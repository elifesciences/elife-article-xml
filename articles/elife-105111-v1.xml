The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated TMEM16 family of membrane proteins plays an important role in collapsing this asymmetric lipid distribution by spontaneously and bidirectionally scrambling phospholipids between the two leaflets, which can initiate signaling and alter the physical properties of the membrane. While evidence shows that lipid scrambling can occur via an open hydrophilic pathway (groove) that spans the membrane, it remains unclear if all family members facilitate lipid movement in this manner. Here, we present a comprehensive computational study of lipid scrambling by all TMEM16 members with experimentally solved structures. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 27 structures from five different family members solved under activating and non-activating conditions, and we captured over 700 scrambling events in aggregate. This enabled us to directly compare scrambling rates, mechanisms, and protein–lipid interactions for fungal and mammalian TMEM16s, in both open (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound) and closed (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free) conformations with statistical rigor. We show that all TMEM16 structures thin the membrane and that the majority of scrambling (&gt;90%) occurs at the groove only when TM4 and TM6 have sufficiently separated. Surprisingly, we also observed 60 scrambling events that occurred outside the canonical groove, over 90% of which took place at the dimer–dimer interface in mammalian TMEM16s. This new site suggests an alternative mechanism for lipid scrambling in the absence of an open groove.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TMEM16</kwd><kwd>coarse-grained simulations</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>scramblases</kwd><kwd>membrane deformation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program 2038436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stephens</surname><given-names>Christina Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM137109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grabe</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discover Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stephens</surname><given-names>Christina Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The majority of TMEM16 lipid scrambling occurs in the open groove associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, but limited scrambling also occurs in the dimer interface independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The TMEM16 family of eukaryotic membrane proteins, also known as anoctamins, is comprised of lipid scramblases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Zanni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stöhr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>), and members that can facilitate both lipid and ion permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Martins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Scudieri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Falzone et al., 2019</xref>).

All structures, except for one of fungal <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> TMEM16 (afTMEM16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>), which is a monomer, are homodimers with a butterfly-like fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Falzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvadia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paulino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arndt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lam and Dutzler, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lam and Dutzler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2023</xref>), and each subunit is comprised of 10 transmembrane (TM) helices with the final helix (TM10) forming most of the dimer interface. Residues on TM6 form half of a highly conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site that accommodates up to two ions. TM6, along with TM3, TM4, and TM5, also forms a membrane spanning groove that contains hydrophilic residues that are shielded from the hydrophobic core of the bilayer in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free states. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> is bound, TM6 takes on a variety of conformational and secondary structural changes across the family, which can have profound effects on the shape of the membrane as seen in cryo-EM nanodiscs with TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is also associated with the movement of the upper portion of TM4 away from TM6 which effectively exposes (opens) the hydrophilic groove to the bilayer, but this opening is not observed for all Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound TMEM16 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvadia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paulino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lam and Dutzler, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lam and Dutzler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>It was first theorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) and later predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stansfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Le et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khelashvili et al., 2022</xref>) that lipids can traverse the membrane bilayer by moving their headgroups along the water-filled hydrophilic groove (between TM4 and TM6) while their tails project into the hydrophobic center of the bilayer. This mechanism for scrambling, first proposed by Menon and Pomorski, is often referred to as the ‘credit card model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>). All-atom MD (AAMD) simulations of open <italic>Nectria haematococca</italic> TMEM16 (nhTMEM16) have shown that lipids near the pore frequently interact with charged residues at the groove entrances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>), two of which are in the scrambling domain which confers scramblase activity to the ion channel-only member TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gyobu et al., 2017</xref>). Frequent headgroup interactions with residues lining the groove were also noted in atomistic simulations of open TMEM16K including two basic residues in the scrambling domain. Lipids experience a relatively low energy barrier for scrambling in open nhTMEM16 (&lt;1 kcal/mol compared to 20–50 kcal/mol directly through the bilayer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>). Simulations also indicate that zwitterionic lipid headgroups stack in the open groove along their dipoles, which may help energetically stabilize them during scrambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kostritskii and Machtens, 2021</xref>). Finally, simulations also show that lipids can directly gate nhTMEM16 groove opening and closing through interactions with their headgroups or tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khelashvili et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Khelashvili et al., 2019</xref>). It is important to note that all of these simulation observations are based on a limited number of spontaneous events from different groups (in aggregate, we estimate that no more than 14 scrambling events have been reported in the absence of an applied voltage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Le et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khelashvili et al., 2022</xref>). Many more scrambling events (~800 in aggregate) have been seen in coarse-grained MD (CGMD) simulations for nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stansfeld et al., 2015</xref>), TMEM16K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>), mutant TMEM16F (F518H), and even TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2024</xref>); however, a detailed analysis of how scrambling occurred in these latter two was not provided. Moreover, a head-to-head comparison of fungal versus mammalian scrambling rates has not been made.</p><p>An outstanding question in the field is whether scrambling requires an open groove. This question has been triggered in part by the failure to determine wild-type (WT) TMEM16F structures with open grooves wide enough to accommodate lipids, despite structures being solved under activating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2023</xref>). Further uncertainty stems from data showing that scrambling can occur in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> when the groove is presumably closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvezzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>). Moreover, afTMEM16 can scramble PEGylated lipids, which are too large for even the open groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvezzi et al., 2018</xref>). This last finding motivated Malvezzi et al. to propose an alternate model of scrambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvezzi et al., 2018</xref>) inspired by the realization that the bilayer adjacent to the protein, whether the groove is open or closed, is distorted in cryo-EM in nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arndt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>), MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khelashvili et al., 2020</xref>), and continuum models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>). The hallmark of this distortion is local bending and thinning adjacent to the groove (estimated to be 50–60% thinner than bulk for some family members) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khelashvili et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arndt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>), and it has been suggested that this deformation, along with packing defects, may significantly lower the energy barrier for lipid crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>). To date, no AAMD or CGMD simulation has reported scrambling by any WT TMEM16 harboring a closed groove; however, a CGMD simulation of the F518H TMEM16F mutant did report scrambling, but the details, such as whether the groove opened, were not provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Again, since a comprehensive analysis across all family members has not been carried out, it is difficult to determine how membrane thinning is related to scrambling or if scrambling mechanisms are specific to certain family members, conformational states of the protein, or both. Additionally, lipids are also directly involved in how TMEM16 scramblases conduct ions. As first speculated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>, AAMD simulations have shown that ions permeate through the lipid headgroup-lined hydrophilic groove of TMEM16K and nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Khelashvili et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kostritskii and Machtens, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jia et al., 2022</xref>). How might this mechanism differ in the absence of an open groove?</p><p>To address these outstanding questions, we employed CGMD simulation to systematically quantify scrambling in 23 experimental and 4 computationally predicted TMEM16 proteins taken from each family member that has been structurally characterized: fungal scramblases nhTMEM16 and afTMEM16, and mammalian scramblase TMEM16K, TMEM16F, and TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). CGMD, which was the first computational method to identify nhTMEM16 as a scramblase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stansfeld et al., 2015</xref>), enables us to reach much longer time scales, while retaining enough chemical detail to faithfully reproduce experimentally verified protein–lipid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Moss et al., 2023</xref>). This allowed us to quantitatively compare the scrambling statistics and mechanisms of different WT and mutant TMEM16s in both open and closed states solved under different conditions (e.g., salt concentrations, lipid and detergent environments, in the presence of modulators or activators like PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Our simulations successfully reproduce experimentally determined membrane deformations seen in nanodiscs across both fungal and mammalian TMEM16s. They also show that only open scramblase structures have grooves fully lined by lipids, and each of these structures promotes scrambling in the groove with lipids experiencing a less than 1 kT free energy barrier as they move between leaflets. Interestingly, one simulation of TMEM16A, which is not a scramblase, initiated from a predicted ion-conductive state scrambled lipids through a lipid-lined groove at a very low rate (only two events), suggesting that ion channel-only members may have residual non-detectable scramblase activity. Our analysis of the membrane deformation and groove conformation shows that most scrambling in the groove occurs when the membrane is thinned to at least 14 Å and the groove is open. We also observe 218 ion permeation events but only in well-hydrated systems with open grooves (98%) and a closed-groove TMEM16A structure (2%). Our simulations also reveal alternative scrambling pathways, which primarily occur at the dimer–dimer interface in mammalian structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lipid densities from coarse-grained simulations match all-atom simulations and cryo-EM nanodiscs</title><p>We simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and -free (apo) structures of TMEM16 proteins in a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer for 10 μs each using the Martini 3 force field. First, we determined how well the simulated membrane distortions matched experiment by comparing the annulus of lipids surrounding each protein to the lipid densities derived from structures solved in nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The shapes of the membrane near the protein qualitatively match the experimental densities and the shapes produced from AAMD simulations and continuum membrane models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the CG simulations capture the sinusoidal curve around both fungal scramblases in apo and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) previously determined by atomistic simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>) of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Even though membrane deformation is a general feature of TMEM16s, the shapes between fungal and mammalian members are noticeably different. Specifically, the membrane is flatter around TMEM16K and TMEM16F compared to the fungal members in both the nanodisc density and CGMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For WT TMEM16s, whether the groove is open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>insets</italic>) or closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), strong lipid density exists near the extracellular groove entrances at TM1 and TM8. Interestingly, this density is lost in the simulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound constitutively active TMEM16F F518H mutant (PDB ID 8B8J), consistent with what is seen in the cryo-EM structure solved in nanodisc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lipid density is present, however, at this location for the simulated open Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound WT TMEM16F (6QP6*, initiated from PDB ID 6QP6) and closed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound WT TMEM16F (PDB ID 6QP6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The loss of density indicates that the normal membrane contact with the protein near the TMEM16F groove has been compromised in the mutant structure. Residues in this site on nhTMEM16 and TMEM16F also seem to play a role in scrambling, but the mechanism by which they do so is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CG simulations of multiple TMEM16 structures capture lipid density in the TM4/TM6 pathway of scrambling-competent members.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshot and POPC headgroup density (right) from atomistic simulations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound nhTMEM16 (PDB ID 4WIS) previously published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>.

These simulation-derived densities crossing the bilayer are strikingly similar to lipids resolved in cryo-EM structures of fungal scramblases in nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>). Individual simulation snapshots provide insight into how lipids traverse this pathway. Open-groove structures typically have an average of 2–3 lipids in the TM4/TM6 groove at any given time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Additional analysis shows that all of the grooves are filled with water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). These profiles share additional features including a clear upward deflection of the membrane as it approaches TM3/TM4 from the left and a downward deflection as it approaches TM6/TM8 from the right; however, the degree of this deflection is not equal, as can be seen for TMEM16K, which is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These distortions are coupled to the sinusoidal curve around the entire protein, which was shown to thin the membrane across the groove and hypothesized to aid in scrambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the open Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound scramblase structures, apo and closed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound TMEM16 structures lack lipid headgroup density spanning the bilayer, and their density profiles are more consistent across the entire family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The membrane is deformed near the groove with some lower leaflet lipid density entering part of the groove and some of the upper leaflet density deflecting inward around TM1, TM6, and TM8 but not entering the closed outer portion of the groove. Again, the membrane around TMEM16F and TMEM16K is flatter than it is in the fungal scramblases. Similarly, simulation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound TMEM16A conformation that conducts Cl<sup>−</sup> in AAMD (7ZK3*<sup>6</sup>, initiated from PDB ID 7ZK3, see Appendix 1—Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) samples partial lipid headgroup penetration into the extracellular vestibule formed by TM3/TM6, but lipids fail to traverse the bilayer as indicated by the lack of density in the center of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This finding is consistent with TMEM16A lacking scramblase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gyobu et al., 2017</xref>); however, we simulated another ion-conductive TMEM16A conformation that can achieve a fully lipid-lined groove during its simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), although this configuration was uncommon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simulations recapitulate scrambling competence of open and closed structures</title><p>To quantify the scrambling competence of each simulated TMEM16 structure, we determined the number of events in which lipids transitioned from one leaflet to the other (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In our simulations, TMEM16F F518H (PDB ID 8B8J) was the only system initiated directly from a solved structure that showed scrambling activity (11.3 ± 1.6 events per μs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Additionally, we performed CGMD on a WT TMEM16F with a single open groove obtained from AAMD initiated from a closed-state structure (cluster 10 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khelashvili et al., 2022</xref>, 6QP6* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed moderate lipid scrambling activity (3.0 ± 1.6 events per μs), most of which happened through the open groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B, C</xref>). Although the rates of scrambling are higher for the mutant than the open WT TMEM16F, there were no noticeable differences in how lipids enter the pathway or how long they take to transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we simulated six structures of mouse TMEM16A, which functions as an ion channel but lacks lipid scrambling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paulino et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, both the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound (PDB ID 5OYB) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free (PDB ID 5OYG) experimental structures failed to induce scrambling in the CGMD simulations, as did one alternative and two ion conduction-competent structures that were obtained from AAMD (see Appendix 1—Methods for details). However, a TMEM16A state with an open hydrophilic groove predicted by Jia and Chen (5OYB*, simulations initiated from PDB ID 5OYB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jia and Chen, 2021</xref>) did scramble a single lipid through each groove in a manner nearly identical to the scramblases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Groove dilation is the main determinant for scrambling activity</title><p>The relative impact of membrane thinning versus TM4/TM6 groove opening on the lipid scrambling rate has long been debated in the TMEM16 field. One of the primary open questions is whether membrane thinning is <italic>sufficient</italic> for scrambling when the groove is closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 2024b</xref>). In our CGMD simulations, 92% of the observed scrambling events occur along TM4 and TM6 with headgroups embedded in the open hydrated groove, in line with the credit card model, which we refer to as ‘in-the-groove’ scrambling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To visualize how groove openness and membrane thinning relate to these events, we plotted the minimum distance between residues on TM4 and TM6 against the minimal thickness near the groove in our average membrane surfaces (see Methods for details) and colored each data point by scrambling rate in the groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Lipid scrambling rates correlate with groove openness and membrane thinning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The minimal membrane thickness at the groove plotted against the median width of the groove measured based on the minimal distance between any two residues on TM4 and TM6 of the groove with the most scrambling events.

bulk membrane thickness (30 Å), regardless of scrambling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). We observed negligible scrambling activity (0–1 events in the groove) in grooves that fail to thin the membrane to less than 14 Å and at the same time do not or very rarely sample TM4-TM6 distances above 6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, upper left quadrant). On the other hand, all active scramblers have a minimal bilayer thickness below 14 Å. Among these structures, we observed the highest scrambling rates in grooves that remain open, with TM4–TM6 distances above 6 Å, throughout most of the simulation (shaded region). To the left of this shaded area, there are two TMEM16F structures (PDB ID 8B8J and 6QP6*) that spent less than half of their simulation time in an open configuration (note large error bars and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and had scrambling rates similar to (PDB ID 8B8J) or less than half of (6QP6*) rates for the open scramblases (PDB IDs 6QM6, 7RXG, and 5OC9). Although these results indicate that scrambling rates are generally higher with thinner membranes and wider grooves, we want to clarify that lipids flowing into the upper and lower vestibules of the dilated grooves heavily contribute to the observed &lt;14 Å membrane thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, we argue that the extremely thin membranes are likely correlated with groove opening, rather than being an independent contributing factor to lipid scrambling. Thus, the major determinant of lipid scrambling by TMEM16s is dilation of the TM4/TM6 groove.</p><p>Upon closer inspection of TMEM16F, we noticed that hydrophobic residues (H/F518, W619, and M522) at the midpoint of the pathway, previously identified as an activation gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Le et al., 2019b</xref>), dynamically swing open to sporadically allow lipids through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3 fig3video5">Figure 3—videos 3 and 5</xref>). Although the distribution of the groove distances is similar for both TMEM16F structures that exhibit scrambling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>), the WT open structure (6QP6*) has half the single subunit scrambling rate. We observed similar fluctuations in both subunits of the open asymmetric TMEM16K (PDB ID 5OC9) which transiently constrict the lipid pathway at Y366/I370/T435/L436 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2 fig3video6">Figure 3—videos 2 and 6</xref>). Again, we observed that the subunit with more scrambling activity (eight times more) spent more time in an open-groove configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Time traces of the TM4–TM6 distances emphasize the two-state, discrete nature of the TMEM16K groove as it opens and closes, the consistently open nature of nhTMEM16 with small fluctuations, and then the frequent fluctuations of the TMEM16F F518H mutant, which has a running average that constantly flickers from 4 Å to the 7–8 Å range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Qualitatively, scrambling occurs more frequently when the groove is open for TMEM16K and F (black dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), while the consistently open Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound nhTMEM16 structure (PDB ID 4WIS) allows lipid headgroups to scramble in an uninterrupted fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>).</p><p>Although all structures of TMEM16A, which is not a scramblase, have negligible scrambling in the groove, we did observe two events for a predicted ion-conductive state (5OYB*) which samples an average TM4–TM6 distance very close, but just below, to the empirically determined 6 Å threshold for scrambling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed lipid headgroups throughout the pathway, but just as for the TMEM16F and K structures, the flow of lipid is obstructed by residues at the center of the groove (I550, I551, and K645), and in TMEM16A they more rarely separate to allow lipids to pass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Lipids are also notably more stagnant in the pore than in the open TMEM16Fs and appear to be stabilized by electrostatic interactions with two charged residues, E633 and K645 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>).</p><p>Despite these individual differences in groove dynamics, scrambling occurs in an identical manner across the family. Scrambling lipids move through the TM4/TM6 groove quickly, with dwell times for individual lipids below 20 ns. However, we observed longer dwell times for TMEM16K and TMEM16F at the groove constriction points, whereas in other scramblases, the dwell times are more evenly distributed along the groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). Among the scramblases, the free energy profile for lipids moving through the open groove is barrierless (&lt;1 kT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3A</xref>) with similar kinetics among the homologs and a mean diffusion coefficient between 10 and 16 Å<sup>2</sup>/ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Scrambling events also enter and leave the groove at random locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>) with only 3–10% of events passing through the high-density lipid regions on lower TM4 and upper TM6/TM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We previously identified four residues (E313, R432, K353, and E352) at the intracellular and extracellular entrances of the nhTMEM16 groove that we hypothesized help organize or stabilize scrambling lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). However, our CGMD of the same nhTMEM16 structure shows that although these residues have elevated contact frequencies, more than half of the contacts are made with bulk lipids that never scramble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Lastly, the in-the-groove scrambling events were Poisson distributed for all open and transiently open scramblases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>), indicating lipids do not scramble in a regular or kinetically coordinated fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Water and ion content in the groove</title><p>To quantify how hydration of the groove or pore relates to scrambling, we measured the number of water permeation events along the pathway of maximum water density at the grooves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>; all values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>; see Appendix 1—Methods for details). As expected, permeation through the closed scramblase structures was low, &lt;30 events per μs on average, while dilated TM4/TM6 grooves (five out of six Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound) support 300–550 permeation events per μs on average. Nonetheless, even when the groove is inaccessible to lipids in closed and intermediate states, including the TMEM16A ion channel path, it remains hydrated with the waters shielded from the hydrophobic core of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>, <italic>closed</italic>).

Although this small number of AAMD-derived scrambling events yielded key insights into specific protein–lipid interactions and scrambling pathways, they cannot provide rigorous statistics on scrambling rates, nor can they be leveraged to perform a large high-throughput comparison between the various family members. To circumvent sampling issues, we used CGMD to systematically quantify lipid scrambling by five TMEM16 family members and relate their scrambling competence to their structural characteristics and ability to distort the membrane. Our simulations correctly differentiate between open and closed conformations across the five family members, consistent with a recent study that showed good qualitative agreement between in vitro and in silico lipid scrambling using the same Martini 3 force field on a diverse set of proteins, including some TMEM16s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tsuji et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to lipid scrambling ability, our results are in accord with the general finding that TMEM16s show very little to no ion selectivity, although permeability ratios vary depending on ion concentrations and lipid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kostritskii and Machtens, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stabilini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). Because the simulation conditions and system setups were identical in all our simulations, we are in a unique position to directly compare a host of biophysical properties between different TMEM16 family members and their structures to answer ongoing questions in the field.</p><p>In our simulations, <italic>all</italic> TMEM16 structures thin the membrane by at least 7 Å, while some pinch the membrane by as much as 18 Å resulting in leaflet-to-leaflet distances at the groove of just 12 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>) and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Khelashvili et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arndt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref> have hypothesized that thinning lowers the physical and energetic barrier for lipid scrambling, but what is surprising is that even non-scrambling, closed-groove structures elicit such large membrane distortions. For instance, several of the closed-groove TMEM16F structures and the ion channel TMEM16A (7ZK3<sup>*8</sup>) compress the membrane 13–14 Å. Despite this large deformation, these conformations do not induce scrambling. On the other hand, structures with dilated grooves exhibit robust scrambling and thin the membrane another 3–4 Å, resulting in the most distorted bilayers. However, because this extreme membrane thinning is coupled to lipid entry into the upper and lower vestibules upon groove opening, it is difficult to determine how much the membrane thinning alone contributes to the resulting scramblase activity. Thus, we conclude that groove dilation is the ultimate trigger for rapid lipid scrambling, and the importance of membrane thinning to modulating scrambling rates has yet to be determined.</p><p>Of the scrambling-competent TMEM16 structures, the open-groove nhTMEM16 (PDB ID 4WIS) is the fastest scrambler, with a rate twice as high as the other homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A, B</xref>). Yet on average, its groove width and membrane thinning are similar (within 1–2 Å) to the other robust scramblers nhTMEM16 (PDB ID 6QM6), afTMEM16 (PDB ID 7RXG), and TMEM16K (PDB ID 5OC9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that there are other features that impact the rates, for example, the shape of the membrane distortion, groove dynamics, and residues lining the groove. Another feature we have not explored is mixed membranes and membranes of shorter or longer chain length, which we expect would alter lipid scrambling rates. For example, TMEM16K resides in the ER membrane which is thinner than the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Petkovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruininks et al., 2019</xref>), and TMEM16K scrambling rates increase 10-fold in thinner membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Experimental scrambling assays performed by different groups have reported basal level scramblase activity in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for fungal and mammalian dual-function scramblases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvezzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>). It is unknown where closed-groove scrambling takes place on the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>) and simulations have never reported such events despite Li and co-workers reporting scrambling events for simulations initiated from closed TMEM16A, TMEM16K, and TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tsuji et al., 2019</xref>), which may have also been sampled in these trajectories. In aggregate, we observed 60 scrambling events that do not follow the credit card model and occur ‘out-of-the-groove’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Nearly all these events (56/60) happen at the dimer interface between TM3 and TM10 of the opposite subunit, hereon referred to as the dimer cleft. Curiously, we do not observe scrambling at this location for any of the fungal structures. Although mammalian TMEM16s have a ~4–5 Å wider gap on average at the lower leaflet dimer cleft entrance than the open fungal TMEM16s, we do not always observe scrambling at such distances and sometimes do not observe any scrambling when the cleft is at its widest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). For all structures, we see lipids from both leaflets intercalate between TM3 and TM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>), which is consistent with lipid densities in cryo-EM nanodiscs images of fungal TMEM16s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>) and TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2019</xref>). Based on our simulations, this interface may be a source for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent scrambling.</p><p>It is unclear whether the out-of-the-groove events we have observed reflect the same closed-groove scrambling activity seen in experimental assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvezzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falzone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>). Also, it is possible that we have missed slow or rare out-of-the-groove events due to limited sampling. One way to assess these points is to ask whether the relative scrambling rates observed in ±Ca<sup>2+</sup> are similar to the relative rates from our simulation with open/closed hydrophilic grooves. Feng et al. reported a 7- to 18-fold increase in scrambling rate by nhTMEM16 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2024a</xref>). Based on our open-groove count of 220, we would expect 12–30 events for the closed-groove states, but we observed no events. However, Watanabe et al. reported a six- to seven-fold increase in scrambling rate by TMEM16F in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>), which is consistent with the seven- to nine-fold increase revealed in our simulations between closed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free TMEM16F structures (PBD IDs 6P47 and 6QPB) and the WT open Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound TMEM16F (6QP6*). It is possible that out-of-the-groove scrambling is highly dependent on the membrane composition, as discussed earlier, and the scrambling ratios we observe in DOPC may be different from the experimental rates determined in different lipids. This cannot be addressed without additional studies. That said, we are encouraged by the high-level correspondence in TMEM16F – we observe much higher scrambling rates through the open grooves and much smaller flipping rates elsewhere on the protein or with closed-groove structures, suggesting that our simulations may be revealing aspects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent scrambling in mammalian family members.</p><p>With regard to predicting absolute rates, our simulations correctly distinguish scrambling-competent structures from non-competent scramblers, but direct comparison of our rates with experimental values (that tend to be 2–3 orders of magnitude slower) should be interpreted qualitatively. For example, single-molecule analysis yielded a scrambling rate of 0.04 events per μs for TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>), whereas we find 3 and 11.3 events per μs for our scrambling-competent TMEM16F structures 6QP6* and PDB ID 8B8J, respectively. Malvezzi et al. estimated a similar scrambling rate of 0.02 events per μs for afTMEM16 using a liposome-based assay, while we find 10.7 events per μs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvezzi et al., 2018</xref>). We will highlight three potential explanations for such discrepancy. First, it is well established that the Martini model increases diffusion dynamics by a factor ~4 due to the lower friction between CG beads and reduced configurational entropy compared to more chemically detailed representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruininks et al., 2019</xref>). Second, the energy barrier for a PC headgroup to traverse the DOPC bilayer in the absence of protein is reduced in Martini 3 compared to Martini 2 and AAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartoš et al., 2024</xref>). It is not trivial to predict how this reduction affects protein-mediated lipid scrambling, but it is likely to increase observed flipping rates compared to the more realistic AAMD. Third, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the Martini 3 elastic network used to restrain the protein backbone in our simulations allows a small degree of flexibility during simulations, which may increase scrambling. For instance, the groove of the open nhTMEM16 structure 4WIS enlarges by ~3 Å during our Martini 3 simulations compared to the starting experimental structure and our Martini 2 simulations, and this dilation correlates with greater scrambling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8A, B</xref>). We also analyzed previously published CHARMM36 AAMD trajectories starting from the same structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>) and observed that while these simulations do show some degree of dilation, as we observe with Martini 3, they generally stay closer to the experimental structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8B</xref>). In addition to the open nhTMEM16 structure, we observed similar subtle movements in the TM4 helix for open Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound structures of afTMEM16, TMEM16K, TMEM16F, and TMEM16A that appear to enlarge the TM4/TM6 outer vestibule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Others have reported that AAMD simulations sample spontaneous dilation of the groove/pore to confer either scramblase activity for WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Le et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khelashvili et al., 2022</xref>) and mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jia et al., 2022</xref>) TMEM16F or ion channel activity for TMEM16A structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Le et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tembo et al., 2019</xref>). These movements away from the experimentally solved structures may be due to the inaccuracy of our atomistic and CG force fields or differences in the model and experimental membrane/detergent environments, but more work is needed to assess whether these dilations reflect physiologically relevant conformational states. CG simulations of closed-groove structures lack such dilations, because the backbones of TM4 and TM6 are in close enough proximity (&lt;10 Å) to be connected by the elastic network that the Martini model requires to maintain proper secondary and tertiary structure (e.g., PDB ID 6QM4, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8C, D</xref>). The recent GōMartini 3 model replaces the harmonic bonds of the elastic network with Lennard–Jones potentials that vanish as residues separate, potentially making this an excellent model for sampling groove opening and closing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Souza et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we end by discussing the observed in- and out-of-the-groove scrambling for the putative ion-conducting states of TMEM16A. The low number of recorded events (11 for the highest and 1 for the lowest) may be consistent with the lack of experimentally measured scramblase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gyobu et al., 2017</xref>), for the reasons discussed in the last paragraph. Consistent with our low computational rate, we also computed an energy barrier for lipid movement through the TMEM16A groove 5.5-fold higher than the scramblase barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3B</xref>). In simulations of our three predicted ion-conductive states of TMEM16A (7ZK3*<sup>6,8,10</sup>) lipid headgroups insert into the lower and upper vestibule of the pore. Compared to the inhibitor-bound structure (PDB ID 7ZK3), the outer vestibule of these conductive states is notably more dilated. We observe four Cl<sup>−</sup> permeation events by 7ZK3*<sup>8</sup> through the partially lipid-lined groove. Surprisingly, our simulation of the predicted TMEM16A conductive state from Jia and Chen did at times feature a fully lipid-lined groove, similar to the proteolipidic pore found in dual-function members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jia and Chen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>); however, we did not observe any ion permeation events from this configuration, which may be a consequence of the configuration not being physiologically relevant, the Martini 3 force field not being ideal for Cl<sup>−</sup>/lipid/protein interactions, or something else. It is intriguing that while TMEM16A has lost experimentally discernible scrambling activity, it still deforms and thins the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Coupled with our observation that groove widening allows lipids to enter, we wonder if it retains thinning capabilities to facilitate partial lipid insertion to promote Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation. This hypothesis has been stated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2016</xref>), and structural evidence for this proteolipidic ion channel pore has recently been reported for the OSCA1.2 mechanosensitive ion channel, which adopts the TMEM16 fold, yet it does not scramble lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lowry et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Coarse-grained system preparation and simulation details</title><p>For each simulated structure, missing loops with less than 16 residues were modeled using the loop building and refinement procedures MODELLER (version 10.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>).

CG Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (bead type ‘SD’ in Martini 3) were inserted at their respective positions based on the original protein structure and connected to coordinating (≤6 Å) Asp and/or Glu side chains by a harmonic bond with a 100 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup> force constant.

We further narrowed our final set of structures by selecting the higher resolution of structures sharing similar backbone conformations and have the same number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). One structure from TMEM16A (PDB ID 8QZC) and TMEM16F (PDB ID 6P46) were excluded because they share a similar conformation to other structures of the same homolog but differ in the number of bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions at the orthosteric site and by a slight elevation of the TM6 C-terminus. In total, we selected 5 nhTMEM16, 2 afTMEM16, 2 TMEM16K, and 11 TMEM16F dimers. We also included 2 cryo-EM structures of TMEM16A. We also chose to simulate a computationally predicted scrambling competent TMEM16F structure based on PDB ID 6QP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khelashvili et al., 2022</xref>) which has a dilated groove similar to nhTMEM16, afTMEM16, and TMEM16K.

The missing residues 260-266, 467-482, 526-527, 669-682 were built and refined using MODELLER (version 10.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>), see more details above. Simulations were performed with GROMACS version 2020.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>) and the CHARMM36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang and MacKerell, 2013</xref>) and CHARMM36m (c36m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) force fields for lipids and protein, respectively. PROPKA3 was used to check the protonation state of protein residues. E624 and D405 are both weakly protonatable at neutral pH, but likely well solvated and therefore left in their negatively charged states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Olsson et al., 2011</xref>). The protein was embedded in a 155x155 Å<sup>2</sup> POPC bilayer and solvated in 150 mM KCl and the CHARMM TIP3P water model using CHARMM-GUI’s Membrane Builder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jo et al., 2009</xref>). System charges were neutralized using the same ions. During minimization, equilibration, and production distance restraints with 418.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-2</sup> force constants were applied between the Ca atoms of residues 465 and 489, 454 and 566, 169 and 278, 126 and 176, 196 and 189, 123 and 282, 185 and 200 to stabilize the cytosolic domain. Simulations were run using a 2 fs time step in an NPT ensemble. Temperature was kept at 303.15 K using the Nosé-Hoover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evans and Holian, 1985</xref>) thermostat (τ<sub>T</sub> = 1 ps). The pressure of the system was semi-isotropically coupled to a 1 bar reference pressure by the Berendsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>) and parrinello-rahman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) barostat (τ<sub>P</sub> = 5 ps, compressibility = 4.5x10<sup>-5</sup>) for equilibration and production respectively. All bonds to H were constrained by the LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hess et al., 1997</xref>). Particle mesh Ewald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darden et al., 1993</xref>)-calculated electrostatic and Van der Waals (VdW) interactions were cut off at 1.2 nm. A Verlet cut-off scheme was used for non-bonded interactions. VdW interactions were smoothly switched to zero between 1.0 and 1.2 nm. The protein with its bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, the membrane, and solvent bath were treated as separate groups for the thermostat coupling and center of mass removal. Harmonic restraints of the protein backbone, sidechains, lipids and dihedrals were applied and slowly reduced over 8 equilibration steps totaling ~32 ns. The equilibrated box size was ~143x143x148 Å<sup>3</sup>. An identical simulation protocol was used for our atomistic simulations of TMEM16F (6QP6) but used Gromacs version 2018.7.

We then saved the centroid of this final set of grid cells and repeated the search using this centroid, or node, as the starting position. This process was continued until either the path length (sum of distances between subsequent nodes) reached 80 Å for lipids (30 Å for water), no new nodes were found, or the next selected node caused the path to deviate sharply (&lt;90°). We only included cells with densities ≥0.0005 for lipids or ≥0.002 for water for this calculation. Path nodes were then interpolated using a B-spline representation in Scipy methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>) and final nodes were selected from this path to given 0.5 Å gaps between nodes for the lipid paths and 4.7 Å for water.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2-2"><title>Water and ion permeation analysis</title><p>For each simulation the positions of water and ion CG beads within a 9.4 Å search radius of the water maximum density pathway were tracked overtime using a custom script that includes MDAnalysis methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Michaud Agrawal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gowers et al., 2016</xref>). Water beads were assigned to path nodes if they fell within the bounds of a cylindrical disc (4.7 Å height, 9.4 Å diameter) centered on the bead with its face normal defined by the vector between the current and subsequent node. Permeation events were counted if a water or ion left the search radius into the bath opposite to the one from which it entered the path. The maximum density path was mirrored symmetrically on both subunits and each pathway was tracked independently.

They particularly focus on the scramblase ability of these proteins and aim to characterize the &quot;energetics of scrambling&quot;. Through their simulations, the authors interestingly relate protein conformational states to membrane's thickness and link those to the scrambling ability of TMEM members, measured as the trespassing tendency of lipids across leaflets. They validate their simulation with a direct qualitative comparison with Cryo-EM maps.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study demonstrates an efficient use of CGMD simulations to explore lipid scrambling across various TMEM16 family members. By leveraging this approach, the authors are able to bypass some of the sampling limitations inherent in all-atom simulations, providing a more comprehensive and high-throughput analysis of lipid scrambling. Their comparison of different protein conformations, including open and closed groove states, presents a detailed exploration of how structural features influence scrambling activity, adding significant value to the field. A key contribution of this study is the finding that groove dilation plays a central role in lipid scrambling. The authors observe that for scrambling-competent TMEM16 structures, there is substantial membrane thinning and groove widening. The open Ca2+-bound nhTMEM16 structure (PDB ID 4WIS) was identified as the fastest scrambler in their simulations, with scrambling rates as high as 24.4 {plus minus} 5.2 events per μs. This structure also shows significant membrane thinning (up to 18 Å), which supports the hypothesis that groove dilation lowers the energetic barrier for lipid translocation, facilitating scrambling.</p><p>The study also establishes a correlation between structural features and scrambling competence, though analyses often lack statistical robustness and quantitative comparisons. The simulations differentiate between open and closed conformations of TMEM16 structures, with open-groove structures exhibiting increased scrambling activity, while closed-groove structures do not. This finding aligns with previous research suggesting that the structural dynamics of the groove are critical for scrambling. Furthermore, the authors explore how the physical dimensions of the groove qualitatively correlate with observed scrambling rates. For example, TMEM16K induces increased membrane thinning in its open form, suggesting that membrane properties, along with structural features, play a role in modulating scrambling activity.</p><p>Another significant finding is the concept of &quot;out-of-the-groove&quot; scrambling, where lipid translocation occurs outside the protein's groove. This observation introduces the possibility of alternate scrambling mechanisms that do not follow the traditional &quot;credit-card model&quot; of groove-mediated lipid scrambling. In their simulations, the authors note that these out-of-the-groove events predominantly occur at the dimer interface between TM3 and TM10, especially in mammalian TMEM16 structures. While these events were not observed in fungal TMEM16s, they may provide insight into Ca2+-independent scrambling mechanisms, as they do not require groove opening.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A significant challenge of the study is the discrepancy between the scrambling rates observed in CGMD simulations and those reported experimentally. Despite the authors' claim that the rates are in line experimentally, the observed differences can mean large energetic discrepancies in describing scrambling (larger than 1kT barrier in reality). For instance, the authors report scrambling rates of 10.7 events per μs for TMEM16F and 24.4 events per μs for nhTMEM16, which are several orders of magnitude faster than experimental rates. While the authors suggest that this discrepancy could be due to the Martini 3 force field's faster diffusion dynamics, this explanation does not fully account for the large difference in rates. A more thorough discussion on how the choice of force field and simulation parameters influence the results, and how these discrepancies can be reconciled with experimental data, would strengthen the conclusions. Likewise, rate calculations in the study are based on 10 μs simulations, while experimental scrambling rates occur over seconds. This timescale discrepancy limits the study's accuracy, as the simulations may not capture rare or slow scrambling events that are observed experimentally and therefore might underestimate the kinetics of scrambling. It's however, important to recognize that it's hard (borderline unachievable) to pinpoint reasonable kinetics for systems like this using the currently available computational power and force field accuracy. The faster diffusion in simulations may lead to overestimated scrambling rates, making the simulation results less comparable to real-world observations. Thus, I would therefore read the findings qualitatively rather than quantitatively. An interesting observation is the asymmetry observed in the scrambling rates of the two monomers. Since MARTINI is known to be limited in correctly sampling protein dynamics, the authors, in order to preserve the fold, have applied a strong (500 kJ mol-1 nm-2) elastic network. However, I am wondering how the ENM applies across the dimer and if any asymmetry can be noticed in the application of restraints for each monomer and at the dimer interface. How can this have potentially biased the asymmetry in the scrambling rates observed between the monomers? Is this artificially obtained from restraining the initial structure, or is the asymmetry somehow gatekeeping the scrambling mechanism to occur majorly across a single monomer? Answering this question would have far-reaching implications to better describe the mechanism of scrambling.</p><p>Notably, the manuscript does not explore the impact of membrane composition on scrambling rates. While the authors use a specific lipid composition (DOPC) in their simulations, they acknowledge that membrane composition can influence scrambling activity. However, the study does not explore how different lipids or membrane environments or varying membrane curvature and tension, could alter scrambling behaviour. I appreciate that this might have been beyond the scope of this particular paper and the authors plan to further chase these questions, as this work sets a strong protocol for this study. Contextualizing scrambling in the context of membrane composition is particularly relevant since the authors note that TMEM16K's scrambling rate increases tenfold in thinner membranes, suggesting that lipid-specific or membrane-thickness-dependent effects could play a role.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I have carefully reviewed the replies of the author, which address the points I raised and improved the manuscript by making the changes outlined in their response. Particularly, I am pleased to see that the authors report ensemble averages in Figure 1-supplement 1 and add relevant information in a newly created table. I welcome the refinement of the discussion towards a cautionary approach in describing quantitatively the findings of experiments and computations for what concerns scrambling rates. I still feel that proper statistical analysis to compare the distributions in Figure 3-figure supplement 6 would have made the points claimed even stronger, but - at the same time - I do see the points of the authors in commenting the differences between these distributions more qualitatively. Overall, I support the publication of this manuscript, it has been a pleasure to read it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105111.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper investigates the TMEM16 family of membrane proteins, which play roles in lipid scrambling and ion transport. A total of 27 experimental structures from five TMEM16 family members were analyzed, including mammalian and fungal homologs (e.g., TMEM16A, TMEM16F, TMEM16K, nhTMEM16, afTMEM16). The identified structures were in both Ca²⁺-bound (open) and Ca²⁺-free (closed) states to compare conformations and were preprocessed (e.g., modeling missing loops) and equilibrated. Coarse-grain simulations were performed in DOPC membranes for 10 microseconds to capture the scrambling events. These events were identified by tracking lipids transitioning between the two membrane leaflets and they analysed correlation between scrambling rates, in addition, structural properties such as groove dilation and membrane thinning were calculated. They report 700 scrambling events across structures and the figure 2 elaborates on how open structures show higher activity, also as expected. The authors also address how structures may require open groove, this and other mechanisms around scrambling is a bit controversial in the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of this study emerges from comparative analysis of multiple structural starting points and understand global/local motions of the protein with respect to lipid movement.

While the study presents a statistically rigorous analysis of lipid scrambling events across multiple structures and conformations, several critical issues undermine its novelty, impact, and alignment with experimental observations.</p><p>Critical issues:</p><p>(1) Lack of Novelty:</p><p>The phenomenon of lipid scrambling via an open hydrophilic groove is already well-established in the literature, including through atomistic MD simulations. The authors themselves acknowledge this fact in their introduction and discussion. By employing coarse-grained simulations, the study essentially reiterates previously known findings with limited additional mechanistic insight. The repeated observation of scrambling occurring predominantly via the groove does not offer significant advancement beyond prior work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s statement regarding the lack of novelty when it comes to our observations of scrambling in the groove of open Ca2+-bound TMEM16 structures. However, we feel that the inclusion of closed structures in this study, which attempts to address the yet unanswered question of how scrambling by TMEM16s occurs in the absence of Ca2+, offers new observations for the field. In our study we specifically address to what extent the induced membrane deformation, which has been theorized to aid lipids cross the bilayer especially in the absence of Ca2+, contributes to the rate of scrambling (see references 36, 59, and 66). There are also several TMEM16F structures solved under activating conditions (bound to Ca2+ and in the presence of PIP2) which feature structural rearrangements to TM6 that may be indicative of an open state (PDB 6P48) and had not been tested in simulations. We show that these structures do not scramble and thereby present evidence against an out-of-the-groove scrambling mechanism for these states. Although we find a handful of examples of lipids being scrambled by Ca2+-free structures of TMEM16 scramblases, none of our simulations suggest that these events are related to the degree of deformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Redundancy Across Systems:</p><p>The manuscript explores multiple TMEM16 family members in activating and non-activating conformations, but the conclusions remain largely confirmatory. The extensive dataset generated through coarse-grained MD simulations primarily reinforces established mechanistic models rather than uncovering fundamentally new insights. The effort, while statistically robust, feels excessive given the incremental nature of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we agree with the reviewer’s statement that our results largely confirm those published by other groups and our own. We think there is however value in comparing the scrambling competence of these TMEM16 structures in a consistent manner in a single study to reduce inconsistencies that may be introduced by different simulation methods, parameters, environmental variables such as lipid composition as used in other published works of single family members. The consistency across our simulations and high number of observed scrambling events have allowed us to confirm that the mechanism of scrambling is shared by multiple family members and relies most obviously on groove dilation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Discrepancy with Experimental Observations:</p><p>The use of coarse-grained simulations introduces inherent limitations in accurately representing lipid scrambling dynamics at the atomistic level. Experimental studies have highlighted nuances in lipid permeation that are not fully captured by coarse-grained models. This discrepancy raises questions about the biological relevance of the reported scrambling events, especially those occurring outside the canonical groove.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up the possible inaccuracies introduced by coarse graining our simulations. This is also a concern for us, and we address this issue extensively in our discussion. As the reviewer pointed out above, our CG simulations have largely confirmed existing evidence in the field which we think speaks well to the transferability of observations from atomistic simulations to the coarse-grained level of detail. We have made both qualitative and quantitative comparisons between atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of nhTMEM16 and TMEM16F (Figure 1, Figure 4-figure supplement 1, Figure 4-figure supplement 5) showing the two methods give similar answers for where lipids interact with the protein, including outside of the canonical groove. We do not dispute the possible discrepancy between our simulations and experiment, but our goal is to share new nuanced ideas for the predicted TMEM16 scrambling mechanism that we hope will be tested by future experimental studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Alternative Scrambling Sites:</p><p>The manuscript reports scrambling events at the dimer-dimer interface as a novel mechanism. While this observation is intriguing, it is not explored in sufficient detail to establish its functional significance. Furthermore, the low frequency of these events (relative to groove-mediated scrambling) suggests they may be artifacts of the simulation model rather than biologically meaningful pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our observed number of scrambling events in the dimer interface is too low to present it as strong evidence for it being the alternative mechanism for Ca2+-independent scrambling. This will require additional experiments and computational studies which we plan to do in future research. However, we are less certain that these are artifacts of the coarse-grained simulation system as we observed a similar event in an atomistic simulation of TMEM16F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Overall, while the study is technically sound and presents a large dataset of lipid scrambling events across multiple TMEM16 structures, it falls short in terms of novelty and mechanistic advancement. The findings are largely confirmatory and do not bridge the gap between coarse-grained simulations and experimental observations. Future efforts should focus on resolving these limitations, possibly through atomistic simulations or experimental validation of the alternative scrambling pathways.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Stephens et al. present a comprehensive study of TMEM16-members via coarse-grained MD simulations (CGMD).

Answering this question would have far-reaching implications to better describe the mechanism of scrambling.</p></disp-quote><p>The main aim of our computational survey was to directly compare all relevant published TMEM16 structures in both open and closed states using the Martini 3 CGMD force field. Our standardized simulation and analysis protocol allowed us to quantitatively compare scrambling rates across the TMEM16 family, something that has never been done before. We do acknowledge that direct comparison between simulated versus experimental scrambling rates is complicated and is best to be interpreted qualitatively. In line with other reports (e.g., Li et al, PNAS 2024), lipid scrambling in CGMD is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than typical experimental findings. In the CG simulation field, these increased dynamics due to the smoother energy landscape are a well known phenomenon. In our view, this is a valuable trade-off for being able to capture statistically robust scrambling dynamics and gain mechanistic understanding in the first place, since these are currently challenging to obtain otherwise. For example, with all-atom MD it would have been near-impossible to conclude that groove openness and high scrambling rates are closely related, simply because one would only measure a handful of scrambling events in (at most) a handful of structures.</p><p>Considering the elastic network: the reviewer is correct in that the elastic network restrains the overall structure to the experimental conformation. This is necessary because the Martini 3 force field does not accurately model changes in secondary (and tertiary) structure. In fact, by retaining the structural information from the experimental structures, we argue that the elastic network helped us arrive at the conclusion that groove openness is the major contributing factor in determining a protein’s scrambling rate. This is best exemplified by the asymmetric X-ray structure of TMEM16K (5OC9), in which the groove of one subunit is more dilated than the other. In our simulation, this information was stored in the elastic network, yielding a 4x higher rate in the open groove than in the closed groove, within the same trajectory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Notably, the manuscript does not explore the impact of membrane composition on scrambling rates. While the authors use a specific lipid composition (DOPC) in their simulations, they acknowledge that membrane composition can influence scrambling activity. However, the study does not explore how different lipids or membrane environments or varying membrane curvature and tension, could alter scrambling behaviour. I appreciate that this might have been beyond the scope of this particular paper and the authors plan to further chase these questions, as this work sets a strong protocol for this study. Contextualizing scrambling in the context of membrane composition is particularly relevant since the authors note that TMEM16K's scrambling rate increases tenfold in thinner membranes, suggesting that lipid-specific or membrane-thickness-dependent effects could play a role.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering different membrane compositions: for this study, we chose to keep the membranes as simple as possible. We opted for pure DOPC membranes, because it has (1) negligible intrinsic curvature, (2) forms fluid membranes, and (3) was used previously by others (Li et al, PNAS 2024). As mentioned by the reviewer, we believe our current study defines a good, standardized protocol and solid baseline for future efforts looking into the additional effects of membrane composition, tension, and curvature that could all affect TMEM16-mediated lipid scrambling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of this study emerges from a comparative analysis of multiple structural starting points and understanding global/local motions of the protein with respect to lipid movement.

The advantage of simulations is to directly observe the transient scrambling events at a spatial and temporal resolution that is currently unattainable for experiments. The current experimental evidence for the precise mechanism of Ca2+-independent scrambling is still under debate. We therefore hope to leverage the strength of MD and statistical rigor of coarse-grained simulations to generate testable hypotheses for further structural, biochemical, and computational studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The findings are largely confirmatory and do not bridge the gap between coarse-grained simulations and experimental observations.

We have provided something that has yet to be done in the field: a comprehensive study that directly compares the scrambling rates of multiple TMEM16 family members in different conformations using identical simulation conditions. Our work clearly shows that a sufficiently dilated grooves is the major structural feature that enables robust scrambling for all TMEM16 scramblases members with solved structures. While all TMEM16s cause significant distortion and thinning of the membrane, we assert that the extreme thinning observed around open grooves is significantly enhanced by the lipid scrambling itself as the two leaflets merge through lipid exchange. We saw no evidence that membrane thinning/distortion alone, in the absence of an open groove, could support scrambling at the rates observed under activating conditions or even the low rates observed in Ca2+-independent scrambling. Moreover, our handful of observations of scrambling events outside of the groove, which has not yet been reported in any study, opens an exciting new direction for studying alternative scrambling mechanisms. That said, we are currently following up on many of the observations reported here such as: scrambling events outside the groove, the kinetics of scrambling, the possibility that lipids line the groove of non-scramblers like TMEM16A, etc. This is being done experimentally with our collaborators through site directed mutagenesis and with all-atom MD in our lab. Unfortunately, it is well beyond the scope of the current study to include all of this in the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments and questions:</p><p>(1) Line 214 and Figure 1- Figure Supplement 1: why have you only compared the final frame of the trajectory to the cryo-EM structure? Even if these comparisons are qualitative, they should be representative of the entire trajectory, not a single frame.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and replaced the single-frame snapshots in Figure 1-figure supplement 1 for ensemble-averaged head groups densities. The overall agreement between membrane shapes in CGMD and cryo-EM was not affected by this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 228-231: You comment 'Residues in this site on nhTMEM16 and TMEMF also seem to play a role in scrambling but the mechanism by which they do so is unclear.' This is something you could attempt to quantify in the simulations by calculating the correlation between scrambling and protein-membrane interactions/contacts in this site. Can you speculate on a mechanism that might be a contributing factor?</p></disp-quote><p>We probed the correlation between these residues and scrambling lipids, as suggested by the reviewer, and interestingly not all scrambling lipids interact with these residues. Yet there is strong lipid density in this vicinity (see insets in Figure 1 and Figure 4-figure supplement 2). These observations lead us to suspect these residues impact scrambling indirectly through influencing the conformation of the protein or flexibility and shape of the membrane. This interpretation fits with mutagenesis studies highlighting a role for these residues in scrambling (see refs 59, 62, and 67). Specifically, Falzone et al. 2022 (ref 59) suggested that they may thin the membrane near the groove, but this has not been tested via structure determination and a detailed model of how they impact scrambling is missing. We could address this question with in silico mutations; however, CG simulation is not an appropriate method to study large scale protein dynamics, and AA simulations are likely best, but beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 240-245 and Figure 1B: This section discusses the coupling between membrane distortions and the sinusoidal curve around the protein, however, Figure 1B only shows snapshots of the membrane distortions. Is it possible to understand how these two collective variables are correlated quantitatively (as opposed to the current qualitative analysis)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that it may be possible to quantitatively capture these two key features of the membrane, as we did previously with nhTMEM16 using our continuum elasticity-based model of the membrane (Bethel and Grabe 2016). Our model agreed with all atom MD surfaces to within ~1 Å, hence showing good quantitative agreement throughout the entire membrane. However, we doubt that we could distill the essence of our model down to a simple functional relationship between the sinusoidal wave and pinching, which we think the reviewer is asking. Rather, we believe that the large-scale sinusoidal distortion (collective variable 1) and pinching/distortion (collective variable 2) near the groove arise from the interplay of the specific protein surface chemistry for each protein (patterning of polar and non-polar residues) and the membrane. This is why we chose to simply report the distinct patterns that the family members impose on the surrounding membrane, which we think is fascinating. Specifically, Fig. 1B shows that different TMEM16 family members distort the membrane in different ways. Most notably, fungal TMEM16s feature a more pronounced sinusoidal deformation, whereas the mammalian members primarily produce local pinching. Then, in Fig. 3A we show that the thinning at the groove happens in all structures and is more pronounced in open, scrambling-competent conformations. In other words, proteins can show very strong thinning (e.g. TMEM16K, 5OC9) even though the membrane generally remains flat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Lines 257-258: Authors comment that TMEM16A lacks scramblase activity yet can achieve a fully lipid-lined groove (note the typo - should be lipid-lined, not lipid-line). Is a fully lipid-lined groove a prerequisite for scramblase activity? Are lipid-lined grooves the only requirement for scramblase activity? Could the authors clarify exactly what the prerequisite for scramblase activity is to avoid any confusion; this will be useful for later descriptions (i.e. line 295) where scrambling competence is again referred to. Additionally, the associated figure panel (Figure 1D) shows a snapshot of this finding but lacks any statistical quantifications - is a fully lipid-lined groove a single event? Perhaps the additional analyses, such as the groove-lipid contacts, may be useful here.</p></disp-quote><p>The definition of lipid scrambling is that a lipid fully transitions from one membrane leaflet to the other. While a single lipid could transition through the groove on its own, it is well documented in both atomistic and CG MD simulations, that lipid scrambling typically happens through a lipid-lined groove, as shown in Fig. 1A-B. The lipids tend to form strong choline-to-phosphate interactions with nearest neighbors that make this energetically favorable. That said, lipid-lined grooves are not sufficient for robust scrambling, which is what we show in Fig. 1D where the non-scrambler TMEM16A did in fact feature a lipid-lined groove. As suggested, we performed contact analysis and found that residue K645 on TM6 in the middle of the groove contacts lipids in 9.2% of the simulation frames.</p><p>To get a better understanding of how populated the TM4-TM6 pathway is with lipids across all simulated structures, we determined for every simulation frame how many headgroup beads resided in the groove. This indicates that the ion-conductive state of TMEM16A (5OYB*, Fig. 1D) only had 1 lipid in the pathway, on average, meaning that the configuration shown Fig. 1D is indeed exceptional. As a reference, our strongest scrambler nhTMEM16 4WIS, had an average of 2.8 lipids in the groove. We added a table containing the means and standard deviations that resulted from this analysis as Figure 1-Table supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Lines 295-298 : The scrambling rates of the Ca²⁺-bound and Ca²⁺-free structures fall within overlapping error margins, it becomes difficult to definitively state that Ca²⁺ binding significantly enhances scrambling activity. This undermines the claim that the Ca²⁺-bound structure is the strongest scrambler. The authors should conduct statistical analyses to determine if the difference between the two conditions is statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>In contrast to the reviewer’s comment, we do not claim that Ca2+-binding itself enhances lipid scrambling. Instead, what we show is that WT structures that are solved in an open confirmation (all of which are Ca2+-bound, except 6QM6) are robust scramblers. For nhTMEM16, we did not observe any scrambling events for the closed-groove proteins, making further statistical analysis redundant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors claim that the scrambling rates derived from their MD simulations are in &quot;excellent agreement&quot; with experimental findings (lines 294-295), despite significant discrepancy between simulated and experimentally measured rates. For example, the simulated rate of 24.4 {plus minus} 5.2 events/µs for the open, Ca²⁺-bound fungal nhTMEM16 (PDB ID 4WIS) corresponds to approximately 24 million events per second, which is vastly higher than experimental rates. Experimental studies have reported scrambling rate constants of ~0.003 s⁻¹ for TMEM16 family members in the absence of Ca²⁺, measured under physiological conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11753-1">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11753-1</ext-link>). Even with Ca²⁺ activation, scrambling rates remain several orders of magnitude lower than the rates observed in simulations. Moreover, this highlights a larger problem: lipid scrambling rates occur over timescales that are not captured by these simulations. While the authors elude to these discrepancies (lines 605-606), they should be emphasised in the text, as opposed to the table caption. These should also be reconducted to differences between the membrane compositions of different studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the spirit of the reviewer’s comment, and because of that, we were very careful not to claim that we reproduce experimental scrambling rates, just that the trends (scrambling-competent, or not) are correct. On lines 294-295, we actually said that the scrambling rates in our simulations excellently agree with “the presumed scrambling competence of each experimental structure”, which is true.</p><p>As explained extensively in the discussion section of our paper (and by many others), direct comparison between MD (e.g., Martini 3, but also atomistic force fields) dynamics and experimental measurements is challenging. The primary goal of our paper is to quantify and compare the scrambling capacity of different TMEM16 family members and different states, within a CGMD context.</p><p>That said, we agree with the reviewer that we may have missed rare or long-timescale events (as is the case in any MD experiment) and added this point to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) To address these discrepancies, the authors should: (i) emphasize that simulated rates serve as qualitative indicators of scrambling competence rather than absolute values comparable to experimental findings and (ii) discuss potential reasons for the divergence, such as simulation timescale limitations or lipid bilayer compositions that may favor scrambling and force field inaccuracies.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our answer to question 6. Within the context of our CGMD survey, we confidently call our results quantitative. However, we agree with the reviewer that comparison with experimental scrambling rates is qualitative and should be interpreted with caution. To reflect this, we rewrote the first sentence of the relevant paragraph in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Line 310: Can the authors provide a rationale as to why one monomer has a wider groove than the other? Perhaps a contact analysis could be useful. See the comment above about ENM.</p></disp-quote><p>The simulation of Ca2+-bound TMEM16K was initiated from an asymmetric X-ray structure in which chain B features a more dilated groove than chain A (PDB 5OC9). The backbones of TM4 and TM6 in the closed groove (A) are close enough together to be directly interconnected by the elastic network. In contrast, TM4 and TM6 in the more dilated subunit (B) are not restricted by the elastic network and, as a consequence, display some “breathing” behavior (Fig. 3B and Fig. 3-Suppl. 6A), giving rise to a ~4x higher scrambling rate. We explicitly added the word “cryo-EM” and the PDB ID to the sentence to emphasize that the asymmetry stems from the original experimental structure.</p><p>When answering this question, we also corrected a mislabeled chain identifier which was in the original manuscript ‘chain A’ when it is actually ‘chain B’ in Fig.2-Suppl. 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Line 312: Authors speculate that increased groove width likely accounts for increased scrambling rates. For statistical significance, authors should attempt to correlate scrambling rates and groove width over the simulation period.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is referring to our description of scrambling rates we measured for TMEM16K where we noted that on average the groove with the highest scrambling rate is also on average wider than the opposite subunit which is below 6 Å. We do not suggest that the correlation between scrambling and groove width is continuous, as the Reviewer may have interpreted from our original submission, but we think it is a binary outcome – lipids cannot easily enter narrow grooves (&lt; 6 Å) and hence scrambling can only occur once this threshold is reached at which point it occurs at a near constant rate. We showed this for 4 different family members in the original Fig. 3B, where scrambling events (black dots) were much more likely during, or right after, groove dilation to distances &gt; 6 Å.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Line 359: Authors have plotted the minimum distance between residues TM4 and TM6 in Fig. 3A/B, claiming that a wide groove is required for scrambling. Upon closer examination, it is clear that several of these distributions overlap, reducing the statistical significance of these claims. Statistical tests (i.e. KS-tests) should be performed to determine whether the differences in distributions are significant.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer appears to be asking for a statistical test between the six distance distributions represented by the data in Fig. 3A for the scrambling competent structures (6QP6*, 8B8J, 6QM6, 7RXG, 4WIS, 5OC9), and we think this is being asked because it is believed that we are making a claim that the greater the distance, the greater the scrambling rate. If we have interpreted this comment correctly, we are not making this claim. Rather, we are simply stating that we only observe robust scrambling when the groove width regularly separates beyond 6 Å. The full distance distributions can now be found in Figure 3-figure supplement 6B, and we agree there is significant overlap between some of these distributions. However, the distinguishing characteristic of the 6 distributions from scrambling competent proteins is that they all access large distances, while the others do not. Notably, TMEM16F proteins (6QP6*, 8B8J) are below the 6 Å threshold on average, but they have wide standard deviations and spend well over ¼ of their time in the permissive regime (the upper error bar in the whisker plots in Fig. 3A is the 75% boundary).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Line 363-364: The authors state that all TMEM16 structures thin the membrane. Could the authors include a description of how membrane thinning is calculated, for instance, is the entire membrane considered, or is thinning calculated on a membrane patch close to the protein? Do membrane patches closer to the transmembrane protein increase or decrease thickness due to hydrophobic packing interactions? The latter question is of particular concern since Martini3 has been shown to induce local thinning of the membrane close to transmembrane helices, yielding thicknesses 2-3 Å thinner than those reported experimentally (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2023.140436">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2023.140436</ext-link>). This could be an important consideration in the authors' comparison to the bulk membrane thickness (line 364). Finally, how is the 'bulk membrane thickness' measured (i.e., from the CG simulations, from AA simulations, or from experiments)?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the calculation of thinning and bulk membrane thickness, as described in Method “Quantification of membrane deformations”, the minimal membrane thickness, or thinning, is defined as the shortest distance between any two points from the interpolated upper and lower leaflet surfaces constructed using the glycerol beads (GL1 and GL2). Bulk membrane thickness is calculated by taking the vertical distance between the averaged glycerol surfaces at the membrane edge.</p><p>The concern of localized membrane deformation due to force field artifacts is well-founded. However, the sinusoidal deformations shown here are much greater than 2-3 Å Martini3 imperfections, and they extend for up to 10 Å radially away from the protein into the bulk membrane (see Figure 3-figure supplement 1-5 for more of a description). Most importantly, the sinusoidal wave patterns set up by the proteins is very similar to those described in the previous continuum calculation and all-atom MD for nhTMEM16 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1607574113">https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1607574113</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Line 374: The authors state a 'positive correlation' between membrane thinning/groove opening and scrambling rates. To support this claim, the authors should report. the correlation coefficients.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed any discussion concerning correlations between the magnitude of the scrambling rate and the degree of membrane thinning/groove opening. Rather we simply state that opening beyond a threshold distance is required for robust scrambling, as shown in our analysis in Fig. 3A.</p><p>Concerning the relation between thinning and scrambling: Instantaneous membrane thinning is poorly defined (because it is governed by fluctuations of single lipids), and therefore difficult to correlate with the timing of individual scrambling events in a meaningful way. Moreover, as we state later in that same section, “we argue that the extremely thin membranes are likely correlated with groove opening, rather than being an independent contributing factor to lipid scrambling”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Line 396: It is stated that TMEM16A is not a scramblase but the simulating scrambling activity is not zero. How can you be sure that you are monitoring the correct collective variable if you are getting a false positive with respect to experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We only observe 2 scrambling events in 10 ms, which is a very small rate compared to the scrambling competent states. In a previous large survey Martini CG simulation study that inspired our protocol (Li et al, PNAS 2024), they employed a 1 event/ms cut-off to distinguish scramblers from non-scramblers. Hence, they would have called TMEM16A a non-scrambler as well. We expect that false negatives in this context might be an artifact of the CG forcefield, or it could be that TMEM16A can scramble but too slowly to be experimentally detected. Regarding the collective variable for lipid flipping, it is correct, and we know that this lipid actually flipped.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Line 402: Distance distributions for the electrostatic interactions between E633 and K645 should be included in the manuscript.

The video clearly shows that the lipid headgroups in the center of the groove orient themselves such that the phosphate bead (red) rests just above K645 (blue) and at other times the choline bead (blue) rests just below E633 (red). We do not think an additional plot with the distance distributions between lipids and these residues will add to our understanding of how lipids interact residues in the TMEM16A pore.</p><p>We made a similar qualitative observation for the interaction between the POPC choline to E843 and POPC phosphate to K850 while watching the AAMD simulation trajectory of TMEM16F (PDB ID 6QP6).

As illustrated by the density isosurfaces in Appendix 1-Figure 2A, the amount of water found in the closed versus open grooves is striking – there is a significant flood of water that connects the upper and lower solutions upon groove opening. Moreover, Appendix 1-Figure 2B shows much greater water permeation for open structures (4WIS, 7RXG, 5OC9, 8B8J, …) compared to closed structures (6QMB, 6QMA, 8B8Q, and many of the non-labeled data in the figure that all have closed grooves and near 0 water permeation).
