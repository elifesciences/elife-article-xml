locate host plants. The importance of CO<sub>2</sub> in this context is not well understood. We manipulated CO<sub>2</sub> perception in western corn rootworm (WCR) larvae through RNAi and studied how CO<sub>2</sub> perception impacts their interaction with their host plant. The expression of a carbon dioxide receptor, <italic>DvvGr2</italic>, is specifically required for dose-dependent larval responses to CO<sub>2</sub>. Silencing CO<sub>2</sub> perception or scrubbing plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> has no effect on the ability of WCR larvae to locate host plants at short distances (&lt;9 cm), but impairs host location at greater distances. WCR larvae preferentially orient and prefer plants that grow in well-fertilized soils compared to plants that grow in nutrient-poor soils, a behaviour that has direct consequences for larval growth and depends on the ability of the larvae to perceive root-emitted CO<sub>2</sub>. This study unravels how CO<sub>2</sub> can mediate plant–herbivore interactions by serving as a distance-dependent host location cue.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living deep in the ground and surrounded by darkness, soil insects must rely on the chemicals released by plants to find the roots they feed on. Carbon dioxide, for example, is a by-product of plant respiration, which, above ground, is thought to attract moths to flowers and flies to apples; underground, however, its role is still unclear. This gaseous compound can travel through soil and potentially act as a compass for root-eating insects. Yet, it is also produced by decaying plants or animals, which are not edible. It is therefore possible that insects use this signal as a long-range cue to orient themselves, but then switch to another chemical when closer to their target to narrow in on an actual food source.</p><p>To test this idea, Arce et al. investigated whether carbon dioxide guides the larvae of Western corn rootworm to maize roots. First, the rootworm genes responsible for sensing carbon dioxide were identified and switched off, making the larvae unable to detect this gas. When the genetically engineered rootworms were further than 9cm from maize roots, they were less able to locate that food source; closer to the roots, however, the insects could orient themselves towards the plant. This suggests that the insects use carbon dioxide at long distances but rely on another chemicals to narrow down their search at close range.</p><p>To confirm this finding, Arce et al. tried absorbing the carbon dioxide using soda lime, leading to similar effects: carbon dioxide sensitive insects stopped detecting the roots at long but not short distances. Additional experiments then revealed that the compound could help insects find the best roots to feed on. Indeed, eating plants that grow on rich terrain – for instance, fertilized soils – helps insects to grow bigger and faster. These roots also release more carbon dioxide, in turn attracting rootworms more frequently.</p><p>In the United States and Eastern Europe, Western corn rootworms inflict major damage to crops, highlighting the need to understand and manage the link between fertilization regimes, carbon dioxide release and how these pests find their food.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plant-herbivore interactions</kwd><kwd>foraging</kwd><kwd>volatile perception</kwd><kwd>behaviour</kwd><kwd>host location</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Maize</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>794947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schimmel</surname><given-names>Bernardus CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>155781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>186094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machado</surname><given-names>Ricardo AR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The larvae of the western corn rootworm use root-emitted CO<sub>2</sub> to successfully locate the most suitable host plant.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insect herbivores can use different cues to locate suitable host plants from a distance. Volatile cues, in particular, can convey information about the identity and physiological status of a host plant and are integrated by herbivores to locate host plants for oviposition and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Visser and Avé, 1978</xref>). Over the years, many attractive and repellent plant volatiles were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Späthe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Webster and Cardé, 2017</xref>), and the importance of individual compounds and volatile blends was documented using synthetic chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bruce and Pickett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrasco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fraenkel, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dorn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Visser and Avé, 1978</xref>). More recently, molecular manipulative approaches were used to manipulate plant volatile production and herbivore perception in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fandino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Robert et al., 2013</xref>), thus confirming the important role of plant volatiles in plant–herbivore interactions.</p><p>While the role of plant volatiles such as green-leaf volatiles, aromatic compounds, and terpenes is well understood, much less is known about the role of plant-associated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in plant–herbivore interactions. As many plant organs and their associated microbial communities release CO<sub>2</sub>, it may be integrated into herbivore foraging as a marker of metabolic activity. <italic>Datura wrightii</italic> flowers, for instance, emit the highest levels of CO<sub>2</sub> during times of high nectar availability; as hawkmoth pollinators are attracted to CO<sub>2</sub>, they may thus use this cue to locate rewarding flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goyret et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guerenstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guerenstein and Hildebrand, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stange, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stange, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stange and Stowe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thom et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, lesions in apples result in high CO<sub>2</sub> release and attract <italic>Bactrocera tryoni</italic> fruit flies. As CO<sub>2</sub> at corresponding concentrations is attractive to the flies, it has been suggested that they may use plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> to locate suitable oviposition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stange, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Root-feeding insects are highly attracted to CO<sub>2</sub> in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernklau and Bjostad, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernklau and Bjostad, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eilers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hibbard and Bjostad, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jones and Coaker, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Klingler, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nicolas and Sillans, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rogers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Strnad et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strnad and Dunn, 1990</xref>). Given that CO<sub>2</sub> is produced and released by plant roots and diffuses relatively well through the soil, a likely explanation for this phenomenon is that root herbivores use CO<sub>2</sub> as a host location cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernklau and Bjostad, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernklau and Bjostad, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doane et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Johnson and Gregory, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnson and Nielsen, 2012</xref>), However, the reliability of CO<sub>2</sub> as a host location cue for root feeders has been questioned due to a number of reasons: (i) CO<sub>2</sub> can be emitted by many other sources apart from host plant roots, including decaying organic matter, microorganisms, and non-host plants; (ii) there is a strong diurnal fluctuation in plant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that does not necessarily match with insect foraging habits; and (iii) other plant-released chemicals can be used by root herbivores for host location within a CO<sub>2</sub> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eilers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hansen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hibbard and Bjostad, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hiltpold and Turlings, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnson and Nielsen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reinecke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Weissteiner et al., 2012</xref>). A model that may reconcile these different views is that CO<sub>2</sub> may be used as an initial cue at long distances, while other, more host-specific volatiles may be used at shorter distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnson and Nielsen, 2012</xref>). So far, this model has not been experimentally validated, and the precise role of plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> as a host location cue by herbivores, in general, and root herbivores, in particular, remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eilers et al., 2016</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no studies so far have investigated the role of plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> in plant–herbivore interactions in vivo using molecular manipulative approaches.</p><p>The larvae of <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic> (the western corn rootworm [WCR]) feed almost exclusively on maize roots in agricultural settings and cause major yield losses in the US and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meinke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Toepfer et al., 2015</xref>). The larvae rely on a number of volatile and non-volatile chemicals to identify and locate host plants, and distinguish between suitable and less-suitable maize plants and forage within the maize root system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hiltpold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Johnson and Gregory, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnson and Nielsen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Robert et al., 2012c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schumann et al., 2018</xref>). Non-volatile primary metabolites such as sugars and fatty acids as well as secondary metabolites such as benzoxazinoids and phenolic acid conjugates modulate larval behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernklau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernklau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernklau et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernklau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Machado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Robert et al., 2012c</xref>). Volatiles including (<italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene, ethylene, and CO<sub>2</sub> attract the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernklau and Bjostad, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernklau and Bjostad, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robert et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Robert et al., 2012a</xref>), while methyl anthranilate repels them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernklau et al., 2016b</xref>). Based on the finding that high CO<sub>2</sub> levels can outweigh the attractive effects of other maize volatiles, it was suggested that CO<sub>2</sub> may be the only relevant volatile attractant for WCR larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernklau and Bjostad, 1998b</xref>). However, under conditions where CO<sub>2</sub> levels are similar, WCR larvae reliably choose between host plants of different suitability using other volatile cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robert et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Robert et al., 2012a</xref>). The demonstrated ability of WCR larvae to respond to different volatile cues and the recent identification of putative CO<sub>2</sub> receptors from transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>) make this species a suitable model system to investigate the role of CO<sub>2</sub> in plant–herbivore interactions. Ongoing efforts to use CO<sub>2</sub> as a bait to control WCR in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernklau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schumann et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schumann et al., 2014b</xref>) provide further motivation to assess the importance of this volatile for WCR foraging.</p><p>To understand the importance of CO<sub>2</sub> for WCR foraging in the soil, we manipulated the insect’s capacity to perceive CO<sub>2</sub>. We reduced the expression levels of three putative WCR CO<sub>2</sub> receptor-encoding genes through RNA interference (RNAi), resulting in the identification of <italic>DvvGr2</italic> as an essential gene for CO<sub>2</sub> perception. Using <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silenced larvae in combination with CO<sub>2 </sub>removal, we then assessed the importance of CO<sub>2</sub> perception for WCR behaviour and foraging in olfactometers and soil arenas. Our experiments reveal how root-associated CO<sub>2</sub> modulates the interaction between maize and its economically most damaging root pest and expand the current repertoire of potential adaptive explanations for the attraction of insect herbivores to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Plants create CO<sub>2</sub> gradients in the soil</title><p>Plant-emitted CO<sub>2</sub> may be used as a host location cue by root herbivores. To understand whether the presence of plant roots is associated with higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, we measured CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the soil at different distances from young maize seedlings. We observed a significant CO<sub>2</sub> gradient in the soil, with concentrations of 548–554 ppm in the rhizosphere, 506–515 ppm at distances between 8 and 16 cm from the plant, and 460–484 ppm at distances between 16 and 32 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At distances of more than 40 cm, CO<sub>2</sub> levels levelled off at 425–439 ppm. We then removed the plants and remeasured CO<sub>2</sub> levels 1 hr afterwards. In the absence of the plants, no CO<sub>2</sub> gradient was observed, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the soil were around 430 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When surrounding soil was removed and seedling roots were washed, we observed 542 ± 6.74 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> around the roots (n = 3). Thus, the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from maize roots can account for the CO<sub>2</sub> difference between soil trays with and without plants. This experiment shows that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels derived from roots and probably from root-associated microorganisms are temporally and spatially associated with the presence of maize roots, and may thus be used as a host location cue by the WCR. To test this hypothesis, we identified CO<sub>2</sub> receptors in WCR larvae, genetically impair their expression, and conducted a series of behavioural experiments as described below.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Plants create CO<sub>2</sub> gradients in the soil.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) CO<sub>2</sub> levels were determined in soil-filled trays at different distances from young maize seedlings (<bold>A</bold>) before and (<bold>B</bold>) after removing the seedlings from the system.

Direct access to the roots was impeded by using volatile-permeable fabrics, referred to hereby as root barriers. The CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by maize roots formed a gradient in the soil, starting at about 506 ppm in the rhizosphere (zone 1) and 430 ppm at distances of 16–32 cm from the plant (zone 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The capacity of the larvae to directly feed on the host roots was impeded using a volatile-permeable root barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Within 10 hr, 36% of the released WT larvae were found in zone 1, and within 32 hr, this number had increased to 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, the capacity to detect CO<sub>2</sub> gradients contributes to successful host location by WCR larvae in a distance-specific manner in the soil. While larvae released at a distance equal to or below 32 cm from the host plant (zones 2–3) can use CO<sub>2</sub> directly as a host location cue, larvae released at greater distances likely move randomly before reaching zones with plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> gradients.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Root-associated CO<sub>2</sub> is used by western corn rootworm (WCR) larvae for host location in a distance-specific manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean (± SEM) proportion of wild type (WT) (dark green) or <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silenced (light green) WCR larvae observed in the different tray zones 8 hr after releasing the larvae in the centre of soil-filled trays without plants.

Taken together, the molecular elements required for carbon dioxide perception may be species-specific. Our results support this notion as <italic>DvvGr2,</italic> but not <italic>DvvGr1</italic> and <italic>DvvGr3</italic>, are crucial for CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness. The role of <italic>DvvGr1</italic> and <italic>DvvGr3</italic> for WCR remains to be determined, but their presence and expression may hint at additional complexity in developmental and/or tissue-specific patterns of CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness in this species.</p><p>Despite the inability of <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silenced WCR larvae to respond to differences in CO<sub>2</sub> levels, the larvae were still able to orient towards maize roots at short distances of 8–10 cm. Olfactometer experiments in combination with CO<sub>2</sub> removal demonstrate that other volatile cues can be used by WCR larvae to locate maize plants at distances shorter than 9 cm. Earlier studies found that (<italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene, which is emitted from the roots of certain maize genotypes when they are attacked by root herbivores, attracts second and third instar WCR larvae and allows them to aggregate on maize plants and thereby enhance their fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robert et al., 2012b</xref>), while neonate larvae are not attracted to this volatile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiltpold and Hibbard, 2016</xref>). Ethylene has also been shown to attract WCR larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Robert et al., 2012a</xref>), and MBOA or its breakdown products have also been proposed as volatile attractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bjostad and Hibbard, 1992</xref>). Methyl anthranilate, on the other hand, has been shown to repel WCR larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernklau et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernklau et al., 2019</xref>). Many other leaf- and root-feeding herbivores are known to respond to plant volatiles other than CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruce et al., 2005</xref>). Given the low reliability of CO<sub>2</sub> as a host-specific cue, it is probably not surprising that WCR, as a highly specialized maize feeder, can use other volatile cues to locate host plants. Integrating other volatile cues likely allows WCR larvae to locate maize plants even in the absence of reliable CO<sub>2</sub> gradients in the soil, thus increasing the robustness of its foraging behaviour at short distances. An intriguing result in this context is the fact that WCR larvae show the same efficiency in locating maize roots at short distances in the absence of a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient, suggesting that this volatile may not play a role as a cue at close range.</p><p>Although intact CO<sub>2</sub> perception was not required for host location at short distances, it had a strong impact on the capacity of WCR larvae to reach the maize rhizosphere at long distances. A gradient of plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> was detected at distances of up to 32 cm from the plant. When WCR larvae were released at distances greater than 32 cm, they still managed to locate plants in a <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-dependent manner. This result can be explained by random movement, where the larvae move randomly until they encounter a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient, or by localized CO<sub>2</sub> gradients along preferential gas-phase pathways that may extend beyond 32 cm, or a combination of both. The advantages of CO<sub>2</sub> as a host location cue are that it is abundantly produced through respiration by most organisms, is relatively stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jones and Coaker, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and diffuses rapidly in air, water, and soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hashimoto and Suzuki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> may thus be a suitable long-range cue to locate organisms with high respiratory rates, such as mammals and heterotroph plant parts, including roots and their associated microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnson and Nielsen, 2012</xref>). Aboveground insects can be attracted to CO<sub>2</sub> traps located as far away as 10 m, and it is estimated that this distance could even be as long as 60 m under optimal environmental circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guerenstein and Hildebrand, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zollner et al., 2004</xref>). For belowground insects, this distance is hypothesized to be within the lower centimetre range as CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion is substantially decreased within the soil matrix compared to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion in air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernklau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doane et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doane and Klingler, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Klingler, 1966</xref>). Other volatiles that are less abundant and diffuse even less well through the soil such as (<italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene are unlikely to be detectable at distances of more than 10 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiriboga M. et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hiltpold and Turlings, 2008</xref>). These volatiles are thus likely useful host location cues at short, but not long, distances in the soil. The finding that WCR integrates CO<sub>2</sub> perception with other environmental cues and that attraction to CO<sub>2</sub> is context dependent is in line with patterns reported for other insects such as mosquitoes, whose response to stimuli such as colour, temperature, and human body odours is enhanced by CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>), and pollinating hawkmoths, which use CO<sub>2</sub> as a redundant volatile distance stimulus in a sex-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goyret et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A recent study shows that a CO<sub>2</sub> receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies is also involved in the detection and behavioural responses to other volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">MacWilliam et al., 2018</xref>). We observed that <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silenced larvae were repelled by methyl anthranilate, a potent maize root repellent, to a similar extent as WT larvae, suggesting that their sensitivity to this plant volatile is unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernklau et al., 2016b</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, the CO<sub>2</sub> receptor <italic>Gr63a</italic> is required for spermidine attractiveness over short time spans, that is, less than 1 min, but not over longer time spans (hours), when other receptors likely become more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">MacWilliam et al., 2018</xref>). In the present experiments, WCR behaviour was evaluated after one or more hours. The CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber experiment provides further evidence that the foraging patterns observed in this study are not due to different sensitivity of <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silenced larvae to other root volatiles.</p><p>Apart from acting as a long-distance host location cue, CO<sub>2</sub> also links plant fertilization to herbivore behaviour by guiding WCR to well-fertilized plants. As WCR larvae are resistant to root defences of maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robert et al., 2012b</xref>), it is likely to benefit from increased fertilization, independently of the plant’s defensive status. As the plant nutritional status and host quality for WCR larvae are associated with higher CO<sub>2</sub> release from the roots, following the highest concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the soil may be adaptive for the herbivore as it may increase its chance not only to find a maize plant per se but also to identify a plant that has the resources to grow vigorously and that is a better host. More experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis as in the current set-up the larvae may have followed the only available CO<sub>2</sub> gradient close to their release point rather than having made a choice between two gradients. However, given the dose-dependent responses of WCR, preferential orientation towards plants surrounded by higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels appears likely. Well-fertilized maize plants increase photosynthesis and biomass production, which results in higher CO<sub>2</sub> release from the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhu and Lynch, 2004</xref>). WCR larvae are specialized maize pests that have evolved with intense maize cultivation in the corn belt of the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gray et al., 2009</xref>) and are resistant to maize defence metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robert et al., 2012b</xref>). Following the strongest CO<sub>2</sub> gradient in an equally spaced maize monoculture may indeed be a useful strategy for this root feeder to locate suitable food sources. An association between CO<sub>2</sub> emission and food-source profitability was also suggested for <italic>Datura</italic> flowers, which emit the highest level of CO<sub>2</sub> in times when nectar is most abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guerenstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thom et al., 2004</xref>). These findings support the general hypothesis that CO<sub>2</sub> is a marker of metabolic activity that allows for an assessment of the vigour and profitability of a wide variety of hosts. The impact of CO<sub>2</sub> for the distribution of root herbivores such as the WCR in heterogeneous environments remains to be determined. Based on our results, we expect plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> to contribute to uneven herbivore distribution and to aggregation on plants with a good nutritional status within monocultures.</p><p>In summary, this work demonstrates how a herbivore uses its capacity to perceive CO<sub>2</sub> to locate host plants. Volatiles other than CO<sub>2</sub> are also integrated into host-finding behaviour in the soil, but their effects are more important at short than at long distances. Random movement in the soil may help this root herbivore to increase its capacity to find host cues at even greater distances. Thus, evidence is now accumulating that CO<sub>2</sub> acts as an important host location cue in different insects, likely because of its unique role as a highly conserved long-range marker of metabolic activity within complex sensory landscapes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plants and planting conditions</title><p>Maize seeds (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L., var.

Larvae that were fed bacteria that express dsRNA that targets GFP were used as controls (herein referred to as wild type larvae; WT). The belowground olfactometers consist of two L-shaped glass pots (5 cm diameter, 11 cm deep) connected to a detachable central glass tube (24–29 mm diameter, 8 cm in length) by detachable Teflon connectors (Verre and Quartz Technique SA, Neuchâtel, Switzerland) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The Teflon connectors contained wire mesh screens (2300 mesh, Small Parts Inc, Miami Lakes, FL, USA) to restrain the larvae from moving into the plants. The central glass tubes remained empty to only allow volatile compounds to diffuse through the central glass tubes. The central glass tubes have an access port in the middle to allow the release of insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Insects can freely move inside the central glass tube (8 cm in length) and reach the metal wire screens.

Insect preference for a given treatment was considered when the larvae were found at a distance of 1 cm or less from the odour source; this is 1 cm apart from the wire mesh. Seven olfactometers per larval type and experiment were assessed. Olfactometers were covered with aluminium foil to reduce light disturbance to the larvae. Aluminium foil was removed shortly before evaluating larval positions. The experiment was repeated twice.

CO<sub>2</sub> levels were increased in one side of the olfactometer by delivering CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched synthetic air (1% CO<sub>2</sub>, Carbagas, Switzerland). For this, the L-shaped glass pots were closed on top using parafilm during CO<sub>2</sub> delivery. A manometer connected to the synthetic air bottle allowed to fine-tune CO<sub>2</sub> delivery rates and concentrations.

In the first experiment, two root pieces (3–4 cm long) of 4-day-old maize seedlings were placed at the rim of a Petri plate lined with moist filter paper. Then, on the opposite rim (i.e., 9 cm apart), either one 2nd–3rd instar WT WCR larvae or one 2nd–3rd instar <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silenced WCR larvae was released. The trajectories followed by the insects and the time required to reach the roots were evaluated. The trajectories followed by the insects were drawn on circular pieces of papers of 9 cm diameter. Six Petri plates with one larva each were assayed (n = 6). In the second experiment, CO<sub>2</sub> point releasers were installed in the centre of Petri plates (9 cm diameter, Greiner Bio-One, Austria). For this, Petri plates were pierced with a hot metal needle. Then, another needle that released CO<sub>2</sub> at 581 ppm, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 60 ppm above ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels, was inserted in the resulting whole.

Petri plates were lined with moist filter paper (9 cm diameter, GE Healthcare, UK). Insect behaviour was observed for 3 min, the trajectories followed by the insects during this time were drawn on circular pieces of papers of 9 cm diameter, and the time spent in close contact with the CO<sub>2</sub> point releaser was quantified. Six Petri plates with one larva each were assayed (n = 6). Both experiments were conducted in a dark room to reduce light disturbance to the larvae.

General specifications of the olfactometers are described above. One set of olfactometers has short arms that allowed for the release of larvae at 9 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) from plant volatile sources, and the other one has long arms that allow to release the larvae at 18 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) from plant volatiles sources. Insect larvae can move freely into the central glass tube and reach the metal wire screens located at both ends of the central glass tube. L-shaped glass pots were covered with aluminium foil, filled with sand, and one 3-week-old maize plant was transplanted 48 hr before the experiments. L-shaped glass pots without plants were treated similarly. Olfactometers remained detached until shortly before the experiments. Thirty minutes before the experiments, soda lime layers were applied and one L-shaped glass pot with a plant and one L-shaped glass pot without a plant were connected to the central glass tubes.

host-searching by a soil-borne insect herbivore, especially because of generating insect larvae with reduced expression levels of CO<sub>2</sub> receptor-encoding genes through RNAi. This study provides very interesting, novel insights into the use of a compound generally produced by living organisms in the process of searching for a host plant. Moreover, the use of different experimental setups at different spatial scales adds to the value of the study.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Plant-derived CO<sub>2</sub> mediates long-distance host location and quality assessment by a root herbivore&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andre Kessler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although all three reviewers were highly interested in the study and consider the generation of the silenced larvae a very interesting approach to studying the role of CO<sub>2</sub> in host-plant selection by larvae of the western corn rootworm, most of the experiments addressing their behavior do not unequivocally lead to the conclusions drawn in the manuscript. This relates especially to the role of CO<sub>2</sub> in long-range attraction, the relative role of CO<sub>2</sub> and other volatiles, the source of the CO<sub>2</sub>. Resolving these issues would require extensive additional experimentation and that is something <italic>eLife</italic> does not ask from authors. In addition the methods section lacks many important details to allow careful assessment of the data presented. Therefore, the reviewers unanimously conclude that this manuscript is not acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript has an interesting topic, presenting a study on the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the behavior of a root-feeding insect, larvae of the western corn rootworm. Despite ample research on the chemical cues used by herbivorous insects in finding their host plant, the role of CO<sub>2</sub> has generally been overlooked and this study addresses this knowledge gap. The data presented show that (1) in a 9 cm olfactometer the larvae are attracted to CO<sub>2</sub> generated by carbonated water and that larvae silenced in one of the carbon dioxide receptor genes are no longer attracted. The behavior to three other compounds was not affected by the RNAi treatment; (2) the response to CO<sub>2</sub> in the 9 cm olfactometer is CO<sub>2</sub> – dose dependent, (3) silencing the receptor does not affect overall motility, but only behavioral responses to CO<sub>2</sub>. (4) in a 9cm olfactometer the larvae orient towards volatiles from roots of a maize seedling, and this is similar for WT and silenced larvae in the presence and absence of soda lime as a CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber, however at 18 cm only WT larvae in the absence of the scrubber oriented towards the root volatiles. (5) in a tray assay the larvae appear to find the roots of plants more frequently with shorter distance from the roots and more orient towards high-fertilization treatment of plants than to low-fertilization treatment. The authors conclude that CO<sub>2</sub> produced by maize roots is an important attractant for WCR larvae.</p><p>The fact that the study involves wildtype and RNAi silenced WCR larvae makes this a very interesting and innovative study and the outcome that CO<sub>2</sub> is important for an insect herbivore in host-plant selection is new. Although I am impressed by the behavioral data presented for wildtype and silenced WCR larvae I have several important issues with the study.</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript and in the title the authors conclude that the phenomena described can be ascribe to plant-derived CO<sub>2</sub> – however there is no evidence for this at all. As mentioned in the Introduction, CO<sub>2</sub> is a ubiquitous compound produced by almost all forms of life. The soil and especially the rhizosphere have abundant numbers of microbes that all produce CO<sub>2</sub>. The microbes in the rhizosphere occur in much higher densities than in the bulk soil as they are recruited by the roots. Thus microbial CO<sub>2</sub> is also more abundant in the rhizosphere and this may be an important part of the explanation for the observed behavior. Thus, conclusion that the roots are the producer of the CO<sub>2</sub> that attracts the WCR larvae (e.g. Results and also many other locations) cannot be drawn on the basis of the current study.</p><p>2) The statistics in Figure 3 cannot be correct and the asterisks seem to derive from a copy and paste process.</p><p>3) The fertilizer experiment lacks a proper control. Fertilization enhances nutrients in the soil and not only the plant but also the soil microbiome can exploit this nutrient source. As a consequence the effect of fertilizer may have been caused by enhanced activity and/or numbers of soil microbes producing higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. A control experiment using fertilizer in the absence of plants is needed to assess the effects of fertilizer on non-plant factors in the soil. Now the conclusion that fertilizer enhances CO<sub>2</sub> production by plant roots is premature.</p><p>4) The Materials and methods section needs to become more informative. For instance, the method of CO<sub>2</sub> quantification, a crucial element of the study is unclear: Subsection “Belowground olfactometer experiments with <italic>DvvGr1</italic>-, 462 <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-, <italic>DvvGr3</italic>-silenced WCR larvae“ states that this was done through GC-FID (really?) but does not tell at all how this was done. How was air sampled and transferred to the GC? This needs to be elaborated in detail as it is not straightforward. In the section on host location experiments two methods are mentioned for assessing CO<sub>2</sub> levels: the use of a gas analyzer and the use of GC-FID but it is neither clear why two methods were used, nor how the air was sampled, nor which data derive from one or the other method. In the olfactometer, larval positions were recorded 1hour after release but how this was done is not clear. Neither is it clear to me whether in the 9 cm olfactometer the larvae can move over the full 9 cm or not. Same for the 18cm olfactometer. Insect behavior was observed for three minutes but it remains unclear how this was done. Same for how the trajectories were followed. Also it is not clear how the crawled distances were measured with ImageJ: were the paths filmed? The volatile-permeable root barrier (Results) has not been described in the Materials and methods section. These examples are non-exhaustive but rather an indicator that the methods section needs major improvement to allow others to repeat the experiments and to allow valuable evaluation of the data.</p><p>5) WCR larvae are soil dwelling and make their behavioral choices in the darkness in the soil. The behavioral assays have been done in Petri dishes and in olfactometers and in both cases the arena where the larvae were released does not seem to contain soil. At least, the picture in Figure 5B suggests that the middle part of the olfactometer where the larvae are introduced is empty. Were these bioassays carried out in the light or in darkness and if in darkness, how were the behavioral parameters quantified (Materials and methods)?</p><p>6) The use of soda lime to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the olfactometer setup is an interesting one but raises the question what the effect is on other volatiles. If CO<sub>2</sub> levels were assessed through GC-FID such samples could also be used for GC-MS to assess the quantitative and qualitative effects of soda lime on other components of the volatile blend. The data in Figure 5B show that with a soda lime filter neither wildtype larvae nor silenced larvae move towards the volatiles from maize roots. The authors draw the conclusion that CO<sub>2</sub> is needed for attraction to the roots, but an alternative explanation is that the soda lime also reduced the levels of other root volatiles with as consequence reduction below the level that leads to attraction at 18 cm distance. To assess which conclusion is best supporting the data the first step should be to analyze the volatiles with the method used already to assess CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>How insects (pests) locate host plants below ground is a highly relevant topic. The MS is very well written. The authors claim that they elucidated distance dependent mechanisms of host location and host quality assessment in WCR larvae by combining molecular, analytical, and behavioural techniques. However, only two findings endure scrutiny. (i) DvvGr2 is a CO<sub>2</sub> receptor required for orientation in a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient and (ii) CO<sub>2</sub> attracts or repels WCR larvae in a concentration dependent manner. The Materials and method section suffers from a substantial information deficits impeding the reader to judge, to replicate, or to transfer the methods to other organisms.</p><p>1) The Introduction is very well written and gives an excellent overview on the state of the art. Nevertheless, there is potential to focus and shorten this section. The same applies to the Discussion, except for those sections that over-interpret results, see below and detailed comments.</p><p>2) The identification of putative CO<sub>2</sub> receptors and selective silencing via RNAi appears to be performed in a competent way. But other reviewers certainly have more expertise in that area.</p><p>3) Synthetic CO<sub>2</sub> has been applied (carbonated water, enriched air) and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been measured in divergent ways (GC-FID, IR-absorption). This apparently came with extreme SD values, which combined with low replicate numbers cast doubt on the results reported in Figure 2 (functional CO<sub>2</sub> receptor assessment). As far as DvvGr2 is concerned these are compensated by the results reported in Figure 3 showing dose dependent responses to CO<sub>2</sub> in WT but not in DvvGr2-silenced larvae. Unfortunately, this aspect is of limited novelty. Dose dependent responses to CO<sub>2</sub> have been shown in many organisms, see publications referenced by the authors.</p><p>4) The authors do not differentiate between responses to volatile stimuli (in this set up: movement in a gradient) and responses to non-volatile stimuli (in this set up: arrest at the point of stimulus presentation). The experimental protocol does not allow for the diffusion of dissolved non-volatile stimuli. Responses to CO<sub>2</sub> on the one hand and Fe(III)(DIMBOA)3 as well as a sugar blends on the other hand (Figure 2) therefore do not answer the question whether RNAi-silencing impairs attraction to other stimuli than CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the results presented in Figure 4 do overcome this shortcoming in showing that DvvGr2-silenced larvae respond to unknown maize root-derived stimuli. Removing the Fe(III)(DIMBOA)3 as well as the sugar blend experiments from the Results section would therefore be an option.</p><p>5) The conclusion suggesting CO<sub>2</sub> as a long-distance attractant in a soil setting is not covered by the data presented. (i) The exp. reported in Figure 6A shows random movement and/or dispersal of the larvae in the absence of stimuli. (ii) CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations above ambient have been ascertained in the zone adjacent to the maize plants only. (iii) Random movement as ascertained in Figure 6A leads to more frequent encounters of detectable CO<sub>2</sub>-gradients (or other chemical stimuli) in zone 2 the closer to this zone larvae have been released. (iv) Random movement combined with short distance attraction from zone 2 to zone 1 may therefore fully explain the higher proportion of WT compared to DvvGr2-silenced larvae ascertained within zone 1. The same line of arguments applies to the time course experiment (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Thus, all results may be explained by other processes than long distance orientation to CO<sub>2</sub> sources. Furthermore, observed differences between WT and Gr2-silenced larvae may well be due to interactions of CO<sub>2</sub> gradients with other plant derived attractants at any level of sensory processing, since most of zone 2 lies within the range of effective attractiveness of plant volatiles as demonstrated in Figure 5A. However, results presented in Figure 5 can't be fully compared to those from Figure 6, since diffusion dynamics of both CO<sub>2</sub> and other volatiles are different in a one-dimensional closed tube filled with another substrate compared to the open tray.</p><p>6) The conclusion suggesting that WCR larvae performed a choice between plants of different suitability based on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is not supported by the data presented. A choice based on comparative quality assessment implies that two stimuli are compared against each other. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations displayed in Figure 7 and Figure S1 indicate that there was no gradient between the point of release (zone 3) and zone 4 adjacent to the low/medium fertiliser treatment, or ∆CO<sub>2</sub> between zone 3 and zone 4 were in the range of no behavioural response as presented in Figure 3B. In contrast a significant gradient appears when comparing zone 3 and 2. Thus, WT larvae moved upwards the only available CO<sub>2</sub> concentration gradient. This behaviour may have field relevance as high emitters become more prone to being discovered by WCR larvae. However, host quality assessment by the larvae appears a pretty premature conclusion.</p><p>7) The Materials and method section is incomplete in several aspects. Some instruments or providers are not specified. Operating conditions and sampling procedures are not described. No written descriptions are given for the olfactometer variants, the core bioassay device of the study. This extends to the substrate used, or references not providing the info claimed (e.g. GC-FID). Core information required to assess results and conclusions, to enable others to either replicate the study, or to apply the methods to other organisms is lacking.</p><p>Conclusion: Despite the topic being of outstanding interest to the scientific community and the reported results (DvvGr2 is a CO<sub>2</sub> receptor; responses to the gas are dose dependent) meriting publication, the ascertained shortcomings of the manuscript as it currently stands prohibit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study Arce et al., functionally analyze three putative <italic>Diabroticavirgiferavergifera</italic> (WCR) CO<sub>2</sub> receptor genes and use genetically silencing the expression of these genes to assess the role of CO<sub>2</sub> as a cue in insect host finding behavior and host plant quality assessment.

Addressing the effect of carbon dioxide is novel and the approach taken by knocking down the carbon dioxide receptor gene of the insects is elegant. The experiments address different levels of scale and substrate and the data look very interesting. The manuscript is a revision of a previous version and it has greatly improved with more detailed descriptions of the methods and with additional CO<sub>2</sub> measurements and root volatile quantification. This supports the understanding of the experiments carried out.</p><p>2) Although the data look very interesting, my main concern with the current version of the manuscript is the statistical analyses. Data for distributions of larvae over two arms of an olfactometer or five zones in a tray are dependent data and cannot be analyzed by ANOVA. Moreover, in some cases the statistical data in Supplementary file 1 conflict with the statistical data presented in the figures. The statistical analyses should be revised to allow a robust analysis of the data presented.</p><p>Statistics:</p><p>3) Results: why an ANOVA with multiple comparison test? This should be a simple two-sample t-test without multiple comparison test (what multiple comparison would be available anyway?).</p><p>4) Materials and methods: same comment as for above.</p><p>5) Results: the choice data are dependent data (a larva can either choose the treatment or the control) and so an ANOVA is not the right test. Moreover it is unclear why a two-way ANOVA was used followed by post hoc tests: the asterisks only seem to indicate whether the choice for treatment versus control differs from a 50:50 distribution.</p><p>6) Results: The asterisks next to the bars suggest to me that these relate to whether the larvae used for that bar had a distribution over the two odor sources that is significant from 50:50. But, how can this be analysed by a three-way ANOVA? There were three olfactometers, each with 6 larvae and the % larvae to either arm was recorded. So for each bar in the graph there are 3 datapoints of % larvae to CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched versus % of larvae to control (the two %% being dependent data).</p><p>7) Supplementary file 1 does not help me to understand the statistics either: here for Figure 4B the table tells me that for a 3-way ANOVA there is no main effect of Silencing construct (P=0.77; so the bars for the WT and silenced larvae do not differ overall) and not main effect of CO<sub>2</sub> dose (P=1.00; so no overall effect of CO<sub>2</sub> dose on larval behavior, no interaction of Silencing construct with CO<sub>2</sub> dose (P=0.999; so the responses of WT and silenced larvae do no differ for the different CO<sub>2</sub> doses). It is not clear from Supplementary file 1 what &quot;treatment&quot; is; it is not significant as main effect (P=0.25) but there is a significant interaction between Treatment and CO<sub>2</sub> dose (P&lt;0.001, indicating that the responses to CO<sub>2</sub> doses are different from different treatments). The significant 3-way interaction between Silencing construct and treatment and CO<sub>2</sub> dose is unclear to me (and 3-way interactions are difficult to interpret anyway, but it further adds to my confusion about the meaning of Sc and T).</p><p>8) Results: In the rebuttal the authors write &quot; Note that the differences in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations between both sides of the olfactometers are significantly different at each concentration at a p-value&lt;0.001; hence the many asterisks.&quot; which further suggests that a t-test was done for the two CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations per test.</p><p>9) Results: see comment for point 3. Supplementary file 1 further suggests that a t-test was done.</p><p>10) The data in Figure 5C disagree with the data in Supplementary file1: Supplementary file 1 tells that the P value for crawled distance analysis is P=0.635, whereas the figure labels these data with ***, indicating that P&lt;0.001.</p><p>11) Results: same comment as for point 6.</p><p>Here we also conducted GLM with binomial distribution followed by analysis of deviance and by FDR-corrected Least Square Means post hoc tests.

An AOVA is not appropriate to analyse these data. Also the information in Supplementary file 1 does not provide information on the use of a categorical data analysis.

In this study Arce et al. identify among three candidates one molecular receptor for CO<sub>2</sub> perception in larvae of the western corn root worm (WCR). Through a series of behavioural experiments employing the RNAi knockdown technique they demonstrate that this single receptor is both essential and sufficient to mediate behavioural responses to CO<sub>2</sub> in a dose dependent manner from attraction to repellence form low to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, respectively. Further experiments show that, while other root derived stimuli attract WCR larvae on a short range irrespective of the CO<sub>2</sub> receptor being silenced or not, CO<sub>2</sub> unfolds its behavioural activity over longer distances. The authors also demonstrate that maize roots establish CO<sub>2</sub> gradients in the soil with steeper gradients around highly fertilised plants, while WCR larvae grow better when feeding on the latter. By showing that WCR larvae move towards the source in all CO<sub>2</sub> gradients encountered under field-relevant conditions, they discuss an enhanced probability for well-nourished maize plants, which emit more CO<sub>2</sub> compared to plants under a poor fertiliser regime, to be found by one of their major insect herbivores.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The manuscript is very well written and gives an excellent overview on the state of the art as introduction. The combination of molecular techniques and behavioural experiments provides novel and unique insights into the orientation of a root feeding insect below ground and the role of CO<sub>2</sub> as an important cue in host location over long distances compared to other root-derived volatiles. By using the RNAi technique the authors reliably demonstrate that the targeted CO<sub>2</sub> receptor is not required for the insect to respond to other cues, be they volatile or soluble compounds like sugars. The multitude of experimental techniques is well documented. The Discussion highlights as a striking difference to other species that a single molecular receptor mediates the full range of behavioural responses to CO<sub>2</sub>. It also carefully addresses different aspects and stages of host location from random walk with no available cue to upward orientation within a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient at longer distances while other root-derived volatiles gain behavioural relevance at shorter distances even whit a silenced CO<sub>2</sub> receptor. In summary these results are noteworthy with respect to the notorious difficulties of assessing insect behaviour below ground.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>By applying a number of different behavioural experiments including volatile and non-volatile stimuli in settings with and without substrate the authors have to some extend limited the informative value of their otherwise excellent and comprehensive work. Responses to volatile and non-volatile stimuli not only involve different sensory modalities, but also different physical processes below ground. While volatile stimuli may – depending on their valence – serve as attractants or repellents, non-volatile stimuli, which are applied at a single point in an arena with no established concentration gradient, may only arrest insects upon contact. Consequently, the latter stimuli contribute little if anything to the authors quest of understanding how host plants are not only located but also assessed from a distance through sensing of CO<sub>2</sub> and interacting volatile stimuli. This interaction aspect is of special interest since, as stressed by the authors themselves, CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted by almost every respiring soil organism and therefore a cue of limited reliability.</p><p>Abstract – please reword to: „…is specifically required for dose-dependent responses.… but silencing does not impair responses to other cues, search behaviour or motility&quot;.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript has an interesting topic, presenting a study on the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the behavior of a root-feeding insect, larvae of the western corn rootworm. Despite ample research on the chemical cues used by herbivorous insects in finding their host plant, the role of CO<sub>2</sub> has generally been overlooked and this study addresses this knowledge gap. The data presented show that (1) in a 9 cm olfactometer the larvae are attracted to CO<sub>2</sub> generated by carbonated water and that larvae silenced in one of the carbon dioxide receptor genes are no longer attracted. The behavior to three other compounds was not affected by the RNAi treatment; (2) the response to CO<sub>2</sub> in the 9 cm olfactometer is CO<sub>2</sub> – dose dependent, (3) silencing the receptor does not affect overall motility, but only behavioral responses to CO<sub>2</sub>. (4) in a 9cm olfactometer the larvae orient towards volatiles from roots of a maize seedling and this is similar for WT and silenced larvae in the presence and absence of soda lime as a CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber, however at 18 cm only WT larvae in the absence of the scrubber oriented towards the root volatiles. (5) in a tray assay the larvae appear to find the roots of plants more frequently with shorter distance from the roots and more orient towards high-fertilization treatment of plants than to low-fertilizatipn treatment. The authors conclude that CO<sub>2</sub> produced by maize roots is an important attractant for WCR larvae.</p><p>The fact that the study involves wildtype and RNAi silenced WCR larvae makes this a very interesting and innovative study and the outcome that CO<sub>2</sub> is important for an insect herbivore in host-plant selection is new. Although I am impressed by the behavioral data presented for wildtype and silenced WCR larvae I have several important issues with the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive opinion on our study and also for all the constructive comments and suggestions, which we have addressed in the new version of our manuscript as indicated below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Throughout the manuscript and in the title the authors conclude that the phenomena described can be ascribe to plant-derived CO<sub>2</sub> – however there is no evidence for this at all. As mentioned in the Introduction, CO<sub>2</sub> is a ubiquitous compound produced by almost all forms of life. The soil and especially the rhizosphere have abundant numbers of microbes that all produce CO<sub>2</sub>. The microbes in the rhizosphere occur in much higher densities than in the bulk soil as they are recruited by the roots. Thus microbial CO<sub>2</sub> is also more abundant in the rhizosphere and this may be an important part of the explanation for the observed behavior. Thus, conclusion that the roots are the producer of the CO<sub>2</sub> that attracts the WCR larvae (e.g. Results and also many other locations) cannot be drawn on the basis of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right to point out that many different organisms produce CO<sub>2</sub>, including roots themselves, root-associated microbes as well as free-living soil microbes. To evaluate the contribution of the roots and their microbiome to CO<sub>2</sub> gradients in the soil, we now measured CO<sub>2</sub> at different distances from maize plants before and after removing the seedlings from the soil (new Figure 1). We observe a strong CO<sub>2</sub> gradient from the roots extending up to 32 cm into the soil. This gradient disappears rapidly when the plants are removed, and the difference can be fully explained by the CO<sub>2</sub> that is released by washed roots. Thus, the presence of plants is tightly associated with higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels in time and space, and can thus serve as a foraging cue for root-feeding insects. Note that we presently cannot distinguish between CO<sub>2</sub> from root and root-associated microbial respiration. This question is beyond the scope of our study and not directly relevant to our research question, as the exact source of the CO<sub>2</sub> does not matter for a root herbivore during long-distance host location. We now refer to “plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub>” in the manuscript title and throughout the text and mention that the CO<sub>2</sub> is likely coming from both plant and microbial respiration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statistics in Figure 3 cannot be correct and the asterisks seem to derive from a copy and paste process.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Two statistical analyses were conducted in this case. The first one to compare the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on each side of the olfactometers, and the second one to compare insect preferences. The asterisks indicating significant differences were placed next to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration values and next to the larval choice values, respectively. We modified the figure and mention this aspect in the figure legend. Note that the differences in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations between both sides of the olfactometers are significantly different at each concentration at a p-value&lt;0.001; hence the many asterisks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The fertilizer experiment lacks a proper control. Fertilization enhances nutrients in the soil and not only the plant but also the soil microbiome can exploit this nutrient source. As a consequence the effect of fertilizer may have been caused by enhanced activity and/or numbers of soil microbes producing higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. A control experiment using fertilizer in the absence of plants is needed to assess the effects of fertilizer on non-plant factors in the soil. Now the conclusion that fertilizer enhances CO<sub>2</sub> production by plant roots is premature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this aspect. As described in the methods section, we first grew plants under different fertilization regimes. We then unearthed, washed, and replanted the plants into new soil trays with equal nutrient levels to avoid direct effects of the fertilizer treatment. Our setup allows for the conclusion that the higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are due to the effects of the fertilizer on the plant (and possibly its associated microbiome) rather than on the soil. We now clarify this in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Materials and methods section needs to become more informative. For instance, the method of CO<sub>2</sub> quantification, a crucial element of the study is unclear: Subsection “Belowground olfactometer experiments with DvvGr1-, 462 DvvGr2-, DvvGr3-silenced WCR larvae“ states that this was done through GC-FID (really?) but does not tell at all how this was done. How was air sampled and transferred to the GC? This needs to be elaborated in detail as it is not straightforward. In the section on host location experiments two methods are mentioned for assessing CO<sub>2</sub> levels: the use of a gas analyzer and the use of GC-FID but it is neither clear why two methods were used, nor how the air was sampled, nor which data derive from one or the other method. In the olfactometer, larval positions were recorded 1hour after release but how this was done is not clear. Neither is it clear to me whether in the 9 cm olfactometer the larvae can move over the full 9 cm or not. Same for the 18cm olfactometer. Insect behavior was observed for three minutes but it remains unclear how this was done. Same for how the trajectories were followed. Also it is not clear how the crawled distances were measured with ImageJ: were the paths filmed? The volatile-permeable root barrier (Results) has not been described in the Materials and methods section. These examples are non-exhaustive but rather an indicator that the Materials and methods section needs major improvement to allow others to repeat the experiments and to allow valuable evaluation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Reviewer # 2 also agrees that we fall short in describing some of our experimental approaches. We have reworked the Materials and methods section entirely and explain our experimental approaches in much more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) WCR larvae are soil dwelling and make their behavioral choices in the darkness in the soil. The behavioral assays have been done in Petri dishes and in olfactometers and in both cases the arena where the larvae were released does not seem to contain soil. At least, the picture in Figure 5B suggests that the middle part of the olfactometer where the larvae are introduced is empty. Were these bioassays carried out in the light or in darkness and if in darkness, how were the behavioral parameters quantified (Materials and methods)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. Behavioral experiments in Petri plates and olfactometers that did not involve plants were conducted in a dark room. As insects are insensitive to red light, red light headlamps were used to evaluate larval behavior. Experiments with olfactometers that involved plants were covered with aluminium to reduce light disturbance to the insects. This aspect is now included in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The use of soda lime to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the olfactometer setup is an interesting one, but raises the question what the effect is on other volatiles. If CO<sub>2</sub> levels were assessed through GC-FID such samples could also be used for GC-MS to assess the quantitative and qualitative effects of soda lime on other components of the volatile blend. The data in Figure 5B show that with a soda lime filter neither wildtype larvae nor silenced larvae move towards the volatiles from maize roots. The authors draw the conclusion that CO<sub>2</sub> is needed for attraction to the roots, but an alternative explanation is that the soda lime also reduced the levels of other root volatiles with as consequence reduction below the level that leads to attraction at 18 cm distance. To assess which conclusion is best supporting the data the first step should be to analyze the volatiles with the method used already to assess CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this aspect. We think it is important to consider this experiment in its entirety, including the short arm olfactometers. What we find with the short arm olfactometers is that the larvae are attracted to plant volatiles independently of their capacity to perceive CO<sub>2</sub> or the presence of soda lime. Thus, there must be attractive root volatiles other than CO<sub>2</sub> that diffuse into the olfactometer, independently of the presence of soda lime. To further validate the use of the soda lime, we now measured its impact of root volatile diffusion in a separate experiment, as suggested by the reviewer. For this, we transplanted maize seedlings into sand-filled spherical glass pots, delivered pure and humified air through the pots via an inlet port, and pulled it out through an additional port, in the opposite side, that was outfitted or not with soda lime. Root volatiles were trapped on Porapak filters. Note that maize roots release volatiles at extremely low levels, which make them hard to trap and detect in vivo. Therefore, we stimulated volatile release by wounding the roots of the seedlings prior to the experiment. Typical chromatograms are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, and relative quantifications of detected maize root volatiles are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2B. As expected, we do not observe any measurable impact of soda lime on root volatiles other than CO<sub>2</sub>. Taken together, these experiments provide strong experimental support for the hypothesis that CO<sub>2</sub> is required for host attraction at longer distances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>How insects (pests) locate host plants below ground is a highly relevant topic.

We gather that the reviewer is satisfied with the evidence we present for the involvement of <italic>DvvGr2</italic> in dose-dependent CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness. We agree that such responses have been shown in other systems. However, these experiments are necessary to set the stage for the following experiments which explore the impact of plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> on host attraction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a molecular manipulative approach is used to assess the role of plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> in plant-herbivore interactions as well as root-environment interactions in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors do not differentiate between responses to volatile stimuli (in this set up: movement in a gradient) and responses to non-volatile stimuli (in this set up: arrest at the point of stimulus presentation). The experimental protocol does not allow for the diffusion of dissolved non-volatile stimuli. Responses to CO<sub>2</sub> on the one hand and Fe(III)(DIMBOA)3 as well as a sugar blends on the other hand (Figure 2) therefore do not answer the question whether RNAi-silencing impairs attraction to other stimuli than CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the results presented in Figure 4 do overcome this shortcoming in showing that DvvGr2-silenced larvae respond to unknown maize root-derived stimuli. Removing the Fe(III)(DIMBOA)3 as well as the sugar blend experiments from the Results section would therefore be an option.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The choice experiments using Fe(III)(DIMBOA)<sub>3</sub> and sugars allow us to test whether silencing <italic>DvvGr2</italic> impacts WCR responses to these non-volatile cues, and to certain extent to test for the additional impacts of <italic>DvvGr2</italic> on host location behavior, which is important, as pointed out by the reviewer, to interpret some of our results. We would therefore prefer to keep these datasets in the manuscript unless there are space constraints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The conclusion suggesting CO<sub>2</sub> as a long distance attractant in a soil setting is not covered by the data presented. (i) The exp. reported in Figure 6A shows random movement and/or dispersal of the larvae in the absence of stimuli. (ii) CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations above ambient have been ascertained in the zone adjacent to the maize plants only. (iii) Random movement as ascertained in Figure 6A leads to more frequent encounters of detectable CO<sub>2</sub>-gradients (or other chemical stimuli) in zone 2 the closer to this zone larvae have been released. (iv) Random movement combined with short distance attraction from zone 2 to zone 1 may therefore fully explain the higher proportion of WT compared to DvvGr2-silenced larvae ascertained within zone 1. The same line of arguments applies to the time course experiment (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Thus, all results may be explained by other processes than long distance orientation to CO<sub>2</sub> sources.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for raising this important point. The clearest evidence for CO<sub>2</sub> acting as a long-range host attractant comes from the olfactometer experiments, where we can clearly show that CO<sub>2</sub> is important for attraction 18 cm away from the plant, but not 9 cm away from the plant. In this case, random movement does not explain the observed patterns, as the CO<sub>2</sub> gradient extends to the release point of the olfactometers, and larvae typically make a choice immediately and then stay in the arm they decide to move into.</p><p>As the reviewer points out, random movement may indeed play a role in the soil arenas, with larvae moving randomly until they detect a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient, and then moving up the gradient in a <italic>DvvGr2</italic>dependent manner. To gain further insight into this possibility, we conducted detailed CO<sub>2</sub> measurements to determine the distribution of plant-associated CO<sub>2</sub> in the soil at higher resolution (11 instead of 5 zones; new Figure 1). We see a gradient up to 32 cm away from the plant, after which CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations level off and become statistically indistinguishable from CO<sub>2</sub> levels of soil without plants. Thus, larvae released in zone 3 (the middle of the trays) and zone 2 (closer to the plants) will have a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient available for host location. Larvae released in zone 4 and 5 likely need to move randomly first before coming across a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient, even though we cannot exclude that they may also encounter localized CO<sub>2</sub> gradients in these zones when encountering preferential gas-phase pathways. We now interpret our experiments in the light of these findings. Importantly, the data presented in Figure 7E-F and Figure 8 can be explained without the need for random larval movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, observed differences between WT and Gr2-silenced larvae may well be due to interactions of CO<sub>2</sub> gradients with other plant derived attractants at any level of sensory processing, since most of zone 2 lies within the range of effective attractiveness of plant volatiles as demonstrated in Figure 5A. However, results presented in Figure 5 can't be fully compared to those from Figure 6, since diffusion dynamics of both CO<sub>2</sub> and other volatiles are different in a one-dimensional closed tube filled with another substrate compared to the open tray.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we have performed several experiments that show that <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silencing does not impair sensory processing of other plant-derived behavioral cues. (1) The attractiveness of sugars and benzoxazinoids is unaffected by <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silencing. (2) The repellent effect of the volatile methyl anthranilate is unaffected by <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silencing. (3) The attraction of the western corn rootworm larvae to volatile blends in the absence of a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient is unaffected by <italic>DvvGr2</italic>-silencing at a distance of &lt;9 cm. We believe that these results provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that DvvGr2 modulates responses to other attractants.</p><p>Second, while the argument about other volatiles interacting with CO<sub>2</sub> in a DvvGr2-specific manner cannot be fully excluded for short distances (Zone 2), it can be excluded for long distances, (Zone 3 and beyond). Therefore, we are confident that we are measuring true effects of CO<sub>2</sub>-mediated host location whenever releasing larvae further away from the plant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The conclusion suggesting that WCR larvae performed a choice between plants of different suitability based on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is not supported by the data presented. A choice based on comparative quality assessment implies that two stimuli are compared against each other. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations displayed in Figure 7 and Figure S1 indicate that there was no gradient between the point of release (zone 3) and zone 4 adjacent to the low/medium fertiliser treatment, or ∆CO<sub>2</sub> between zone 3 and zone 4 were in the range of no behavioural response as presented in Figure 3B. In contrast a significant gradient appears when comparing zone 3 and 2. Thus, WT larvae moved upwards the only available CO<sub>2</sub> concentration gradient. This behaviour may have field relevance as high emitters become more prone to being discovered by WCR larvae. However, host quality assessment by the larvae appears a pretty premature conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. What we show is that WCR larvae prefer well-fertilized plants, and that WCR grow better on those plants. We also show higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels around well-fertilized plants, and that CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive WCR larvae do not show any preference for differentially fertilized plants. We can therefore conclude that CO<sub>2</sub> detection is important for WCR to locate well-fertilized plants. However, our setup is at this point not sufficient to conclude that this behaviour is due to host-quality assessment. We have toned down our conclusions accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Materials and method section is incomplete in several aspects. Some instruments or providers are not specified. Operating conditions and sampling procedures are not described. No written descriptions are given for the olfactometer variants, the core bioassay device of the study. This extends to the substrate used, or references not providing the info claimed (e.g. GC-FID).

In this new version, we address all the concerns and include all the suggestions made by the reviewers as detailed in their comments below.

Addressing the effect of carbon dioxide is novel and the approach taken by knocking down the carbon dioxide receptor gene of the insects is elegant. The experiments address different levels of scale and substrate and the data look very interesting.

Data for distributions of larvae over two arms of an olfactometer or five zones in a tray are dependent data and cannot be analyzed by ANOVA.

The statistical analyses should be revised to allow a robust analysis of the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Unfortunately, in some instances, we failed to properly describe the statistical tests we conducted and to accurately introduce this information in Supplementary file1.

In essence, we had evaluated the distribution of larvae by Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with binomial distribution followed by analysis of deviance and by FDR-corrected Least Square Means post hoc tests.

Actually, we had analysed the data by Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with binomial distribution followed by analysis of deviance and by FDR-corrected Least Square Means post hoc tests.

It is not clear from Supplementary file 1 what &quot;treatment&quot; is; it is not significant as main effect (P=0.25) but there is a significant interaction between Treatment and CO<sub>2</sub> dose (P&lt;0.001, indicating that the responses to CO<sub>2</sub> doses are different from different treatments). The significant 3-way interaction between Silencing construct and treatment and CO<sub>2</sub> dose is unclear to me (and 3-way interactions are difficult to interpret anyway, but it further adds to my confusion about the meaning of Sc and T).</p></disp-quote><p>“Treatment” in this case means the olfactometer side where the larvae were recovered (either control, or CO<sub>2</sub> enriched side).

The combination of molecular techniques and behavioural experiments provides novel and unique insights into the orientation of a root feeding insect below ground and the role of CO<sub>2</sub> as an important cue in host location over long distances compared to other root-derived volatiles. By using the RNAi technique the authors reliably demonstrate that the targeted CO<sub>2</sub> receptor is not required for the insect to respond to other cues, be they volatile or soluble compounds like sugars. The multitude of experimental techniques is well documented. The Discussion highlights as a striking difference to other species that a single molecular receptor mediates the full range of behavioural responses to CO<sub>2</sub>. It also carefully addresses different aspects and stages of host location from random walk with no available cue to upward orientation within a CO<sub>2</sub> gradient at longer distances while other root-derived volatiles gain behavioural relevance at shorter distances even whit a silenced CO<sub>2</sub> receptor. In summary these results are noteworthy with respect to the notorious difficulties of assessing insect behaviour below ground.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive impression of our study and for highlighting its different strengths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses</p><p>By applying a number of different behavioural experiments including volatile and non-volatile stimuli in settings with and without substrate the authors have to some extend limited the informative value of their otherwise excellent and comprehensive work. Responses to volatile and non-volatile stimuli not only involve different sensory modalities, but also different physical processes below ground. While volatile stimuli may – depending on their valence – serve as attractants or repellents, non-volatile stimuli, which are applied at a single point in an arena with no established concentration gradient, may only arrest insects upon contact. Consequently, the latter stimuli contribute little if anything to the authors quest of understanding how host plants are not only located but also assessed from a distance through sensing of CO<sub>2</sub> and interacting volatile stimuli. This interaction aspect is of special interest since, as stressed by the authors themselves, CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted by almost every respiring soil organism and therefore a cue of limited reliability.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right to point out that non-volatile compounds such as sugars or Fe(III)(DIMBOA)<sub>3</sub> are likely less relevant for host location at long distances.
