presynaptic terminals. However, the intricate mechanisms governing these processes have remained elusive due to the presence of multiple functional domains within Munc13, each playing distinct roles in neurotransmitter release. Here, we report a coordinated mechanism in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Munc13 homolog UNC-13 that controls the functional switch of UNC-13 during synaptic transmission. Mutations disrupting the interactions of C1 and C2B with diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) on the plasma membrane induced the gain-of-function state of UNC-13L, the long UNC-13 isoform, resulting in enhanced SV release. Concurrent mutations in both domains counteracted this enhancement, highlighting the functional interdependence of C1 and C2B. Intriguingly, the individual C1 and C2B domains exhibited significantly stronger facilitation of SV release compared to the presence of both domains, supporting a mutual inhibition of C1 and C2B under basal conditions. Moreover, the N-terminal C2A and X domains exhibited opposite regulation on the functional switch of UNC-13L. Furthermore, we identified the polybasic motif in the C2B domain that facilitates SV release. Finally, we found that disruption of C1 and C2B membrane interaction in UNC-13S, the short isoform, leads to functional switch between gain-of-function and loss-of-function. Collectively, our findings provide a novel mechanism for SV exocytosis wherein UNC-13 undergoes functional switches through the coordination of its major domains, thereby regulating synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>UNC-13</kwd><kwd>Munc13</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1122351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56NS128048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007567</institution-id><institution>City University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9610647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mechanistic mechanism in UNC-13/Munc13 regulates synaptic neurotransmitter release at the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapses exhibit many types of short-term, use-dependent synaptic plasticity which are thought to underlie learning and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fioravante and Regehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Regehr, 2012</xref>). The regulatory mechanisms of synaptic plasticity involve the functional diversity of the key synaptic proteins in synaptic vesicle (SV) release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jahn and Südhof, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Südhof and Rizo, 2011</xref>). Exocytosis of SVs releases neurotransmitters to transfer neuronal signals, and this membrane fusion process is controlled by an exquisite release machinery, consisting of the core SNARE complexes including SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin, and SNARE-interacting proteins such as Munc13, complexin, and Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jahn and Südhof, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Südhof and Rizo, 2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that many synaptic proteins in the release machinery contain multiple functional domains playing different roles in regulating SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nishiki and Augustine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xue et al., 2009</xref>). Deciphering how synaptic proteins integrate their domain functions to control synaptic strength is thus crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The multi-domain protein Munc13 serves as a key regulator of SV priming and exocytosis in the mammalian central synapses. Genetic knockout of Munc13, or its invertebrate homolog UNC-13, eliminates nearly all neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>). Recent investigations into Munc13 and its <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> homolog UNC-13 have elucidated the functions of individual domains and their binding partner in SV release. In Munc13-1, the most important Munc13 isoform in the mouse hippocampal synapses, the N-terminal C2A domain binds to the active zone protein RIM, releasing Munc13-1 from an autoinhibitory homodimerization and promoting SV priming and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). The C1 and the C2B domains, binding to diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) on the plasma membrane, are implicated in facilitating SV release and boosting synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). The C-terminal region, including the C2C domain, was found to interact with the SV membrane to trigger SV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Padmanarayana et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the biochemical characteristics and the functional analysis of the domains in Munc13 support a bridge model in which Munc13 connects SVs and the plasma membrane to trigger membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release. Indeed, recent cryo-EM crystal structure analysis of the Munc13 core sequence has provided direct evidence supporting this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grushin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). This arrangement of Munc13 is believed to expose the central MUN domain to bind to the SNARE complexes and initiate the SNARE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Given the functional diversity of the multiple domains in Munc13, their coordination and integration likely encompass key mechanisms of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The cryo-EM crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grushin et al., 2022</xref>) has highlighted the crucial role of C1 and C2B membrane interaction in supporting the Munc13 bridge and facilitating SV exocytosis. However, our previous studies showed that deletion of either C1 or C2B in <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-13 significantly enhanced SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>). The results were mimicked by the HK mutation (histidine to lysine) in C1 that disrupts the DAG binding of C1 and by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding mutations in C2B (aspartate to asparagine, also referred to as DN mutations) which disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PIP<sub>2</sub> binding of C2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>). It has been postulated that the HK mutation in Munc13-1 (H567K) lowers the energy barrier of SV exocytosis, thereby enhancing the probability of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, evidence from both invertebrates and vertebrates supports the notion that disrupting the membrane interaction of C1 and C2B turns Munc13/UNC-13 into a gain-of-function state. Autoinhibition models have been proposed to explain the enhanced SV release induced by C1 and C2B disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>). According to this model, under basal conditions, C1 and C2B adopt autoinhibitory conformations which prevent them from binding to the plasma membrane. The elevated levels of DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> on the membrane alleviate the autoinhibition of C1 and C2B, enabling them to bind the membrane and enhance SV release.</p><p>Despite the previous findings, the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory roles of C1 and C2B as well as their disinhibition to enhance synaptic transmission remain unclear, as does the modulation of their functions by other domains within Munc13/UNC-13. Here, we showed that the HK and DN mutations in C1 and C2B converted UNC-13 into a gain-of-function state, leading to increased SV release. Whereas the concurrent mutations of HK and DN eliminated the increase of SV release, reverting UNC-13 to its basal physiological state. This indicates that C1 and C2B are functionally dependent and supports a mutual inhibition model in which C1 and C2B inhibit each other under basal conditions. Disrupting the membrane interaction of either domain releases the other, allowing it to bind to the membrane to enhance release. This model was supported by the fact that individual C1 or C2B domains remarkably enhanced synaptic transmission. In addition, we found that the N-terminal C2A and X domains in UNC-13 differentially regulate C1 and C2B functions. The effects of HK and DN mutations were significantly strengthened by the absence of C2A but were eliminated by the absence of X, indicating distinct roles for C2A and X during the functional switch of UNC-13 between basal physiological state and gain-of-function state. Furthermore, we found that the polybasic motif of C2B plays a critical role in SV release. Finally, we showed that the domain coordination in the short UNC-13 isoform controls the protein switch between the gain-of-function state and the loss-of-function state. Together, our results revealed novel coordinated mechanisms by which the major domains in UNC-13 regulate SV release, providing significant insight into synaptic transmission and plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disrupting the membrane interaction of C1 and C2B turns UNC-13 into gain-of-function state</title><p>Previous biochemical and structural studies have established C1 and C2B as the primary domains in Munc13 that mediate interaction with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kazanietz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, there are two UNC-13 isoforms, a long isoform called UNC-13L and a short isoform known as UNC-13S (also called UNC-13MR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Both C1 and C2B in <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-13, rat Munc13, and fly UNC-13 are highly conserved, including the residues that mediate their DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To delineate the contribution of their membrane interaction to SV release, we introduced the HK and DN mutations into the <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-13. The UNC-13L constructs carrying the HK or DN mutations were expressed in the nervous system (under the <italic>snb-1</italic> promoter) of the <italic>unc-13</italic> null mutants (<italic>s69</italic>) to assess the rescue of SV release.

Measurement of SV release at the NMJ synapses was conducted through electrophysiological recordings of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs, commonly referred to as minis or spontaneous release) and electric stimulus-evoked EPSCs. Note that evoked EPSCs were recorded under 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition, while mEPSCs and mIPSCs were recorded under both 0 mM and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions. Our previous studies have indicated that certain <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants display more pronounced defects in spontaneous release under conditions of either absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or low Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Concurrent HK and DN mutations eliminate the enhancement of synaptic vesicle (SV) release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the C1 and C2B domains between the worm UNC-13L, the rat Munc13-1, and the fly UNC-13A.

Thus, our results corroborate earlier findings in Munc13-1 and demonstrate the functional conservation of the C1 and C2B domains across species and synaptic types. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that disrupting the membrane interaction of C1 and C2B turns UNC-13 into the gain-of-function state which triggers neurotransmitter release at an elevated level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Concurrent HK and DN mutations eliminate the enhancement of SV release in UNC-13L</title><p>The increased SV release in animals expressing L<sup>HK</sup> and L<sup>D1-5N</sup> raised the question about the mechanism underlying the gain-of-function of UNC-13. To address this question, we performed a screen in UNC-13L to examine the functional involvement of other major domains in the L<sup>HK</sup> and the L<sup>D1-5N</sup> context. Remarkably, we found that the effects of the HK and DN mutations were entirely abolished by the concurrent mutations in UNC-13L (L<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup>). SV release in animals rescued with L<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup> is akin to those in the UNC-13L rescued animals, with no significant differences observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–I</xref>). Our results thus revealed the intriguing dependence of the HK-induced enhancement in SV release on C2B binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub>, while the DN-induced enhancement in SV release requires the interaction of C1 and DAG.</p><p>To determine whether the changes of SV release by mutated UNC-13L are attributed to the expression level of UNC-13 proteins, we generated fusion proteins of wild-type and mutated UNC-13L tagged with mApple (UNC-13L::mApple, L<sup>HK</sup>::mApple, L<sup>D1-5N</sup>::mApple, and L<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup>::mApple, all were driven by the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter) and examined their abundance in the nervous system. Our results showed that the HK, DN, and HK+DN mutations did not alter the expression level of UNC-13, with the fluorescence intensity being indistinguishable from all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). These results indicate that SV release changes induced by HK and DN mutations resulted from functional defects of C1 and C2B. The localization of UNC-13 proteins at synapses was also examined by analyzing the colocalization with the active zone marker UNC-10::GFP (<italic>unc-10</italic> encodes the mammalian RIM). Our results showed that all UNC-13 proteins, including wild-type and mutated UNC-13L (all tagged with mApple), exhibited a well colocalization with UNC-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), demonstrating that the HK and DN mutations do not alter the synaptic localization of UNC-13.</p><p>We further confirmed the above observation by examining SV release in UNC-13L carrying concurrent mutations of HK and D3,4N.

Thus, our findings support the notion of functional interdependence between C1 and C2B domains in boosting SV release.</p><p>The above results indicate that disrupting the membrane interaction of C1 and C2B simultaneously restores UNC-13 to its basal physiological state, implying that under the basal conditions, neither C1 nor C2B can effectively interact with the plasma membrane. Prior studies have proposed that C1 inhibits the MUN domain activity by an intramolecular interaction with the Munc13 C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>), and that binding of C1 to DAG relieves this inhibition on the MUN domain. This relief of inhibition likely arises from a conformational change in C1 following DAG binding. However, our results provide an alternative interpretation, suggesting that C1 and C2B mutually inhibit each other in the basal state. The HK or DN mutations induce conformational changes in either C1 or C2B, thereby releasing the inhibition on the other domain, allowing it to bind to the membrane and trigger release. This mutual inhibition model also explains why simultaneous HK and DN mutations eliminate the enhancement of SV release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The N-terminus regulates the functions of C1 and C2B</title><p>The above results support the notion that the HK and DN mutations induce a functional switch of UNC-13 between basal physiological and gain-of-function states.

These results align with previous observations indicating that C1 and C2B act in concert to control SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>).

These findings suggest that the C2B domain possesses additional functions that stimulate the spontaneous release and part of the evoked release, as indicated by the larger remaining evoked EPSCs in C2B<sup>D1-5N</sup>linker3MUNC2C animals compared to MUNC2C animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mutual inhibition between C1 and C2B requires the linker regions</title><p>In UNC-13L and UNC-13R, the arrangement of C1, C2B, and MUN is mediated by several linkers (referred to as linker1, linker2, and linker3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To elucidate how C1 and C2B establish mutual inhibition, we generated a chimeric protein, C1C2BMUNC2C, devoid of the linkers. If C1 and C2B contribute to exert inhibitory effects on each other, we would anticipate a reduction in SV release comparable to MUNC2C levels in animals expressing C1C2BMUNC2C. However, our findings showed that the evoked EPSCs mediated by C1C2BMUNC2C were similar to those mediated by C1MUNC2C and C2BMUNC2C, and are significantly higher than those in UNC-13R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

Several possibilities may account for these unexpected results. First, it is conceivable that the C2B domain carrying polybasic mutations may still function in UNC-13L through its ability to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub>. However, this scenario seems unlikely given that the two operational modes of C2B did not demonstrate functional redundancy in C2Blinker3MUNC2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Second, the effects of the polybasic mutations in UNC-13L might be compensated by other domains such as C1. The compensation mechanism could maintain SV release at a normal level but not a higher level as observed in the DN mutations. We observed pronounced effects of the polybasic mutations in C2Blinker3MUNC2C, suggesting the absence of such a compensation mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Disrupting C1 and C2B membrane interaction simultaneously inactivates UNC-13S</title><p>In addition to UNC-13L, the short isoform UNC-13S also plays a pivotal role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons regulating synaptic transmission.

These findings contribute novel insights into the intricate coordination of UNC-13’s multiple functional domains and their impact on synaptic function. First, we elucidated a mutual inhibition mechanism between the C1 and C2B domains of UNC-13, highlighting their pivotal roles in the regulation of basal synaptic transmission under physiological conditions. Disrupting the membrane interaction of either domain led to a gain-of-function state, enhancing SV release. Whereas the concurrent mutations in both domains abolished the enhancement of SV release, restoring UNC-13 to the basal physiological state. Second, we validated the mutual inhibition model by isolating individual C1 and C2B domains, demonstrating that each domain alone promotes SV release at a significantly higher level than the presence of both domains, indicating that either C1 or C2B acts in the gain-of-function state without the inhibition from the other. Third, we revealed the involvement of the N-terminal C2A and X domains in the functional switch of UNC-13 induced by disruption of C1 and C2B membrane interaction. Specifically, the C2A domain inhibits UNC-13 from converting to the gain-of-function state and also promotes its restoration to the basal physiological state. The X domain, however, promotes the transition of UNC-13 to the gain-of-function state. Fourth, we uncovered the multifaceted role of the C2B domain in triggering SV release, including its interaction with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub> and its regulation through the polybasic motif, which likely mediates the plasma membrane interaction. Fifth, we demonstrated how domain coordination in the short UNC-13 isoform controls the protein switch between gain-of-function and loss-of-function states, offering insights into isoform-specific regulatory mechanisms. Overall, these findings revealed previously unknown mechanisms underlying UNC-13-mediated synaptic transmission regulation, and provided significant contributions to our understanding of synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mutual inhibition between C1 and C2B in the basal physiological state</title><p>Previous studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates have established the inhibitory roles of C1 and C2B within mammalian Munc13 and worm UNC-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, while treatment with phorbol ester, an analog of DAG, remarkably enhances SV release, the HK mutation, which disrupts C1 binding to DAG and phorbol ester, also leads to a comparable increase in SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lou et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that the HK mutation mimics C1 activation. A proposed disinhibition model posits that the C1 domain, when bound to the Munc13 C terminus, inhibits the catalytic MUN domain. However, binding of C1 to DAG or phorbol ester leads to a conformational change of C1, thereby disinhibiting the MUN domain and enhancing release. Recent studies in the worm UNC-13 showed that deleting C2B or mutating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites in loop 3 of C2B also enhanced SV release, revealing the inhibitory function of the C2B domain in UNC-13. Moreover, C1 and C2B appear to act in concert inhibiting SV release, with the elevation in DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup> relieving this inhibition, thereby enhancing SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our findings contribute significantly to the existing autoinhibition models of C1 and C2B and support a mutual inhibition model between C1 and C2B, thereby advancing our understanding of how membrane binding mutations lead to a gain-of-function state of UNC-13. Through a screen investigating the functional involvement of other domains in the UNC-13L gain-of-function, we discovered interesting observations. Specifically, concurrent HK and DN mutations in C1 and C2B abolished the enhancement in SV release, providing evidence that C1 and C2B mutually inhibit each other. Moreover, SV release levels in L<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup> and R<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup> animals were restored to those in UNC-13L and UNC-13R, indicating that C1 and C2B may not contribute to basal synaptic transmission. Instead, they form an inhibitory unit that controls baseline transmission at an acceptable level, which could optimize synaptic function by stabilizing the size of the primed vesicle pool.</p><p>The recent cryo-EM structure of C1C2BMUNC2C has provided insights into the functional importance of C1 and C2B, revealing that these two domains pack at the N-terminal end of the MUN and interact with the membrane, supporting the Munc13 bridge. While it has been widely believed that the membrane interactions of C1 and C2B are crucial for promoting SV release, direct evidence supporting their facilitatory roles has been lacking, mainly due to the mutations that disrupt C1 and C2B membrane interaction or C1 and C2B deletion increase SV release by enhancing the probability of neurotransmitter release. Our findings with C1MUNC2C and C2Blinker3MUNC2C provide novel evidence of the facilitatory roles of C1 and C2B in promoting SV release. Additionally, the HK and DN mutations in these chimeric proteins disrupted the domain function and decreased SV release, contrasting the observations in UNC-13L, UNC-13R, and UNC-13S. Notably, our results suggest that individual C1 and C2B domains within the chimeric proteins act in the gain-of-function state, as evidenced by higher SV release levels compared to UNC-13R. The decreased SV release caused by the HK and DN mutations in these chimeric proteins demonstrates that C1 and C2B promote SV release through their direct interaction with DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the long-lasting question of how C1 and C2B in Munc13/UNC-13 trigger SV release.</p><p>How do C1 and C2B inhibit each other under the basal conditions? Structure analysis has shown that the C1C2BMUNC2C fragment of Munc13 exhibits a rigid arc-like rod shape with limited flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). In this configuration, the DAG-binding region of the C1 domain and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding region of the C2B domain are positioned near each other with the same orientation. This arrangement is expected to facilitate cooperation between C1 and C2B in their membrane binding. Moreover, cryo-EM studies have reported two conformations of C1C2BMUNC2C, open and closed, differing mainly in the orientation of the MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grushin et al., 2022</xref>). In the closed conformation, the MUN domain is titled, and both C1 and C2B interact with the membrane, allowing SVs to be positioned close to the membrane in a primed, ready-to-release state. Since the cyro-EM experiments were conducted without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grushin et al., 2022</xref>), it is possible that C1 and C2B can naturally form membrane-attached orientation in the SV supply chain and reach a stabilized state which represents the basal physiological state. Although direct physical interaction between C1 and C2B is not identified in structural analysis, extensive interdomain contacts, including those involving C1 and C2B, as well as C2B and MUN, have been indicated in Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). These findings may support the structural basis for the mutual inhibition between C1 and C2B. We propose that the interdomain interfaces and the membrane contacts of C1 and C2B allow the formation of a relatively rigid C1-C2B module. This rigid unit functions like a balanced seesaw, preventing each side from engaging in further, stronger interactions with the membrane. However, the HK and DN mutations may induce conformation changes in either C1 or C2B, disrupting the balance of the rigid C1-C2B module and allowing the other end to more deeply insert into the membrane, consequently enhancing SV release.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The N-terminus regulation on C1 and C2B function</title><p>The functions of the N-terminal C2A domain in Munc13 and UNC-13 have been extensively investigated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). Of the four Munc13 isoforms in mammals, only two, Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2, possess a C2A domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brose et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Song et al., 1998</xref>). Structural and functional analyses have unveiled two contrasting binding modes of the C2A domain: it can form a homodimer with another C2A domain, thereby autoinhibiting Munc13 activity, or it can bind to the zinc finger domain of the active zone protein RIM, forming a heterodimer that promotes SV priming and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations that disrupt this heterodimerization result in defects in priming and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the C2A domain in <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-13L exhibits similar regulatory mechanisms in SV release, demonstrating its functional conservation between vertebrates and invertebrates. In contrast, the X domain located in the N-terminus has not been thoroughly elucidated. This region was initially considered as a large linker between C2A and C1, with the structural information being unknown. Nevertheless, our previous findings demonstrated that deleting X in UNC-13L enhances SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting an inhibitory role of this region in UNC-13L.</p><p>Despite the wealth of previous research, investigations into the N-terminus of Munc13/UNC-13 have been conducted separately from analyses of other domains, partly due to the lack of structural information of the entire protein, hindering our understanding of the spatial folding of C2A and X, as well as their potential interactions and coordination with other domains. Nevertheless, insights from the structure of C1C2BMUNC2C, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2017</xref>, have provided some clues. For example, the helix H1 situated between the CaM domain and the C1 domain (linker1 in UNC-13L) exhibits many contacts with neighboring regions, including the linker region between C1 and C2B (linker2 in UNC-13L), as well as the MUN domain. Notably, the helix H1 is closely packed against the MUN domain, with its N-terminus directed toward the center of the elongated rod-like structure. This arrangement suggests that the C2A and the X region may adopt a spatial conformation that interacts with either the MUN domain or the linker region between C1 and C2B. Such interactions could potentially regulate the MUN domain activity or influence the function of C1 and C2B.</p><p>Interestingly, our findings revealed the significant influence of C2A and X on the effects of the HK and DN mutations, providing compelling evidence linking the N-terminus to C1 and C2B domains. Specifically, we observed markedly stronger enhancements in SV release in UNC-13ΔC2A animals with the HK and DN mutations, whereas no changes were observed in UNC-13ΔX animals. This suggests that C2A and X play inhibitory and facilitatory roles, respectively, in regulating the function of the C1-C2B module, thereby controlling the switch of UNC-13 from the basal physiological state to the gain-of-function state. Moreover, in animals rescued with ΔC2A<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup>, SV release was not restored to the control level, as observed in UNC-13L and UNC-13R, indicating that ΔC2A<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup> remains in the gain-of-function state. This supports the additional role of C2A in promoting the switch of UCN-13 from the gain-of-function state to the basal physiological state. These findings align with the stronger enhancements of release in ΔC2A<sup>HK</sup> and ΔC2A<sup>D1-5N</sup> animals, suggesting that the presence of C2A favors UNC-13 in the basal physiological state. This could be potentially achieved through C2A interactions with the MUN domain, inhibiting MUN activity, or by interacting with the C1-C2B module (either the two domains or the linker2), thereby strengthening the mutual inhibition of C1-C2B by stabilizing the module. These effects of C2A might be negated by binding to RIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). As for the X domain, the only known sequence is the CaM domain which binds calmodulin and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dimova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Junge et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that Munc13 binding to calmodulin modulates synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Junge et al., 2004</xref>). One possible model for the X domain function is that the CaM domain also interacts with the C1-C2B module or the linker between them, promoting C1 and C2B binding to the membrane. This interaction may facilitate the transition of UNC-13 from the basal physiological state to the gain-of-function state.</p><p>Our findings that S<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup> almost eliminated SV release are striking. A comparison between these results with those in R<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup> indicates a potent inhibitory role of the N-terminal M domain in UNC-13S when C1 and C2B membrane interactions are simultaneously disrupted. Like the X domain in UNC-13L, structural information of the M domain has not been obtained. However, our previous studies have demonstrated that the M domain in UNC-13S plays an inhibitory role, likely by locking the MUN domain in a non-favorable conformation for SNARE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, mammalian bMunc13-2 and Munc13-3 also contain unstructured N-terminal sequences. Prior reports have indicated that the coiled-coil motif in the N-terminal of bMunc13-2 binds to the active zone protein ELKS1, thereby regulating the synaptic localization of bMunc13-2 and priming of SVs in hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, at <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory synapses, the UNC13B isoform exhibits a differential localization with the C2A-containing isoform UNC13A, likely through the interactions of their N-termini with active zone proteins Bruchipilot (Brp, mammalian ELKS1 ortholog) and Syd-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fulterer et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that the M domain in UNC-13S may have some unknown mechanisms that regulate SV release. Similar to the C2A and X in UNC-13L, we propose that the M domain can directly interact with the MUN domain, and this interaction could strongly impede the rotation of the MUN domain, thereby obstructing SV release.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The physiological significance of the C1-C2B model</title><p>Although the C1-C2B functional switch model is mainly based on the dysfunction of the C1-C2B module (through HK and DN mutations), it provides a potential physiological framework for understanding how the structural balance of C1-C2B module relates to the variability of synaptic transmission in the nervous system. In the CNS, synaptic transmission is highly variable, and the temporal pattern of the presynaptic activity may require dynamic switching of the fusion machinery between different functional modes, thereby triggering synaptic transmission at various levels. Our model suggests that under conditions of high neuronal activity, the C1-C2B module may transition from a balanced to an unbalanced state (gain-of-function state), thereby enhancing synaptic transmission. The future studies will focus on additional sequences in UNC-13 (e.g. the linkers between C1 and C2B, C2B and MUN) to investigate their potential roles in regulating synaptic transmission and their broader functional significance in UNC-13 dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Zhitao Hu (zhtiaohu@cityu.edu.hk).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>All new strains and plasmids created in this study will be provided on request with no restrictions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Strain maintenance and genetic manipulation were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Overview:</p><p>We appreciate all the constructive comments from the reviewer and the reviewing editor, as their suggestions have significantly improved our manuscript. In response to their comments, we have made several key revisions: First, we have performed new colocalization analyses between the active zone marker UNC-10::GFP and all UNC-13L variants (UNC13L, UNC-13L<sup>HK</sup>, UNC-13L<sup>D1-5N</sup>, and UNC-13L<sup>HK+D1-5N</sup>, all tagged with mApple). These results confirm that the mutations do not affect synaptic localization. Second, we have provided a clearer explanation of the “gain-of-function” term used in this study, emphasizing that it reflects an increased SV release due to C1-C2B module dysfunction rather than a single mechanistic state. Third, we have expanded the discussion on the physiological implications of the C1-C2B model, particularly its role in regulating synaptic transmission under varying neuronal activity conditions. Finally, to improve clarity and focus, we have removed unnecessary speculative discussions, ensuring that the revised manuscript centers on the most relevant findings.</p><p>We have reorganized the manuscript to incorporate these new results into the figures and text. Full responses to all reviewer comments are provided below. We hope that the reviewer and the editor find these revisions satisfactory and that our manuscript is now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Joint Public Review:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate how different domains of the presynaptic protein UNC-13 regulate synaptic vesicle release in the nematode <italic>C. elegans.</italic> By generating numerous point mutations and domain deletions, they propose that two membrane-binding domains (C1 and C2B) can exhibit &quot;mutual inhibition,&quot; enabling either domain to enhance or restrain transmission depending on its conformation.

Different mutations selectively affect spontaneous or evoked release, suggesting that each variant may not share the same underlying mechanism. Moreover, many conclusions rely on combining domain deletions or point mutations, yet the electrophysiological data show distinct outcomes across EPSCs, IPSCs, mini, and evoked responses. This raises questions about whether these manipulations all act on the same pathway and whether their observed additivity or suppression genuinely reflects a single mechanistic process. A unifying model-or at least a clearer explanation of why the authors infer one mechanistic state across different domain manipulations would strengthen the paper's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and understand the potential confusion regarding the use of the term &quot;gain-of-function&quot; in the manuscript. To clarify, the gain-of-function state described in this study does not refer to a single specific mechanistic change in UNC-13 but rather to a high synaptic vesicle (SV) release state achieved by disrupting the C1-C2B module - either through dysfunction of the C1 domain or the C2B domain (as seen with the HK and DN mutations).</p><p>Our findings support a &quot;seesaw&quot; model in which the C1 and C2B domains maintain a dynamic balance in their interaction with the plasma membrane, binding to DAG and PIP2. This balance may increase the energy barrier for SV release, preventing excessive neurotransmitter release under basal conditions. However, the C1-C2B toggle may be disrupted by high neuronal activity and act in an unbalanced state, thereby enhancing synaptic transmission (i.e., the gain-of-function state). To address these concerns, we have provided a clearer explanation of this functional switch in the revised version of the manuscript (page 27).</p><p>Regarding the differences between spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release, our previous studies have revealed that these two forms of release do not always respond similarly to various <italic>unc-13</italic> mutations. This is a common phenomenon observed in other synaptic protein mutants, including synaptotagmin, tomosyn, and complexin, which indicates distinct yet partially overlapping regulatory mechanisms. Our model is well supported by most of the electrophysiological results from HK, DN, and HK+DN mutations across different <italic>unc-13</italic> isoforms (UNC-13L, UNC-13S, UNC-13R, UNC-13ΔC2A, UNC-13ΔX). The main exception is that in UNC-13ΔX<sup>HK+DN</sup> mutants, the changes in mEPSCs and mIPSCs differ from those observed in evoked EPSCs. This suggests that the mechanisms regulating the functional switch of <italic>unc-13</italic> may differ slightly between spontaneous and evoked release. Since the <italic>X</italic> region of <italic>unc-13</italic> and Munc13 remains largely uncharacterized, our findings provide intriguing insights into its potential functional role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript proposes that UNC-13 toggles from a basal to a &quot;gain-of-function&quot; state under normal synaptic activity. However, it does not address when or how this switch might occur in vivo, since it is demonstrated principally via artificial mutations. Providing direct evidence or additional discussion of such switching under physiological conditions would be particularly informative.</p><p>What is the physiological significance of the proposed gain-of-function state? The data suggest that certain mutants (e.g., HK+D1-5N) lacking the gain-of-function state can still support synaptic transmission at wild-type levels. How do the authors reconcile this with the idea that the gain-of-function state plays a critical role at the synapse?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments. While our model is mainly based on the dysfunction of the C1-C2B module (through HK and DN mutations), it provides a potential physiological framework for understanding how the structural balance of C1-C2B relates to the variability of synaptic transmission in the nervous system. In the CNS, synaptic transmission is highly variable, and the temporal pattern of the presynaptic activity may require dynamic switching of the fusion machinery, including UNC-13, between different functional modes, thereby triggering synaptic transmission at various levels. Our model suggests that under conditions of high neuronal activity, the C1-C2B module may transition from a balanced to an unbalanced state (gain-of-function state), thereby enhancing synaptic transmission.</p><p>Regarding the physiological significance of the gain-of-function state, we acknowledge that certain mutants (e.g., HK+D1-5N) lacking this state can still support wild-type levels of synaptic transmission. This observation suggests that the gain-of-function state may not be strictly required for baseline synaptic function but rather plays a modulatory role under specific conditions, such as heightened neuronal activity or synaptic plasticity. Further investigations will be needed to determine the precise in vivo triggers and functional consequences of this switch under physiological conditions. Moreover, we will focus on several linker regions (between C1 and C2B, C2B and MUN) to investigate their potential roles in regulating synaptic transmission and their broader functional significance in UNC-13 dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors determined the fluorescence intensity of mApple-tagged UNC-13 variants (Figure 1J-K and Figure 7J-K), finding no significant changes compared to the wild-type. However, a more detailed analysis of the density or distribution of fluorescent puncta in axons could clarify whether certain mutations alter the localization of UNC-13 at synapses. Demonstrating colocalization with wild-type UNC-13 (or another presynaptic marker) would help rule out mislocalization effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. In response, we have included a more detailed analysis of the synaptic localization of both wild-type and mutated UNC-13L in the revised manuscript. Our data show that in all scenarios, UNC-13 proteins exhibit strong colocalization with the active zone marker UNC-10::GFP (Figure 1L). Along with the fluorescence intensity data in Figure 1J, our findings indicate that the C1 and C2B mutations do not affect the expression level or the localization of UNC-13 at synapses. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (page 8) and in Figure 1L.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study mainly relies on extrachromosomal transgenes, which can show variable copy numbers and expression levels among individual worm strains. This variability might complicate interpretation, as differences in expression could mask or exaggerate certain phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the expression levels of synaptic proteins can influence synaptic transmission levels. However, given the large number of mutations and truncations employed in this study, generating single-copy rescue lines for all transgenic strains would be a significant undertaking. On average, we need to microinject 50-100 worms to obtain one single-copy line, whereas injecting only 5-10 worms allows us to generate at least three independent extrachromosomal arrays. Based on our previous work, we found that the synaptic transmission levels are comparable between various extrachromosomal rescue arrays of <italic>unc13</italic> and their single-copy rescue lines (e.g., UNC-13L, UNC-13S, UNC-13R, UNC-13ΔC2A, UNC-13ΔC2B, etc.). In future studies, we aim to use single-copy expression or CRISPRbased methods to induce deletions or mutations in various synaptic proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the discussion is somewhat diffused. Streamlining the text to focus on the most direct connections would help readers pinpoint the key conclusions and open questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. As suggested, we have refined the discussion section. Specifically, we have removed the last part of the discussion (Functional roles of the linkers in UNC-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Clarify the &quot;Gain-of-Function&quot; State. Provide stronger justification or explicit discussion of whether all manipulations that enhance SV release truly correspond to the same mechanistic state or if multiple conformational states might be at play.</p></disp-quote><p>The “gain-of-function” state in this manuscript refers to a specific conformational status of UNC-13 that enhances synaptic vesicle (SV) release probability (both spontaneous and evoked) as a result of mutations (HK and DN) in the C1 and C2B domains. This effect is observed across multiple UNC-13 isoforms, including UNC-13L, UNC-13S, and UNC-13R. Prior studies from our group and others have demonstrated that C1 and C2B exhibit conserved functions in regulating synaptic transmission (Li et al., 2019, Cell Reports; Liu et al., 2021, Cell Reports; Michelassi et al., 2017, Neuron), supporting the idea that these domains share a common mechanism for modulating SV release. Given that C1 and C2B act as a functional unit (Michelassi et al., 2017, Neuron; and this study), we define all synaptic states induced by the dysfunction of these two domains as the &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mode.</p><p>However, it is important to note that this classification does not apply to high-release probability states induced by mutations in other domains.</p><p>The concept of a gain-of-function state due to C1 and C2B dysfunction has been previously proposed in studies of Munc13. Basu et al. (2007, Journal of Neuroscience) demonstrated that the H567K mutation in Munc13-1 C1 increases both spontaneous and evoked release probability, leading to a gain-of-function mode. Similarly, work from the Südhof group showed that KW and DN mutations in Munc13-1 C2B also enhance release probability, thereby inducing a gain-of-function state (Shin et al., 2010, Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology). Our recent findings further support this idea, showing that UNC-13 C2B D3,4N (Li et al., 2019, Cell Reports; Liu et al., 2021, Cell Reports; Michelassi et al., 2017, Neuron) and the newly identified D1-5N mutation (this study) significantly elevate SV release, consistent with the D1,2N mutations reported by Shin et al.</p><p>Overall, our study integrates and extends previous findings, providing strong evidence that the C1 and C2B domains function as a regulatory switch between a basal physiological mode, a gain-of-function mode (enhanced release), and a loss-of-function mode (impaired release). This framework advances our understanding of how C1 and C2B dysfunction affects synaptic transmission and plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Add comparisons to wild-type UNC-13L: When presenting data for deletions/mutants as &quot;controls,&quot; include a visual reference (e.g., dashed line in figures) showing wild-type UNC13L levels. This will help readers see whether each construct is above or below the normal activity baseline.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, a dashed line showing the level of UNC-13L has been added to the bar graphs of all evoked EPSCs. The functional switch model is well supported by the results of the evoked EPSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Mutant and wild-type UNC-13 colocalization analysis: Demonstrating whether each mutant localizes robustly to synapses, in comparison to wild-type UNC-13, would bolster the interpretation of electrophysiological changes. If the authors have these data, adding them would address the possibility of mislocalization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there would be value to address the possibility of mislocalization. However, in our experience working with UNC-13 mutant colocalization, we have found that neither deleting the X, C1 and C2B domains in UNC-13L nor deleting C1 and C2B domain in UNC-13MR or UNC-13R altered the synaptic colocalization with the active zone protein UNC-10/RIM (Li 2019, Liu 2021), suggesting that C1 and C2B domains in UNC-13 are not involved in the regulation of protein localization. Thus, the mutations in the C1 and C2B domains are unlikely leading to protein mislocalization in the synaptic region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) If possible, adding analysis using single-copy transgenes to confirm that extrachromosomal array expression variability does not qualitatively change the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree with the reviewer that single-copy transgenes would provide more stable protein expression levels and further consolidate our conclusions. However, several factors give us confidence that the extrachromosomal array rescue approach does not introduce significant variability in our results: First, our prior research has shown that SV release levels are generally comparable between extrachromosomal arrays carrying various <italic>unc13</italic> transgenes and their corresponding single-copy rescue lines (e.g., UNC-13L, UNC-13S, UNC-13R, UNC-13ΔC2A, and UNC-13ΔC2B). Second, the major conclusions in this study are drawn from highly consistent and robust changes in SV release between different rescue lines (e.g., UNC-13L<sup>HK+DN</sup> vs UNC-13L<sup>DN</sup>; UNC-13S<sup>HK+DN</sup> vs UNC-13S<sup>HK</sup> or UNC-13S<sup>DN</sup>). Third, our imaging data indicate that the protein levels are indistinguishable between different <italic>unc-13</italic> rescue arrays carrying C1 and C2B mutations, further supporting the validity of our findings.</p><p>Additionally, due to our recent relocation to a new institute, we are still in the process of setting up our microinjection system. Generating single-copy transgenes for all the extrachromosomal arrays used in this study would require significant time. We appreciate the reviewer’s understanding of our current situation. For our future studies regarding <italic>unc-13</italic> and other synaptic proteins, we will prefer to use single-copy expression rather than extrachromosomal arrays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Reduce the length and speculation in the Discussion. A concise discussion that focuses on the most direct implications of the present findings will help improve the readability of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment.
