human death. Mortality is primarily due to metastatic organ colonization, with the liver being the main organ affected. We modeled metastatic CRC (mCRC) liver colonization using patient-derived primary and metastatic tumor xenografts (PDX). Such PDX modeling predicted patient survival outcomes. In vivo selection of multiple PDXs for enhanced metastatic colonization capacity upregulated the gluconeogenic enzyme PCK1, which enhanced liver metastatic growth by driving pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis under hypoxia. Consistently, highly metastatic tumors upregulated multiple pyrimidine biosynthesis intermediary metabolites. Therapeutic inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme DHODH with leflunomide substantially impaired CRC liver metastatic colonization and hypoxic growth. Our findings provide a potential mechanistic basis for the epidemiologic association of anti-gluconeogenic drugs with improved CRC metastasis outcomes, reveal the exploitation of a gluconeogenesis enzyme for pyrimidine biosynthesis under hypoxia, and implicate DHODH and PCK1 as metabolic therapeutic targets in CRC metastatic progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Colorectal cancer, also known as bowel cancer, is the second most deadly cancer in the United States, where it affects over 140,000 people each year. This cancer often spreads to the liver, in a process known as metastasis. To do this, the colorectal cancer cells must survive the low oxygen levels found in the blood that carries them from the gut to the liver, and in the liver itself. The majority of colorectal cancer cells that arrive in the liver die, but some survive leading to secondary tumors.</p><p>To investigate how the colorectal cancer cells that survive and metastasize to the liver accomplish this feat, Yamaguchi, Weinberg, Nguyen et al. took colorectal tumors from patients and introduced them into mice. This showed that tumors from patients with the worst outcomes tended to metastasize more efficiently in mice.</p><p>Next, Yamaguchi et al. looked to see which genes were active in the colorectal cancer cells that were able to metastasize and compared them to those that were active in the cells that could not. This analysis revealed that the gene coding for a protein called PCK1 was more active in the cells that could metastasize. In healthy cells, PCK1 promotes the generation of the sugar glucose, and Yamaguchi et al. observed that, in a low oxygen environment, higher levels of PCK1 allowed colorectal cancer cells to proliferate faster. Unexpectedly, this was due to PCK1 increasing the production of a molecule needed to make nucleotides, which are the building blocks for DNA and RNA. Consistent with this, metastasizing colorectal cancer cells generated more nucleotide precursors, and inhibiting the enzyme involved in nucleotide synthesis (DHODH) with an arthritis drug called leflunomide stopped colorectal cancer cells from spreading.</p><p>Metastasizing colorectal cancer cells depend on PCK1 and the nucleotide-synthesizing enzyme to grow, so therapies that target these proteins may help more patients to survive this kind of cancer. The findings also suggest that the arthritis drug leflunomide should be explored further as a potential drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group

cancer-related death. An estimated 145,000 Americans will be diagnosed with CRC and roughly 51,000 will die of it in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">National Cancer Institute, 2019</xref>). The majority of these deaths are due to distant metastatic disease with the liver being the most common distal organ colonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">National Cancer Institute, 2019</xref>). While the prognosis of patients diagnosed with non-metastatic or locoregional disease is relatively better, a significant fraction of such patients will nonetheless experience subsequent metastatic progression. A key clinical need is identifying which patients will develop metastatic disease since few prognostic indicators of disease progression exist. Additionally, novel targeted therapies for the prevention and treatment of metastatic CRC are major needs.</p><p>While cell lines established from human CRC have provided important insights into the biology of CRC, tissue culture drift, adaptation, and evolution can restrict their relationship to the pathophysiology of patient tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillet et al., 2013</xref>). Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, which allow for the growth of patient tumor samples in immunodeficient mice, can capture the endogenous diversity within a tumor as well as the patient-to-patient variability of metastatic cancer. Prior work has revealed that breast cancer, melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer PDX modeling can predict human clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quintana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">John et al., 2011</xref>). These models have revealed the potential of individualized mice models for prognostication and tailoring of therapies. Past CRC PDX models were subcutaneous implantations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2015</xref>). Such subcutaneous PDX tumors are useful for tumor growth studies, but do not metastasize and are not exposed to the pathophysiologically relevant and restrictive conditions of the hepatic microenvironment. While orthotopic PDX implantation serves as a good model for studying metastasis in melanoma and breast cancer, this approach has limited feasibility in CRC, as the orthotopic tumor kills the host due to the obstructive dimensions that implanted tumors reach prior to liver metastatic colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quintana et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, a clinically relevant PDX model of CRC that recapitulates the critical process of liver metastatic colonization is an important need.</p><p>Beyond predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses, PDX models of mCRC could allow for identification of molecules that contribute to metastatic colonization through the use of in vivo selection. This process subjects a parental population (e.g. cancer cells, bacteria, yeast) to a severe physiologic bottleneck such that only those cells with the requisite gene expression states survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fidler, 1973</xref>). Such selection is repeated iteratively to enrich for cells that are best adapted to the new microenvironment. Molecular profiling can then reveal molecular alterations that enable the selected population to colonize the new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Minn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tavazoie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pencheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>By engrafting patient-derived CRC primary and metastatic tumors of diverse mutational backgrounds, we observed that subcutaneous tumor engraftment efficiency and liver colonization capacity, but not subcutaneous tumor growth rate, was associated with patient overall survival. By performing liver-specific in vivo selection with CRC PDXs, we enriched for cells optimized for growth in the liver microenvironment. Gene expression analysis revealed the gluconeogenesis enzyme PCK1 to be a robust driver of liver metastatic colonization that is over-expressed in metastatic CRC. Mechanistic studies revealed that PCK1 enhances pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, which enables cancer cell growth in the context of hypoxia—a key feature of the liver microenvironment. Moreover, highly metastatic CRC PDXs contained higher levels of intermediary metabolite precursors for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. Consistent with these observations, molecular and pharmacologic inhibition of PCK1 or the pyrimidine biosynthetic gene DHODH inhibited CRC liver metastatic colonization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Liver growth and engraftment rates of CRC PDXs predict patient outcomes</title><p>In order to establish a PDX model of CRC liver metastatic colonization, a small sample of CRC tissue, taken either from a primary or metastatic site, was dissociated and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup> Il2rg<sup>tm1Wj</sup></italic><sup>l</sup>/SzJ (Nod-Scid-Gamma; NSG) mice within 2 hr of surgical resection at MSKCC. Thirty-one subjects provided 40 tumor samples; 48.3% of the subjects’ samples engrafted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of subjects in this study were classified as Stage IV CRC according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). However, AJCC stage was not associated with increased xenograft engraftment (p=0.35; χ<sup>2</sup> test). The engraftment rates for tumor tissues that originated from the colon and the liver were similar (40% vs 37.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Most subjects had undergone chemotherapy prior to surgical resection of metastases (67.7%). When categorizing tumors by commonly tested clinical mutations (KRAS, high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and none), MSI-H tumors exhibited the highest engraftment rates (83.3%), while tumors lacking these commonly tested for clinical mutations exhibited the lowest engraftment rates (18.2%).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical characteristics of the subjects who provided the samples that created CRC patient-derived xenografts.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52135-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>We found that subcutaneous tumor engraftment was associated with worse patient survival (p=0.045; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The time from subcutaneous tumor implantation to tumor harvest ranged from 35 to 88 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Among those CRC tumors that did grow subcutaneously, the time required to reach the pre-determined tumor size (1000 mm<sup>3</sup>) was not significantly associated with patient survival (p=0.27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When the estimated subcutaneous tumor volumes reached 1000 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were removed. For each sample, a portion of the xenografted tumor was set aside for cryopreservation, and the rest of the tumor was dissociated into a single cell suspension for portal circulation injection via the spleen. Portal circulation injection has been demonstrated to be a reliable means of establishing liver growth via hematogenous spread of CRC cells, simulating the entry of cells into the portal circulation which is typical of clinical CRC progression. After injection of cells, we observed the mice until they were deemed ill by increased abdominal girth, slow movement, and pale footpads, at which point we proceeded to euthanization and tumor extractions. Successful liver metastatic colonization was achieved upon injection of 15/17 patient samples. The time to mouse sacrifice for the CRC patient-derived liver xenografts ranged from 51 to 407 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and did not correlate with subcutaneous tumor growth rates (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.046, p=0.50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The mCRC liver PDXs fell into two biologically distinct groups based on their growth rates: one set grew quickly, requiring mouse euthanasia within three months of implantation; the other set grew more slowly, requiring animal sacrifice after 6 months, or even 1-year, post-engraftment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, these two groups of PDXs exhibited similar growth rates when implanted subcutaneously (p=0.09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests distinct selective pressures existing in the liver relative to the subcutaneous microenvironment. We found that the liver colonization model mimicked clinical outcomes, as patients whose xenografts rapidly colonized mouse livers fared poorly relative to patients whose xenografts colonized the liver slowly or not at all (p=0.031; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Taken together, these results establish that CRC liver metastasis PDX modeling described above is prognostic of clinical survival outcome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Subcutaneous engraftment and liver colonization growth rate, but not subcutaneous growth rate, correlate with patient outcomes in CRC PDXs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Approximately 50 mm<sup>3</sup> of surgically resected colorectal cancer tissue was dissociated and injected subcutaneously into NSG mice.

While metabolites related to glycolysis and the citric acid (TCA) cycle were significantly increased, corroborating previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montal et al., 2015</xref>), the most salient finding was a significant depletion of nucleosides and nucleotides including uridine, guanine, UMP, CMP, CDP, IMP, GMP, and AMP in <italic>PCK1</italic> depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>).

To better understand how <italic>PCK1</italic> maintains nucleotide pools under hypoxia, we performed a <sup>13</sup>C glutamine metabolic flux analysis in control and <italic>PCK1</italic>-depleted cells.

In contrast, the generation of pyrimidine precursors derived from oxidative reactions in the TCA cycle were either significantly increased or unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>).

These findings reveal that <italic>PCK1</italic> promotes growth by maintaining the levels of aspartate, a nucleotide precursor.

Some patients with metastatic CRC can experience regression responses to current therapies, although most succumb to their disease within 3 years. Given that most CRC deaths occur as a result of complications of metastatic disease, a model that can predict which patients with advanced CRC harbor more aggressive disease could aid in appropriately positioning patients for experimental clinical trials. The objectives of our study were two-fold: to develop a CRC liver metastasis patient-derived xenograft model, and to employ this model to identify candidate genes and biology underlying CRC liver metastatic colonization.</p><p>Most patient-derived xenograft models consist of subcutaneous tumor tissue implantation. Similar to others, we found that successful subcutaneous tumor engraftment associated with worse patient survival in those with CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2015</xref>). However, among those tumors in our study that did engraft subcutaneously, the subcutaneous tumor growth rate did not significantly correlate with patient survival. In contrast, we found that liver metastatic growth rate was significantly correlated with patient survival. The reason for this discrepancy in the prognostic power of subcutaneous tumor growth versus liver metastatic growth is likely the greater selective pressure inherent to the liver microenvironment. This collection of clinically predictive CRC liver metastatic PDX models represents a valuable resource for the cancer community.</p><p><italic>PCK1</italic> is the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis and is often upregulated in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus.

While numerous pathways are involved in metabolic reprogramming, metabolic shunting into pathways including glucose metabolism, the citric acid (TCA) cycle, and lipogenesis largely support macromolecule synthesis for cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Locasale and Cantley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Possemato et al., 2011</xref>). In line with these notions, there have been two reports on <italic>PCK1</italic> and its role in cancer. In one study, <italic>PCK1</italic> was found to enhance melanoma tumor re-initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In this work, the authors demonstrated that, in tissue culture, melanoma ‘tumor re-initiating cells’ consumed more glucose and produced more lactate and glycerate-3-phosphate; <italic>PCK1</italic> silencing elicited the opposite phenotype in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Using cell culture metabolomics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montal et al. (2015)</xref> recently described a mechanism by which <italic>PCK1</italic> promotes CRC growth through its increased ability to metabolize glutamine into lipids and ribose . <italic>PCK1</italic> silencing in a CRC cell line in vitro was shown to decrease glutamine utilization and TCA cycle flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montal et al., 2015</xref>). This group found that cells with increased expression of <italic>PCK1</italic> consumed more glucose and produced more lactate. They further performed <italic>PCK1</italic> staining on a primary CRC tissue microarray, finding that <italic>PCK1</italic> was overexpressed in many primary CRC biopsies but its expression was not associated with tumor grade. Our findings demonstrate a major role for <italic>PCK1</italic> in liver metastatic colonization by CRC. While we did not find evidence of <italic>PCK2</italic> upregulation in our mCRC model, three recent studies demonstrated that <italic>PCK2</italic> upregulation in lung cancer cells in vitro can improve cancer cell survival in glucose-depleted conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leithner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vincent et al., 2015</xref>). Vincent et al. found that in glucose-depleted conditions, lung cancer cells increased consumption of glutamine as an energy source in a PCK2-dependent manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al. (2017)</xref> observed <italic>PCK2</italic> upregulation in tumor initiating cells and demonstrated that <italic>PCK2</italic> promoted tumor initiation through reducing TCA cycle flux by lowering Acetyl-CoA. Our findings provide three novel insights underlying the role of <italic>PCK1</italic> in cancer progression. First, we demonstrate that increased <italic>PCK1</italic> strongly drives liver metastatic colonization but minimally impacted primary tumor growth rate in the cells studied. Second, we provide the first reported evidence that <italic>PCK1</italic> can promote hypoxic growth. Third, we uncover a key role for <italic>PCK1</italic> in pyrimidine biosynthesis under hypoxia via reductive carboxylation. Although we do not provide a precise biochemical mechanism by which <italic>PCK1</italic> promotes reductive carboxylation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zamboni et al. (2004)</xref> reported that in a bacterium with pyruvate kinase impairment, <italic>PCK1</italic> could operate in reverse—converting phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate. We speculate that such a reaction would drive reductive carboxylation by generating oxaloacetate, a precursor for aspartate and consequently pyrimidines. In support of this, our metabolite profiling of <italic>PCK1</italic>-depleted cells under hypoxia revealed increased abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate. Moreover, we had previously observed that highly metastatic CRC cells upregulate <italic>PKLR</italic>, which was shown to inhibit pyruvate kinase M2 (<italic>PKM2</italic>) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>)—analogous to the observations in the aforementioned bacterial study. Further investigation is warranted to conclusively define the mechanism by which <italic>PCK1</italic> regulates pyrimidine synthesis in metastatic CRC cells under hypoxia.</p><p>Because tumor cells alter their metabolic programs within their given tumor microenvironment, metabolic liabilities that provide therapeutic opportunities emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wheaton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Locasale et al., 2011</xref>).

Our work reveals that beyond effects on cell growth in vitro and primary tumor growth, CRC metastatic progression selects for upregulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Moreover, the use of leflunomide to therapeutically target <italic>DHODH</italic> has been implicated under various cancer contexts as a metabolic inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luengo et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we observe that molecular or pharmacological inhibition of this pathway with leflunomide strongly impairs CRC metastatic colonization relative to primary tumor growth. Our work reveals that hypoxia enhances the sensitivity of cells to DHODH inhibition, consistent with enhanced pyrimidine biosynthesis enabling enhanced growth under hypoxia—a key feature of the hepatic tumor microenvironment.</p><p>5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was the first chemotherapeutic to demonstrate efficacy in reducing the risk of CRC recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moertel et al., 1990</xref>). This agent remains the backbone of the current FOLFOX regimen, which is administered to patients after surgical resection to reduce the risk of metastatic relapse. Interestingly, 5-FU targets thymidylate synthase, an enzyme downstream of <italic>DHODH</italic> in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway—supporting our premise of dependence and susceptibility to inhibition of this pathway in CRC metastasis. Despite its activity, a large fraction of patients treated with 5-FU relapse. Multiple mechanisms of resistance to 5-FU have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holohan et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of <italic>DHODH</italic> can suppress metastatic progression of a CRC cell line that is resistant to 5-FU—revealing promise for clinical testing of this agent in patients at high risk for relapse and whose tumors may exhibit resistance to 5-FU. Overall, our work reveals that PDX modeling of CRC can be predictive of clinical survival outcomes; that integration of PDX modeling with in vivo selection can give rise to highly metastatic PDX derivatives which can be profiled transcriptomically and metabolically to identify key drivers of metastatic progression; and that <italic>PCK1</italic> and <italic>DHODH</italic> represent key metabolic drivers of CRC metastasis and therapeutic targets in CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Using RNA sequencing to analyze highly metastatic variants, you found that the metabolic enzyme <italic>PCK1</italic> was unregulated. Suppression of <italic>PCK1</italic> limits in vitro cell growth and reduces nucleotide levels specifically in hypoxia. Uridine supplementation restored the viability in hypoxia in cells where <italic>PCK1</italic> is inhibited by RNAi. Overall this work is of potential interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers noted that the description of patient-derived xenografts and the identification of <italic>PCK1</italic> as an enzyme that contributes to tumorigenesis has already been reported.

We provide molecular evidence that <italic>PCK1</italic> promotes reductive carboxylation to produce aspartate and orotate in CRC cells under hypoxia in a cataplerotic manner (Figure 6G-H, Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-E).</p><p>2) We performed aspartate and pyruvate rescue experiments to functionally validate whether these metabolites, which are involved in nucleotide synthesis, are necessary for restoration of hypoxic cell growth in <italic>PCK1</italic> silenced cells. These experiments were performed since it has been previously shown that aspartate and pyruvate become essential for cell growth under hypoxia (Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2018). We observed that aspartate supplementation partially and significantly rescued hypoxic cell growth in <italic>PCK1</italic>-depleted cells. Pyruvate supplementation had a modest effect in rescuing hypoxic cell growth in <italic>PCK1</italic>-depleted cells. Combined supplementation with aspartate and pyruvate nearly fully rescued the hypoxic cell growth in <italic>PCK1</italic>-depleted cells. These findings reveal that a major role for <italic>PCK1</italic> is generation of aspartate as a precursor to nucleotides. Pyruvate can act as a precursor for aspartate and can replete NAD under hypoxia. The finding that combined aspartate and pyruvate provides the maximal rescue suggests that intracellular aspartate depletion is a key defect that <italic>PCK1</italic> over-expression overcomes under hypoxia (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F). <italic>PCK1</italic>-mediated overcoming of this defects enables enhanced nucleotide generation under hypoxia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear what metastasizing cells and hypoxic cells have in common that make them both sensitive to pathway inhibition, while primary tumors (which may also experience hypoxia?) are not.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these important points. Colorectal cancer cells metastasize to the liver via the portal circulation, which is hypoxemic. Moreover, the liver microenvironment itself is known to contain hypoxic regions, with metabolically active hepatocytes at the periportal region displaying high rates of oxygen consumption and hepatocytes at the perivenous region actively undergoing glycolysis (Dupuy et al., 2015; Jungermann and Kietzmann, 2000). Upon arriving in the hepatic microenvironment, CRC cells experience acute hypoxia and are poorly adapted to the liver microenvironment prior to induction of a HIF-activated response. Indeed, our prior imaging studies revealed substantial cell death upon CRC entry into the hepatic microenvironment (Loo et al., 2015).Thus, this is a major bottle-neck that leads to substantial attrition. At the primary tumor site, cells are provided oxygenated arterial blood, rather than hypoxemic venous blood. Furthermore, cancer cells at the primary site are not competing with perivenous hepatocytes for oxygen consumption. We have better referenced the past literature describing the physiological basis for the hypoxic nature of the hepatic microenvironment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The RNAi experiments with PCK1 are interesting but require rescue experiments to confirm that they are on target, particularly since different RNAi reagents are used in different experimental models.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have now included data showing that expressing <italic>PCK1</italic> in CRC cells expressing an shRNA targeting the 3’UTR of <italic>PCK1</italic> fully rescued hypoxic cell growth. This validates the specificity of our observations with multiple distinct RNAi’s as well as pharmacology (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In addition, does purine supplementation rescue the phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the important comments by the reviewers. Montal et al. had shown that <italic>PCK1</italic> promotes CRC cell growth by increasing ribose abundance, which they proposed was the mechanism underlying enhanced purine synthesis (Montal et al., 2015). To test the importance of pyrimidines and purines/ribose in hypoxic cancer cell growth, we conducted hypoxic cell growth assays with purines, ribose, and uridine supplementation (Figure 6I). While purines, ribose, or the combination of purines and ribose had modest effects on hypoxic cell growth, uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, fully rescued hypoxic cell growth in <italic>PCK1</italic> silenced cells suggesting that <italic>PCK1</italic> is primarily overcoming the barrier of pyrimidine nucleotide depletion under hypoxia.</p></body></sub-article></article>
