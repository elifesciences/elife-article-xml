These associated microbes, especially fungi and bacteria, perform a range of beneficial functions for their host, such as nutrient provision and immune modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeda-Ohtsubo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Some of these host–microbe associations are facultative and dispensable, while others are more important or even essential for host growth or survival under specific circumstances. Compared to symbioses between a limited number of specific species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shigenobu and Wilson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Su et al., 2022</xref>), however, those that encompass a larger number of species are intricate and analytically challenging. Additionally, despite a growing number of reports documenting the presence of fungi in the mammalian intestine, including humans, our comprehension of their roles is still limited, with the exception of a handful of pathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hallen-Adams and Suhr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pérez, 2021</xref>). Moreover, the composition of these complex microbiota tends to change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moya and Ferrer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we focused on how the host sustains its life processes in such unstable environments.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has made remarkable contributions to our comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms governing development, growth, and metabolism, which are highly conserved among animals. More recently, the fly has emerged as a valuable model for investigating animal-associated microbes. The microbiota associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> comprise relatively few species, most of which can be cultured aerobically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grenier and Leulier, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Brey, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, germ-free (GF) or gnotobiotic animals can be easily prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ludington and Ja, 2020</xref>). The aforementioned advantages of analysis enabled a thorough exploration of the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic>-associated microbes. Notably, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) demonstrate the ability to enhance larval growth under nutrient scarcity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>). However, most researchers have examined only a single species or a limited number of bacteria. Additionally, most previous studies did not investigate the association with yeasts. Possibly, this is because live yeasts are either absent or present in very small quantities, due to antifungal agents added to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> laboratory foods. Instead of live yeasts, the foods typically contain heat-killed budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a major nutrient source, but this yeast species rarely coexists with <italic>Drosophila</italic> in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoang et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, the relationship between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and its associated microorganisms has often been classified as facultative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martino et al., 2018</xref>), and the role played by associated fungi has been largely overlooked.</p><p>In the wild, the presence of microbes is crucial for the developmental growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae that feed on fruit-based food sources. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in its natural habitat feeds on fruits fermented by its associated microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). GF larvae cannot grow on fresh fruits alone, while inoculation with certain species of yeasts or bacteria promotes pupariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pais et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that, in the wild, microbes provide vital nutrients for larval growth. While the bacterial roles have been extensively investigated, few reports have focused on yeasts; some studies described interspecies variation of yeasts with regard to their effects on larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quan and Eisen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solomon et al., 2019</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly explored. We therefore set out to address the following questions: (1) which species play a central role in food microbiota? (2) what are the essential traits that these species possess? (3) what microbe-derived nutrients are necessary for host growth?</p><p>To address these questions, we sampled fermented bananas that had been fed upon by wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We collected the foods at two different timepoints, referred to as ‘early-stage’ and ‘late-stage’ foods, and demonstrated a dramatic shift in fungal and bacterial taxonomic compositions during fermentation. Regarding fungi, we observed that yeasts predominated in both stages, but the dominant species changed between the stages. Among bacterial species, Enterobacterales accounted for a large proportion in the early stage, whereas LAB and AAB dominated in the late stage. We then isolated yeast and bacterial strains from the food samples and tested their ability to support larval development on a banana agar. <italic>Hanseniaspora uvarum</italic>, the predominant yeast species in the early stage, was able to support larval growth by itself. In contrast, most of the late-stage microbes tested did not efficiently promote larval growth when inoculated individually. However, we found that when the AAB <italic>Acetobacter orientalis</italic> coexisted with either LAB or late-stage yeast species, it effectively promoted larval growth. Our analyses of larvae under different microbial environments, including transcriptomic analyses of first instars, strongly suggest that <italic>A. orientalis</italic> is potentially able to promote larval growth, although it requires interactions with other late-stage microbes. Finally, we investigated the molecular basis underlying the distinct larval growth-promoting effects among yeast species, including the supportive <italic>H. uvarum</italic> from the early-stage foods and non-supportive <italic>Pichia kluyveri</italic> and <italic>Starmerella bacillaris</italic> from the late-stage foods. Surprisingly, all the yeast species strongly promoted larval growth upon heat killing. This and additional results indicate that all species produce sufficient nutrients for larval development, but larvae cannot utilize those produced by the live non-supportive species. Our metabolomic analysis and metabolite supplementation assay suggest that only the supportive yeast cells can release critical metabolites for larval growth, including branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine and/or isoleucine. Collectively, our findings detail the key microbial species, their interactions, and the yeast species-dependent supply of nutrients that contribute to the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The composition of both yeast and bacteria in the food microbiota shifts as fermentation progresses, independently of the presence of larvae</title><p>To examine the community structure of the microbiota associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in nature, we collected and analyzed larval foods, fermented bananas, that had been fed on by wild larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A, B</xref>). Because <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and its related species are often found near human settlements, we set traps containing freshly peeled and sliced bananas outside of our residences so that wild flies would lay eggs on the foods. A portion of each food sample was collected as ‘early-stage’ food, while the remaining food was incubated in the laboratory. When the larvae reached the late third instar stage, we collected further fermented ‘late-stage’ food samples (refer to Materials and methods for experimental definitions of early- or late-stage foods). We performed sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the bacterial 16S rRNA region to analyze the composition of fungi and bacteria in individual food samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The composition of both yeast and bacteria in the food microbiota shifts as fermentation progresses, independently of the presence of larvae.</title><p>Sampling designs and results for the analyses of microbial compositions in natural food sources of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<bold>A, B</bold>), effects of larval presence on the microbial composition shift (<bold>C, D</bold>), or microbial compositions in adult flies, larvae, and their foods (<bold>E, F</bold>).

At the family level, the compositions showed dramatic differences between the early and late stages; while Saccharomycodaceae dominated in most of the early-stage foods, Pichiaceae, <italic>Starmerella</italic>, and Saccharomycetaceae became dominant in the late-stage foods. The dominant bacteria also differed between the two stages, with Enterobacterales predominating at the early stage and LAB and AAB predominating at the late stage (bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). Henceforth, we refer to the transition from early-to-late stages in microbial composition as the microbial composition shift or simply the composition shift. In this sampling, we obtained, by chance, a ‘no-fly’ trap; no adult flies were caught in the trap, and no eggs, larvae, or pupae were found in the food at either stage (‘No-fly’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; ‘No-fly trap’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A, B</xref>; refer to ‘Collection of fermented bananas and wild <italic>Drosophila</italic>’ in Materials and methods for further details). We analyzed food samples from this trap for comparison. The microbiota in the foods significantly differed from that of other foods, with a lower percentage of yeast in the fungal community and a consistently high abundance of Enterobacterales in the bacterial community.</p><p>A previous study showed that the presence of larvae influences the community structures of food microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stamps et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the larvae contributed to the composition shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A, C</xref>). We prepared microbe-containing suspensions using newly collected early-stage foods and introduced them to fresh bananas, with or without GF embryos. We then incubated the bananas and examined whether the microbial composition shifts occurred in them. Remarkably, the composition shifts occurred similarly, irrespective of the presence of larvae, as indicated by the decreased proportions of Saccharomycodaceae yeast and Enterobacterales bacteria, along with the increased proportions of Pichiaceae yeasts as well as LAB and AAB (compare ‘Susp’ with ‘w/o L’ or ‘w/L’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C, D</xref>). These findings suggest that the composition shift observed in the food microbiota is unlikely to be solely attributed to the presence of larvae but more plausibly influenced by factors such as interspecies interactions among microbes.</p><p>Furthermore, we analyzed the microbial composition of adult flies captured in traps, as well as the food and larval samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A, D</xref>). This analysis revealed a similar composition of the yeast species in adult flies and early-stage foods, and a similar composition of yeast species in larvae and late-stage foods (top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C</xref>). However, notable dissimilarities were observed in the bacterial compositions between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples and the early-stage foods, primarily attributed to the conspicuous presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sp. (Anaplasmataceae) and <italic>Gilliamella apicola</italic> (Orbaceae) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples (bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2E</xref>).

For this purpose, we performed quantitative PCR to quantify the copy numbers of fungal and bacterial rDNA in each food sample presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D, F</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The analysis indicated that there were no dramatic increases or decreases in copy numbers in most food samples. Note that measuring rDNA copy numbers in the microbiome does not necessarily reflect actual cell numbers due to variations in the genomic rDNA copy numbers among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lofgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stoddard et al., 2015</xref>).

This result implies that AAB possessed the ability to induce a growth-promoting response, but the effect likely did not persist until pupariation. We observed that the growth rate of AAB on banana agar was noticeably lower compared to those of other microbes. This led us to speculate that this lower growth rate might result in a shortage of AAB, leading to undernutrition during the later stage of larval development. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether larval development could recover when AAB was constantly available. Daily supplementation of AAB enabled larvae to pupariate as effectively as the initial co-inoculation of AAB and LAB did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E. F</xref>), demonstrating that AAB can promote larval growth if it is available throughout the course of development.</p><p>The aforementioned observations have prompted us to assume that yeast and LAB contribute to the stable coexistence of AAB and larvae. To investigate this hypothesis, we raised larvae on a diet containing AAB either alone or in conjunction with the other species. After a 4-day incubation, we quantified the abundance of AAB in each tube, including those in the food and those inside the larval body. Co-inoculation with other species led to an average 5- to 19-fold increase in the number of AAB colonies compared to the monoculture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>).

The overall findings closely resembled those obtained from various bacterial species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Gene expression profiles exhibited marked differences between larvae fed on the supportive yeasts and those fed on the non-supportive yeasts, with intermediate responses observed in larvae fed on the mild yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Feeding on the supportive yeasts upregulated genes involved in metabolism and cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>), and the expression profiles under the supportive and the non-supportive yeast diets resembled those observed in fed and starved conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>One potential factor determining the ability of larvae to develop on specific yeast species might be the production or secretion of adequate nutrients for larval growth. To assess whether each yeast species produced sufficient essential nutrients internally, we administered heat-killed yeasts to the larvae. Somewhat surprisingly, strong growth enhancement was observed in all seven yeast species upon heat killing, with <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>S. bacillaris</italic> promoting larval development nearly as effectively as the supportive yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>).

This finding suggests that all of these yeasts do indeed produce the requisite nutrients for larval development; however, it is likely that the nutrients produced by the live non-supportive yeasts are inaccessible to larvae (further analyzed in the subsequent section).</p><p>We also considered the possibility that the non-supportive yeasts somehow inhibited the host growth. To test this possibility, we cultured the yeast species on a nutrient-rich sterile medium and fed them to the larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, J</xref>). This medium contains dry yeast and enables larvae to pupariate even without live yeasts (‘GF’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, J</xref>). Under these conditions, larvae fed with <italic>S. bacillaris</italic> pupariated as efficiently and nearly as rapidly as those without yeasts or with other yeast species, suggesting that <italic>S. bacillaris</italic> did not impede larval growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, J</xref>). In contrast, larvae fed with <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> exhibited a significantly reduced percentage of pupariation compared to larvae grown with the other yeast species or without yeasts. This could be related to the extensive growth of <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> on this food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Nevertheless, none of these yeast species reproduced the low percentage of pupariation of larvae observed on banana agar.

Yeast cells were for the analysis of intracellular metabolites, whereas yeast-conditioned banana-agar plates and cell suspension supernatants were for that of extracellular metabolites. The samples were prepared as the following procedures. Yeasts were grown on banana-agar plates for 2 days at 25°C, and then scraped from the plates to obtain ‘yeast cells’. Next, the remaining yeasts on the resultant plates were thoroughly removed, and a portion from each plate was cut out (‘yeast-conditioned banana agar’).

Therefore, the holidic medium could be considered to contain the minimal essential nutrients required for larval growth. Our analysis indicated a substantial reduction of these known nutrients in the yeast-conditioned plates compared to their original quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The quantities of metabolites within the cells varied markedly among the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>); while the supportive <italic>H. uvarum</italic> contained numerous known metabolites, it was intriguing that <italic>K. humilis</italic>, another supportive species, did not possess as much essential nutrients as other species, including the non-supportive <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>S. bacillaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result, in conjunction with the observations from feeding heat-killed yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>), raises the possibility that the interspecies disparities in metabolites within living yeast cells do not directly influence larval growth. On the other hand, our analysis of the cell suspension supernatant revealed distinct variations in the known nutrients in the holidic medium between the supportive and non-supportive species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). Among these, we focused on BCAAs, leucine and isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that bacteria associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> provide these essential amino acids to the hosts feeding on artificial diets lacking them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henriques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). In our analysis, suspension supernatants of supportive yeasts had concentrations of both leucine and isoleucine that were at least fourfold, on average, higher than those of non-supportive yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6B</xref>).</p><p>The above finding prompted us to explore whether leucine and isoleucine are supplied by the associated supportive yeasts, similar to bacterial symbiosis. To investigate this, we supplemented banana agar with these BCAAs and inoculated it with the non-supportive yeasts, subsequently evaluating the restoration of larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Remarkably, the supplementation of BCAAs elicited a significant improvement in larval development in the presence of the non-supportive yeasts, while it had no effect on larvae fed with the supportive yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). At 12 days after egg laying, a significant increase was observed in the proportion of individuals that had progressed to the second instar or later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggest that the lack of BCAAs in bananas inoculated with the non-supportive yeast species is one of the causes of larval growth deficiency. Additionally, we explored the conservation of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for leucine and isoleucine among the isolated yeast strains. We performed de novo genome assembly and annotation for the six yeast species and examined the presence of orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

The result of this genomic analysis also strengthens the possibility that differences in the ability of yeasts to support larvae do not stem from variances in their ability to biosynthesize BCAAs, but rather in their ability to provide BCAAs in an available form to the larvae.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Supportive yeasts facilitate larval growth by providing nutrients, including branched-chain amino acids, by releasing them from their cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Growth of larvae feeding on yeasts on banana agar supplemented with leucine and isoleucine.

A previous study reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have profound effects on the community structure of yeasts in fermented bananas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stamps et al., 2012</xref>). Our experiment, however, suggests that the microbial composition shift observed in our food samples is plausibly influenced by factors such as interspecies interactions among microbes. These discrepancies may be due in part to differences in experimental conditions possibly including larval densities, food sample volumes, or culture vessels.</p><p>Another implication from our microbial composition analysis is a possible composition shift occurring in the adult intestine. The microbiota of late-third instar larvae resemble those of the late-stage foods they fed on, whereas those of trap-caught adults are similar to those of the corresponding early-stage foods. This result suggests a potential change in microbial composition during pupal stages or after adult eclosion. Unlike developing larvae, which continually consume fermented foods throughout the feeding stages, adults move among a number of food sources, which could lead to the acquisition of new microbes. Additionally, some bacteria have recently been demonstrated to colonize the adult intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dodge et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pais et al., 2018</xref>), possibly contributing to the formation of adult microbiota through the dominance of microbes with a propensity to colonize the intestine.</p><p>As for the origin of food microbiota, the initial microbial inoculation to foods is assumed to be mediated by adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broderick and Lemaitre, 2012</xref>). Our study revealed the presence of common microbes between our early-stage foods and adult fly samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C, E</xref>). Furthermore, the foods from the ‘no-fly’ trap harbored distinct microbiota compared to those from other traps. The distinction was marked by the presence of <italic>Colletotrichum musae</italic>, which is the causal agent of banana anthracnose and might have been present in fresh bananas, and filamentous fungi, which could have originated from airborne spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>). These results support the previously proposed microbial inoculation to the foods by adult flies. However, alternative sources of microbes should also be considered. For example, microbes may have been infiltrated in unpeeled bananas through peel injuries, as microbial rDNA was detected in bananas that had not undergone microbial inoculation (‘Blank’ samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). In addition, they could be introduced by other insects such as rove beetles and sap beetles, which were found in some of the traps, sharing the same habitat with <italic>Drosophila</italic> spp. Further investigation is required to determine the inoculation routes of the microbes in larval foods.</p><p>In the early stage of fermentation, both the predominant yeast and bacterial species were capable of supporting larval growth on their own. However, in stark contrast, at the late stage of fermentation, microbial interactions assumed a crucial role. While AAB provide sufficient nutritional resources to support larval growth, their growth rate on bananas is suboptimal. On the other hand, other associated microbes may lack essential nutrients for larvae but contribute to establishing a stable association between AAB and the larvae. Previous studies have reported interactions between AAB and LAB in artificial foods, where AAB act as a source of nutrients, including amino acids, while LAB provide lactic acid as a substrate for amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Consuegra et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henriques et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings have demonstrated that LAB also play a supportive role in the symbiotic relationship between larvae and AAB on a fruit, a natural food source of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. It is worth noting that interactions may also occur between the AAB and the late-stage yeasts. We observed the presence of various metabolites not only in the suspension supernatant of the supportive yeast species but also in that of the non-supportive late-stage yeast species. Therefore, the growth of AAB on fruits could be enhanced through the utilization of such metabolites by the bacterium.</p><p>In laboratory settings, yeasts are recognized and employed as important nutritional sources for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, providing essential nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumberger, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broderick and Lemaitre, 2012</xref>). In our study, we have demonstrated that during larval growth on their natural food sources, the associated yeasts contribute to the provision of BCAAs, leucine, and/or isoleucine. Of these two amino acids, the availability of leucine acts as an effective regulatory signal for the mTORC1 pathway, as established in both mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). The mTORC1 pathway governs metabolism and cell growth in response to nutritional conditions. Indeed, the expression levels of numerous genes involved in these processes exhibited significant up- or down-regulation in larvae fed on supportive microbes compared to those fed on non-supportive microbes or GF individuals. Nonetheless, supplementing these BCAAs alone did not fully restore larval growth, suggesting that there should be other key nutrients. Our metabolomic analysis did not encompass some known metabolites, including lipids. Among these, sterols, substrates for ecdysone biosynthesis, are indispensable for larval growth. However, sterols are unlikely to be lacking in the fermented bananas. In our experiments, <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> and <italic>A. orientalis</italic> did promote larval growth, but most bacteria, including the two aforementioned species, lack the steroid biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoshino and Gaucher, 2021</xref>). Therefore, larvae can grow on bananas without bacterial-derived sterols. Deficiency in other lipids is also unlikely, because larvae can grow on the holidic medium for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that contains cholesterol as a sole lipid component, and the developmental delay on the medium is rescued by a ‘critical element’ which is ‘not a lipid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, microbial nutrients that promote larval growth, whose functions have not yet been identified in this study, may be components other than lipids.</p><p>Despite the well-recognized importance of yeast as a source of nutrients, limited studies have reported the detailed process of how these nutrients are utilized by larvae. Our results suggest that for yeasts to serve as nutritional sources, they should not only produce the nutrients, but also release them outside the cells. The amount of nutrients released extracellularly varied among yeast species. This could be explained by varying abilities to secrete metabolites, although yeasts are unlikely to release the nutrients that are also beneficial to themselves. Another possibility suggested for <italic>K. humilis</italic> was that this species is more prone to death on the culture medium, thus releasing more nutrients. Indeed, yeast autolysates are reported to contain various known nutrients, such as proteins, lipids, and B-group vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rakowska et al., 2017</xref>). More thorough investigations should be conducted on another supportive yeast, <italic>H. uvarum</italic>, to assess its mortality on banana-agar plates.</p><p>Our results indicate that yeast cells are not necessarily digested in the larval gut, which might contradict previous reports. For instance, vegetative cells of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have been reported to be digested in the gut of adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coluccio et al., 2008</xref>). However, the digestibility of yeast may vary depending on the species of yeast, diet composition, or developmental stage of the host. Indeed, a study has discussed the possibility that <italic>S. bacillaris</italic> is not digested in the larval gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solomon et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, by focusing on the non-model yeast species associated with wild flies, we revealed part of the mechanism by which wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae utilize yeast as a nutrient source.</p><p>To date, the majority of studies on animal-associated yeasts have focused on a limited number of specific species that are either pathogenic or employed for fermenting foods. In this study, we have examined the species composition of yeasts that make up the symbiotic mycobiota of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and analyzed the roles of each predominant species by investigating their interactions with bacteria as well as with the host. To obtain a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the function of animal microbiota, future studies should further explore the contribution of associated yeasts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains and culture</title><p><italic>D. melanogaster Canton-Special</italic> (E-10002) strain was obtained from EHIME-Fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stocks of Ehime University.

The sampling places, near laboratory members’ apartments or houses in Kyoto and Osaka prefectures, Japan, or outside the laboratory at Kyoto University, are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. Bananas were selected as bait considering their use in previous <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anagnostou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Consuegra et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stamps et al., 2012</xref>). They are also affordable and available year-round, which would be advantageous for subsequent analyses requiring large amounts of fruit-based culture media. Peels of ripening bananas were treated with 70% ethanol and then removed carefully so as not to touch the fruit inside to avoid contamination. The bananas were subsequently cut into pieces with an autoclaved sterile spatula, and placed in a sterile 100-ml centrifuge tube (Iwaki). Each trap was made of an empty milk carton, and contained one tube of banana bait.</p><p>Traps were set up for 2.5 days, which duration was determined from pilot experiments; a shorter collection time resulted in a lower likelihood of obtaining traps visited by adult flies, whereas a longer collection time caused overcrowding of larvae as well as deaths of adults from drowning in the liquid seeping out of the fruits. When the traps were collected, wild flies or their eggs/larvae were found in all traps or foods, except for one (the ‘no-fly’ trap). In the sampling shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>, rove beetles (Staphylinidae) and sap beetles (Nitidulidae) were found in several foods. These insects appeared to share a niche with wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> in nature, suggesting that the presence of these insects did not interfere with our goal of obtaining larval food samples. The non-drosophilid insects were removed from the foods immediately after the trap collection. 3–5 ml of the foods (early-stage foods) were sampled, and the remaining foods were incubated at 25°C. Four to five days later, when late third instar larvae were seen in all foods except for the one from the no-fly trap, the foods were collected (late-stage foods). At the first sampling, we added GF embryos of GFP-expressing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> laboratory strain (<italic>Cg-Gal4</italic>, <italic>UAS-mCD8:GFP</italic>) to obtain <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae that were reared in the fermented food, but we could not sample them because most animals apparently drowned in the juice that seeped out of the fermented bananas.</p><p>To obtain early-stage-food suspensions, newly obtained early-stage foods were crushed in autoclaved sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and after vigorous mixing, the liquid was collected carefully without taking bananas, embryos, or larvae. 200 µl of this microbial suspension (or sterile PBS for Blank) was added to 100 ml tubes containing fresh ripening banana with or without ~200 GF embryos (<italic>Cg-Gal4</italic>, <italic>UAS-mCD8:GFP</italic>). The bananas were incubated at 25°C for 4 days. Late-stage foods were collected as described above. Larvae collected from the food were examined under a fluorescent microscope to make sure they were derived from the embryos we added and not from contaminating wild embryos. When sterile PBS was added to bananas instead of microbial suspensions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the food showed no apparent change in appearance or odor during the 4-day incubation, and larvae in the food remained at the first instar stage. The amounts of microbes detected in such foods were less than those obtained for the food inoculated with the microbial suspension by 2–4 orders of magnitude (‘Blank’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>; see details in the legend).</p><p>All the food samples were collected after removing embryos and larvae, and snap-frozen. Larvae were surface sterilized using the same procedure as embryo samples before snap-freezing. Adult flies in the traps were collected following different procedures depending on whether their microbiota were analyzed. When the adult samples were solely utilized for species identification, the whole bodies were stored in 100% or 70% ethanol. When we also required samples for microbial analysis, after washing the whole bodies in 70% ethanol, the head, external genitalia, and wings of each fly were removed and stored in 70% ethanol and subsequently used to identify the species.

In experiments that require daily addition of AAB, the bacterial cells (a lump of ~3 µl by volume per tube) were added daily. As more individuals pupariated, less bacteria were consumed each day.

Sequence coverages estimated by GenomeScope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vurture et al., 2017</xref>) were over ×100 for all genomes (×103.42–×210.48). For ONT sequencing, libraries were prepared with Rapid Barcoding Kit (ONT) and sequenced using the R9.4.1 flow cell with the MinION platform, followed by base-calling using Albacore ver. 2.3.3 (ONT). Adapter sequences of MinION reads were trimmed with NanoFilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Coster et al., 2018</xref>) or Porechop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop">https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wick, 2018</xref>), followed by filtering with a quality threshold of 10 and a length threshold of 2000. After filtering, 84,598–197,215 reads (765–4402 Mb in total sequence length) were obtained for each genome (average; 121,913 reads and 1035 Mb). Estimated sequence coverages by MinION reads were ×63.1–×107.3 (average; ×87.9).</p><p>For RNA-seq analysis, equal amounts of yeast cells cultured under six conditions (two temperatures: 25 and 30°C, and three culture plates: MRS, YPD, or banana-agar plates) were mixed and used for RNA extraction. RNA was extracted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iida and Kobayashi, 2019</xref>) and purified using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Libraries for RNA-seq were prepared with NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) and sequenced on the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina) to generate 300-base paired end sequences which were used for annotation described below. A total of 23.48–26.75 M reads were obtained for each yeast (average; 25.63 M reads).</p><p>Genome assembly was performed by MaSuRCA v3.2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zimin et al., 2013</xref>) using MiSeq and MinION reads. In the heterozygosity rate estimation by GenomeScope based on MiSeq reads, the <italic>K. humilis</italic> and <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> genomes showed higher heterozygosity rates (<italic>K. humilis</italic>; 2.98%, <italic>P. kluyveri</italic>; 2.08%) while those of other genomes were 0.02–1.00%. In the assessment of autoannotated genome assemblies using BUSCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simão et al., 2015</xref>), completeness was over 86% in the four genomes other than the <italic>H. uvarum</italic> (64.58%) and <italic>S. bacillaris</italic> (75.21%) genomes. However, among the four genomes, those of <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>K. humilis</italic> showed a high proportion of ‘Duplicated complete’ genes (<italic>K. humilis</italic>; 27.74%, <italic>P. kluyveri</italic>; 5.17%, respectively), which was apparently due to the high heterozygosity rate of these genomes. Therefore, these two genomes were assembled using Platanus-allee v2.2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kajitani et al., 2019</xref>), and by comparing it with the MaSuRCA assemblies using GenomeMatcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohtsubo et al., 2008</xref>), redundant sequences in the MaSuRCA assemblies were identified and removed from the assemblies. As the proportions of ‘Duplicated complete’ genes estimated by BUSCO were 5.51% for the <italic>K. humilis</italic> genome and 0.74% for the <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> genome after removing redundant sequences, these redundant sequence-removed genome assemblies were used as the final genome assemblies of <italic>P. kluyveri</italic> and <italic>K. humilis</italic>.</p><p>Genome annotation was performed using FunGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Min et al., 2017</xref>) with the above-mentioned RNA-seq data obtained from each yeast.

In the assessment of annotated genomes using BUSCO, completeness was &gt;86% for the four genomes other than those of <italic>H. uvarum</italic> (65.95%) and <italic>S. bacillaris</italic> (76.92%).

The samples were resolved on the Discovery HS F5-3 column (2.1 mm ID × 150 mm, 3 μm particle, Sigma-Aldrich), using a step gradient with mobile phase A (0.1% formate/water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formate/acetonitrile) at ratios of 100:0 (0–5 min), 75:25 (5–11 min), 65:35 (11–15 min), 5:95 (15–20 min), and 100:0 (20–25 min), at a flow rate of 0.25 ml min<sup>−1</sup> and a column temperature of 40°C. Chromatogram peaks obtained with compound-specific MRM channels were integrated and manually confirmed. If more than one confirmatory MRM channel was available for the target compound, it was set to confirm the identification of the peak compound. Structural isomers were separated either by retention time on the column or by compound-specific MRM signals. Detailed MRM conditions are identical to the previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oka et al., 2017</xref>). To further confirm the signal specificity, sample-derived chromatographic peaks were compared with the corresponding standards to ensure that retention times were consistent. Peak quantification values obtained for each compound were corrected for recovery due to L-Met in the IS.

The authors use bacterial and fungal species associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> in the wild to analyze their respective contributions in promoting larval growth in a decaying banana, mimicking the natural niche of fruit fly. They found that some fungal species and some fungus/bacteria combinations effectively promote growth by supplementing key branched amino acids in the food substratum. Production of these amino acids by <italic>Drosophila</italic> itself is not sufficient, and only fungal species that secrete these amino acids into the medium can sustain <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth. Thus, the authors clarify how facultative symbionts contribute to host growth in a natural setting by changing the food substratum in a dynamic manner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The natural setting developed by the authors to analyze the impact of the microbiota is clearly valuable, as is the focus on the role of fungal microbiota species. This complements studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiota that have previously focused on bacterial species and used a lab setting.</p><p>While there has been an extensive focus on obligate endosymbionts or gut symbionts, this study analyzes how facultative symbionts shape the food substratum and influence host growth.</p><p>A last strength of this study is that it analyzes the contribution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiota over a dynamic timeframe, analyzing how microbial species change in decaying fruit over time.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The author should better review what we know of fungal <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiota species as well as the ecology of rotting fruit. Are the microbiota species described in this article specific to their location/setting? It would have been interesting to know if similar species can be retrieved in other locations using other decaying fruits. The term 'core' in the title suggests that these species are generally found associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> but this is not demonstrated. The paper is written in a way that implies the microbiota members they have found are universal. What is the evidence for this? Have the fungal species described in this paper been found in other studies? Even if this is not the case, the paper is interesting, but there should be a discussion of how generalizable the findings are.</p><p>2. Can the author clearly demonstrate that the microbiota species that develop in the banana trap are derived from flies? Are these species found in flies in the wild? Did the authors check that the flies belong to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species and not to the sister group D. simulans?</p><p>3. Did the microarrays highlight a change in immune genes (ex. antibacterial peptide genes)? Whatever the answer, this would be worth mentioning. The authors described their microarray data in terms of fed/starved in relation to the Finke article. This is fine they should clarify if they observed significant differences between species (differences between species within bacteria or fungi, and more generally differences between bacteria versus fungi).</p><p>4. The whole paper - and this is one of its merits - points to a role of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval microbiota in processing the fly food. Are these bacterial and fungal species found in the gut of larvae/adults? Are these species capable of establishing a niche in the cardia of adults as shown recently in by the Ludington lab (Dodge et al.,)? Previous studies have suggested that microbiota members stimulate the Imd pathway leading to an increase in digestive proteases (Erkosar/Leulier). Are the microbiota species studied here affecting gut signaling pathways beyond providing branched amino acids?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90148.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Mure et al investigated host-microbe interactions in wild-mimicked settings. They analyzed microbiome composition using bananas that had been fed on by wild larvae and found that the microbiota composition shifted from the early stage of feeding to the later stage of the fermentation process proceeded. They isolated several yeast and bacterial species from the food, and examined larval growth on banana-based food, mimicking natural setting where germ-free larvae cannot grow on it. The authors found that a yeast, Hanseniaspora uvarum, can support larval growth sufficiently, and insists that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) provided by the yeast may partly be accounted for the growth support. Interestingly, other isolated yeast species, some were non-supportive strains in terms of larval growth, can assist larval development when they were heat-killed. Besides, they showed that acetic acid bacteria, isolated from well-fermented banana (later-stage food), is sufficiently supportive but their presence depended on other microbes, lactic acid bacteria or yeast.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>So far, host-microbe studies using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have relatively less focused on the roles of fungi and many studies used only &quot;model&quot; yeasts. In the experimental setting where natural conditions may be well mimicked, the authors successfully isolated wild yeast species and convincingly showed that wild yeast plays a critical role in promoting host growth. In addition, the authors provided intriguing observations that all of the heat-killed yeast promoted larval growth even though some of the yeast never support the development when they were alive, suggesting that wild yeasts produce the necessary nutrients for larval development, but the nutrients of non-supportive yeasts are not accessible to the host. This might be an interesting indication for further studies revealing host-fungi interactions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The experimental setting that, the authors think, reflects host-microbe interactions in nature is one of the key points. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether isolated microbes are indeed colonized in wild larvae of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> who eat bananas. Another matter is that this work is rather descriptive. A molecular level explanation is missing in &quot;interspecies interactions&quot; between lactic acid bacteria (or yeast) and acetic acid bacteria that assure their inhabitation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90148.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary: In this manuscript, Mure et al. describe interactions between diet, microbiome, and host development using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model.

How the interactions between different microbial species within the microbiome shape host physiology is an area of great interest but equally challenging due to the complexity of intercellular interactions in complex, host-associated microbial communities. By using a simplified model and interrogating not only microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions, but also the role played by diet, authors were able to identify significant interactions during fly development.</p><p>Weaknesses: All weaknesses observed in the original manuscript have been corrected in the current version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful evaluation of our manuscript. We considered all the comments and prepared the revised version. The following are our responses to the reviewers’ comments. All references, including those in the original manuscript are included at the end of this point-by-point response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The authors should better review what we know of fungal <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiota species as well as the ecology of rotting fruit. Are the microbiota species described in this article specific to their location/setting? It would have been interesting to know if similar species can be retrieved in other locations using other decaying fruits. The term 'core' in the title suggests that these species are generally found associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> but this is not demonstrated. The paper is written in a way that implies the microbiota members they have found are universal. What is the evidence for this? Have the fungal species described in this paper been found in other studies? Even if this is not the case, the paper is interesting, but there should be a discussion of how generalizable the findings are.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer inquires as to whether the microbial species described in this article are ubiquitously associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> or not. Indeed, most of the microbes described in this manuscript are generally recognized as species associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> spp. For example, yeasts such as Hanseniaspora uvarum, Pichia kluyveri, and Starmerella bacillaris have been detected in or isolated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> spp. collected in European countries as well as the United States and Oceania (Chandler et al., 2012; Solomon et al., 2019). As for bacteria, species belonging to the genera Pantoea, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Acetobacter have also previously been detected in wild <italic>Drosophila</italic> spp. (Chandler et al.,2011). These statements have been incorporated into our revised manuscript (lines 391-397).Nevertheless, the term “core” in the manuscript and title may lead tomisunderstanding, as the generality does not ensure the ubiquitous presence of these microbial species in every individual fly. Considering this point, we replaced the “core” with “key,” a term that is more appropriate to our context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Can the authors clearly demonstrate that the microbiota species that develop in the banana trap are derived from flies? Are these species found in flies in the wild? Did the authors check that the flies belong to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species and not to the sister group D. simulans?</p><p>Can the authors clearly demonstrate that the microbiota species that develop in the banana trap are derived from flies? Are these species found in flies in the wild?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asked whether the microbial species detected from the fermented banana samples were derived from flies. To address this question, additional experiments under more controlled conditions would be needed, such as artificially introducing wild flies onto fresh bananas in the laboratory. Nevertheless, the microbes potentially originate from wild flies, as supported by the literature cited in our response to the Weakness 1.</p><p>Alternative sources of microbes also merit consideration. For example, microbes may have been introduced to unfermented bananas by penetration through peel injuries (lines 1300-1301). In addition, they could be introduced by insects other than flies, given that rove beetles (Staphylinidae) and sap beetles (Nitidulidae) were observed in some of the traps.The explanation of these possibilities have been incorporated into DISCUSSION (lines 414427) of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors check that the flies belong to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species and not to the sister group D. simulans?</p></disp-quote><p>Our sampling strategy was designed to target not only <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> but also other domestic <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, such as D. simulans, that inhabit human residential areas. For the traps where adult flies were caught, we identified the species of the drosophilids as shown in Table S1, thereby showing the presence of either or both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and D. simulans. We added these descriptions in MATERIALS AND METHODS (lines 511-512 and 560-562), and DISCUSSION (lines 378-379).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Did the microarrays highlight a change in immune genes (ex. antibacterial peptide genes)? Whatever the answer, this would be worth mentioning. The authors described their microarray data in terms of fed/starved in relation to the Finke article. They should clarify if they observed significant differences between species (differences between species within bacteria or fungi, and more generally differences between bacteria versus fungi).</p><p>Did the microarrays highlight a change in immune genes (ex. antibacterial peptide genes)?Whatever the answer, this would be worth mentioning.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the antimicrobial peptide genes, statistical comparisons of our RNA-seq data across different conditions were impracticable because most of the genes showed low expression levels. The RNA-seq data of the yeast-fed larvae is shown in Author response Table 1. While a subset of genes exhibited significantly elevated expression in the nonsupportive conditions relative to the supportive ones, this can be due to intra-sample variability rather than the difference in the nutritional conditions. Similar expression profiles were observed in the bacteria-fed larvae as well (data not shown). Therefore, it is difficult to discuss a change in immune genes in the paper. Additionally, the previous study that conducted larval microarray analysis (Zinke et al., 2002) did not explicitly focus on immune genes.</p><table-wrap id="sa4table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Antimicrobial peptide genes are not up-regulated by any of the microbes.</title><p>Antimicrobial peptides gene expression profiles of whole bodies of first-instar larvae fed on yeasts.

This observation implies that consumption of BCAAs upregulates diverse genes involved in cellular growth processes in larvae. We mentioned a previously reported interaction between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) in the manuscript (lines 433-436). LAB may facilitate lactate provision to AAB, consequently enhancing the biosynthesis of essential nutrients such as amino acids. To test this hypothesis, future experiments will include the supplementation of lactic acid to AAB culture plates, and the co-inoculation of AAB with LAB mutant strains defective in lactate production to assess both larval growth and continuous larval association with AAB. With respect to AAB-yeast interactions, metabolites released from yeast cells might benefit AAB growth, and this possibility will be investigated through the supplementation of AAB culture plates with candidate metabolites identified in the cell suspension supernatants of the late-stage yeasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Apart from these matters, the future directions or significance of this work could be discussed more in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's recommendations.

The use of PFPP columns, which provide excellent separation of amino acids and nucleobases, allows chromatographic peaks of many structural isomers to be separated into independent peaks. In addition, all measured compounds are compared with data from a standard library to confirm retention time agreement. Structural isomers were separated either by retention time on the column or by compound-specific MRM signals (in fact, leucine and isoleucine have both unique MRM channels and column separations).

We suspected that the supportive live yeast cells may release critical nutrients for larval growth, whereas the non-supportive yeasts may not. To test this possibility, we made three distinct sample preparations of individual yeast strains (yeast cells, yeast-conditioned banana-agar plates, and cell suspension supernatants). Yeast cells were for the analysis of intracellular metabolites, whereas yeast-conditioned banana-agar plates and cell suspension supernatants were for that of extracellular metabolites. The samples were prepared as the following procedures. Yeasts were grown on banana-agar plates for 2 days at 25°C, and then scraped from the plates to obtain “yeast cells.” Next, the remaining yeasts on the resultant plates were thoroughly removed, and a portion from each plate was cut out (“yeast-conditioned banana agar”). In addition, we suspended yeast cells from the agar plates into sterile PBS, followed by centrifugation and filtration to eliminate the yeast cells, to prepare “cell suspension supernatants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We have introduced this explanation to the RESULTS section of the manuscript (lines 322-327).

H. uvarum is predominant in the early-stage food and provides Leu, Ile, and other nutrients that are required for larval growth. In the late-stage food, AAB directly provides nutrients, while LAB and yeasts indirectly contribute to larval growth by enabling the stable larva-AAB association. The host larva responds to the nutritional environment by dramatically altering gene expression profiles, which leads to growth and pupariation.

Line 323 - Consider rewriting this sentence (too long, explain what the holidic medium is and why this is interesting). &quot;In the yeast-conditioned banana-agar plates, which were anticipated to contain yeast-derived nutrients, many well-known nutrients included in a chemically defined synthetic (holidic) medium for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Piper et al., 2014, 2017) were not increased compared to the sterile banana-agar plates; instead, they exhibited drastic decreases irrespective of the yeast species.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer's suggestion to improve the readability of our manuscript. We have rewritten the sentence in the revised manuscript (lines 320-328) as follows: “The yeastconditioned banana-agar plates were expected to contain yeast-derived nutrients. On the contrary, the result revealed a depletion of various metabolites originally present in the sterile banana agar (Figure 5A). This result prompted us to focus on the metabolites in the chemically defined (holidic) medium for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Piper et al., 2014; Piper et al., 2017. This medium contains ~40 known nutrients, and supports the larval development to pupariation, albeit at the half rate compared to that on a yeast-containing standard laboratory food Piper et al., 2014; Piper et al., 2017. Therefore, the holidic medium could be considered to contain the minimal essential nutrients required for larval growth. Our analysis indicated a substantial reduction of these known nutrients in the yeast-conditioned plates compared to their original quantities (Figure 5B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data or analyses.</p><p>1. It should be clearly shown (or stated) that isolated microbes, such as H. uvarum and Pa. agglomerans, are indigenous microbes in wild <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in their outdoor sampling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Addressing the presence of isolated microbes within wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adults is important, but cannot be feasible with our data for the following reasons. Our microbiota analysis of adults was conducted using pooled individuals of multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, rather than using <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> exclusively. Moreover, the microbial isolation and the analysis of adult microbiota were carried out in two independent samplings (Figures 1A and 1E in the original manuscript, respectively). As a result, the microbial species detected in the adults were slightly different from those isolated from the food samples collected in the previous sampling. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that H. uvarum dominated in 2 out of the 3 adult samples, constituting &gt;80% of the fungal composition. Pantoea agglomerans was not detected in the adults, although Enterobacterales accounted for &gt;59% in 2 out of the 3 samples. Therefore, these isolated microbial species, or at least their phylogenetically related species, are presumed to be indigenous to wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>If the reviewer’s suggestion was to state the dominance of H. uvarum and Pantoea agglomerans in early-stage foods, we have added a supplemental figure showing the species-level microbial compositions corresponding to Figure 1B of the original manuscript (Figure S1), and further revised the manuscript (lines 180-186).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The reviewer supposes that the indigenous microbes of flies may differ from what they usually eat. In this study, the authors use banana-based food, but is it justified in terms of the natural environment of the places where those microbes were isolated? In other words, did sampled wild flies eat bananas outside the laboratory at Kyoto University?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> spp. inhabit human residential areas and feed on various fermented fruits and vegetables. In the areas surrounding Kyoto University, they can be found in garbage in residential dwellings as well as supermarkets. In this regard, fruits are natural food sources of wild Drosophila in the area.</p><p>Among various fruits, bananas were selected based on the following two reasons. Firstly, bananas were commonly used in previous <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies as a trap bait or a component of <italic>Drosophila</italic> food (Anagnostou et al., 2010; Stamps et al., 2012; Consuegra et al., 2020). Secondly, and rather practically, bananas can be obtained in Japan all year at a relatively low cost. Previous studies have used various fruits such as grapes (Quan and Eisen, 2018), figs (Pais et al., 2018), and raspberries (Cho and Rohlfs, 2023). However, these fruits are only available during limited seasons and are more expensive per volume than bananas. Thus, they were not practical for our study, which required large amounts of fruit-based culture media. We have included a brief explanation regarding this point in MATERIALS AND METHODS (lines 514-518).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Fig. 6B, the Leu and Ile experiment, is the added amount of those amino acids appropriate in the context that they mention &quot;...... supportive yeasts had concentrations of both leucine and isoleucine that were at least four-fold higher than those of non-supportive yeasts&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the supplementation should be carried out ideally in a quantity equivalent to the difference between the released amounts of supportive and non-supportive species. However, achieving this has been highly challenging. Previous studies determined the amount of amino acid supplementation by quantifying their concentration in the bacteriaconditioned media (Consuegra et al., 2020; Henriques et al., 2020). However, we found that quantifying the exact concentrations of the amino acids is not feasible with our yeasts. As shown in Figure 5B in the original manuscript, the amino acid contents were markedly reduced in the yeast-conditioned banana agar compared to the agar without yeasts, presumably because of the uptake by the yeasts. Thus, the amino acids released from yeast cells on the banana-agar plate are not expected to accumulate in the medium. As this reviewer pointed out, in the cell suspension supernatants of the supportive yeasts, concentrations of both leucine and isoleucine were at least four-fold higher compared to those of non-supportive yeasts (Figures 5G-H in the original submission), However, this measurement does not give the absolute amount of either amino acid available for larvae. Given these constraints, we opted for the amino acid concentrations in the holidic medium, which support larval growth under axenic conditions (Piper et al., 2014). We also showed that the supplementation of the amino acids at that concentration to the bananaagar plate was not detrimental to larval growth (Figures 6A-B in the original manuscript). These rationales have been included in the revised ‘Developmental progression with BCAA supplementation’ section in MATERIALS AND METHODS of our manuscript (lines 840-847).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In addition to the above, it can be included other amino acids or nutrients as control experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our manuscript (lines 365-368), we did supplement other amino acids, lysine and asparagine, which failed to rescue the larval growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the experiment of Fig. 2E, how about examining larval development using heat-killed LAB or yeast with live AAB? The reviewer speculates that one possibility is that AAB needs nutrients from LAB.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not feed larvae with heat-killed LAB and live AAB for the following reasons. LAB grows very poorly on banana agar compared to yeasts, and preparation of LAB required many banana-agar plates even when we fed live bacteria to larvae. Adding dead LAB to banana-agar tubes would require far more plates, but this preparation is impractical. Furthermore, heat-killing may not allow the investigation of the contribution of heat-unstable or volatile compounds.</p><p>As for the reviewer's suggestion regarding the addition of heat-killed yeast with AAB, heat-killed yeast itself promotes larval growth, as shown in Figures 4G and 4H in the original manuscript, so the contribution of yeast cannot be examined using this method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p><p>1. It would be good to mention that during sample collection, other insects (other than <italic>Drosophila</italic> species) were not found in the food if this is true.</p></disp-quote><p>Insects other than <italic>Drosophila</italic> spp. were found in several traps in the sampling shown in Figures 1C-F.

The yeasts were revived from frozen stocks on banana-agar plates, incubated at 25°C, and then streaked on fresh agar plates. After 2-day incubation, yeast cells were scraped from the plates and suspended in PBS at the concentration of 400 mg of yeast cells in 500 µL of PBS. 125 µL of the suspensions were added to banana-agar tubes prepared as described, and after centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5 min, the supernatants were removed. The amount of cells in each tube is ~50x compared to that when feeding live yeasts, which compensates for the reduced amount due to their inability to proliferate. The tubes were subsequently heated at 80°C for 30 min before adding germ-free larvae.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

To estimate the microbial rDNA copy number, we assumed that the proportion of microbial rDNA within the total amplification products remains consistent between the qPCR and the corresponding sequencing analysis, because the template DNA samples and amplified regions were shared between the analyses. Based on this, the copy number of microbial rDNA was estimated by multiplying the qPCR results with the microbial rDNA ratio observed in the ITS or 16S sequencing analysis of each sample.

In Figure S1, authors showed that bananas that were not inoculated still had detectable rDNA signal. Is this really because bacteria can penetrate the peel? Or could this be the “reagent microbiome”? Alternatively, could these microbes have been introduced during sample prep, such as cutting the bananas?</p></disp-quote><p>The detection of rDNA in bananas that were not inoculated with microbes was unlikely to be due to microbial contamination during experimental manipulation. The reviewer pointed out the possibility that the “reagent microbiome”, presumably the microbes in PBS, are detected from the uninoculated bananas. This seems to be unlikely, considering the PBS was sterilized by autoclaving before use. To ensure that no viable microbe was left in the autoclaved PBS, we applied a portion of the PBS onto a banana-agar plate and confirmed no colony was formed after incubation for a few days. DNA derived from dead microbes might be present in the PBS, but the PBS-added bananas were incubated for 4 days, so it is also unlikely that a detectable amount of DNA remained until sample collection. Furthermore, we believe that no contamination occurred during sample preparation. Banana peels were treated with 70% ethanol before removing them extremely carefully to avoid touching the fruit inside. All tools were sterilized before use. Taking all of these into account, we speculate that the microbes were already present in the bananas before peeling.
