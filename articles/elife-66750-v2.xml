The robust development of intricate body structures is striking in light of the complexity of the process, involving a vast number of molecular constituents and interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Despite insights into the molecular complexity of an organismâs developmental program and the intricacies of the mechano-chemical dynamics involved, we lack a deep understanding of how robustness emerges within a complex developmental program and what its generic quantitative signatures must be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Visser et al., 2003</xref>). The existence of robustness hints at the existence of global constraints within the development program that ensure that the inevitable fluctuations in underlying mechanisms invariably lead to similar outcomes.</p><p>It has been noted that there is an apparent paradox related to robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masel and Siegal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Masel and Trotter, 2010</xref>). If some body structure shows evidence of evolving within or between species, it would seem that robustness would antagonize its evolvability. It suggestsÂ that there is a conflict between the demands for developmental robustness and the requirement for evolvability. In particular, global constraints on the spectrum of developmental outcomes restrict the nature of varieties that can be selected for by the environment. One explanation to resolve this conflict supposes that the constraints can be temporarily alleviated, resulting in sudden expression of phenotypic diversity from the underlying genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waddington, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hermisson and Wagner, 2004</xref>). It is unclear how the constraints are alleviated during the natural evolutionary history of organisms. Another explanation supposes that the constraints allow for many different genotypes to generate similar, though not identical, phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner, 2008</xref>) Thus, there are many mutations and combinations of mutations that can elicit similar phenotypic change. These very constraints might ensure that the map from an organismâs genotype to phenotype is not idiosyncratic.</p><p>To address these issues, we put forward a general mathematical strategy for the direct quantification of the degree and nature of developmental robustness of a wholly integrated body organ. Historically, developmental robustness has been measured by focusing on one or a few discrete traits that are small parts of a much larger body structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waddington, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dun and Fraser, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rendel, 1959</xref>). Moreover, methods to quantify the morphology of large body structures have all relied on an arbitrary fragmentation of the structure into a handful of composite measurable traits, referred to as landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kendall, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bookstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dryden and Mardia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abouchar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klingenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klingenberg and Gidaszewski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">PÃ©labon et al., 2006</xref>). Logically then, landmark-based analysis of morphology is potentially missing important features of morphological variation and an incomplete measure of more global properties such as robustness. We propose that a landmark-free approach to align and statistically analyze a large number of individual variants defines the appropriate statistical ensemble to make apparent any global constraints in play within a developmental system.</p><p>We have chosen the model system of the wing of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to conduct this analysis.

Remarkably, we find that the outcomes of wing development can be statistically described by a one-dimensional (1D)Â linear manifold in morphological space that corresponds to a non-intuitive combination of structural variations across the wing. This dominant mode is systematically excited by variants generated by very weak mutations in signaling pathway genes as well as by thermal and dietary environmental perturbations. As such, our work provides direct empirical evidence for the presence of global constraints within the developmental program of the wing, funneling environmental inputs and genetic variation into phenotypes stretched along a single axis in morphological space. Our work is a step towards a quantitative characterization and explanation of the robustness of complex living forms. While the developmental outcomes are globally constrained, there exists the potential for morphological variation along the unconstrained direction. This provides a dissolution of the apparent conflict between robustness and evolvability. Finally, this general strategy used to study the wing formulates an approach for finding such constraints in a broader class of developmental processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Landmark-free morphometrics</title><p>Current approaches to morphological phenotyping are particularly problematic for body structures with complex form and pattern, where spatial information is often arbitrarily discretized into landmarks â anatomical loci that are homologous in all individuals being analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1aâc</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones and Mahadevan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi and Mahadevan, 2018</xref>). Analysis of phenotypic variation has additional challenges owing to the inability to perform precision alignment of complexÂ two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensionalÂ (3D) shapes, which cannot be achieved through simple schemes that account for rotation, scaling, and shear transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kendall, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bookstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dryden and Mardia, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these problems, we have developed an alignment tool that admits a landmark-free method to measure the physical totality of all traits in a body subsystem. Using the wing of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> as the prototype subsystem, the landmark-free method comprises four steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1dâf</xref>). First, each wing is imaged by transmitted light microscopy at high resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>). Second, the boundary of the wing image is accurately detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2019</xref>). Third, the boundary of the wing image is computationally mapped to the interior of a fixed-sized disc. The mapping of the boundary to the disc relies on an efficient numerical implementation of the Riemann mapping theorem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riemann, 1867</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahlfors, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Driscoll and Trefethen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablowitz et al., 2003</xref>). In particular, the map is conformal, preserving the shape of the image, locally, by preserving angles, while manifestly distorting areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). This feature of the approach is both a strength and a limitation, downweighting the effects of variation in boundary shape, and upweighting the effects of the pattern of hairs and veins in the interior of the wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4j,Â k</xref>). Fourth, mapped images are globally registered to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,Â f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4l</xref>) since disc-mapped wings vary in their orientation and region of focus (the central point in the disc). These misalignments are spanned by the space of conformal maps of the disc onto itself, which can be optimized to produce a global registration of the images, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> (further details can be found in MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). We can thus generate boundary and bulk registered ensembles of wing images, whose variation we can study at single-pixel resolution in a landmark-free manner.</p><p>We imaged wings from a highly outbred population of wildtype <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. This population was founded from 35 inbred wildtype strains collected worldwide, which were then blended together for 2 years to ensure substantial genetic variation. We visualized the quantitative variation in the ensemble of images at the single-pixel resolution, measured as per-pixel information entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozachenko and Leonenko, 1987</xref>). Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty, which here is based on variations in image intensity determined on a per-pixel basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacKay and Mac Kay, 2003</xref>). Regions of higher entropy straddle the longitudinal veins, indicating that the positions of these veins along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis vary slightly between individuals; less than a single vein width across the ensemble of wings. However, the proximal region of the L1 vein shows considerable variation, as do some other regions near the hinge. In addition, the cross-veins substantially vary between individuals along the proximal-distal (PD) axis. The intervein region between L1 and L2 veins and the intervein regions near the distal tip also show variation owing to variation in wing hair location. A Procrustes analysis of the same wing ensemble is limited to the variation in landmarks alone, with the intersection of L1 and L2 veins being the most variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). An anatomical description of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c,Â d</xref>.</p><p>The wings of male and female <italic>Drosophila</italic> differ in their size, shape, and pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1a,Â b</xref>), providing a setting to compare the landmark-based and landmark-free approaches to distinguishing two populations. By Procrustes landmark analysis, the intersection of L1 and L2 veins shows the greatest sexual dimorphism, with substantial non-overlap between male and female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The intersection of L1 and L5 veins also shows sexual dimorphism. A very different perspective is revealed using our landmark-free method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The relative entropy of pixel intensities across the two ensembles demonstrates that sexual dimorphism is not restricted to the landmarks. In particular, the proximal and distal regions of the L1 vein are variable between male and female. The L3 vein proximal to the cross-vein also shows considerable variation. Strikingly, the regions showing sexual dimorphism do not spatially overlap with the regions showing variation within each wildtype population. In summary, this comparative analysis demonstrates the remarkable sensitivity of our landmark-free method to make precise measurements of the variational properties of wing form, as well as demonstrating the incomplete picture of variation provided by landmarks alone.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of Procrustes and landmark-free phenotyping.</title><p>(<bold>a,Â b</bold>) Variation between ensembles of male and female wings from the outbred wildtype population.

The intensity of each pixel in the space of disc-mapped images is identified with a unique dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Therefore, an individual image is a single point in this phenotype space of ~30,000 dimensions (pixels). By contrast, the standard landmark-based parameterization of the wing defines phenotype in 24 dimensions â the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> locations of 12 landmarks. By way of illustration, we portray an ensemble of wildtype wings populating a 3D slice of this vast phenotypic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The dominant mode of variation in the population is indicated as the âlongÂ axisâ of the cloud of points. To find the major axes of variation within the 30,000-dimensional space, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on male and female wings from the outbred stock raised under standard environmental conditions. PC1 and PC2 axes account for 68% of the total variation, with 66% of the variation aligned along PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Strikingly, male and female wings are separated along PC2, suggesting that the dominant mode of variability is not sex-specific. This dominant mode of variability is also not congruent with left-right patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1d</xref>), variation in wing size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1e</xref>), or variation in imaging conditions across the ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1f</xref>). We mapped pixels whose variation is most aligned with PC1 and found vein positions are most prominent, particularly in the proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We also performed PCA on the Procrustes landmark data from the wildtype ensemble and observed that sexual dimorphism is the dominant source of detected variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Strikingly, the dominant mode made manifest in our landmark-free analysis is undetected by a landmark-based method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1c</xref>), demonstrating that novel, even dominant, modes of variation are rendered detectable by our more holistic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic and environmental variation</title><p>To investigate the origins of this dominant mode of variation, we performed landmark-free analysis on a published dataset of wing images from the wildtype Samarkand strain and from animals heterozygous for weak mutations in signal transduction genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnenschein et al., 2015a</xref>). Specifically, these genes act in the Notch, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and EGF receptor (EGFR) pathways, which are required for proper growth and patterning of the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blair, 2007</xref>). Note that all of the mutations are considered to be recessive to wildtype for wing phenotypes, and thus the heterozygous animals do not exhibit easily discernible differences in wing form from wildtype. Since stronger effect mutations produce phenotypes rarely seen in a natural population, the weak nature of these genetic perturbations is crucial to our investigations into the origins of natural variation. Mutant wing images were subjected to our landmark-free analysis. The high-dimensional phenotype space occupied by each mutant population was compared to the reference wildtype population. This was done by finding the centroid (center of mass) for each populationâs cloud of points, which constitutes its average phenotype. We then considered the line joining each mutant centroid and the reference wildtype centroid, which represents the difference between the average mutant and wildtype phenotypes. For illustration, a simplified 3D example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>. The spatial maps of the mutant-wildtype differences in pixel intensities are revealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3bâe</xref>), and they show how our method can detect even subtle effects (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Mutation of the <italic>Egfr</italic> gene causes L3 and L4 veins to be slightly more distant from one another, whereas mutation of <italic>Star</italic>, which encodes an inhibitor in the EGFR pathway, has the opposite effect. The posterior cross-vein is also affected by these mutants. Both <italic>mastermind (mam)</italic>, a component in the Notch pathway, and <italic>thick veins (tkv)</italic>, a component in the BMP pathway, have common effects in that L2âL4 slightly shift anterior. However, <italic>tkv</italic> shows evidence of subtle vein thickening, which is an attribute of the homozygous mutant phenotype. We conclude that the landmark-free method is sensitive enough to robustly detect phenotypic differences in mutant alleles that are historically considered to be completely recessive to wildtype.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Variational analysis of genetic mutants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of hypothetical 3D phenotype space, with each cloud of points representing wings from an ensemble subject to a different treatment or condition.

With the exception of the male population of <italic>Star</italic> heterozygotes, the degrees of alignment are far above those expected by chance due to sample size effects or artifacts in the imaging and analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). As such, the mutant phenotypes statistically align with a single direction, which is identified as the direction of dominant variation in an outbred wildtype population. We note that the mutants affect distinct signaling pathways, which play significant and separate roles in wing development, thus highlighting the nontrivial nature of the statistical alignment we observe. Taken together, these small-effect genetic perturbations â both the recessive mutations and the variants in the outbred populations â excite variation along a single integrated mode of variation in the wing.</p><p>To investigate the nature of developmental variants generated due to perturbations in environment, we raised the outbred wildtype population at different temperatures from the standard 25Â°C. As previously observed, increasing temperature causes a decrease in wing size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1g,Â h</xref>). The differences between the average wing phenotypes at different temperatures were spatially mapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,Â b</xref>).

The average wing phenotype due to nutrient limitation also reveals robust spatial variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Remarkably, there is a strong statistical alignment of the temperature and dietary phenotypes with the dominant mode of variation within the outbred population raised under standard environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,Â e</xref>).

Leveraging a new mathematical strategy to statistically analyze large ensembles of wings across multiple conditions, we demonstrate that natural variants can be described by a 1D linear manifold in morphological space that corresponds to a non-intuitive combination of structural variations that are spatially extended across the wing. Strikingly, the single phenotypic mode is also excited by weak genetic perturbations in distinct developmental pathways, suggesting that its encoding is more global than any particular gene or pathway. As such, our study indicates the presence of strong constraints that limit the spectrum of phenotypic varieties when confronted with small changes in the genetic and environmental conditions of development. The spectrum of investigated phenotypes stand in contrast to the those associated with strong-effect genetic mutations that manifestly probe additional phenotypic dimensions that are absent in natural populations.</p><p>We hypothesize two developmental processes that could potentially give rise to such an integrated mode of phenotypic variation. First, thick proveins are refined into narrow veins during pupal development, allowing for the possibility to globally alter the final resting place of veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blair, 2007</xref>). Second, the number, size, and shapes of intervein epidermal cells might vary, and after expansion, separate neighboring veins by different distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bollenbach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Hidalgo et al., 2018</xref>). These effects could be exacerbated in the proximal wing during hinge contraction, which occurs over an extended period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sui et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We believe thatÂ there are three distinguishing characteristics of the approach that facilitated our discovery. First, the precision boundary and bulk alignment of wings permit a more holistic, landmark-free, approach to parameterizing phenotype. Although we apply the approach to one body structure, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, it can be applied to any 2DÂ surface with no holes. This could be a simple 2D shape like the wing or the closed surface of a complex 3D shape such as a tooth, brain, or another body part. Second, transformations that are learned from the data are those that interpolate between different individuals within an outbred <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> population and those subject to mild genetic and environmental perturbations. This stands in sharp contrast to the more severe phenotypes generated by strong-effect mutations. Third, our approach is statistical, involving the analysis of large ensembles of wings, permitting a quantitative analysis of variance. We propose that it is these three features of our approach that permits the data-driven discovery of global phenotypic constraints in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing developmental program and lays the foundations for doing so in other developmental contexts.</p><p>Our work presents a general strategy for the quantitative case study of the emergence of robustness and evolvability in complex developmental forms. In the context of the fly wing, we quantify the degree and nature of developmental robustness, which we demonstrate funnels diverse environmental and genetic variation into a 1D, spectrum of phenotypes. Wing development is robust in that the final body structures are statistically constrained to lie along this mode and not elsewhere in morphological space. However, it indicates that the wing is also evolvable because varieties produced along this mode are highly probable. Indeed, our work suggests that the map from genotype to this constrained set of phenotypes is massively degenerate, wherein a vast number and variety of genetic and environmental changes produce similar phenotypic outcomes. As such, our study suggests that global constraints are required to insulate the system from the idiosyncratic and random nature of genes and their mutations. The correspondence between the constrained phenotypic mode identified in this study and fitness remains unclear. The mode might correspond to changes in organismal form that buffer the system from perturbations with little or no impact on fitness. Alternately, the identified mode could correspond to the most broadly conserved aspects of fitness. Disambiguating between these possibilities is central to understand the origins and consequences of such phenotypic constraints. Stepping back, since the spectrum of developmental varieties provide the menu options for the environment to select from, our discovery suggests that closely related species ought to diverge along the phenotypic axis we detect here. If found, an alignment between the statistical properties of a developmental and evolutionary ensemble would lay the groundwork for a quantitative approach to the study of evolutionary-developmental biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>Cornmeal-molasses food was used for standard husbandry.

Wings were removed by clasping the wing joint with a pair of forceps and pulling the wing from the body, using a different pair of forceps to hold the body in place. Both left and right wings were dissected, and the carcass was discarded. Both wings were then placed in a small volume of 70% ethanol solution on the microscope slide ventral side down. A few drops of 70% (v/v) glycerol were added to the wings/ethanol on the slide. If the alula was folded onto the dorsal side of a wing, it was unfolded or removed.

A 4Ã 0.1Â NA Plan Apochromatic objective was used and the Optivar was set to 1.25Ã magnification. The camera adaptor magnification was 0.5Ã. This gave a total magnification of 2.5Ã. The condenser was focused and centered on a wing specimen, and then the stage was moved in order to define shading correction at a neutral point with no slide or wing in the image. Specific shading correction was defined before any images were taken in an imaging session. Each wing had two images taken: one with unfiltered light from the microscopeâs halogen lamp at 100% power, and one with the green filter in place between the lamp and specimen. The slide remained in the exact same position for each of the two images. After one wing was imaged, its partner wing was then imaged. Wing images were taken so that the anterior side of the wing faced downwards in the image so as to eliminate confusion between right and left wing labeling. If either wing appeared damaged or if dust or debris marked either wing, we rejected that wing and its partner wing. For some female wings, the specimen was too large to be captured in one image. For these, we captured a portion of each wing in one image and then moved the stage to capture the rest of the wing in a separate image. The two images had sufficient overlap that they could be computationally stitched together post-imaging.</p><p>Images were captured as CZI files with a Zeiss Axiocam ERc 5s attached to a Dell XPS 8500 computer using ZEN Blue 3.1 imaging software. Each image had dimensions of 2560 Ã 1920 pixels, and each pixel intensity was recorded in 8-bit RGB mode. Each CZI file was converted to a TIFF file using the Bio-Formats 6.5.1 plugin for Matlab. Exposure time was 0.3 ms for white-lit images and 0.4 ms for green-lit images. Color balance was set to auto. The intensity level was set at 100%. This ensured that the background was not saturated, thatÂ is, background pixel intensity was not maximal. The average background pixel intensity was reproducibly between 210 and 215 for almost all wing samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1e</xref>). For those wing samples that were captured using two overlapping images, we used the Photomerge algorithm in Adobe Photoshop CS3 with default settings. Although both white-lit and green-lit images were captured for each wing, we only used the green channel of the green-lit RGB files for further analysis.</p><p>We analyzed both left and right wings for each individual.

Each P-element mutant is described as hypomorphic when homozygous, meaning thatÂ they are weak loss-of-function mutations.

Hence, the higher the resolution of the image, the greater the number of variables. The resolution of wing images we captured are such that there are 100,000 pixels for each wing. However, the pixels are not landmarks in the traditional sense. Traditional landmark-based methods globally align identifiable anatomical loci from homologous objects of different individuals. Then, the variation in the landmark coordinate position is measured for each landmark. Our landmark-free method globally aligns the entire image from homologous objects of different individuals. Then, the variation in intensity for each pixel coordinate is measured.</p><p>Homologous body structures from different individuals can have different shapes. This can apply not only to individuals from different species (i.e., forelimb of bat and horse) but also individuals from the same species. This is why the field of morphometrics has reduced the complexity of the continuum of shape to a discretized proxy, thatÂ is, landmark-based Procrustes analysis then can estimate shape variation.</p><p>Our approach (code is available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alba, 2020</xref>) is to use a conformal map to map all homologous body structures onto the same shape, in this case, a disc of fixed size. Although we apply the approach to one body structure, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, it can be applied to any 2D surface with no holes, with or without a boundary. This could be a simple 2D shape like the wing or the closed surface of a complex 3D shape such as a tooth, brain, or another body part.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Wing boundary identification</title><p>Although the background intensity of all images was highly consistent across ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1e</xref>), there were minor differences, including uneven illumination across the field of view. This variability was most problematic with the wing images from the genetic databaseÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnenschein and Chari, 2015b</xref>). To correct these issues, we apply contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to our images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3a</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pizer et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>We use an Ilastik segmentation model to identify pixels that belong to the wing bulk, veins, and background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). The machine learning model is trained on 25 wings and after that is applied to all wings across all ensembles to remove systematic trends owing to variations in segmentation. The output of Ilastik comprises four layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). The segmentation output requires further cleaning that is done in a custom-made Matlab script. In particular, we use knowledge about the fact that background is only outside of the wing, and wing bulk is surrounded by veins, to clean up the segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2c</xref>). Once the segmentation is cleaned, we use a watershed algorithm to produce the boundary of the wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2d</xref>). Watershed algorithms find catchment basins in an image, treating intensity as a height of the landscape. Since wings were detached from the body by breaking the hinge region with tweezers, each wing has a slightly different hinge due to experimental manipulation. Therefore, we use two morphologically identifiable landmarks, the humeral break and the alula notch (stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2d</xref>). These landmarks are manually selected for each segmented wing image, and a script automatically defines the line between the two points as the proximal boundary. This defines a precise and repeatable way to delete the hinge. Area of each wing is measured as pixel number inside the wing boundary. Distribution of outbred group wing areas is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1gâj</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Conformal map conformal mapping</title><p>One feature of a conformal map is that it is possible to map any closed region onto another closed region if the shape is approximated as a complex polygon. For example, when we approximate the boundary of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing as a 100-point polygon, we can map the whole wing onto a unit disc. We distribute these points on the wing boundary with a density that is inversely proportional to the local curvature of the wing boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2e</xref>). Therefore, we compute 2D curvature for every point of a segmented wing boundary using the linecurvature2D packageÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kroon, 2020</xref>). Once we have curvature for every point, we compute and plot the cumulative curvature and distribute points equidistantly along the cumulative direction. The cumulative curve is monotonous; therefore, we can find the position of the vertices on the boundary. This approach minimizes the difference between polygonal representation and the real boundary for a given number of points.</p><p>Once a polygonal representation is made of a wing boundary, SchwarzâChristoffel mapping generates a map from the interior of the polygon onto a unit disc. The conformal map scales each local region homogeneously, but the scaling constant depends on the position. In the case of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, which is approximately the shape of an ellipse, the bulk of the wing is minimally distorted, while regions far from the I are more distorted. For instance, several peripheral pixels may be mapped onto one pixel of the unit disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4k</xref>). Particular distortion depends on the shape of the wing; therefore, if we would like to decouple shape from a pattern, this feature comes in handy.</p><p>We use the SchwarzâChristoffel Toolbox for MatlabÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driscoll, 2002</xref>) to map each segmented wing onto a unit disc that has a diameter of 200 pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4i</xref>). SchwarzâChristoffel conformal mapping requires only the boundary and I-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4b</xref>) of the shape. The shapeâs boundary becomes the circumference and the shapeâs I-point becomes the origin. This is done individually for all of the segmented wings in an ensemble.</p><p>Note that the unit disc is the same area for all segmented wings. A wing boundary is a polygon in a complex space. Therefore, conformal mapping a segmented wing image onto the unit disc depends on the size of the segmented wing image. However, the target (the unit disc) has a fixed size, and so it may be the case that several pixels in the wing image may be mapped onto one pixel in the disc. Consequently, the intensity of the target pixel is an average of the wing image pixels that map to it.

We use 8-bit grayscale images, which means that each pixel has intensity ranging from 0 to 255. Therefore, a wing image with <italic>N</italic> pixels can be represented as a single vector in discrete <italic>N</italic>-dimensional space, or to be more precise it is a vector in an <italic>N</italic>-dimensional cube ([0255]<italic><sup>N</sup></italic>). For a group with <italic>M</italic> number of wings, the group can be represented as a set of <italic>M</italic> vectors in <italic>N</italic>-dimensional space. Therefore, we can use all the tools from linear algebra.</p><p>We can analyze variability within a group since each group of individuals is subject to natural variation. We analyze this variation using PCA, which finds the directions of greatest variation within the group. Each PC is a unit vector in the same <italic>N</italic>-dimensional space as the wing discs comprising a group. We use the pca function from the Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Extraction toolbox for Matlab for all PCA-related computations.</p><p>We can also analyze variability within a group using entropy. Each pixel at a fixed position may have different intensities for wings in an ensemble. If the pixel belongs to a region that has almost no variability in intensity, then it will have small entropy, but in the regions where there is pattern variability, the entropy will be larger. As an example, we can consider vein motion, which means that the position of the vein along either AP or PD axes varies between wings. If a pixel at a fixed position has identical intensity values for all aligned images, then that pixel has zero entropy. If a fixed-position pixel is within a wing vein for some but not all aligned images, then it might have larger entropy. In the intervein regions of wing images, the intensity of fixed-position pixels often varies slightly, so their entropy will be small but nonzero.

For this approach, we use the bootstrap method that requires that we randomly draw subsets of wings that have a size of 50% of the ensemble.

The first one is a random shift of the origin that was obtained by the maximization of the cross-correlation between individual image and reference image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2f</xref>). We randomly shifted origin by a random value from â3 to 3 pixels in each direction. Also, we randomly shifted alula notch and humeral break by a random value from â3 to 3 pixels in each direction. Once these points shifted, new boundary is identified as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2g</xref>. The final perturbation was perturbation of the boundary segmentation. Each pixel of the initial boundary that was obtained after refinement of the segmentation part of the pipeline is shifted by random number from â1 to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2h</xref>). After these perturbations, the remaining pipeline is applied. We notice that despite small numerical differences of the analysis for the perturbation, quantitative conclusions remain the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Robustness of results to log-transformed pixel data</title><p>Motion of a vein across a database corresponds to a significant variation in intensity in limited zones of the image. We performed the analysis on log-transformed data and log-transform of the inverse of data (where veins are bright as opposed to dark structures) to investigate the significance of the representation. We confirmed that all the statistical trends are maintained with intensity transformed data. We thank the referee for this and other recommendations through which we believe we have provided further evidence towards the accuracy and robustness of the computational approach/pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Statistical significance</title><p>We were exploring previously unknown phenomena, and therefore it is a priori unknown as to what is a good observable, let alone what a sufficient sample size ought to be to help parameterize it. In light of this, our study has generated a large dataset that permits a careful analysis of statistical robustness and significance. As a rule, we leverage non-parametric approaches to assessing significance, including bootstrap with replacement and resampling from marginal distributions (also known as shuffling). We pursue a non-parametric approach to avoid any assumptions regarding the generative process of a manifestly very complex phenomena.</p><p>This section of the SI puts forward our reasoning for our confidence in our conclusions. In particular, we confirm that our sample size is sufficient to generate robust estimation of inferred parameters that we use in our study.</p><sec id="s4-22-1"><title>Parameters of interest</title><p>There are fundamentally two quantities that form the basis of our analyses of intra- and inter-population variation. Those being the first and second moments of each genetic and environmental population in the phenotype space that we define. It must be stated that these two quantities are provably the most statistically robust features of an empirical dataÂ distribution. Nonlinear analyses that are nowadays commonplace in even the most standard dimensionality reduction algorithms are more susceptible to noise. These two quantities go into helping a spectral, or principal component, analysis of the distributions. The central result of the paper is the striking dominance and importance of the first principal component (eigenvector). It must again be stated that this direction is the most statistically robust direction by construction. The only other parameter we infer is the mean phenotype of populations, which is already a quantity that goes into the construction of PCA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-2"><title>PCA</title><p>To demonstrate the significance of the PCs that we further analyze and base our conclusions on, we adopt a marginal resampling approach. The explicit advantage of this approach over a Marcenko Pasteur (MP) approach is that the closed-form analytic solutions for the eigenvalue distributions are based on an assumption of Gaussianity of the data. To avoid this parametric assumption, which is rarely true for real-world data, we adopt a marginal resampling approach. This approach gives a spectrum of eigenvalues that could be generated by the nature of the marginal distributions alone, and not due to any covariance in the data. For all our populations, we got at least 70 significant eigenvalues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-3"><title>Degree of alignments</title><p>The central feature of our analysis was to estimate the degree of alignment between the (1) direction of variation between the means of two populations and (2) the natural variation of the individual populations. (1) Is the phenotype associated with the difference, say, for example, the phenotypic difference between a genetic mutant set of wings and the WT? The mean values of the degree of alignments are presented in the main manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4d</xref> for the genetic and environmental analyses, respectively. Complete distributions of these alignments, achieved through bootstrapping, are presented here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>, for the environmental and genetic populations, respectively.</p><p>To assess the significance of these measurements of alignment, you must compare what is measured to a null distributions. Again, in the non-parametric approach embodied in our work, the null distribution is constructed from the data itself. In particular, we compare the measured directions to directions that would emerge by chance were the labels of the different populations of wings to be shuffled. Any alignment between inter-population directions of change and intra-population directions of variance in the shuffled label data is purely due to chance or an artifact of our pipeline. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref> present the p-values achieved through these analyses in the environmental and genetic populations. In all instances, other than the male star population, the alignments are significant. The lack of significance of the male star population is explained in our manuscript as being a statistical consequence of its very weak effect on phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>SexualÂ dimorphism vs. the long axis of the data</title><p>We include a more detailed description of the relative orientations of the long axis in the data and the axis corresponding to sexual dimorphism in the high-quality images of environmental variation. We observe that within stressed populations of flies, at low diet and high temperatures close to their physiological limit (29Â°C), the sexual dimorphism axis rotates from being orthogonal to the long axis in the data to parallel; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>. This conditional GxE interaction (G being sex-specific genes) provides further evidence that what we are observing is biological in origin, rather than an artifact of our pipeline. It is also consistent with our observation that alignment of mutational perturbations in signaling genes with the long axis in the data is sometimes dependent on the sex of the flies, depending on the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Seppe Kuehn for fruitful conversations.

perturbation. The authors have created a new landmark-free approach to morphological analysis of complex developmental structures (here, the fly wing) and use it to describe variation across individuals in a population and in response to weak genetic and environmental perturbations. Their finding that morphological variation amongst individuals follows along a low-dimensional, but spatially non-intuitive, mode is a fundamental result. The landmark-free analysis should be broadly applicable to other structures and developmental systems.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Global Constraints within the Developmental Program of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The essence of the idea is to propose that there are hidden simplicities that are not obvious but that can be discovered in a data-driven manner using statistical reasoning. With this premise, the authors claim (1) they have created a new landmark-free approach to morphological analysis of complex developmental structures (here, the fly wing) in which ensembles of images are processed to identify the boundary of the structure, then mapped onto a disc while maintaining local geometry, and then aligned, (2) that this stack of aligned structures can be then statistically analyzed for pixel-by-pixel positional entropy, providing a high-dimensional feature space within which each image is embedded, (3) that the landmark-free analysis is superior to existing low-dimensional landmark-dependent approaches, (4) that eigenvalue decomposition of the ensemble shows that most of the variation amongst individuals is accounted for in just the top mode, (5) that the top modes of variation are different from what is learned by the traditional landmark-dependent approach, (6) that subtle genetic variations due to mutations or natural outbred variations project onto the top mode of this analysis, and (7) that significant perturbations due to temperature during development and or dietary fluctional largely excites variations along the same top mode. From this, the authors propose (1) that there are global, low-dimensional constraints within the development of the fly wing such that random, genetic, and environmental perturbations are largely forced to cause variations along a single mode of variation, and (2) that this mode is not obvious in traditional ways of analyzing morphological data.</p><p>In general, this is a very interesting and topical body of work. The question is important, and the specific findings seem well supported by the data presented. The finding that morphological variation amongst individuals follows along a low-dimensional (but spatially non-intuitive) mode is a fundamental result, especially if the approach of landmark-free analysis inspires other developmental biologists to check and verify the claims in many other systems. The finding that genetic and environmental variations also follow along the same global mode is a potentially deep statement about the relative simplicity underlying the vast apparent complexity of molecular mechanisms and more naively observed phenotypes associated with development. If the results of this work can be extended, it could represent an approach for a more general and simpler description of developmental processes and a route to better characterize the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>A couple specific points that the authors may wish to consider:</p><p>(1) The data support the notion that there is a low-dimensional character to the magnitude of variation amongst individuals in terms of developmental phenotype. But how is the size of such variations related to fitness of individuals of a species? Could it be that weaker modes that carry less of the overall variation still are under strong selective pressure in certain environments and indeed, are strongly relevant for organismal fitness? Or is the argument that the global mode simply defines the most broadly conserved aspects of fitness? If the latter, then it is interesting to understand how much of the wing developmental program is captured in the top mode of variation.</p><p>(2) The key technical feature of this work lies in the mapping of images of wing morphology to a fixed-sized disc and alignment over the ensemble of images. Perhaps the authors could indicate whether such a transform is guaranteed for any sort of structures during development. This may help readers understand how general the method developed here might be for enabling similar studies in other developmental systems.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors implement a novel method for quantifying phenotypic variation in flat two dimensional structures that consists in mapping the entire image into a standard shape (a disk) by an angle preserving transformation. It eliminates the need for preselecting fiducial marks and projecting onto the space of their relative positions. They analyze the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, which is nicely two dimensional, and well-studied by other means, thus a good benchmark.

Nevertheless, the authors new method is provocative and deserves to reach a wide audience, who can try it on other data sets.</p><p>1. It's difficult to design a data set in this area where the 'ground truth' is known, so that the degree an algorithm discovers that truth is a measure of its quality. The worry then is the authors analysis inserts some variability in a particular way and the primary principle component just 'discovers', the variability that was inserted. I do not know how to definitively test for this, but to check for the obvious things, can the authors:</p><p>i. Intentionally augment the outer boundary of the wing, and analyze as in Figure 5. Is R &gt;&gt; Ï. What if some ripple was added to the boundary, what would that look like mapped to the disk?</p><p>ii. The authors need to rely on a reference feature to map to the origin of the disk. Assume the position of that was randomized by a few pixels, how would that display in Figure 5?</p><p>iii. Same set of questions for the way the authors separate the wing from the hinge</p><p>2. In Figure 2d most of the variation is in common for male-females under the landmark free methods while with landmarks the largest PCA component discovers sex. The authors claim this is a vindication of their method, but could it in fact be a problem (as suggested in 1.) Also the data in 2d seems to be bipartite, any explanation?</p><p>3. Can the authors take their conformal mapped and registered images, and extract the coordinates of the Procrustes reference points. What is the relation of the principle components based on the Procrustes variables versus their pixel based measures. It's not entirely clear to me what feature their dominant PC picks up. If I shift a vein normal to itself a lot of pixels change, but the movement is less consequential viewed as an operation on a vein. Thus as usual an information theory measure can be misleading.</p><p>4. A key finding is that genetic perturbations fall along the same PC as does intrapopulation variation. In the case of the gene tkv the authors remark that their analysis picks up the same feature displacement in the weak heterozygote as in the homozygote. Is the same true for the other mutants they examine, in particular N. The N mutants are readily visible, if they are processed as in Figure 5b,c would they fall along the primary PC? If the authors consider it too onerous to measure on new flies, can they just by photoshop impose a comparable mutation on a few of their current images and process?</p><p>5. With their environmental perturbations the authors could ascertain when in development the wings are sensitive to the environment, ie does a molt reset the phenotype of the wing?</p><p>6. The ultimate test of the unique principle component, is to measure the wings on a closely related species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (as the authors remark at the end of their discussion). Would this be a big increment in work over what has already been done? Just 10's of individuals from a stock collection of D. simulans, D. schellia or whatever is easiest. Some of these species make sterile hybrids with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, so it would be interesting to know how close the wings are.</p><p>7. Some technical remarks about the mapping to the disk</p><p>i. Is there a reflection among the rotations to align the right and left wings?</p><p>ii. Is it obvious one should do PCA directly on the pixel variables, (ie not log transformed for instance). Not many pixels change, but those that do may change their gray scale by a factor of 2-10 (depending on how you are treating background). Does this matter?</p><p>The paper is clearly written and should be published after the above questions and those from other referees are addressed. If it's wrong, it's at least interesting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66750.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>A couple specific points that the authors may wish to consider:</p><p>(1) The data support the notion that there is a low-dimensional character to the magnitude of variation amongst individuals in terms of developmental phenotype.

First, we have included additional figures in a new section of the SI where the eigenvalue spectrum of each ensemble is presented. Indeed, the first mode carries significantly more variation than the remainder, combined. Second, as the reviewer no doubt recognizes, we have no empirical approach to quantitatively estimate the fitness of wings and/or individuals. That said, the relation between form and fitness is central to what we conclude from our observations. We have now included an additional discussion of the two possible scenarios that the reviewer points out in our Discussion section of the manuscript, which we recount here:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>âThe correspondence between the constrained phenotypic mode identified in this study and fitness remains unclear. The mode could correspond to changes in organismal form that buffer the system from perturbations with little or no impact on fitness. Alternately, the identified mode could correspond to the most broadly conserved aspects of fitness. Disambiguating between these possibilities is central to understand the origins and consequences of such phenotypic constraints.â</p><p>(2) The key technical feature of this work lies in the mapping of images of wing morphology to a fixed-sized disc and alignment over the ensemble of images.

As the</p><p>reviewer is no doubt aware, the mathematical foundation of the method outlined in our</p><p>study is the Riemann mapping theorem, which holds for a smooth two-dimensional</p><p>surface with no holes. We now have a more detailed statement in the manuscript describing this, which we recount here:</p><p>âOur approach (code is available at (48)) is to use a conformal map to map all homologous body structures onto the same shape, in this case, a disc of fixed size. Although we apply the approach to one body structure, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, it can be applied to any two-dimensional surface with no holes, with or without a boudnary.

Crucially, R&gt;&gt;Ï for perturbations of reasonable amplitude â see Figure 5âfigure supplement 2.

We observe that within stressed populations of flies, at low diet and high temperatures close to their physiological limit (29Â°C), the sexual dimorphism axis rotates from being orthogonal to the long axis in the data to parallel â see Figure 2âfigure supplement 3. This conditional GxE interaction (G being sex-specific genes) provides further evidence that what we are observing is biological in origin, rather than an artifact of our pipeline. It is also consistent with our observation that alignment of mutational perturbations in signaling genes with the long axis in the data is sometimes dependent on the sex of the flies, depending on the mutation (Figure 5 in manuscript)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the data in 2d seems to be bipartite, any explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>The bipartite nature of the data at 25C high diet isnât observed at other conditions â See figure 3 in this response document.

Can the authors take their conformal mapped and registered images, and extract the coordinates of the Procrustes reference points. What is the relation of the principle components based on the Procrustes variables versus their pixel based measures. It's not entirely clear to me what feature their dominant PC picks up. If I shift a vein normal to itself a lot of pixels change, but the movement is less consequential viewed as an operation on a vein. Thus as usual an information theory measure can be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying two issues in this recommendation. First, precisely for the reasons identified by the reviewer, we take the radon transform of the disc mapped and aligned images of wings. The reason for doing so is so that the anticipated correlated deformation of veins across the ensemble of wings is represented more suitably in radon space. All analysis is performed in the radon space, which as the reviewer is no doubt aware, is an invertible transform. We have now further emphasized this aspect of our analysis in the manuscript.</p><p>Second, following the reviewerâs recommendation we present a comparative analysis of the mapped locations of landmarks in the disc and the pixel-based measure. We indeed agree that the landmark centric view of the wing âfocusesâ on gross deformations of veins, while the pixel-based approach has no knowledge of these macroscopic structures. We thus wanted to assess what the relation between disc mapped landmarks and the dominant direction (PC1) of the pixel-based approach was. In Figure 4C, we present the cloud of landmark data for the 25Â°C high diet ensemble of wing images. In Figure 4D we present a quantitative analysis of the degree of correlation between the principal components of disc-mapped/aligned landmarks and the pixel-based approach. Most crucially, we observe that PC1 of the pixel-based approach is not captured in the landmark spectrum. Indeed, what we observe is that PC2 is the sexual dimorphism axis and that this is observable in the landmark based approach. Thus, it seems like the variation encoded in PC1 of the pixel-based approaches is not encoded in the landmarking based approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A key finding is that genetic perturbations fall along the same PC as does intrapopulation variation. In the case of the gene tkv the authors remark that their analysis picks up the same feature displacement in the weak heterozygote as in the homozygote. Is the same true for the other mutants they examine, in particular N. The N mutants are readily visible, if they are processed as in Figure 5b,c would they fall along the primary PC? If the authors consider it too onerous to measure on new flies, can they just by photoshop impose a comparable mutation on a few of their current images and process?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, the Notch pathway is important to wing development. One of the mutants we analyzed in heterozygous state is in the mastermind (mam) gene. Mam is a <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcriptional coactivator that specifically functions in the Notch pathway. Mam physically binds to Su(H) in the nucleus but only when Su(H) is complexed to the Notch ICD. Mam recruits p300/CBP to Notch-dependent gene enhancers where they elicit nucleosome acetylation and transcriptional activation. In the wing, mam mutants phenocopy N mutantsâ effects on vein patterning. Thus, our analysis of mam heterozygous mutant wings is our proxy for a weak effect N mutant. As the reviewer can see in Figure 5B, the mam data follows the general geometric trend observed in the data as a whole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. With their environmental perturbations the authors could ascertain when in development the wings are sensitive to the environment, ie does a molt reset the phenotype of the wing?</p></disp-quote><p>This is precisely one of the experiments we are currently pursuing. Figuring out what developmental stage or process buffers the system from perturbations is crucial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The ultimate test of the unique principle component, is to measure the wings on a closely related species of Drosophila (as the authors remark at the end of their discussion). Would this be a big increment in work over what has already been done? Just 10's of individuals from a stock collection of D. simulans, D. schellia or whatever is easiest. Some of these species make sterile hybrids with D. melanogaster, so it would be interesting to know how close the wings are.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, the reviewer has predicted what experiments we are currently pursuing. We have indeed acquired the three closely related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (all part of the Madagascar radiation 3 Mya) and measurements of wing phenotypes within and across these ensembles are underway. We agree with the reviewer that this is the ultimate test. Additionally, the reviewer is also correct that the patterns of which species can cross is complex, and we intend to study its correlation with phenotypic distance of wings. Again, we thank the reviewer for their prescient insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Some technical remarks about the mapping to the disk</p><p>i. Is there a reflection among the rotations to align the right and left wings?</p></disp-quote><p>First, we performed an analysis to validate the lack of any left-right patterning in the wing, which is what we anticipated based on 100 years of research. An individualâs left and right wings are of course slightly different from each other, but there is no systematic trend across individuals that we observed. Thus, we batch together left and right wings to increase our numbers. This is achieved through reflection. We have now included a description of this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Is it obvious one should do PCA directly on the pixel variables, (ie not log transformed for instance). Not many pixels change, but those that do may change their gray scale by a factor of 2-10 (depending on how you are treating background). Does this matter?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that few pixels change across images, and those that change do so by a significant factor. For example, motion of a vein across a database corresponds to a significant variation in intensity in limited zones of the image. We had previously performed the analysis on log-transformed data, and log-transform of the inverse of data (where veins are bright as opposed to dark structures) to investigate the very issue that is being raised here. We confirmed that all the statistical trends are maintained with intensity transformed data. We now include this analysis in Figure 5âfigure supplement 3. Again, we thank the referee for this and other recommendations through which we believe we have provided further evidence towards the accuracy and robustness of the computational approach/pipeline.</p></body></sub-article></article>
