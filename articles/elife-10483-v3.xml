selective attenuation of gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Selective targeting of multiple myeloma cell lines through CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is the result of direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4, which is essential for the viability of myeloma cells, and the concomitant repression of the IRF4 target gene <italic>c-MYC</italic>. Ectopic expression of either IRF4 or MYC antagonizes the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, highlighting the IRF4/MYC axis as a key component of its mechanism of action. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10483.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10483.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10483.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Multiple myeloma is an aggressive and incurable cancer of white blood cells called B cells and plasma cells. Many of the mutations that trigger multiple myeloma interfere with genes that normally cause B cells to develop into plasma cells.</p><p>Multiple myeloma cells often activate genes that are inactive in healthy cells or vice versa. They also express some genes that are active in healthy cells but at the wrong levels. These changes in gene expression are regulated by proteins that bind to DNA and other DNA-associated proteins. Proteins called CBP and EP300 are two examples of regulatory proteins, and have been implicated in promoting various cancers in humans. Both CBP and EP300 contain a region known as a bromodomain, which binds to proteins associated with DNA. Abnormal activity of the bromodomains of CBP and EP300 may thus promote the onset of cancer.</p><p>Conery et al. have now treated a wide range of human blood cancer cells grown in the laboratory with two new chemicals that inhibit CBP and EP300 bromodomains. Of all the cells tested, multiple myeloma cells were the most strongly affected; these cells proliferated more slowly and died more quickly in the presence of the chemical inhibitors.</p><p>Next, Conery et al. analysed the changes in gene expression in the multiple myeloma cells when they were treated with the inhibitors. The genes whose expression levels changed the most were genes that are regulated by a protein called IRF4. This protein is important for normal B cell and plasma cell development. One notable IRF4 target gene that was down-regulated was the gene that encodes a protein called Myc, which strongly encourages cell division and growth. Conery et al. then supplemented the multiple myeloma cells with extra IRF4 or Myc while treating with the inhibitors and found that this caused the inhibitors to lose most of their effect.</p><p>Neither CBP nor EP300 have previously been thought of as targets for multiple myeloma therapy. Therefore a next critical step is to find more refined chemicals to target their bromodomains and importantly to test these chemicals in preclinical trials. These studies could in turn lead to improved treatments for patients with multiple myeloma in the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10483.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10483.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CBP</kwd><kwd>EP300</kwd><kwd>bromodomain</kwd><kwd>IRF4</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd><kwd>myeloma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors have a therapeutic application in oncology via targeting the IRF4 transcriptional program, a clinically validated network critical for multiple myeloma cell viability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple myeloma is an aggressive and incurable hematologic malignancy characterized by the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahindra et al., 2010</xref>). Myeloma is driven by transcriptional reprogramming events that prevent the differentiation of activated B cells to plasma cells and subsequently promote the proliferation of dysfunctional plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahindra et al., 2010</xref>). Abnormal activity of a number of transcription factors has been implicated in multiple myeloma development, including NF-ÎºB, MAF, MYC, and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dean et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Keats et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palumbo et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shaffer et al., 2008</xref>). The oncogenic activity of these transcription factors in multiple myeloma is demonstrated by the presence of translocation events that fuse them to highly active enhancers that drive high expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dean et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iida et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The IRF4 transcription factor is a critical component of the normal adaptive immune response and is required for lymphocyte activation and differentiation of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MittrÃ¼cker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sciammas et al., 2006</xref>). Downstream targets of IRF4 include factors that regulate cell cycle progression, survival, and normal plasma cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shaffer et al., 2008</xref>). While oncogenic translocations of <italic>IRF4</italic> have been found, more frequently, myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies are dependent on dysfunctional transcriptional networks downstream of a genetically normal <italic>IRF4</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shaffer et al., 2008</xref>). While the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide has been shown to promote IRF4 protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moros et al., 2014</xref>), pharmacological agents that regulate the expression of <italic>IRF4</italic> mRNA have not been identified.</p><p>Small molecule inhibition of bromodomain-containing transcriptional co-regulators have recently been shown to be a viable strategy for the suppression of otherwise un-druggable downstream transcription factors. This is best exemplified by theÂ inhibitors of BET family bromodomains, which down-regulate <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>BCL2</italic> and are thus highly active in malignancies driven by these critical oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mertz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). Cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and E1A interacting protein of 300âkDa (EP300) are highly homologous bromodomain-containing transcriptional co-activators that regulate a number of important cellular events through their acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goodman and Smolik, 2000</xref>). Genetic studies in mice and surveys of human cancer mutations and translocations have implicated CBP/EP300 in cancer, but the role of the bromodomain in the normal and pathological function of CBP/EP300 has not been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murati et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ohnishi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pasqualucci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>).

SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 are chemically distinct tool compounds with selective affinity for the bromodomains of CBP/EP300 over other bromodomains in this protein family. Independent of CBP/EP300, the bromodomains with the highest affinity for these molecules is the BET bromodomain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hay et al., 2014</xref>).

SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 showed similar dose-dependent inhibition of CBP-H3.3 binding, with calculated EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.28 Î¼M and 0.24 Î¼M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). The BET bromodomain inhibitor CPI203 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devaiah et al., 2012</xref>) did not display dose-dependent inhibition in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we made use of an imaging-based assay that measures the release of bromodomain-GFP fusion proteins from chromatin upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, chromatin release results in aggregation of fusion proteins into finite speckles whose number and intensity increase with ligand binding. Both SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 promote chromatin release of CBP bromodomain fusion proteins at low micromolar concentrations as quantitated by high-content imaging (10-fold cell shift), comparable to previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hay et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, both probe compounds release BRD4-BD1 fusion proteins from chromatin at significantly higher concentrations as compared to the selective BET inhibitor CPI203 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâF</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devaiah et al., 2012</xref>). Given the cellular selectivity of the compounds, we are confident that at defined concentrations of the inhibitors (â¤2.5 Î¼M SGC-CBP30 or â¤5 Î¼M I-CBP112), any observed pharmacological effects are due to on-target inhibition of CBP/EP300 bromodomains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</title><p>To assess the biological activity of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, we treated a panel of cell lines of multiple myeloma and acute leukemia origin with SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, a subset of cell lines was highly sensitive to both compounds, with the most sensitive cell lines having GI<sub>50</sub> values below 3 Î¼M of SGC-CBP30. Notably, 14 of the 15 most sensitive cell lines are of multiple myeloma origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As effectors of multiple biological processes, CBP and EP300 play important roles in multiple phases of the cell cycle. To assess the requirement of the CBP/EP300 bromodomains in cell cycle progression, we released G0/G1 arrested LP-1 cells in the presence of either DMSO, SGC-CBP30, or I-CBP112. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, the progression of the cells appears normal through G2/M phase (8âhr). Only upon entry into the next cell cycle is there a noticeable alteration in cell cycle progression, with compound-treated cells accumulating in G1 at 16 and 24âhr as compared to DMSO-treated cells. Thus, it appears that the primary phenotypic effect of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Consistent with these observations, growth inhibition resulting from CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is accompanied by G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in phenotypically sensitive cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). As the phenotypic effects of SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 appeared similar, we utilized the more potent compound, SGC-CBP30, for further experiments and made use of I-CBP112 as a distinct chemotype to confirm important observations.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10483.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phenotypic effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth inhibitory effects of SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 in the indicated cell lines.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C,D and E</xref>, three unique shRNA constructs that efficiently knocked down either CBP or EP300 reduced the expression of <italic>IRF4</italic> at the mRNA and protein level. Viability effects were observed subsequent to suppression of <italic>IRF4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which is consistent with the kinetics and phenotypic effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition. Taken together, these data argue that the suppression of <italic>IRF4</italic> is due to on target inhibition of the CBP/EP300 bromodomains.</p><p>CBP and EP300 function as transcriptional co-activators via acetylation of histones and transcription factors. The bromodomains of CBP/EP300 are required for the acetylation of histones within a chromatin context, and histone H3 lysine 18 (H3K18) and histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) have been shown to be specifically targeted by CBP/EP300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of transcriptional suppression of <italic>IRF4</italic>, we first examined whether CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition causes global reduction in histone acetylation. Following incubation of LP-1 cells with SGC-CBP30, we did not observe any significant changes in the global levels of H3K18 or H3K27 acetylation by Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). We looked more closely for localized changes in histone acetylation by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, we observed a significant reduction in both H3K18ac and H3K27ac at a previously annotated super-enhancer of IRF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chapuy et al., 2013</xref>) as well as at the transcription start site. Notably, this reduction in acetylation is accompanied by a reduction in the chromatin occupancy of EP300, suggesting that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition promotes release of the protein from chromatin leading to a reduction in histone acetylation. It should be noted that broad and complete loss of EP300 was not observed, perhaps suggesting that the bromodomain of EP300 serves to localize it to restricted domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Importantly, treatment with SGC-CBP30 did not result in global eviction of BRD4, arguing against a direct effect on BET bromodomain proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>IRF4 and MYC suppression are associated with phenotypic response to CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition</title><p>We have shown that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition leads to viability defects in multiple myeloma cell lines and toÂ the suppression of IRF4 and its downstream transcriptional programs in the representative cell line LP-1.

We also noted that H3K18ac and H3K27ac were reduced at the chromatin regions driving <italic>MYC</italic> expression following CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, although loss of EP300 was less apparent, consistent with <italic>IRF4</italic> suppression being up-stream of <italic>MYC</italic> suppression in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Further, consistent with the suppression of IRF4 at both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D,E</xref>), the expression of MYC was reduced following theÂ knockdown of either EP300 or CBP in LP-1 and OPM2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the bromodomains of CBP and EP300 are involved in the regulation of the IRF4/MYC axis in multiple myeloma cells, and the suppression of the IRF4/MYC axis may be important for the phenotypic effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Suppression of the IRF4/MYC axis is required for anti-myeloma effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition</title><p>To further test the link between the transcriptional effects on IRF4/MYC and the phenotypic consequences of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, we generated LP-1 cell lines containing inducible IRF4 (LP-1/IRF4) or MYC (LP-1/MYC) expression cassettes. We then treated these cell lines with SGC-CBP30 or I-CBP112 in the presence or absence of doxycycline to induce ectopic expression of IRF4 or MYC.

Indeed, we found that the induction of IRF4 in the LP-1/IRF4 cell line both increased <italic>MYC</italic> expression (most prominently at the mRNA level) and prevented the suppression of <italic>MYC</italic> by SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> far left, 6B and 6C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistent with MYC suppression being a critical downstream effect of IRF4 suppression, ectopic expression of MYC in the LP-1/MYC cell line phenocopied ectopic expression of IRF4, rescuing cell cycle arrest and abrogating MYC suppression following CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B,C,D</xref>, and 1F).</p><p>While BET proteins are known to similarly target MYC in multiple myeloma, a comparison of CBP/EP300 and BET bromodomain inhibition demonstrated that these modalities target the IRF4-MYC network at different nodes, with BET inhibition having no impact on IRF4 at the doses and timepoints examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Our data suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition exerts its anti-myeloma effects in a mechanism distinct from BET inhibition via the direct transcriptional inhibition of <italic>IRF4</italic> and the downstream suppression of IRF4 target genes such as <italic>MYC</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in multiple myeloma cell lines. Viability effects are dependent on the silencing of the transcription factor IRF4, which results in the downstream suppression of c-MYC. CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition thus targets the IRF4/MYC network, which is critical for multiple myeloma cells independent of the upstream oncogenic signal. A recent publication describes the use of the CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitor I-CBP112 to inhibit the growth of leukemic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Picaud et al., 2015</xref>). Our data pointing to the preferential activity of both SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 in multiple myeloma cell lines as compared to leukemic cell lines is consistent with this published work. Similar to our findings, Picaud et al. observed minor cytostatic and limited cytotoxic effects in all leukemic cell lines screened with the exception of Kasumi-1. Only upon examining the effects of I-CBP112 on clonogenic growth did the authors observe more broad phenotypic effects. Thus, while CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition may have robust cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma, our results do not exclude the possibility that this modality would have additional therapeutic utility in leukemia by targeting leukemic self-renewal.</p><p>Pharmacological inhibition of CBP/EP300 bromodomains represents a viable strategy for targeting these transcriptional co-activators. Evidence from genetic studies in mice has shown that ablation of any two of the four alleles of CBP and EP300 results in embryonic lethality, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking expression of CBP and EP300 cannot proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yao et al., 1998</xref>). The selective viability effects and limited transcriptional footprint observed with CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors suggests that this modality is milder than genetic ablation, perhaps affording an acceptable therapeutic index once drug-like molecules are optimized. Our results are more broadly consistent with recent studies using SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 that demonstrated selective phenotypic and transcriptional effects in distinct biological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hammitzsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Picaud et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mice with heterozygous loss of <italic>Cbp</italic> are prone to the development of hematologic malignancies, and human patients with germline mutations in <italic>CREBBP</italic> develop the Rubinstein-Taybi cancer predisposition syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>). Further, recent surveys of the mutational landscape in a variety of tumors have demonstrated frequent loss of function mutations in <italic>CREBBP</italic> and <italic>EP300</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pasqualucci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kishimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mullighan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). While this evidence implicates CBP/EP300 as tumor suppressors, evidence also supports their oncogenic activity. Rare human leukemias have been found with oncogenic fusion proteins containing either CBP or EP300, and these oncogenic fusion proteins require the activity of CBP or EP300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murati et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ohnishi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of CBP/EP300 in leukemic cell lines and primary patient samples also support the oncogenic role of CBP and EP300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Picaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Giotopoulos et al., 2015</xref>). Our data in multiple myeloma are consistent with an activity supporting oncogenic signaling, as either pharmacological inhibition or knockdown resulted in loss of viability. It is unclear whether CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition would have tumor promoting activity in normal tissues. However, concerns about inhibiting potential tumor suppressor activity of CBP/EP300 in normal tissues may be alleviated by a dosing regimen that prevents continuous target coverage in normal tissues.</p><p>BET bromodomain inhibitors are highly active in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mertz et al., 2011</xref>). The activity of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors in multiple myeloma potentially suggests that this modality may modify similar genes regulated by BET bromodomain inhibitors, but transcriptional profiling does not support this notion. At the doses of SGC-CBP30 utilized, CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition appears to have a more circumscribed transcriptional footprint than BET bromodomain inhibition. Phenotypic effects of BET bromodomain inhibition in multiple myeloma are likely due to direct suppression of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>BCL2</italic>, while the effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition appear to be via suppression of <italic>IRF4</italic>. The distinct transcriptional effects of the two modalities suggests that combinations may be efficacious. It has in fact been shown that targeting the IRF4 network with lenalidomide and the MYC network with BET bromodomain inhibitors has synergistic effects in mantle cell lymphoma and primary effusion lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moros et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2015</xref>). CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition may thus represent an alternative strategy for targeting the IRF4 transcriptional axis in these contexts.</p><p>The discovery of BET bromodomain inhibitors represented a breakthrough in the ability to target what were thought to be intractable oncogenic factors. Here we have shown that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors may similarly be used to target the expression of critical oncogenic transcription factors. As dysregulated transcriptional control is central to the pathology of cancer, the ability to target oncogenic transcription networks with small molecule bromodomain inhibitors represents a promising direction for future therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Sources of cell lines and results of mycoplasma testing are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

IPs were performed overnight at 4Â°C. Immune complexes were washed twice in buffer containing 140 mM NaCl, once in buffer containing 360 mM NaCl, once in 250 mM LiCl wash buffer, and twice in TE. Samples were eluted and treated with 20 Âµg proteinase K (Roche) for 1âhr at 55Â°C, crosslinks were reversed for 4âhr at 65Â°C, and 20 Âµg RNase (Sigma) was added for 1âhr at 37Â°C. DNA was purified with the MinElute kit (Qiagen), and libraries were prepared using the Ovation Ultralow DR Multiplex System (NuGEN, Inc.; San Carlos, CA) according to the manufacturerâs recommendations. Amplified libraries were size selected and gel-purified prior to Illumina massively parallel sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 system at the MIT Biomicro Center. Biological replicates were performed for each sample, and representative images are depicted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>AlphaLISA</title><p>Inhibitory activity of compounds was determined by following the inhibition of the binding of purified His-Flag-tagged bromodomains to H4-TetraAc-biotin peptide (New England Peptide, Inc.; Gardner, MA) using AlphaLISA technology (PerkinÂ Elmer). Compound at varying concentrations were dispensed into 384 well Proxiplates (PerkinÂ Elmer) using Echo technology (Labcyte, Inc.; Sunnyvale, CA). For CBP assays, 0.5 Î¼M His-Flag-tagged CBP bromodomain (amino acids 1082â1197) was incubated with 0.003 Î¼M H4-TetraAc-biotin for 20 min at room temperature in 1x reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM TCEP, 0.069 mM Brij-35, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Streptavidin acceptor beads and nickel donor beads (PerkinÂ Elmer) were added to 15 Î¼g/ml with a Combi Multidrop dispenser. Plates were sealed and incubated at 90 min in the dark at room temperature, and plates were read on an Envision plate reader (PerkinÂ Elmer) according to manufacturerâs instructions. For the BET assays, the protocol was similar except that BET family bromodomains were used at 0.03 Î¼M (BRD4-BD1) and incubated with 0.2 Î¼M H4-TetraAc-biotin for 20 min in reaction buffer (40 mM HEPES pH7.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.069 mM Brij-35, 40 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Streptavidin donor beads and Anti-Flag Acceptor beads (PerkinÂ Elmer) were added to 10 Î¼g/ml, and then plates were sealed and incubated in the dark for 60 min prior to reading on the Envision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chemical compounds</title><p>The synthesis and characterization of CPI203 have been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devaiah et al., 2012</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Chemical inhibitors of CBP/P300 bromodomain are evaluated in hematopoietic cancer cell lines for effects on proliferation and gene expression. After validating the selectivity of these compounds in biochemical and in-cell assays for P300/CBP versus BRD4, the sensitivity of a large panel human myeloma and leukemia cell lines to these compounds was evaluated. This revealed sensitivity within a variety of myeloma cell lines in the low micromolar range of GI50s. Comparative transcriptional profiling revealed a unique IRF4 gene signature and ensuing genetic experiments provided evidence supporting IRF4 and MYC suppression as an important effect of these compounds.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is of interest, but given that these are previously published compounds and the mechanistic studies are not particularly detailed, there should be more support for the proposed pathway IRF4/MYC as the critical pathway downstream of P300/CBP Bromodomain inhibition and the specificity of the compounds for P300/CBP.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> show data using CBP30 to inhibit CBP bromodomains and it is explained that this molecule was chosen since it is most potent. It seems reasonable to characterize this compound in greatest detail.

Regarding the selectivity of the compounds, we have added data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref> showing Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) profiling of the compounds across 19 members of the bromodomain family, supporting the specificity towards CBP. These data are consistent with those provided in two manuscripts that were published during the revision period (Hammitzsch et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 2015, Picaud et al. Cancer Res. 2015), and together with our additional selectivity data argue that the effects we have observed are due to on-target engagement of CBP/EP300 bromodomains. We have also generated additional supporting data with I-CBP112 to demonstrate that the effects we have observed are not specific to any given chemotype.</p><p>Regarding the connection to the IRF4/MYC axis, we have generated several new pieces of data to support our hypotheses. First, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> that the pharmacodynamic response of IRF4 suppression is correlated with in vitro efficacy of SGC-CBP30. Second, we used IRF4 knockdown experiments to demonstrate that cell lines that are phenotypically sensitive to CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition require IRF4 for viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The degree of MYC suppression resulting from IRF4 knockdown or CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is correlated with the phenotypic response to either stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplements 1A and 1B</xref>), which lends further support to MYC being a critical downstream factor of IRF4 in multiple myeloma. Third, we have shown in an additional cell line, OPM2, that CBP/EP300 knockdown leads to IRF4 and MYC suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, we have used reconstitution with ectopic MYC to further support the hypothesis that MYC suppression downstream of IRF4 suppression is a critical factor in the phenotypic response to CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B, C, D and F</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> show data using CBP30 to inhibit CBP bromodomains and it is explained that this molecule was chosen since it is most potent. It seems reasonable to characterize this compound in greatest detail. However it would be helpful if they could assess the other less potent compound in some of the assays performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3/4/5</xref>to show similar effects.</italic> </p><p>Where possible, we have replicated experiments with I-CBP112 in the revised manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> demonstrates a consistent phenotypic response with the two compounds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref> shows a similar transcriptional response for the two compounds, as well as a similar distinction from the effects of CPI203. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref> and 1D show suppression of <italic>IRF4</italic> mRNA and protein with I-CBP112, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref> show similar kinetics of <italic>IRF4</italic> suppression with the two compounds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref> shows dose dependent reduction in <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA with I-CBP112 in two cell lines. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref> and 1F demonstrate IRF4 and MYC reconstitution with I-CBP112 treatment. These data support our conclusions with SGC-CBP30 and argue that the effects we have observed are not scaffold-specific.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> it appears that the compound induces significant apoptosis (sub-G1 cells). Is this rescued but IRF4 expression in the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>? The experiments in this figure are important but complicated by the toxicity of IRF4 itself. Along these lines, the authors argue that MYC maybe downstream of IRF4. Does Myc expression rescue some of the phenotypes induced by the inhibitor? In general it would be helpful if there were some more evidence that IRF4 and MYC are critical to the phenotypes. It appears they might be but this part of the manuscript is under developed.</italic> </p><p>Regarding the first point, the reviewers are correct in pointing out that ectopic expression of IRF4 leads to increased basal apoptosis (we believe this is due to increased MYC expression, which is known to promote apoptosis). However, we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref> that the increase in apoptosis (measured by% sub-G1 cells, in response to either SGC-CBP30 or I-CBP112) above background is reduced in the presence of ectopic IRF4. As mentioned above, we have added experiments with MYC reconstitution to the revised manuscript, and demonstrate that ectopic expression of MYC phenocopies ectopic expression of IRF4 in this context. Additional evidence connecting suppression of IRF4/MYC with the phenotypic response to CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors is discussed in point 1 above.</p><p><italic>4) Can the authors use ChIP-qPCR at the IRF4 super-enhancer and a few other regions to compare occupancy of BRD4, p300, and CBP with a titration of BET inhibitor and CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibitors. The goal would be to establish clarity whether the CBP/p300 compounds are in fact not influencing BRD4 at the concentrations of compound used here.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, as it further addresses the specificity of SGC-CBP30 towards CBP/EP300 bromodomains. In our experience, manual ChIP-qPCR has been difficult to interpret when using small changes in inhibitor concentrations (i.e. dose-responses), perhaps reflecting inherent assay noise. To address this question, we performed genome-wide ChIP-seq with BRD4 antibodies to address the global changes in BRD4 occupancy following CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition. We utilized the same concentrations of inhibitors used in gene expression and functional experiments in the manuscript for consistency (6 hour treatment with 2.5 Î¼M SGC-CBP30, 0.25 Î¼M CPI203). We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref> that while BRD4 is evicted from some loci upon treatment with SGC-CBP30, there is little correlation with the effects of the pure BET inhibitor CPI203. In contrast, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref> we show that SGC-CBP30 leads to eviction of EP300 at numerous loci, an effect that is not observed with CPI203 (which in fact increases EP300 enrichment at multiple loci). We finally show some example loci with BRD4 and EP300 ChIP-seq tracks following SGC-CBP30 and CPI203 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Note the eviction of EP300 at the IRF4 super-enhancer and at the ARHGEF12 locus (which is accompanied by minimal eviction of BRD4) in response to SGC-CBP30. In contrast note the robust eviction of only BRD4 at the IgH enhancer (which drives <italic>MYC</italic> in this cell line) and loci such as CLECL1 in response to CPI203. These data argue that the effects of SGC-CBP30 are not due to global eviction of BRD4, which is observed only with the pure BET inhibitor CPI203.</p><p><italic>5) The authors have not clearly delineated the specificity of these agents. If activity data across the entire family of bromodomains is available this should be provided. If not, the compounds should be profiled in something like the commercially available Bromoscan. In the absence of such data, it is not clear whether effects on other bromodomains may contribute to the phenotypes observed.</italic> </p><p>As discussed in point 1 above, we have added DSF data across a panel of bromodomains to the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). We further reference the recently published manuscripts from the SGC to support our data.</p><p><italic>6) The rationale for using a BRD9</italic> â <italic>CBP bromodomain fusion protein for the chromatin release assay is entirely unclear and may substantially alter the effects of the compound on CBP occupancy which may or may not have other chromatin tethering capabilities. This experiment should be done with CBP and/or P300.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the ambiguity in our explanation for making use of the BRD9 scaffold to test the CBP bromodomain. We have added additional text addressing the assay to the Methods section so as not to distract the reader in the Results section. Consistent with data published in Picaud et al. (Cancer Res. 2015) we did not observe consistent release of chromatin-bound full-length CBP-ZsGreen fusion proteins in response to pharmacologic inhibition or inactivating mutation of the bromodomain. The group at the SGC rectified this problem by fusing three copies of the CBP bromodomain to GFP for FRAP experiments. Our solution was to swap the bromodomain of CBP into the BRD9 scaffold. We found that this domain-swapped fusion protein was released from chromatin only by compounds that showed biochemical engagement of CBP, and that swapping distinct bromodomains into the BRD9 scaffold allowed for chromatin release only with compounds that targeted that specific bromodomain (see our published patent application WO/2014/144303 for reference). While we cannot completely rule out confounding effects of using the chimeric CBP bromodomain in the BRD9 scaffold, our data with the chromatin release assay is complimentary to the BRET assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, as well as to the published cellular target engagement assays for SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 from the SGC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
