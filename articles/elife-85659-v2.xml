In this study, FAM76B was first demonstrated to inhibit the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway by affecting the translocation of hnRNPA2B1 in vitro. We further showed that FAM76B suppressed inflammation in vivo using a traumatic brain injury (TBI) mouse model. Lastly, FAM76B was shown to interact with hnRNPA2B1 in human tissues taken from patients with acute, organizing, and chronic TBI, and with different neurodegenerative diseases. The results suggested that FAM76B mediated neuroinflammation via influencing the translocation of hnRNPA2B1 in vivo during TBI repair and neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, we for the first time demonstrated the role of FAM76B in regulating inflammation and further showed that FAM76B could regulate the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway by affecting hnRNPA2B1 translocation, which provides new information for studying the mechanism of inflammation regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FAM76B</kwd><kwd>hnRNPA2B1</kwd><kwd>NF-κB pathway</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81773265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Haibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013317</institution-id><institution>Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018SF-106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Haibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007128</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023-JC-YB-642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Xiaojing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GK202007023 and GK202107018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Haibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical analyses in vitro and in vivo reveal how the novel protein FAM76B regulates inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral immune cells mediating inflammation have been reported to be closely associated with the development of some diseases, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suarez-Carmona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khansari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khandia and Munjal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kolb et al., 2016</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khodabandehloo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saltiel and Olefsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curley et al., 2021</xref>), and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lochhead et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Venkatesha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Raya and Abou-Raya, 2006</xref>), among others. Microglia, as the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), act as the first line of defense in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muzio et al., 2021</xref>) and play a role in mediating neuroinflammation.

In our previous study, by using immunohistochemical staining with custom-made anti-human FAM76B monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), we found strong immunolabeling of FAM76B in the human brain, lymph nodes, and spleen. The results raised the question: does this protein play a role in regulating inflammation and neuroinflammation? In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that FAM76B could inhibit inflammation in vitro and in vivo by inactivating the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, we showed that FAM76B could regulate the NF-κB pathway and mediate inflammation by affecting the translocation of hnRNPA2B1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FAM76B plays an anti-inflammatory role in macrophages in vitro</title><p>FAM76B is a nuclear speckle-localized protein with previously unknown function. We previously found that FAM76B was highly expressed in U937 cells using an in-house FAM76B antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). U937 is a human macrophage cell line that has been widely used to study inflammation in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that FAM76B might involve inflammation in U937 cells in this study. To test the hypothesis, we first produced a <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockdown U937 cell line (<italic>Fam76b</italic> KD) by lentivirus-mediated Cas9/sgRNA genome editing. The expression of FAM76B in U937 cells with <italic>Fam76b</italic> KD was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Following treatment with PMA plus LPS/IFNγ, the cell line showed markedly increased expressions of <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>PTGS2</italic>, <italic>TNFα</italic>, and <italic>IL10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

The results indicated that FAM76B was involved in regulating inflammation in U937 cells. Furthermore, a <italic>FAM76B</italic> gene knockout (<italic>Fam76b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) U937 cell line was obtained using Cas9/sgRNA technology followed by drug screening and dilution cloning, then was confirmed by western blot and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Moreover, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of FAM76B rescued the function of FAM76B and reduced cytokine mRNA levels in <italic>Fam76b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>).

IL-6 is one of the important mediators of the inflammatory response, and it can be activated by NF-κB. NF-κB/IL-6 signaling has long been considered as a major proinflammatory signaling pathway in the peripheral tissues and brain. To explore the mechanisms of FAM76B regulating inflammation in U937 cells, the luciferase reporter vector of the <italic>IL6</italic> promoter was constructed. HEK293 cells transfected with this vector showed upregulated activity of the <italic>IL6</italic> promoter by NF-κB overexpression, confirming the activity of the reporter vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockout in HEK293 cells further increased the promoter activity of <italic>IL6</italic>, compared to wild-type (WT) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In WT U937 cells, the activity of the <italic>IL6</italic> promoter was increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, and <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockout in U937 cells made this change even more prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Next, to evaluate if FAM76B regulates <italic>IL6</italic> promoter activity via influencing NF-κB, we constructed luciferase reporters controlled by a miniCMV promoter containing the NF-κB binding motif 1 or 2 sequence from the <italic>IL6</italic> promoter region. The results indicated that the luciferase activity from the vector in both WT and <italic>Fam76b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> U937 cells was increased, especially in the latter, after treatment with 1 ng/mL LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). These data suggested that FAM76B inhibited the activity of the <italic>IL6</italic> promoter by downregulating the NF-κB pathway.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>FAM76B regulates <italic>IL6</italic> promoter activity by affecting the NF-κB pathway.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The luciferase reporter vector of the <italic>IL6</italic> promoter was tested in wild-type (WT) and <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockout (<italic>Fam76b</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) HEK293 cells.

We identified 160 proteins that interacted with FAM76B within U937 cells. Selective molecules of these proteins were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, with their interaction scores and ranks. To validate the IP-MS results, co-immunoprecipitation on selected proteins was performed. Among those FAM76B interacting proteins, hnRNPs captured our attention because of their reported function in regulating the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). The hnRNPA2B1 was selected for further validation. The co-immunoprecipitation results confirmed the interaction of FAM76B with hnRNPA2B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In addition, confocal microscopy also revealed the co-localization of FAM76B and hnRNPA2B1 in the nucleus of HEK293 cells overexpressing FAM76B-eGFP and hnRNPA2B1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Based on the validation of the interaction between hnRNPA2B1 and FAM76B, to identify the domain(s) of the hnRNPA2B1 required for their interaction with FAM76B, we generated different truncates containing RRM1, RRM2, or RGD domains of hnRNPA2B1 and demonstrated that the RGD domain of hnRNPA2B1 was responsible for its binding to FAM76B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). It has been reported that hnRNPA1 binds to IΚBα, which led to IκBα degradation and consequently, to NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). Using co-immunoprecipitation with HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing hnRNPA2B1 and IκBα-flag (or IκBε-flag), we also demonstrated that hnRNPA2B1 bound to IκBα or IκBε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Based on the results above, we speculated that FAM76B, hnRNP A/B, and IκBs could form a protein complex by binding FAM76B to hnRNPs through the RGD domain and binding hnRNPs to IκBs through the RRM2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). These results suggested that FAM76B might regulate hnRNPA2B1-mediated inflammatory action through a novel interaction, subsequently influencing the activation of NF-kB pathway.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Validation of the interactions among FAM76B, hnRNPA2B1 and IκBs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The interaction between FAM76B and hnRNPA2B1 was revealed by co-immunoprecipitation.

Considering the interaction of FAM76B and hnRNPA2B1, we speculated that FAM76B was the molecule that affected the cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNPA2B1 and subsequent NF-kB activation and inflammation. To test that hypothesis, hnRNPA2B1 immunostaining was performed on U937 cells with <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockout treated with PMA, which showed increased cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNPA2B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>); this result was also confirmed by the levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic hnRNPA2B1 using western blot and semiquantification based on the results of western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). A similar result was obtained in U937 cells with <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockout treated with PMA followed by LPS+IFNγ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–f</xref>). To further confirm our hypothesis, we produced stable U937 cell lines overexpressing FAM76B (<italic>Fam76b<sup>OE</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The inflammatory responses in this stable cell line were examined following treated with PMA plus LPS+IFNγ stimulation. Overexpression of FAM76B downregulated <italic>IL6</italic> expression significantly, and to a lesser extent, the expressions of <italic>PTGS2</italic> and <italic>TNFα</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). <italic>IL10</italic> expression was minimally or mildly affected by FAM76B overexpression in U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These data indicated that FAM76B had an anti-inflammatory effect. At the same time, there were no significant differences in cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNPA2B1 between U937 cells and U937 cells overexpressing FAM76B, when they were treated with PMA only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

(a) FAM76B was a novel systemic inflammatory and neuroinflammatory modulator that could inhibit NF-κB activity by affecting the cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNPA2B1, a newly discovered interacting partner of FAM76B in this study. (b) Human brains with TBI showed the activation, evolution, and persistence of FAM76B-positive microglia, indicating the significant role of FAM76B in the development of human TBI. (c) There was an increased cytoplasmic co-localization of FAM76B and hnRNPA2B1 in the brain of the patients with TBI or neurodegeneration, particularly in FTLD-TDP.</p><p>This is the first report investigating the function of FAM76B in inflammation and neuroinflammation. In this study, we speculated that when FAM76B was present in the nucleus, the hnRNPA2B1 protein was trapped in the nucleus by its binding to FAM76B; however, when FAM76B was decreased or made absent (such as by <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockdown or knockout, respectively) or was subjected to inflammatory stimulation (such as by LPS), the hnRNPA2B1 protein translocated to the cytoplasm, which then led to increased NF-κB-mediated inflammation by degrading IκBα and causing p65 to enter the nucleus. When FAM76B was overexpressed, the translocation of hnRNPA2B1 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was suppressed, and led to the inhibition of NF-κB-mediated inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Followed by LPS+IFNγ stimulation, FAM76B and hnRNPA2B1 were found to be partially translocated into the cytoplasm from the nucleus. We speculated that the increased cytoplasmic translocation of FAM76B under inflammatory situation was possibly to balance the increased action of hnRNPA2B1. The detailed mechanism involved needs to be further investigated.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of FAM76B regulating the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway by affecting the hnRNPA2B1 translocation.</title><p>Under normal conditions, FAM76B could bind to hnRNPA2B1 and make hnRNPA2B1 stay in the nucleus. However, when the expression level of FAM76B was changed, the localization of hnRNPA2B1 was also changed, which then regulated inflammation in immune cells. ① When FAM76B expression was decreased or knocked out in the immune cells, more hnRNPA2B1 proteins translocated into the cytoplasm and led to increased NF-κB-mediated inflammation by the degradation of IKBα and p65’s entry into the nucleus. ② When FAM76B expression was increased in the immune cells, FAM76B could trap more hnRNPA2B1 in the nucleus and resulted in less cytoplasmic distribution of hnRNPA2B1 correspondingly, which led to the inhibition of NF-κB mediated inflammation due to the less degradation of IκBα and less entry of P65 into nucleus.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85659-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>FAM76B is one of the 86 proteins in the human genome that contains stretches of five or more histidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salichs et al., 2009</xref>). Studies have suggested that His-repeats may act as nuclear speckle-targeting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrmann and Mancini, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salichs et al., 2009</xref>). In our previous study, we confirmed the nuclear speckle localization of both human and mouse FAM76B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, FAM76B may have functions related to nuclear speckles, such as splicing factor storage and modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salichs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGlincy et al., 2010</xref>). We found in this study that FAM76B interacted with hnRNPA2B1, a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein related to mRNA binding and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moran-Jones et al., 2005</xref>) that was associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin and Cao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2011</xref>). By in vitro and in vivo experiments, we showed that FAM76B could regulate NF-κB-mediated inflammation via influencing the translocation of hnRNPA2B1.</p><p>Neuroinflammation is the response of the CNS to injury and disease and is the common thread that connects brain injuries to neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilhus and Deuschl, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brambilla, 2019</xref>). In TBI, neuroinflammation is one of the most prominent reactions. TBI leads to early resident microglial activation, which is accompanied by local upregulations of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frugier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Csuka et al., 1999</xref>) and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frugier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perez-Barcena et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Helmy et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, we also found increased levels of IL-6 at the contusion site of mouse brains after TBI. In addition, the IL-6 level was further increased by <italic>FAM76B</italic> knockout, indicating the role of the FAM76B-NF-κB pathway in regulating microglial function and driving acute post-traumatic neuroinflammation. TBI can cause persistent neuroinflammation and microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morganti-Kossmann et al., 2019</xref>). Studies of TBI biomarkers in adults with severe TBI have shown that serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are chronically increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2017</xref>). TBI animal models have demonstrated persistently increased numbers of microglia at the margins of the lesion and in the thalamus at 1 year post-injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we found that in human brain tissue of chronic TBI patients, there was persistent enhanced expression and cytoplasmic distribution of FAM76B in microglia. Persistent microgliosis after TBI correlates with chronic neurodegeneration and dementia development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberici et al., 2018</xref>), which suggests that chronic neuroinflammation may be the mechanism of the neurodegeneration associated with TBI. Furthermore, TBI and neurodegeneration may share a similar neuroinflammatory pathway. In this study, we observed that the enhanced expression and cytoplasmic distribution of FAM76B occurred in both chronic TBI and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly FTLD-TDP, suggesting that the FAM76B-mediated inflammatory pathway might be the common pathway that mediated the neuroinflammation in TBI and FTLD-TDP and that FAM76B-mediated neuroinflammation might be the mechanism by which TBI is linked to neurodegeneration.</p><p>In the peripheral tissues, FAM76B deficiency led to increased activation of the NF-κB pathway. In response to an acute proinflammatory stimulus, intraperitoneal LPS administration, <italic>Fam76b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed an interesting phenotype: significantly increased tingible body macrophages in the spleen’s white pulp. This finding suggested that FAM76B played a unique role in regulating macrophage function. An overlap between FTLD and autoimmune disease has been noted in the field of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberici et al., 2018</xref>). FTLD-associated genetic variants are also linked to autoimmune conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bright et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, FAM76B dysfunction might be involved in autoimmune processes in FTLD. Though the function of FAM76B in the peripheral tissue is beyond the scope of this paper, it deserves to be further investigated.</p><p>In summary, we elucidated, for the first time, a novel function for FAM76B: modulating systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation via influencing the translocation of hnRNPA2B1. We demonstrated the role of FAM76B in the shared neuroinflammatory pathway of TBI and neurodegeneration, particularly in FTLD-TDP.

evidence for its mechanism of action. FAM76B previously had no clear cellular function but the solid experimental methods described in this study established it as a negative regulator of inflammation.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Section 3.2 &quot;FAM76B regulates the NF-κB pathway by influencing the translocation of hnRNPA2B1&quot; on pages 13-14 requires additional data to support the title or revise to discuss whether the possible role of increased cytoplasmic translocation of FAM76B under inflammatory situation is to balance the increased action of hnRNPA2B1, and not to promote the activation of NF-κB pathway. Overexpression of FAM76B with and without stimulation of LPS and IFNγ could be informative. Additionally, consider altering NFKB or hnRNPA2B1 in both WT and FAM76B KO cells in response to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS or TNFa to strengthen conclusion.</p><p>2) The columns in Figure 9 different magnifications which exaggerates effect, please provide same magnification for both groups. Also, is the n=5 for figure 9 from 5 different brains? Or 5 different regions of one section? From methods, it seems it is 5 regions of one brain section. This should be removed or revised to clearly note that it is comparing two patients.</p><p>3) The mouse data do not support a role of FAM76B in TBI, it only shows that an inflammatory trigger increased Iba1 and cytokine expression. Claims for a role of FAM76B for TBI should be revised.</p><p>4) The custom antibody reacts with mouse FAM76B based on 2016 paper. Which cells express FAM76B in the mouse brain? Is there evidence that microglia express it in mice? Or is increased Iba1 an indirect effect? The authors should consider a figure showing the colocalization of FAM76B with microglia in the mouse brain to support the increased Iba1 is direct effect of FAM76B effects in microglia.</p><p>5) The heading for 3.4 should be revised. There is no evidence to support that FAM76B plays a role in neurodegeneration or TBI. Authors should remove mention of FAM76B playing a role in neurodegeneration. If anything, it seems it is increased in Iba1 cells but wouldn't that possibly decrease the inflammatory state of microglia? For example, point d in the first paragraph of Discussion: what is the evidence that TBI shows &quot;activation, evolution and persistence of FAM76B-NFkB mediated neuroinflammation during repair process&quot; in human brain? Similar concern for point e. Authors should focus on the data provided that supports causal not correlative role. The finding that FAM76B can regulate neuroinflammatory responses is the primary takeaway from the current study with the data presented. Overall, the human data is interesting but not adequate to support a claim of FAM76B having a contribution to neurodegeneration or TBI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript from Wang et al., first demonstrated that FAM76B inhibited the NF-κB-mediated inflammation by modulating the cytosol translocation of hnRNPA2B1, which is a potentially important finding about inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases which not much is known. There is a need in the field to better understand the underlying mechanism. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and easy to follow, and the study is focused on an important question in the roles and mechanism of FAM76B in regulation of inflammation. This work is an important step forward.</p><p>1. FAM76B was described as a negative regulator of inflammation in this work, could the author discuss whether it had a directly function on NFkB or its upstream signaling?</p><p>2.

However, the major concern is that it is still unclear how the FAM76B regulates/or affects the cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNPA2B1 in brain cells after a variety of injuried stimuli and thereby influencing the NF-κB activation.</p><p>1. Results of 3.2 &quot;FAM76B regulates the NF-κB pathway by influencing the translocation of hnRNPA2B1&quot; on pages, 13-14, are unclear. First, data from U937 cells with FAM76B gene knockout upon the LPS stimulation showed that inhibition of FAM76B increased the activity of the IL-6 promotor, NF-κB binding motifs (Figure 2), cytosolic hnRNPA2B1 levels, phosphates IKBa and IKBß and nuclear activation of p65 (Figure 4). However, Figure 4h showed that both FAM76B and hnRNPA2B1 were found to be partially translocated into the cytoplasm from the nucleus in the M1-like macriphage cells after LPS and IFNγ stimulation. Thus, the authors concluded that&quot;FAM76B could promote NF-κB activation by affecting the translocation of hnRNPA2B1&quot;, which was not supported but conflicted by Figures2, and 4a -g. This statement needs to be further examined in U937 cells with over expression of FAM76B with or without LPS and IFNγ stimulation. At least, the authors may need to discuss whether the possible role of increased cytoplasmic translocation of FAM76B under inflammatory situation is to balance the increased action of hnRNPA2B1, but not to promote the activation of NF-κB pathway.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85659.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Section 3.2 &quot;FAM76B regulates the NF-κB pathway by influencing the translocation of hnRNPA2B1&quot; on pages 13-14 requires additional data to support the title or revise to discuss whether the possible role of increased cytoplasmic translocation of FAM76B under inflammatory situation is to balance the increased action of hnRNPA2B1, and not to promote the activation of NF-κB pathway.

We are very sorry for the incorrect conclusion &quot;FAM76B could promote NF-κB activation by affecting the translocation of hnRNPA2B1&quot; in Section 3.2 &quot;FAM76B regulates the NF-κB pathway by influencing the translocation of hnRNPA2B1&quot; on pages 16 in the original manuscript. It was made by our mistake. We have corrected this. The right statement is “FAM76B could inhibit NF-κB activation by affecting the translocation of hnRNPA2B1.” which is (See the revised manuscript on page 7, lines 151-152). (2) According to your suggestion, we revised discussion part about increased cytoplasmic translocation of FAM76B under inflammatory situation (See Page 12, lines 284-288 in the revised manuscript). (3) According to your suggestion, we included the results of U937 cells with the overexpression of FAM76B treated with PMA only or with PMA followed by LPS+IFNγ stimulation in revised manuscript on Page 6, lines 137-146. The results indicated that overexpression of FAM76B could downregulate several inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, PTGS2 and TNF-α, indicating that FAM76B had an anti-inflammatory effect (See revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1), and inhibit the translocation of hnRNPA2B1 from nucleus to cytoplasm in U937 cells followed by LPS and IFNγ stimulation compared to the control group (See revised Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and 3).

The results were added in the manuscript on Page 6, lines 135-136 (See revised Figure 4d-f). Considering the logicality of the results from Figure 4, the original Figure 4h was moved and renamed revised Figure 4—figure supplement 4. Besides, in the study, we mainly focused the effect of FAM76B on the translocation of the hnRNPA2B1.
