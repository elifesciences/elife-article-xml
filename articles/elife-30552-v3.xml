However, TMS-evoked activity of individual neurons has remained largely inaccessible due to the large TMS-induced electromagnetic fields. Here, we present a general method providing direct in vivo electrophysiological access to TMS-evoked neuronal activity 0.8–1 ms after TMS onset. We translated human single-pulse TMS to rodents and unveiled time-grained evoked activities of motor cortex layer V neurons that show high-frequency spiking within the first 6 ms depending on TMS-induced current orientation and a multiphasic spike-rhythm alternating between excitation and inhibition in the 6–300 ms epoch, all of which can be linked to various human TMS responses recorded at the level of spinal cord and muscles. The advance here facilitates a new level of insight into the TMS-brain interaction that is vital for developing this non-invasive tool to purposefully explore and effectively treat the human brain.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30552.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Being able to tap into someone’s brain activity by holding loops of wires above their head sounds a little like the stuff of science fiction. And yet this technique, known as transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS, is used in research and to treat many brain disorders. TMS emits a pulsed magnetic field that induces tiny electrical currents in the underlying brain tissue, activating that region of the brain. But exactly how these currents affect the individual neurons and networks within activated brain regions remains unclear.</p><p>The main reason for this is that we cannot use conventional electrode-based techniques to study neuronal activity during TMS because its strong electromagnetic interferences mask the signals from the electrodes. Several groups have found ways to overcome this problem. However, their methods are technically demanding and specific to one single animal model –limitations that could present an obstacle for many laboratories. Li et al. therefore set out to develop a simple and widely accessible method to study neuronal activities under TMS.</p><p>The resulting method makes it possible to measure the activity of individual neurons roughly 1/1,000<sup>th</sup> of a second after applying TMS. To show that the technique works, Li et al. induced small movements in the forelimbs of rats by applying TMS to the brain region that controls the forelimbs, while measuring the activity of neurons at the same time. This revealed, for the first time, how the neurons responsible for the forelimb movements responded to TMS. The observed TMS-triggered neuronal activity continued long after the TMS pulse had ended. The activity also varied depending on the direction of TMS-induced currents in the brain.</p><p>This new method opens up the possibility to conveniently study – in rodents or other animals – how TMS procedures that are used in patients affect neuronal activity. Li et al. hope this will make it easier to develop, study and refine these procedures, and lead to advances in TMS therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>spikes</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>I-wave</kwd><kwd>coil orientation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bingshuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bingshuo</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Cornelius</given-names></name><name><surname>Giese</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Cornelius</given-names></name><name><surname>Giese</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ziemann</surname><given-names>Ulf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KA 1258/15-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giese</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020 CogIMon ICT-644727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giese</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008316</institution-id><institution>Baden-Württemberg Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KONSENS-NHE NEU/007/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giese</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0036/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giese</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cellular-level in vivo investigative method that provides unprecedented insights into the dynamics of neuronal activities evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1985, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker et al. (1985)</xref> applied a pulsed magnetic field to a subject’s head to selectively evoke responses in a hand muscle, the scientific community was fascinated by this pain-free, electrodeless, and non-invasive tool for brain stimulation. Since then, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has attracted enormous interest in neurology, psychiatry, and applied neuroscience research for its unique capability of non-invasively activating neuronal populations and inducing plasticity. Despite its impressive array of applications and fast-growing popularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walsh and Cowey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funke and Benali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lefaucheur et al., 2014</xref>), TMS is poorly understood physiologically as we know very little about how TMS interacts with the brain at the level of neurons and circuitries. Although various sources of indirect evidence obtained from human studies support the use of TMS in multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Lazzaro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suppa et al., 2016</xref>), our very limited insight into the neurophysiology of TMS remains a bottleneck that hampers the utilization and the development of TMS applications, blocking the exciting potential of this non-invasive brain stimulation tool.</p><p>One critical reason behind this inadequacy is the absence of a research platform on which TMS-evoked neuronal activities can be investigated in vivo in real time. Extracellular electrophysiology (EEP) with microelectrodes is the gold standard for studying brain activities at the level of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scanziani and Häusser, 2009</xref>). However, a single TMS pulse, characterized by an alternating tesla-level magnetic field with a center frequency of approximately 4 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ilmoniemi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>), generates an array of strong interferences disturbing the acquisition of EEP signal. As evidenced by the pioneering works on TMS-EEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moliadze et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pasley et al., 2009</xref>), artifacts from TMS resulted in a significant amount of data loss that precluded the investigation of TMS-evoked neuronal activities for up to 100 ms after each TMS pulse. Several groups used innovative imaging methods to circumvent this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozyrev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>); however, their investigations were restricted to the upper cortical layers and they were unable to reach the single-neuron and millisecond precision needed to decipher the intricate interactions between TMS and neurons. Recently, two groups reported TMS-EEP methods for non-human primate research. One of the methods utilized custom-built TMS coil and offline correction to minimize the TMS-induced data loss to a median time of 2.5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tischler et al., 2011</xref>), while the other used a combination of custom-built coil, amplifier modifications, field sensing, active compensation, and offline correction to minimize the data loss to 1 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller et al., 2014</xref>). Despite their success in artifact reduction, these methods face a major limitation that the technical expertise required for their implementations, especially custom-building TMS coils and field sensing, is not widely accessible to the neuroscience community. More importantly, these methods were developed solely for non-human primate research, which is used for investigating the neuronal underpinnings of high-level cognitive functions and therefore is not best suited for investigations concerning basic neurophysiology on the level of cells and detailed microcircuits.</p><p>With the aim of establishing a widely applicable in vivo experimental platform to study the dynamics of TMS-evoked neuronal activities and to further develop the scientific and clinical applications of this powerful technique, we engineered a novel method for TMS-EEP that is suitable for, but not limited to, laboratory rodents, which are widely accessible and offer a rich repertoire of experimental techniques including transgenic and optogenetic tools. The method is compatible with existing standard TMS coils and allows the recording of neuronal activities 0.8–1 ms after the onset of various types of TMS stimuli by attenuating artifacts resulting from magnetic induction, electric field coupling, and vibrations. Furthermore, the method allows for the instantaneous determination of TMS-driven inadvertent charge injection into the neural tissue, a problem that has been overlooked by almost all prior TMS-EEP studies. In the following sections, we will present this methodological advance and demonstrate its potential by unveiling neuronal activities in the layer V of the primary motor cortex (M1) that accompany cortically evoked unilateral muscle activations by monophasic single-pulse TMS (mspTMS). Additionally, we will also demonstrate that mspTMS modulates different neuronal circuits depending on the orientation of the stimulating current or the time-window of investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Attenuation of the induction artifact</title><p>The induction artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, period indicated in blue) is created as coil-generated rapid magnetic flux change induces voltages within loops formed along an EEP recording assembly. Owing to the large rate of flux change, the induction artifact, if transmitted to the high-gain and filter stages of an EEP amplifier, can easily lead to signal saturation and data loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset). To address this, we developed a gated multi-stage TMS-EEP amplifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It consists of a differential preamplifier (Pamp) stage of gain four and a filter-amplifier (Famp) stage of gain 500, separated by an ultra-low capacitance/charge injection solid-state analog switch (SSSW) controlled by optically coupled digital signal synchronized to TMS. The components of the amplifier were chosen to provide the optimal balance between voltage and current noise with the source impedance of EEP microelectrodes. The Pamp stage must be able to maintain its high impedance character when being perturbed by TMS. Failing to do so will result in excessive induction current in the input wires that leads to electrical stimulation of the brain. In our design, the electronic components and supply voltage of the Pamp stage were chosen so it can tolerate ±7.9 V input during TMS. Due to its high-gain and filters, the Famp stage must be protected from TMS by SSSW that grounds the input to Famp for a user-defined time interval around TMS onset (e.g. from 0.2 ms pre- to 0.8 ms post-TMS). The SSSW was strategically placed behind the input capacitor of a high-pass filter of the Famp so that the input capacitor is preconditioned to any DC bias in the microelectrodes before the end of the grounding period. To minimize ground bounce and to reduce ground loop, the external digital signal that controls SSSW is connected to the amplifier circuit through an optocoupler (OC). In addition, to protect the amplifier circuit from TMS-induced fields, the circuit board of the amplifier is mounted inside a 1.5-mm-thick grounded aluminum enclosure. The Pamp, as well as DC-DC converters, is housed inside a metal shield for additional protection. Furthermore, to minimize artifacts from vibrations due to the loud click sound of TMS coils, solder contacts, instead of spring-loaded connectors, were used whenever possible, as well as polyphenylene sulfide film capacitors, since they do not generate piezoelectric voltages from vibration. The default frequency response of the amplifier was set from 300 Hz (−3 dB) to 5 kHz (−6 dB), but the lower bound of the passband can be adjusted to 4 Hz as needed for different applications. A simplified circuit diagram of the amplifier, including the model number of its critical components, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30552.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simultaneous TMS-EEP recording requires artifact attenuation in multiple dimensions.</title><p>The full waveform of a TMS artifact recorded differentially under low-gain (x4) using a high impedance amplifier. The artifact consists of a series of sharp deflections (induction and fast E-field coupling artifacts) and a long tail (polarization decay artifact resulted from E-field coupling). The slow polarization decay artifact renders the signal out of range (indicated by the green area) until ca. 30 ms post-TMS in a standard EEP system. Vibration artifacts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) are not visible here due to low amplification.

When a TMS pulse is triggered, a large current driven by a kV-level voltage pulse flows through the coil. Inadvertently, this process emits an electric field that injects a displacement current into the EEP recording assembly through capacitive coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In a short time-interval (&lt;0.4 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, period indicated in orange), as the coil current rapidly fluctuates, the displacement current generates a fast-changing artifact in EEP signal. In a long time-interval (tens of ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, period indicated in yellow), a decay-like artifact is observed as the displacement current polarizes the electrochemical double-layer of microelectrode tips and thereby generates a decaying waveform while the double-layer returns to its equilibrium potential. Depending on stimulation intensity, electrode impedance, and filter settings, the decay may persist with relatively high signal values for tens of milliseconds before re-entering the input range of a standard EEP amplifier (green area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), contributing to an extended period of data loss. To address this problem, we developed an electrical shield for the TMS coil that substantially attenuates the coil-emitted electric field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). One important consideration in shield construction is that the amount of eddy current in the shield should remain low; otherwise, strong vibration or even magnetic attenuation may occur. Therefore, we applied a layer of weakly conducting material in shield construction and the resulted shield possesses an electrical resistance of 10 kΩ (see Materials and methods) that does not result in vibration and magnetic attenuation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30552.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Electric field coupling in TMS-EEP and its attenuation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustrating how electric field coupling interferes with the EEP recording circuit. Here, the loop between one microelectrode and the ground is used as an example. The microelectrode is modeled as a parallel resistor-capacitor for simplification.

The branch of displacement current (I<sub>D1</sub>) that flows toward the input end of the amplifier opposes the I<sub>ind</sub>, counteracting the magnetically induced voltage change across the amplifier input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>).

As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> illustrates, induction voltage waveforms, with and without the shield, overlap perfectly, confirming the absence of any noticeable magnetic attenuation. Subsequently, using a high-impedance buffer, we measured the voltage between an EEP microelectrode and a ground electrode, both electrode tips immersed in a saline bath, under mspTMS at 100% maximum stimulator output (MSO) delivered with or without the shield. We expected that the shield would remove, to a large extent, voltage signal that is due to electric field coupling between the TMS coil and the EEP recording assembly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> illustrates the results from these measurements. Without the shield, the captured waveform was drastically different from the induction waveforms resulted by mspTMS (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and it ended with a strong voltage bias (polarization). With the shield in place, the captured waveform appeared consistent with the induction waveforms and the voltage bias was no longer visible. These findings confirm that by interrupting electric field coupling, the shield is effective in preventing polarization and the decay artifact that follows.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Attenuation of vibration artifacts</title><p>Upon elimination of artifacts resulted from induction and electric field coupling, vibration artifacts, which are normally masked by the other artifacts, become visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Vibration can be generated by magnetic force, as well as by sound pressure perturbation. For the magnetically mediated vibration, an avoidance of ferromagnetic materials and large conductive surfaces in the close vicinity of the coil is adequate. However, the elimination of vibration artifacts driven by sound pressure is not straightforward. When a TMS pulse is triggered, a loud click sound is produced by coil wires due to the attractive forces between them. This sound is problematic as it generates micro-vibration in the amplifier input cables. The extremely weak signal (μV-level) these cables carry can be easily perturbed by micro-vibrations through the triboelectric effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fowler, 1976</xref>). Since the generation of such click sound is inevitable, we attenuated the vibration artifacts by using a special type of low-noise miniature coaxial cable with a semiconducting layer added between its dielectric and braided shield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The addition of this semiconducting layer provides a path that drains triboelectric charges, rendering the cables insensitive to vibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30552.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Low-noise miniature coaxial cable attenuates vibration artifacts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustration of the 36-gauge low-noise miniature coaxial cable.

In our case, we kept the length of our cables at 16 cm to keep the signal attenuation less than 20% at 1 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Minimization and determination of inadvertent charge injection</title><p>TMS-driven inadvertent charge injection is another major issue, which has been overlooked by most prior reports using EEP under TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moliadze et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pasley et al., 2009</xref>). By inserting electrodes into the brain and connecting them to the measurement electronics, multiple loops of electric circuit are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When being subjected to alternating electric and magnetic field, voltages can be readily developed along these loops that drive unwanted current injection into the brain through microelectrodes. If the amount and the temporal structure of the injected current are comparable to the threshold parameters reported in intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) literature (bipolar charge transfer totaling from 150 to 800 pC, current waveform approximately similar to that of TMS; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asanuma and Rosén, 1973</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butovas and Schwarz, 2003</xref>), such current will excite neuronal elements around the microelectrode tips and therefore severely confound the measurement of TMS effects. Therefore, it is crucial that the development of voltages along these loops be minimized. Since a large portion of the TMS-emitted electric field had already been filtered away by the coil shield, precautions were taken for magnetic induction. These included a compact arrangement of microelectrodes as well as cable twisting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), both minimize the area of induction loops exposed to TMS. More importantly, we incorporated a low-gain monitoring channel (LGM as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in our amplifier design that allowed us to conveniently determine the amount of inadvertent current flow, without any additional measurement devices, under each experimental setup. The conversion from voltage, which is measured by the LGM, to current is made possible since amplifier’s input capacitance and its voltage fluctuation are known, and the amount of current flow through the input capacitance is equal to the amount of current flow in the circuit.

In this set of experiments, we switched the TMS coil orientation so that the induced current flows from the posterior to the anterior part of the brain (PA stimulation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> inset).

As the two examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> demonstrate, at 120% MT intensity, ML stimulation evoked scarcely any spike, whereas PA stimulation evoked robust neuronal firing generating a distinct temporal pattern with peaks at 1.2–1.6 ms and at 3.2–4.2 ms.

Direct investigation of the dynamics of neuronal activities evoked by TMS was hindered by technical obstacles imposed by the strong electromagnetic pulse produced by TMS. We engineered a widely applicable experimental method for the in vivo study of TMS-evoked brain activities at the level of neurons using EEP. It allows the monitoring of neuronal activities as early as 0.8–1 ms after the strong electromagnetic perturbation of various TMS stimuli ranging from single pulse to the high-frequency theta burst stimulation. Our method encompasses solutions to all major challenges in concurrent TMS-EEP recording, including magnetic induction, electric field coupling, vibrations, and inadvertent charge injection. Despite the multidimensional approach of our method, it was developed with generalizability, simplicity, flexibility, and scalability in mind. It is compatible with, but not limited to, rodents, an animal model that is widely used for studying basic neurophysiology and offers a wide range of investigative tools. It does not require active compensation based on magnetic field sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller et al., 2014</xref>) or custom-made coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tischler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller et al., 2014</xref>) for artifact reduction. It can accommodate electrodes directly under a conventional TMS coil, a feature making it suitable even for awake animals with chronically implanted electrodes. In addition, the method can be scaled up for large-scale high-density EEP recording with silicon-based microelectrode arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>) as well as be accompanied by optogenetic tools for the in vivo control of neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scanziani and Häusser, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The amount of magnetic, electric, and vibrational interference TMS imposed on EEP depends on multiple factors. Some of the most critical factors include the waveform and magnitude of the pulsed magnetic and electric field emitted from a TMS coil, the size of circuit loops formed by an EEP recording assembly, and the coil position relative to these loops. Changes in these parameters will result in changes in the severity of different types of interference. For example, keeping the coil the same, by replacing a standard monophasic with a standard biphasic stimulator, coil-emitted fields will generate a longer period of magnetic and electric field interference due to the longer pulse waveform. However, the severity of interference might be lower if the coil and biphasic stimulator combination does not produce magnetic and electric outputs that are as high as those in the monophasic case. Similarly, miniaturization of TMS coils for small animals can also lead to a reduction in interference because of the reduced electromagnetic output of such devices. Furthermore, the integration of recording, reference, and ground electrode in one microfabricated electrode array can also reduce the severity of interference as such configuration significantly decreases the area of circuit loops exposed to TMS.</p><p>One common criticism of TMS investigations in rodents is that the TMS coil is large compared to the size of a rodent brain. While we fully acknowledge this concern, we argue that it is not a problem of critical importance at this stage. With careful coil positioning, it is possible to achieve certain level of spatial selectivity as evident in the results of our study as well as those of several other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rotenberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, plasticity, assessed by motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2014</xref>), learning performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mix et al., 2010</xref>), sensory-evoked neural activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thimm and Funke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>), or protein expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trippe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benali et al., 2011</xref>), can also be successfully induced in rodents using human TMS coils, making rodents a suitable experimental model for investigating the basic neuronal mechanisms underlying stimulation-induced plasticity. Furthermore, TMS can be used as a tool to deliver a strong transient stimulus to perturb neuronal populations of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walsh and Cowey, 2000</xref>). Being able to capture the neuronal response to such perturbation at spike resolution will undoubtedly open up another avenue to study the connectivity and the functional properties of neuronal networks. Nonetheless, the development of smaller and more compact coils specifically designed for small animals would be beneficial for their improved spatial resolution and smaller electromagnetic interference as the maximum magnetic output of these coils is much smaller (at mT level; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Makowiecki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2016</xref>) than the 4T output tested in our development.</p><p>To validate our method, we successfully translated mspTMS to rodents and unveiled the evoked neuronal activities underlying this classical TMS stimulus which has been widely used in humans since its introduction in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker et al., 1985</xref>). At the behavioral level, mspTMS delivered in either ML or PA direction over left CFA evoked unilateral forelimb movement in the contralateral side. The similarity between the onset latency of mspTMS- and single-pulse ICMS-evoked MUAPs suggests the cortical origin of the TMS-evoked muscle activations. At the neuronal level, despite the similar evoked motor outputs, mspTMS delivered in the ML and PA orientation evoked different CFA layer V neuronal activities in the short-latency window (1–6 ms) after TMS onset. While threshold or suprathreshold ML oriented stimuli evoked virtually no response in this time window, PA oriented stimuli evoked population spiking activities that occurred preferably around 1–1.5 ms and at 3–3.5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Such discrepancy in neuronal response suggests that TMS-induced current of different orientations activates different microcircuits in the rodent forelimb M1: ML-oriented stimuli directly activated pyramidal cells of the descending motor pathways while PA-oriented stimuli evoked trans-synaptic high-frequency spiking activities in M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). It is important to note here that neuronal activity within 1 ms after TMS onset is not visible. Therefore, any antidromic spike evoked by direct axonal activations could not be recorded.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30552.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>mspTMS activates different neuronal circuits depending on stimulus orientation or the time-window of investigation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the short-latency time window (1–6 ms after onset), ML- and PA-oriented mspTMS evoked different patterns of neuronal activities in layer V of CFA (left panel).

We believe this is rather unlikely, as short-latency spikes evoked by ML stimulation were absent across multiple recording sites within CFA (0 out of 7 sites) while the significant high-frequency spiking pattern was observed readily within CFA under PA stimulation (3 out of 4 sites). Additionally, in PA trials, the observed high-frequency spiking disappeared when we turned the stimulus orientation to ML. While we cannot rule out the possibility that mspTMS evoked early spike responses in areas other than the ones we monitored, our data supports the notion that in the layer V of CFA — the output layer of the rodent forelimb M1 — selectivity in stimulus orientation exists. Another confounding factor that might explain the discrepancy is the intensity difference of induced electric fields in the brain under ML and PA stimulation. Since the rodent skull is not spherical, with a given coil output, induced electric field in the ML direction (along the short axis of the skull) should be lower in intensity than that in the PA direction (along the long axis of the skull), raising the possibility that the observed high-frequency spiking pattern under PA stimulation is a result of high intensity of the induced electric field. However, motor thresholds under ML stimulation, in which induced electric field intensity is lower, were significantly lower than their PA counterparts (median<sub>ML</sub> = 61% MSO; median<sub>PA</sub> = 74% MSO; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0.03). This is a strong indication that factors other than induced electric field intensity play a critical role in stimulus orientation selectivity. Therefore, we conclude that the observed response difference between ML and PA stimulation is unlikely to be caused solely by the difference in the intensity of induced electric fields.</p><p>TMS works on human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaneko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Lazzaro et al., 2001</xref>) and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amassian et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amassian and Stewart, 2003</xref>) also reported similar stimulus orientation selectivity but in the context of evoked motor outputs. However, we stress that the similarities between our results and those of humans and non-human primates rest solely at the level of a shared common principle: TMS-evoked direct activation is a product of the interaction between TMS-induced electric field and the anatomical and physiological properties of the neurons within. Despite different levels of complexity between primate and rodent brains, certain neuronal structures are preferably stimulated in one stimulus orientation rather than the others. But whether such similarity is based on shared anatomical and physiological properties warrants further investigation. Furthermore, the primate cortex is gyrencephalic while the rodent cortex is lissencephalic. As we could reliably stimulate a lissencephalic M1 and evoke muscle activation on the contralateral forelimb at the correct cortically evoked latency, the locus of direct TMS activation is most likely not dependent on the magnitude of induced electric field component normal to the cortical columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fox et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bungert et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The evoked short-latency response in the PA orientation was characterized by population spikes at a very high frequency similar to that of the I-waves recorded in the corticospinal tracts of humans and animals in response to a transient shock delivered to the M1 by either transcranial electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patton and Amassian, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kernell and Chien-Ping, 1967</xref>) or TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaneko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakamura et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Lazzaro et al., 2012</xref>). What are the principles of anatomical and functional organization in M1 that drive such high-frequency neuronal response? We recorded in layer V of the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) where two types of excitatory projection neurons exist: the corticospinal tract (PT) neurons that project to midbrain, brainstem, and spinal cord, and the intratelencephalic (IT) neurons that project ipsi- or bilaterally within the cortex and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). It has been shown recently that PT neurons exhibit reciprocal connectivity characterized by short-term facilitation and that synaptic transmission time for a pair of reciprocally connected PT neurons is 1.6 ± 0.5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morishima et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that the network formed by the interconnected PT neurons in layer V provides the physiological foundation for the high-frequency neuronal discharge and that a mspTMS pulse oriented in PA direction preferably delivers an input into this network that triggers the observed high-frequency spiking response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Furthermore, the interconnected PT network may also offer a neuronal explanation for the short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) described in the human literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tokimura et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ziemann et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>As we extend the window of investigation to 6–300 ms after TMS onset, a multiphasic response appears among the recorded CFA layer V neurons. The response is characterized by its excitation-inhibition-excitation pattern and is not qualitatively different between PA and ML stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). The strong excitation that peaks around 20 ms, given its latency, duration, presence in both layer V and II/III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), and its apparent lack of motor output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), reflects a high excitability state of the motor cortex. We hypothesize that this excitation is generated through the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Evidence suggests that cortex projects monosynaptically to basal ganglia (BG) structures such as striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kita and Kita, 2012</xref>), while the projection from striatum and STN back to cortex is polysynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shepherd, 2013</xref>). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN produces cortically evoked EEG potentials with a peak latency of 22.2 ± 1.2 ms, and TMS delivered at this latency after DBS showed facilitation of its cortically evoked motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuriakose et al., 2010</xref>). It is likely that TMS activates IT and PT neurons that project to BG monosynaptically, and the response is then transmitted back to the cortex as the intermediate excitation observed here. But other cortico-cortical or cortico-subcortical loops could be involved as well. The neuronal mechanism of TMS protocols such as intracortical facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ziemann et al., 1996</xref>) and theta burst stimulation (interpulse interval of 20 ms within each burst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suppa et al., 2016</xref>) remain unknown; however, it is conceivable that these protocols exploit this particular phase of excitation for their physiological effects. The long-lasting inhibition phase that follows the intermediate excitation is well-known, and evidence supports the notion that it is mediated by GABA<sub>B</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butovas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>) and underlies the long-interval intracortical inhibition as well as the cortical silent period in human TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valls-Solé et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonnell et al., 2006</xref>). However, the local or long-distance circuit mediating this phase of inhibition remains unknown. The rebound excitation phase, occurring after the inhibition, represents a period of excitation most likely resulting from the termination of GABA<sub>B</sub> inhibition, and corresponds to the late cortical disinhibition, which is being harnessed for augmenting plasticity induction in human TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the circuit mechanism behind this phase of rebound excitation remains to be elucidated as well.</p><p>Would the same neuronal activity pattern be observed if a rodent-sized TMS coil is used to stimulate the forelimb M1? We believe that this is the case since we carefully calibrated coil position and stimulation strength according to MEP. Furthermore, the long-lasting inhibition and the rebound excitation are well-documented phenomena in ICMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butovas and Schwarz, 2003</xref>), which is a much more localized stimulation method than TMS. Additionally, as discussed above, data from human TMS is largely congruent with the pattern of neuronal activity reported here. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the coil we used in this study directly activated structures outside of the forelimb M1. Nonetheless, the role of stimulus spatial resolution in modulating neuronal networks is a highly interesting topic for future research.</p><p>By combining the tool presented here with optogenetic, transgenic, anatomical, theoretical, and clinical methods, future work could take on two parallel directions concerning either the short- or long-latency evoked response of TMS. For the short-latency response, investigation could focus on discerning the circuit selectivity of different stimulus orientations by pinpointing the locus of direct activation in each case, and on elucidating the principles of anatomical and functional organization of the M1 microcircuitry. Additionally, utilizing TMS as a probe, other cortical areas can be investigated in a similar manner. For the long-latency response, the focus shall be on characterizing long-range circuits activated by TMS and examining their modulatory contributions in the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric conditions. We are convinced that studying the neuronal dynamics under TMS will undoubtedly advance our understanding of the functional organization of the brain, and drive the development of non-invasive brain stimulation therapies that are more specific, effective, durable and safe than hitherto possible.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Determination of the inadvertent charge injection</title><p>To determine the amount of TMS-induced charge injection in the electrode-electrode loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we used the voltage signal from the low-gain monitoring channel to calculate the current flow via the amplifier’s input capacitance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Stimulation intensity (normalized to %MT) was used as the fixed effect to model trials of normalized FR of each response phase. The animal’s identity was used as the random effect (random intercept) to control for intraclass correlation. We also explored the possibility of trial number being another fixed effect. However, it was dropped in the final models as it did not contribute significantly to model’s fit. Statistical significance of the fixed effect in each model was evaluated against the corresponding null model using the Kenward Roger-based F-test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halekoh and Højsgaard, 2014</xref>)</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by funding from the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research and the Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, University of Tübingen, Germany, and from the Max Planck Society, Germany.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Lifting the veil on the dynamics of neuronal activities evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Risto J. Ilmoniemi (Reviewer #2); Javier Marquez Ruiz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The authors present a novel method for TMS coupled with high fidelity extracellular single neuron recordings in anesthetized rats. This protocol's innovations include electrical TMS coil shielding, specialized amplifier circuitry, and specialized cabling. The presented results provide both a proof of principle for the method, and insight into immediate TMS-modulated single unit activity in the rat motor cortex.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Organization and Presentation:</p><p>a) Include, in the Introduction, a clear statement of the problematic system interactions, the manifestation of these interactions in the acquired EEP data and short statements about how each is to be ameliorated. This would include the interactions due to induction, electrical field (capacitive) coupling, vibration, and charge injection.</p><p>b) Presently the elucidation of the interactions between the TMS and EEP systems and their corrections come in three different places with increasing levels of detail: The Results, Materials and methods section and the Supplemental Section. Please pare this down to two places with much less appearing in the supplemental section.</p><p>c) Clarify how the described methods differ from other methods that address these interactions. For instance, consider the following statement: &quot;Two groups reported TMS-EEP methods for non-human primates (Mueller et al., 2014; Tischler et al., 2011); however, the applicability of these methods is very limited as they were developed solely for primate research, which is not best positioned to answer basic questions on neural circuitry, and they involve complex electronics and custom-designed TMS coils for artifact reduction.&quot; For this statement, please describe: (i) the methods that they used, (ii) the time window following the TMS pulse in which these methods are effective (0-1 ms as well?), (iii) how effective the methods are, and (iv) why the methods are not &quot;best positioned to answer basic questions on neural circuitry.&quot;</p><p>d) The manuscript content together with supplementary information has all the elements required for facilitating the proposed methodological improvements by interested researchers; nevertheless, much of this important information is categorized as &quot;supplementary,&quot; giving priority to the observed physiological response to TMS (somehow incomplete data, see comments below). Taken into account that this manuscript has been submitted to &quot;tools and resources&quot; category all the important technical details should be included in the body of the manuscript.</p><p>e) There are 5 &quot;figures&quot; in the main part and 10 in the supplement. However, in many figures, there are subfigures (A, B, C.…) and in some of the subfigures, there are multiple panels. The total number of labeled figures or subfigures is about 40. This may be too much. Even the main text contains 19 figures or subfigures. One reason for the large number of figures is that there is material in the manuscript for two manuscripts. For instance, while the abstract emphasizes the development of the engineering and measurement methodology, the discussion and much of the other text emphasize the neuroscientific results. Please consider condensing the text and figures to improve the paper's focus.</p><p>2) The section describing the second artifact source which begins at the third paragraph of the Results section lacks clarity. This section can be improved if the authors: (i) state that capacitive coupling between the TMS and EEP systems poses a significant problem which can be eliminated by appropriate shielding, (ii) state the properties which an effective shield must have to eliminate the coupling yet not interfere with the TMS B field, and (iii) propose the mechanism for the long time scale (compared to the TMS pulse length time) of the observed interaction.</p><p>3) The Results contain the following statement: &quot;…displacement current, if large enough, can stimulate neuronal structures through microelectrodes&quot; and if the amount of such current injection is large enough, it will excite the neural tissues around the microelectrodes and severely confound the measurement of TMS effects.&quot; Adjacent to these sentences please provide estimates of what is &quot;large enough&quot; That is, how large would the current magnitudes have to be to introduce these potential problems?</p><p>4) Since the text mentions the problems with using a human-size TMS coil for rodent experimentation, then please elaborate on the expected size of the interactions in rodent sized coils.</p><p>5) Would the rebound excitation phase exist if a rat-sized TMS coil were used to stimulate the motor cortex rather than the human-sized coil used in this work? Please elaborate. This is not so much a criticism as it is a direction for further research (perhaps to be mentioned in the Discussion).</p><p>6) Please comment on whether the magnitudes of the interactions significantly influenced by the pulse type (i.e. monophasic or biphasic TMS pulse?).</p><p>7) Please consider commenting on this in the revised Discussion: While ML-oriented TMS evoked virtually no early response, PA-oriented TMS evoked neuronal spikes around 1-1.5 ms and at 3-3.5 ms. This finding is interesting and indicates the importance of coil orientation. However, since only a limited population of neurons was monitored, this study did not demonstrate that ML-oriented TMS would not have elicited early spikes in some other population of neurons than those that were monitored.</p><p>8) In the Discussion section, the reason for different neuronal responses to ML and PA stimulation is discussed but an essential aspect is forgotten: since the rat skull is far from spherical, the induced electric field does not remain the same (adjustment of the TMS intensity to keep the E-field constant was not mentioned in the text) if the coil is rotated; in the latter case, the E-field is likely to be much stronger than in the former case (ML). This fact alone might explain the fact that ML stimulation did not give rise to much early activity (but see the previous paragraph). In any case, in addition to this reviewer's &quot;armchair thinking&quot;, please take another look at the ML and PA difference and explain the difference in E-field values (if any) in the ML and PA stimulations.</p><p>9) Please state the total number of recorded neurons in different animals and describe the methodology used for spike isolation and analysis. This is particularly relevant for TMS evoked response with stimulus orientation (where data are from only 4 animals).</p><p>10) Please respond to the following concern: The experiments related to different responses to TMS stimulus orientations is quite preliminary and it needs for additional data to be validated. Do the authors compare spike firing for both stimulus orientations maintaining the same isolated neurons? On the other hand, the authors claim that neurons were recorded at layer V of CFA. Do the authors test the putative nature (pyramidal, inhibitory interneurons…) of the recorded neurons? Could the orientation of the stimulus have a different impact on different neuronal populations located at layer V?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30552.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Organization and Presentation:</p><p>a) Include, in the Introduction, a clear statement of the problematic system interactions, the manifestation of these interactions in the acquired EEP data and short statements about how each is to be ameliorated.

For instance, consider the following statement: &quot;Two groups reported TMS-EEP methods for non-human primates (Mueller et al., 2014; Tischler et al., 2011); however, the applicability of these methods is very limited as they were developed solely for primate research, which is not best positioned to answer basic questions on neural circuitry, and they involve complex electronics and custom-designed TMS coils for artifact reduction.&quot; For this statement, please describe: (i) the methods that they used, (ii) the time window following the TMS pulse in which these methods are effective (0-1 ms as well?), (iii) how effective the methods are, and (iv) why the methods are not &quot;best positioned to answer basic questions on neural circuitry.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>To address these questions, in the Introduction section, we added the following statements:</p><p>“Recently, two groups reported TMS-EEP methods for non-human primate research. One of the methods utilized custom-built TMS coil and offline correction to minimize the TMS induced data loss to a median time of 2.5 ms (Tischler et al., 2011), while the other used a combination of custom-built coil, amplifier modifications, field sensing, active compensation, and offline correction to minimize the data loss to 1 ms (Mueller et al., 2014). Despite their success in artifact reduction, these methods face a major limitation that the technical expertise required for their implementations, especially custom-building TMS coils and field sensing, is not widely accessible to the neuroscience community. More importantly, these methods were developed solely for non-human primate research, which is used for investigating the neuronal underpinnings of high-level cognitive functions and therefore is not best suited for investigations concerning basic neurophysiology on the level of cells and detailed microcircuits.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The manuscript content together with supplementary information has all the elements required for facilitating the proposed methodological improvements by interested researchers; nevertheless, much of this important information is categorized as &quot;supplementary,&quot; giving priority to the observed physiological response to TMS (somehow incomplete data, see comments below). Taken into account that this manuscript has been submitted to &quot;tools and resources&quot; category all the important technical details should be included in the body of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential Revisions question 1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) There are 5 &quot;figures&quot; in the main part and 10 in the supplement. However, in many figures, there are subfigures (A, B, C.…) and in some of the subfigures, there are multiple panels. The total number of labeled figures or subfigures is about 40. This may be too much. Even the main text contains 19 figures or subfigures. One reason for the large number of figures is that there is material in the manuscript for two manuscripts. For instance, while the abstract emphasizes the development of the engineering and measurement methodology, the discussion and much of the other text emphasize the neuroscientific results. Please consider condensing the text and figures to improve the paper's focus.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential Revisions question 1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The section describing the second artifact source which begins at the third paragraph of the Results section lacks clarity. This section can be improved if the authors: (i) state that capacitive coupling between the TMS and EEP systems poses a significant problem which can be eliminated by appropriate shielding, (ii) state the properties which an effective shield must have to eliminate the coupling yet not interfere with the TMS B field, and (iii) propose the mechanism for the long time scale (compared to the TMS pulse length time) of the observed interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We restructured this section according to the comments above for improved clarity. Please see Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Results contain the following statement: &quot;…displacement current, if large enough, can stimulate neuronal structures through microelectrodes&quot; and &quot;if the amount of such current injection is large enough, it will excite the neural tissues around the microelectrodes and severely confound the measurement of TMS effects.&quot; Adjacent to these sentences please provide estimates of what is &quot;large enough&quot; That is, how large would the current magnitudes have to be to introduce these potential problems?</p></disp-quote><p>It is the magnitude and the temporal pattern of such injected current that determine if the current injection is large enough to excite neuronal tissues and confound EEP measurements. To clarify this, we added the following statements:</p><p>“If the amount and the temporal structure of the injected current are comparable to the threshold parameters reported in intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) literature (bipolar charge transfer totaling from 150 to 800 pC, current waveform approximately similar to that of TMS; see Asanuma and Rosén, 1973, Butovas and Schwarz, 2003), such current will excite neuronal elements around the microelectrode tips and therefore severely confound the measurement of TMS effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since the text mentions the problems with using a human-size TMS coil for rodent experimentation, then please elaborate on the expected size of the interactions in rodent sized coils.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, in the Discussion section, we added the following statements:</p><p>“Nonetheless, the development of smaller and more compact coils specifically designed for small animals would be beneficial for their improved spatial resolution and smaller electromagnetic interference as the maximum magnetic output of these coils is much smaller (at mT level; Makowiecki et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2016) than the 4T output tested in our development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Would the rebound excitation phase exist if a rat-sized TMS coil were used to stimulate the motor cortex rather than the human-sized coil used in this work? Please elaborate. This is not so much a criticism as it is a direction for further research (perhaps to be mentioned in the Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we added the following paragraph in the manuscript:</p><p>“Would the same neuronal activity pattern be observed if a rodent-sized TMS coil is used to stimulate the forelimb M1? We believe this is the case since we carefully calibrated coil position and stimulation strength according to MEP. Furthermore, the long-lasting inhibition and the rebound excitation are well-documented phenomena in ICMS (Butovas and Schwarz, 2003), which is a much more localized stimulation method than TMS. Additionally, as discussed above, data from human TMS is largely congruent with the pattern of neuronal activity reported here. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the coil we used in this study directly activated structures outside of the forelimb M1. Nonetheless, the role of stimulus spatial resolution in modulating neural networks is a highly interesting topic for future research.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please comment on whether the magnitudes of the interactions significantly influenced by the pulse type (i.e. monophasic or biphasic TMS pulse?).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we added the following paragraph in the manuscript:</p><p>“The amount of magnetic, electric, and vibrational interference TMS imposed on EEP depends on multiple factors. Some of the most critical factors include the waveform and magnitude of the pulsed magnetic and electric field emitted from a TMS coil, the size of circuit loops formed by an EEP recording assembly, and the coil position relative to these loops. Changes in these parameters will result in changes in the severity of different types of interference. For example, keeping the coil the same, by replacing a standard monophasic with a standard biphasic stimulator, coil-emitted fields will generate a longer period of magnetic and electric field interference due to the longer pulse waveform. However, the severity of interference might be lower if the coil and biphasic stimulator combination does not produce magnetic and electric outputs that are as high as those in the monophasic case. Similarly, miniaturization of TMS coils for small animals can also lead to a reduction in interference because of the reduced electromagnetic output of such devices. Furthermore, the integration of recording, reference, and ground electrode in one microfabricated electrode array can also reduce the severity of interference as such configuration significantly decreases the area of circuit loops exposed to TMS.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please consider commenting on this in the revised Discussion: While ML-oriented TMS evoked virtually no early response, PA-oriented TMS evoked neuronal spikes around 1-1.5 ms and at 3-3.5 ms. This finding is interesting and indicates the importance of coil orientation. However, since only a limited population of neurons was monitored, this study did not demonstrate that ML-oriented TMS would not have elicited early spikes in some other population of neurons than those that were monitored.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we added the following statements in the manuscript:</p><p>“It might be argued that the observed discrepancy in short-latency response is a result of bias in neuronal sampling. We believe this is rather unlikely, as short-latency spikes evoked by ML stimulation were absent across multiple recording sites within CFA (0 out of 7 sites) while the significant high-frequency spiking pattern was observed readily within CFA under PA stimulation (3 out of 4 sites). Additionally, in PA trials, the observed high-frequency spiking disappeared when we turned the stimulus orientation to ML. While we cannot rule out the possibility that mspTMS evoked early spike responses in areas other than the ones we monitored, our data supports the notion that in the layer V of CFA — the output layer of the rodent forelimb M1 — selectivity in stimulus orientation exists.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the Discussion section, the reason for different neuronal responses to ML and PA stimulation is discussed but an essential aspect is forgotten: since the rat skull is far from spherical, the induced electric field does not remain the same (adjustment of the TMS intensity to keep the E-field constant was not mentioned in the text) if the coil is rotated; in the latter case, the E-field is likely to be much stronger than in the former case (ML). This fact alone might explain the fact that ML stimulation did not give rise to much early activity (but see the previous paragraph). In any case, in addition to this reviewer's &quot;armchair thinking&quot;, please take another look at the ML and PA difference and explain the difference in E-field values (if any) in the ML and PA stimulations.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this possible confounding issue, we added the following statements in the manuscript:</p><p>“Another confounding factor that might explain the discrepancy is the intensity difference of induced electric fields in the brain under ML and PA stimulation. Since the rodent skull is not spherical, with a given coil output, induced electric field in the ML direction (along the short axis of the skull) should be lower in intensity than that in the PA direction (along the long axis of the skull), raising the possibility that the observed high-frequency spiking pattern under PA stimulation is a result of high intensity of the induced electric field. However, motor thresholds under ML stimulation, in which induced electric field intensity is lower, were significantly lower than their PA counterparts (median<sub>ML</sub>= 61% MSO; median<sub>PA</sub>= 74% MSO; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0.03). This is a strong indication that factors other than induced electric field intensity play a critical role in stimulus orientation selectivity. Therefore, we conclude that the observed response difference between ML and PA stimulation is unlikely to be caused solely by the difference in the intensity of induced electric fields.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please state the total number of recorded neurons in different animals and describe the methodology used for spike isolation and analysis. This is particularly relevant for TMS evoked response with stimulus orientation (where data are from only 4 animals).</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the issue raised in this comment, in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript, we added the following statements:</p><p>“Spike isolation was performed using principal component analysis of the spike waveforms followed by a Gaussian mixture model with Kalman filters that track waveform drifts over time (Ecker et al., 2014). A total of 51 single units were isolated (L5<sub>ML</sub> = 19; L5<sub>PA</sub> = 14; L2/3<sub>ML</sub>=18); however, since at the present stage we are only interested in characterizing the response of M1 neuronal population to mspTMS, in the following analysis, we combine spikes from all single units as well as those that cannot be reliably isolated into a multiunit cluster.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Please respond to the following concern: The experiments related to different responses to TMS stimulus orientations is quite preliminary and it needs for additional data to be validated. Do the authors compare spike firing for both stimulus orientations maintaining the same isolated neurons? On the other hand, the authors claim that neurons were recorded at layer V of CFA. Do the authors test the putative nature (pyramidal, inhibitory interneurons…) of the recorded neurons? Could the orientation of the stimulus have a different impact on different neuronal populations located at layer V?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we did not test if the same neuron was held under different coil orientations. This can be difficult given that CFA L5 neurons remained largely unresponsive under ML stimulation. However, through a combination of ICMS and histology, we did confirm the recording locations were indeed in the L5 of CFA. Regarding the putative nature of the recorded neurons, we did not perform classification to explore this since it is beyond the scope of the present study, which is focused on method development and the first characterization of the response from L5 neuronal population in the forelimb M1 to mspTMS that evoked focal forelimb activations. Nonetheless, we do agree with the reviewers that it is plausible that stimulus orientation has a differential impact on different neuronal populations, and we believe this issue should be investigated further in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
