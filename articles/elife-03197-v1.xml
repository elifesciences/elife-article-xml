structures such as the eukaryotic spindle. No similar structure has been identified in prokaryotes. The bacteriophage-encoded tubulin PhuZ is required to position DNA at mid-cell, without which infectivity is compromised. Here, we show that PhuZ filaments, like microtubules, stochastically switch from growing in a distinctly polar manner to catastrophic depolymerization (dynamic instability) both in vitro and in vivo. One end of each PhuZ filament is stably anchored near the cell pole to form a spindle-like array that orients the growing ends toward the phage nucleoid so as to position it near mid-cell. Our results demonstrate how a bacteriophage can harness the properties of a tubulin-like cytoskeleton for efficient propagation. This represents the first identification of a prokaryotic tubulin with the dynamic instability of microtubules and the ability to form a simplified bipolar spindle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03197.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03197.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03197.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a cell or virus to reproduce, it must duplicate its genome and separate the two copies. In plants and animals, this DNA is stored in the nucleus of each cell in the form of chromosomes, and a complex protein structure called the spindle apparatus is responsible for physically aligning and then separating the duplicated chromosomes.</p><p>The spindle apparatus is mainly built from a group of proteins called tubulin, which join together end-to-end to form fibers called microtubules. Proteins that interact with the fibers link them to the chromosomes or to one of the two ‘poles’ that sit on opposite sides of the cell. Tubulin proteins are then rapidly added to, or removed from, the other end of the microtubule, lengthening or shortening the structure. The rapid switch between fiber growth and shortening is known as dynamic instability. As these fibers shrink, they pull the pair of chromosomes apart and towards opposite sides of the cell.</p><p>Viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages for short) replicate their DNA by invading a bacterial cell and hijacking its DNA-replication machinery. In contrast to animals and plants, bacterial cells do not have a cell nucleus, and most bacteria and many phages have genomes comprised of circular DNA rings. Bacteria and phages do share the need to correctly position their DNA in the bacterial cell; but neither bacteria nor phages are known to possess an equivalent to the spindle apparatus that could perform this positioning. A group of bacteriophages were recently found to contain a type of tubulin called PhuZ; however, it was not known if this protein could form a spindle-like apparatus in bacterial cells.</p><p>Erb, Kraemer et al. now reveal that PhuZ filaments grow and shorten in similar ways to the microtubules in animal and plant cells: PhuZ proteins are rapidly added to or subtracted from just one end of the fiber. Erb, Kraemer et al. believe this is the first time dynamic instability has been confirmed in a tubulin from a cell without a nucleus.</p><p>Erb, Kraemer et al. infected bacteria with bacteriophages that use PhuZ and observed that long fibers of PhuZ form and arrange into a structure that resembles a simple form of the spindle apparatus. These structures only form if a virus has invaded a cell. During the early stages of infection, viral DNA localizes to the cell poles but rearranges at around the same time that PhuZ fibers form. At this point, the viral DNA moves towards the middle of the bacterial cell with fibers on either side of the DNA, suggesting that the fibers play a role in moving the DNA. While the fast growing ends of the fibers were shown to be highly dynamic, the other ends were stably anchored at the cell poles.</p><p>Erb, Kraemer et al. propose that this bacteriophage system may be an evolutionary ancestor of the spindle apparatus, although more work is required to confirm this.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03197.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03197.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>dynamic instability</kwd><kwd>spindle</kwd><kwd>pseudomonas</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM073898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pogliano</surname><given-names>Joe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM031627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pogliano</surname><given-names>Joe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A bacteriophage tubulin homolog, PhuZ, forms a structure with the biochemical, structural, and functional properties of a simplified, bipolar spindle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tubulins are universally conserved GTPases that polymerize in a head to tail fashion to form filaments. They have evolved properties that allow them to assemble into a wide variety of structures with various functions and dynamics. In eukaryotes, α/β-tubulin forms large, dynamically unstable microtubules (MTs), composed of 13 protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Downing and Nogales, 1998</xref>). MTs are the essential component of many cell biological processes; one of the most familiar and well studied is the mitotic spindle required for the faithful segregation of sister chromatids in all eukaryotic cells.</p><p>MTs have a distinct growth polarity in which growing (plus) ends elongate substantially faster than minus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Borisy, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Downing and Nogales, 1998</xref>). They are often anchored by their minus ends at specific locations in the cell known as microtubule organizing centers to facilitate mitosis, directional transport, and motility. This anchoring significantly stabilizes the MTs and lends a consistent organization to these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2a">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984b</xref>). The polarity of the filament becomes key in its ability to specifically interact with binding partners, such as the kinetochore, and for the regulation of the filaments by microtubule accessory proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euteneuer and McIntosh, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitamura et al., 2010</xref>). These two features allow for the rapid and effective search and capture of the sister chromatids by the MTs via dynamic instability.</p><p>Dynamic instability is defined as the stochastic switching between states of polymerization and rapid depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984a</xref>). The biomechanical source of this dynamic instability is the differential between the addition of new monomers into the MT lattice and the hydrolysis of the GTP bound to the beta subunit of the heterodimer. While GTP bound to the subunits in the middle of the lattice has been hydrolyzed to GDP, the tip of the growing MT is crowned by a cap of GTP-bound heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984a</xref>). The loss of this GTP cap facilitates a conformational change in the filaments, subsequent depolymerization and, possibly, catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Downing and Nogales, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Until now, these properties of tubulins have appeared to be unique hallmarks of eukaryotes. Some plasmid encoded bacterial actins, such as ParM and Alp7A, display dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derman et al., 2009</xref>); however, unlike MTs, ParM filaments elongate bidirectionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garner et al., 2004</xref>) and assemble only transiently during the relatively brief process of pushing plasmid DNA molecules apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Mullins, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, they are not spatially organized and assemble at random positions in the cell. Several families of bacterial tubulins have been identified that participate in cell division, DNA segregation, and viral DNA positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meier and Goley, 2014</xref>). While TubZ has been shown to treadmill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>), for most other prokaryotic tubulins, the type of motion the filament undergoes in vivo remains unclear. None of the bacterial tubulins have been shown to exhibit dynamic instability or other critical properties of a microtubule-based spindle.</p><p>We recently identified a family of bacteriophage tubulins, PhuZ, that play a role in spatially organizing DNA during lytic growth and thereby contribute to efficient phage production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kraemer et al., 2012</xref>). PhuZ from <italic>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</italic> phage 201ϕ2-1 contains a tubulin fold and an extended C-terminus that forms extensive longitudinal and lateral contacts required to stabilize a unique triple stranded filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kraemer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zehr et al., 2014</xref>). Catalytically defective PhuZ mutants lacking GTPase activity generate stable filaments and disrupt correct positioning of clusters of DNA during lytic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kraemer et al., 2012</xref>). While this suggested the importance of filament dynamics, it has remained unclear how PhuZ polymers might facilitate this organization.</p><p>Here we present the first example of a prokaryotic tubulin that undergoes dynamic instability both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the PhuZ cytoskeleton has many of the properties of eukaryotic MTs, including polarity, a GTP cap, and anchoring. These shared properties extend to the ability of both PhuZ and MTs to build a bipolar spindle for the movement of DNA. We further characterize replication of this bacteriophage, demonstrating that the infection nucleoid contains only replicating phage DNA and that nucleoid centering is independent of replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PhuZ filaments are highly dynamic in vitro</title><p>To gain insight into the mechanism of phage centering by PhuZ, we investigated the properties of PhuZ filaments assembled in vitro and in vivo. First, we used total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy to visualize dynamics of purified PhuZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the presence of GTP and a crowding agent to minimize filament diffusion, 2.5 µM PhuZ (20% Cy3-labeled, 80% unlabeled) that was otherwise unattached to PEG-coated coverslips, formed short dynamic filaments that translocated across the coverslip (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Many of these filaments displayed non-uniform intensity, and annealing and severing events were also observed (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), implying that many of these structures consist of at least two PhuZ filaments. The apparent motion could be the result of either diffusion near the surface or treadmilling, that is, growth at one end and depolymerization at the other. This ambiguity could be resolved by using the naturally occurring intensity variations along each filament to allow growth and shrinkage rates at each end to be quantified (n = 40) independent of any overall filament motion. This revealed that the filaments treadmill in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with new filament growth at one end and depolymerization at the other. Depolymerization from these minus-ends occurred at a rate of 15 ± 5 µm/min (n = 40). The large amount of heterogeneity could be due to the presence of bundles and some events being catastrophic depolymerization events from a plus-end. Thus, like MTs and actin, PhuZ filaments must be polar, with one end growing faster than the other. In a manner reminiscent of MT catastrophe, filaments were also observed to occasionally fully depolymerize (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03197.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TIRF microscopy reveals polarity and dynamic instability in PhuZ filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cy3 labeled PhuZ filaments exhibit treadmilling in the presence of GTP.

To make stable seeds, 2 µM PhuZ (20% Cy5, 5% biotin, 75% unlabeled) was polymerized with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPCPP for 5 min and attached to PEG-biotin-coated coverslips via streptavidin. After 2 min, the flow chamber was subsequently washed with TIRF buffer (See ‘Materials and methods’) to remove unattached filaments, free monomers, and GMPCPP. Cy3-labelled PhuZ (20% Cy3, 80% unlabeled) and GTP were then added to the chamber to initiate dynamic filament formation, and dynamics were monitored at 0.25-s intervals for 100 s (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). To ensure that Cy3-PhuZ filaments would only grow from the preformed Cy5-PhuZ seeds, Cy3-PhuZ was added to the flow chamber at a concentration (1.5 µM) below the critical concentration (2.5 µM). The movies indicate that PhuZ filaments possess a distinct kinetic polarity, with growth only seen from one end, highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This is similar to, but more asymmetric than MTs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergen and Borisy, 1980</xref>). The Cy3-PhuZ filaments elongated at a rate of 1.9 ± 0.1 µm/min at 1.5 µM, (n = 40). This rate, when normalized for concentration, is equivalent to the growth rate of ParM filaments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garner et al., 2004</xref>), and about 6-fold faster than growing MTs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hyman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bode et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). After a random period of time, growing PhuZ filaments were observed to switch to rapid disassembly (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and completely depolymerize. The remaining stabilized GMPCPP Cy5-PhuZ seed could then nucleate another round of polymerization. As shown in the kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), filament depolymerization always (n = 40) went to completion and proceeded at an average rate of 108 ± 20 µm/min. This rate of catastrophic depolymerization is comparable to rates observed for yeast tubulin (103 µm/min)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bode et al., 2003</xref>), but is an order of magnitude faster than that of either mammalian tubulin or ParM (13, 9.4 µm/min, respectively)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hyman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garner et al., 2004</xref>).

Due to the rapid GTP hydrolysis within the lattice, only the most recently added monomers at the plus-end of the filament contain GTP. Thus, the observed rapid depolymerization after adding GDP implies the existence of a stabilizing GTP-cap that is lost upon GDP addition. The stability observed with D190A-PhuZ demonstrates that the nucleotide state of the penultimate PhuZs must be determining filament stability and not the state of the exchangeable most plus-end monomer. These observations help explain the catastrophic depolymerizations observed in our movies as the result of stochastic loss of the cap due to nucleotide hydrolysis in one or more plus end monomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PhuZ filaments display dynamic instability and are distributed throughout the cell in the absence of phage</title><p>To determine if PhuZ displays the microtubule-like properties in vivo that were observed in vitro (unidirectional growth, dynamic instability), we visualized GFP-PhuZ filaments in <italic>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</italic> cells using rapid time-lapse microscopy.

It has been argued that the spatiotemporal organization of the cytoskeleton by organizing centers may be a defining characteristic of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Theriot, 2013</xref>). However, the prokaryotic cell also utilizes cytoskeletal proteins to organize internal space and efficiently execute essential life processes.

Furthermore, it assembles into a bipolar spindle that more than superficially resembles its eukaryotic counterpart. The PhuZ spindle appears to play a key role in organizing viral reproduction by positioning the phage nucleoid at midcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Since polar localization is phage infection-dependent, we hypothesize that a phage protein (depicted as purple triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) is necessary for the organization of the spindle. Based on our long time lapse movies of complete infection cycles, a transition must occur between early un-localized pre-existing filaments to the localized polar structures seen in late infection, suggesting a clear role for anchoring. Whether the putative phage polar protein also acts to nucleate de novo filament formation or facilitate bundling is unclear. We propose that early during infection, the dynamically unstable ends of PhuZ polymers (plus ends, by analogy with tubulin) specifically interact with and move the replicating phage DNA, presumably by applying pushing forces, although this movement is independent of replication.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03197.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of PhuZ bipolar spindle formation during lytic growth.</title><p>PhuZ is expressed early in lytic growth and forms dynamically unstable polymers anchored at the cell poles.

To date, prokaryotic tubulins have either been demonstrated to treadmill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>) (TubZ) or the relevant filament movement remains an unresolved matter (FtsZ). This apparent switch in the type of functional movement displayed by prokaryotic tubulins versus eukaryotic ones had posed an intriguing question—why don't bacterial tubulins undergo dynamic instability? We now know that some of them do and this particular type of biomechanics may inherently lend itself to the formation of complex structures for the search and capture of large masses of DNA.</p><p>PhuZ appears to be unique from other prokaryotic systems implicated in DNA positioning in prokaryotes. The tubulin based plasmid segregation system TubZ has not been shown to display dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Erickson, 2008</xref>). TubZ assembles two and four-stranded polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montabana and Agard, 2014</xref>) in contrast to the dynamically unstable triple stranded filaments of PhuZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zehr et al., 2014</xref>). Several actin based plasmid segregation systems display dynamic instability in vitro and in vivo, but unlike PhuZ, these proteins only transiently assemble spindles that rapidly push copies of their plasmids to the cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moller-Jensen et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Mullins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sengupta et al., 2010</xref>). Proteins belonging to the highly conserved ParA ATPase family segregate plasmids, chromosomes, and protein complexes in a variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerdes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schumacher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiekebusch and Thanbichler, 2014</xref>). ParA proteins have been proposed to form ATP dependent concentration gradients or other intracellular structures as they carry out these diverse functions, but none of them form dynamically unstable polymers similar to PhuZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>). Clearly, bacteria and their mobile genetic elements have evolved an enormous number of nucleotide hydrolyzing, self-assembling, DNA positioning machines. This raises the question as to whether any eukaryotic cells have inherited one of these many ancient DNA positioning mechanisms.</p><p>All eukaryotic cells are thought to utilize a mitotic spindle to ensure accurate inheritance of sister chromatids to the daughter cells, but it has long been a mystery how such a complicated structure might have evolved. The first function of the eukaryotic spindle is to line up replicated chromatids at the midline of the dividing cell. Our discovery of a bacteriophage that assembles a similar structure raises the possibility that bipolar spindles arose more than once by convergent evolution taking advantage of the unique properties of tubulin polymers. Alternatively, it is also possible that phage hijacked the mitotic spindle from an ancient eukaryotic cell. However, since bacteria and phage are thought to predate eukaryotic life, an intriguing possibility is that the mitotic spindle first evolved in a bacteriophage for the purpose of positioning viral DNA during lytic growth and was later co-opted for positioning chromosomal DNA in the progenitor of the first eukaryotic cell. One can imagine that a primordial tubulin evolved to form filaments of increasing biochemical, structural, and functional complexity, beginning with single stranded protofilaments (FtsZ) required for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erickson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meier and Goley, 2014</xref>). These then evolved into multi-stranded filaments capable of segregating plasmid DNA (TubZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Erickson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aylett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montabana and Agard, 2014</xref>) and centering viral DNA (PhuZ). The increased structural and biochemical complexity, including an increase in the number of protofilaments, would allow the lattice to become more cooperative and provide a greater difference between growth and nucleation rates. This in turn would allow the lattice to become more metastable, thereby storing the greater energy necessary for more complex functions within the lattice.</p><p>Bacterial tubulin homologs have proven as essential to prokaryotic cell biology as to eukaryotes, and as such, it is not totally unexpected that the advantages conferred upon a cell or virus by the ability to build complex tubulin based structures would also be selected for and shared across kingdoms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and Purification</title><p>Wild-type and KCK-PhuZ were expressed and purified as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kraemer et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>As you will see from the appended reviewers' comments, there was a high level of interest in your study describing how a bacteriophage tubulin creates spindle-like structures in bacteria to position phage DNA. However, the reviewers felt that key data fell short of supporting your model and thus revisions are required before the manuscript is suitable for publication. Specifically, conclusions regarding dynamic instability and organization of filaments in spindle-like structures of infected cells made on the basis filament tracking data require substantiation. Reviewer 2 makes specific suggestions of alternative image analysis strategies that could address these concerns. Both reviewers also made other excellent suggestions that will improve the quality/clarity of the manuscript that should be considered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This interesting paper from Erb, Kraemer et al reports the dynamic properties of a tubulin isotype, PhuZ, encoded by the genome of a bacteriophage that infects Pseudomonas chlororaphis bacteria. The authors report that filaments of PhuZ, like eukaryotic MTs, display dynamic instability <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that within the bacterial cell during lytic infection, they assemble into a spindle-like structure capable of using free energy released by PhuZ polymerization to generate polar-ejection forces that push the replicating phage DNA to the center of the bacterial cell. I think this is a well-written, succinct, scientifically sound and interesting study. My only minor concern is the extent to which it advances what was published in their Cell paper, but on balance I think it does represent a sufficiently significant advance, and accordingly I recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I have only minor suggestions for the authors to consider:</p><p>1) It would be useful to present a small summary table comparing the four parameters of dynamic instability (i.e. growth rate, shrinkage rate, catastrophe frequency and rescue frequency) displayed by the phage tubulin compared to eukaryotic tubulins.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows a drawing that depicts some type of PhuZ organizing center that anchors the minus ends at the poles of the cell. What is the evidence for this, and are there any molecular candidates for this function (in the Shapiro lab model for the ParA spindle, TipN fulfills this function)?</p><p>3) I think the discussion would be more interesting if the authors noted that other workers have also proposed the existence of spindle-like structures that are responsible for prokaryotic DNA segregation, e.g. by using actin-like filament depolymerase motors to mediate plasmid segregation e.g. Ptacin et al, 2010, Nat Cell Biol. 12:791. Moreover, other workers have proposed that bacterial cytoskeleton-mediated plasmid segregation may utilize a chemical gradient mechanisms rather than polymer ratchet mechanisms e.g. Vecchiarelli et al, 2014, PNAS, 111:4880.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper reports analysis of polymerization dynamics of a tubulin-like protein from a bacteriophage using TIRF microscopy of pure protein and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging. The conclusions of the paper are overall exciting, in that the authors report dynamic instability of individual filaments, and a structure resembling a bipolar mitotic spindle in infected cells. Dynamic instability of a bacterial polymer is not new, but the spindle-like organization is, and it’s very interesting. Thus, the paper may be suited for <italic>eLife</italic>. That said, the paper tries to cover a lot of ground, and the most important conclusions are not sufficiently supported by the data provided. In particular, important claims made on the basis of single filament tracking in living cells seem to be serious over-interpretations because the images provided do not convincingly demonstrate that single filament tracking is possible in living cell. The large degree of over-interpretation of the <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging data that support the most interesting aspects of the paper's conclusion make the current paper unsuited for publication.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The most interesting aspect of the paper is the claim of spindle-like organization in infected cells, and dynamic instability of polarized filaments selectively at the center of the cell. This part of the paper is not adequately supported by the data provided. The individual filament traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 G, H</xref> are unconvincing, with lots of datapoints consisting of a single point that goes up or down compared to a trendline. This could be noise. The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, J</xref> and visual inspection of the movies provided suggests tracking of individual filament ends may not be possible using the current microscopy methods. The tracking data and movies appear broadly consistent with the hypothesis provided by the authors, but given the difficulty of convincing single filament tracking, these data have been seriously over-interpreted in the text.</p><p>Another strong statement in the text that is not adequately supported by the data is that the filaments are arranged in a bipolar manner, with all fluctuating ends oriented towards the center of the cell. Again, the movies are visually consistent with such an interpretation, but they fall well short of proving it, as implied in the text. Filaments in infected cells appear tightly bundled near the poles, which would make is difficult to detect fluctuations in length of individual filaments there. The imaging in the center of the cell is too imprecise to convincingly detect non-fluctuating ends, or even convincingly track fluctuating ends. The authors’ model or polarized organization is attractive, but they seriously over-interpret the data in trying to support it.</p><p>2) The pure filament studies convincingly demonstrate both highly polarized net assembly, leading to treadmilling of uncapped filaments, and dynamic instability of free ends of the kind that prefer to grow; let's call them plus ends. This is very nice data. However, in interpreting the <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, the authors seem to ignore the possibility of minus ends shrinking. In uninfected cells, shouldn't we see some minus end shrinkage? In infected cells, their cartoon model puts in some kind of nucleating site/cap at poles that orients filaments and caps minus ends. But there is no strong support for this nucleating site from the <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging data. The text states that filaments are randomly oriented in uninfected cells, and bipolar in infected, but this large difference in organization is not well supported by the data provided.</p><p>Points 1) and 2) could perhaps be addressed by some kind of quantitative image analysis that focused less on single filament tracking, which is frankly unconvincing, and more on other kinds of fluctuation analysis. For example, a spatial map of temporal variance might demonstrate in a convincing manner that fluctuations are located at random positions in uninfected cells, and concentrated at the center in infected cells. Difference imaging; subtracting frame n- from frame n- might also be beneficial in analyzing where in the cell polymerization dynamics occur. Difference imaging sometimes allows detection of fluctuations even in densely packed regions like the poles. A spatial map of average signal in difference images, which is related to an analysis of temporal variance, could be useful to map the positions in a cell where length change is occurring. More critical interpretation of imaging data is also essential. The authors must distinguish much more precisely between experimental observation and model. It's fine to propose a model that is not completely proven, but is consistent with the data.

Moreover, other workers have proposed that bacterial cytoskeleton-mediated plasmid segregation may utilize a chemical gradient mechanisms rather than polymer ratchet mechanisms e.g. Vecchiarelli et al, 2014, PNAS, 111:4880</italic>.</p><p>A paragraph discussing these points has been added to the Discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This paper reports analysis of polymerization dynamics of a tubulin-like protein from a bacteriophage using TIRF microscopy of pure protein and in vivo imaging. The conclusions of the paper are overall exciting, in that the authors report dynamic instability of individual filaments, and a structure resembling a bipolar mitotic spindle in infected cells. Dynamic instability of a bacterial polymer is not new, but the spindle-like organization is, and it’s very interesting. Thus, the paper may be suited for eLife. That said, the paper tries to cover a lot of ground, and the most important conclusions are not sufficiently supported by the data provided. In particular, important claims made on the basis of single filament tracking in living cells seem to be serious over-interpretations because the images provided do not convincingly demonstrate that single filament tracking is possible in living cell. The large degree of over-interpretation of the in vivo imaging data that support the most interesting aspects of the paper's conclusion make the current paper unsuited for publication</italic>.</p><p>As per Reviewer #2’s request, we have renamed the figures and reworded the conclusions so that it is clear when we are proposing a model to explain the results as well as to acknowledge a wider range of possible interpretations of our data.</p><p><italic>Specific points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The most interesting aspect of the paper is the claim of spindle-like organization in infected cells, and dynamic instability of polarized filaments selectively at the center of the cell. This part of the paper is not adequately supported by the data provided. The individual filament traces in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>G, H are unconvincing, with lots of datapoints consisting of a single point that goes up or down compared to a trendline. This could be noise. The images in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A, J</italic></xref> <italic>and visual inspection of the movies provided suggests tracking of individual filament ends may not be possible using the current microscopy methods. The tracking data and movies appear broadly consistent with the hypothesis provided by the authors, but given the difficulty of convincing single filament tracking, these data have been seriously over-interpreted in the text</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the dynamic properties of the filaments were not clearly presented in the original Figures and we thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the Figures to more clearly show filament dynamics and we have included a mutant, GFPPhuZD190A, that is defective in GTP hydrolysis as a control for noise.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> now clearly shows an example of a filament undergoing growth and shrinkage in uninfected cells. A second example showing dynamic instability of filaments within uninfected cells is shown in the kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p>The time-lapse sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Movie 5</xref> have been modified so that the ends of individual filaments can be clearly tracked over time. By following the arrows that mark the filament ends near the center of the cell, growth and shrinkage can be clearly observed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B, C, and D</xref> show measured filament length changes over time normalized to their starting position and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows the average amount of absolute filament length change that occurs per unit time (0.5 s). Wild type GFP-PhuZ filaments exhibit significant and rapid changes in length over time while a mutant filament that is incapable of depolymerizing displays very little change in length over time, demonstrating that the changes in length observed for wild type are not due to noise but are GTP-dependent changes in filament length. It’s also worth noting that many of the changes in length in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 5C</xref> are large enough (&gt;0.5 μm) to be beyond the noise of most high-resolution optical systems.</p><p><italic>Another strong statement in the text that is not adequately supported by the data is that the filaments are arranged in a bipolar manner, with all fluctuating ends oriented towards the center of the cell. Again, the movies are visually consistent with such an interpretation, but they fall well short of proving it, as implied in the text. Filaments in infected cells appear tightly bundled near the poles, which would make is difficult to detect fluctuations in length of individual filaments there. The imaging in the center of the cell is too imprecise to convincingly detect non-fluctuating ends, or even convincingly track fluctuating ends</italic>.</p><p>As this reviewer has correctly noted, the ends of the filaments near the cell middle frequently appear less intense than near the vertex, suggesting that they represent either individual filaments or at least smaller bundles of filaments relative to the rest of the spindle. Despite the lower intensity of these filaments, we can accurately track their ends as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Movie 5</xref>. Analysis of centrally located filament ends show that they are dynamic, and fluctuate back and forth as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Movie 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and in the kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the centrally located filament ends can be observed to grow and shrink over time, while the ends of the filaments nearest the pole remain relatively stationary. For comparison, the kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> of GFP-D190APhuZ shows that mutant filaments do not change in length over time. Taken together with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, the simplest model suggests that the filament ends located toward the middle require GTP to grow and shrink. In the text we have softened our conclusion and point out that this is one possible interpretation of the data and that we cannot rule out the possibility that filament or bundle growth are occurring at the vertex of the spindle.</p><p>The authors’ model or polarized organization is attractive, but they seriously over-interpret the data in trying to support it.</p><p>We have softened the interpretation to indicate that one model consistent with the data is that there is a dramatic change in filament organization upon phage infection.</p><p><italic>2) The pure filament studies convincingly demonstrate both highly polarized net assembly, leading to treadmilling of uncapped filaments, and dynamic instability of free ends of the kind that prefer to grow; let's call them plus ends. This is very nice data. However, in interpreting the in vivo imaging, the authors seem to ignore the possibility of minus ends shrinking</italic>.</p><p>This is a very good point. Filaments within uninfected cells are short, dynamic and tend to depolymerize before reaching more than 1 micron in length. As now shown in the time-lapse sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and in the kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, filaments elongate and depolymerize and we have no way to accurately distinguish plus from minus ends. We assume, of course, that there is some depolymerization from the minus ends, but since we do not know which end is which, we have refrained from speculating directly on this point. Our conclusions from the <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging data of uninfected cells are that filaments display dynamic instability and generally recapitulate the behavior of filaments assembled <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p><italic>In uninfected cells, shouldn't we see some minus end shrinkage? In infected cells, their cartoon model puts in some kind of nucleating site/cap at poles that orients filaments and caps minus ends. But there is no strong support for this nucleating site from the in vivo imaging data</italic>.</p><p>In the model figure we hypothesize the existence of a polar anchoring protein encoded on the phage genome due to the observation that only phage-infected cells show polar stabilization of filaments and the structural similarities to a bipolar spindle. Uninfected cells expressing GFP-PhuZ alone never exhibit this property. We do not currently know which protein fulfils this role. We have clarified this in the Discussion and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> figure legend.</p><p><italic>The text states that filaments are randomly oriented in uninfected cells, and bipolar in infected, but this large difference in organization is not well supported by the data provided</italic>.</p><p>In order to underscore the differences in the organization of polymers between uninfected and infected cells, we have added several Figure panels and clarifying text.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A, B, C and E</xref> show the distribution and dynamics of filaments in a population of uninfected cells. Filaments can now clearly be seen to be different from filaments assembled during phage infection as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>. We have also clarified our hypothesis and reasoning for the inclusion of a hypothetical “stabilizing” protein in our model. In infected cells, the wishbone-shaped bundles seem very stably anchored at the poles. While these are presumably assembled from many underlying filaments whose individual dynamics are unresolvable, the net effect is a stable (let’s call it) minus end. We presume that the filaments within uninfected cells are randomly oriented within the cell due to the fact short (∼0.2μm) spontaneously assembled filaments can be observed to “tumble” or rotate 360 degrees in the cell during time-lapse microscopy experiments.</p><p><italic>Points 1) and 2) could perhaps be addressed by some kind of quantitative image analysis that focused less on single filament tracking, which is frankly unconvincing, and more on other kinds of fluctuation analysis. For example, a spatial map of temporal variance might demonstrate in a convincing manner that fluctuations are located at random positions in uninfected cells, and concentrated at the center in infected cells. Difference imaging; subtracting frame n- from frame n- might also be beneficial in analyzing where in the cell polymerization dynamics occur. Difference imaging sometimes allows detection of fluctuations even in densely packed regions like the poles. A spatial map of average signal in difference images, which is related to an analysis of temporal variance, could be useful to map the positions in a cell where length change is occurring. More critical interpretation of imaging data is also essential. The authors must distinguish much more precisely between experimental observation and model. It's fine to propose a model that is not completely proven, but is consistent with the data. It is not ok to make statements about what has been observed when the data do not support those statements. It may be the case that the authors will have to argue their model without use of single filament tracking in vivo, if such tracking is simply unconvincing or impossible, as suggested by the current Movies and Figures</italic>.</p><p>As noted above, we have significantly revised the figures so that changes in filament lengths can be clearly seen for both infected and uninfected cells. We acknowledge that our model is not completely proven; there is certainly more work to do, however; together with the Movies and the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we suggest that our <italic>in vivo</italic> data are fully consistent with and supportive of our model. We have reworded some of our conclusions about the data to avoid confusion and convey a better sense of the unresolved issues. We agree with the reviewer that difference mapping is a powerful tool that can often eliminate some of the perils of tracking individual filaments, but the limitations of our host/phage system have complicated its use in this case. Filaments of PhuZ in infected cells are always a mixed population of labeled (from a plasmid) and unlabeled (from the phage) monomers; movement and/or exchange of the two populations of monomers within a polymer, as well as movement of the polymer itself in all three axes, leads to variations in intensity of the pixels and leads to a “maxed out” standard deviation for the entire filament. We believe that traditional kymographs and tracking individual filament ends as shown in the revised figures allow for a better evaluation of the change over time for each of the filament ends.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>is not very relevant to the main point of the paper, and the result could be mentioned in words only. In general, the paper jumps around a lot, and would benefit from more thorough analysis of polymerization dynamics, both in vitro and (especially) in vivo, and less distraction from analysis of DNA</italic>.</p><p>We understand and acknowledge Reviewer #2’s concern. These data are significant because they begin to address the purpose of the centering function and how it is coordinated with other essential processes of the phage <italic>in vivo</italic>. Is DNA replication required for the spindle to assemble or to function properly? We show that it is clearly not required and this eliminates an entire set of models and possible lines of inquiry. For these reasons, we have retained this data set in the revised manuscript. We have clarified these points in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
