neural activity that control aversion to nicotine and their adaptation during the addiction process remain largely unknown. Using a two-bottle choice experiment, we observed considerable heterogeneity in nicotine-drinking profiles in isogenic adult male mice, with about half of the mice persisting in nicotine consumption even at high concentrations, whereas the other half stopped consuming. We found that nicotine intake was negatively correlated with nicotine-evoked currents in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), and that prolonged exposure to nicotine, by weakening this response, decreased aversion to the drug, and hence boosted consumption. Lastly, using knock-out mice and local gene re-expression, we identified β4-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of IPN neurons as molecular and cellular correlates of nicotine aversion. Collectively, our results identify the IPN as a substrate for individual variabilities and adaptations in nicotine consumption.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nicotinic

substance in the world, and even though cigarette smoking is overall decreasing, the use of new products such as electronic cigarettes has risen dramatically in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">WHO, 2021</xref>). Nicotine administration induces a range of effects, from pleasant (i.e. appetitive, rewarding, reinforcing, anxiolytic…) to noxious (i.e. anxiogenic, aversive…) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fowler and Kenny, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Verendeev and Riley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wills et al., 2022</xref>). These multifaceted effects have been described both in humans and in rodents. They greatly depend on the dose of nicotine administered, show substantial inter-individual variability, and are considered essential in the regulation of nicotine intake and in the maintenance of addiction. Understanding the variable effects of nicotine at the molecular and circuit levels is therefore fundamental to progress in the pathophysiology of nicotine addiction and to develop efficient smoking-cessation therapies.</p><p>Nicotine mediates its physiological effects by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), pentameric ligand-gated ion channels encoded by a large multigene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wills et al., 2022</xref>). There are nine α (α2–10) and three β (β2–4) nAChR subunits expressed in the brain, which can assemble to form homo-pentamers or hetero-pentamers with various localizations and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zoli et al., 2015</xref>). Initiation of consumption and reinforcement to nicotine involve the mesolimbic dopamine reward circuit, which originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maskos et al., 2005</xref>). Nicotine primarily acts on this circuit by activating α4β2 nAChRs, a receptor subtype that displays high affinity for the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand-de Cuttoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maskos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tapper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tolu et al., 2013</xref>). An acute injection of nicotine also inhibits a subset of VTA dopamine neurons that project to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>), and this results in elevated anxiety in mice, illustrating the heterogeneity of the brain reward circuit, and the complexity of nicotine dependence.</p><p>Another important pathway in the neurobiology of nicotine addiction is the medial habenulo-interpeduncular (MHb-IPN) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frahm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tuesta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolfman et al., 2018</xref>). This pathway is deeply implicated in the regulation of aversive physiological states such as fear and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Otsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). It is believed to directly mediate aversion to high doses of nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frahm et al., 2011</xref>), to trigger affective (anxiety) and somatic symptoms following nicotine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao-Shea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao-Shea et al., 2013</xref>) and to be involved in relapse to nicotine-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forget et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, neurons of the MHb-IPN axis express the highest density and largest diversity of nAChRs in the brain, notably the rare α5, α3, and β4 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zoli et al., 2015</xref>). These are encoded by the <italic>CHRNA5-A3-B4</italic> gene cluster, some sequence variants of which are associated with a high risk of addiction in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bierut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lassi et al., 2016</xref>). The α3 and β4 subunits are virtually absent in the VTA, or in other parts of the brain. The implication of these different subunits in the response of the IPN to nicotine was so far investigated using brain slice physiology experiments or indirect approaches such as c-fos quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolfman et al., 2018</xref>). Recording the physiological response of IPN neurons to nicotine in the intact brain in vivo remains a prerequisite to understand the mechanism of action of nicotine on this pathway.</p><p>A distinct feature of addiction is that, overall, only some individuals lose control over their drug use, progressively shifting to compulsive drug intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">George and Koob, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juarez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pascoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siciliano et al., 2019</xref>). About one-third to one-half of people who have tried smoking tobacco become regular users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010</xref>). Individual differences in the sensitivities of the VTA and MHb-IPN systems, and in their respective adaptations during chronic tobacco use, could contribute to the vulnerability to nicotine and to the severity of the addiction process. Yet, the neural mechanism that makes individuals more prone to maintain nicotine consumption than durably stop are unclear. In addition, whether the MHb-IPN pathway respond differently to nicotine in individuals with and without a history of nicotine use, and the mechanisms by which smokers develop tolerance to the aversive effects of nicotine, are largely unknown. Here, we used isogenic mice and electrophysiology (ex vivo and in vivo) to study the neuronal correlates of inter-individual variabilities in nicotine consumption behavior, and their adaptation after chronic exposure to the drug.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heterogeneity in nicotine consumption in isogenic wild-type mice</title><p>We used a continuous access, two-bottle choice nicotine-drinking test to assess consumption profiles in male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice single-housed in their home cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this test, animals have continuous and concurrent access to two bottles containing a solution of either 2% saccharine (vehicle) or nicotine plus 2% saccharine (to mask the bitter taste of nicotine). After a 4-day habituation period with water in both bottles, nicotine concentration was progressively increased in one bottle across 16 days, from 10 to 200 μg/ml (4 days at each concentration), while alternating the side of the nicotine-containing solution every other day to control for side bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The consumption from each bottle was measured every minute. We found that daily nicotine intake increased throughout the paradigm, stabilizing at about 10 mg/kg/day on average for the highest nicotine concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Overall, the percent of nicotine consumption, that is, the nicotine solution intake relative to the total fluid intake, was initially close to 50%, and decreased for nicotine concentrations above 50 μg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results match what was observed in previous studies using male C57BL/6 mice, notably that these mice rarely show nicotine consumption over 50%, whether the water is supplemented with saccharine or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagdas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matta et al., 2006</xref>). The decrease in percent nicotine consumption observed at the population level over the course of the task suggests that mice adapt their behavior to reduce their number of visits to the nicotine-containing bottle.

In particular, some mice abruptly reduced their intake right after an increase in nicotine concentration in the bottle, or had very low nicotine intake throughout the task (intake never exceeded 2 mg/kg/day; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We classified these mice (17/35) as ‘avoiders’. The other half of the mice (18/35), on the other hand, displayed a continuous increase in nicotine intake, or eventually reached a titration plateau in their consumption. These mice were classified as ‘non-avoiders’. Another way to examine these distinct consumption profiles is to quantify the differences in intake between 2 consecutive days (positive differences indicate an increase in intake, while negative differences indicate a decrease in intake). The distinction between the two phenotypic groups becomes clear when we plot, for each mouse, the minimum and maximum values of the intake difference between 2 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right). The group of avoiders was characterized either by a negative minimum difference in intake (mice that reduce their intake abruptly), or by a minimum and maximum difference in intake close to zero (very low intake throughout the task). In contrast, the non-avoider mice were characterized by a minimum difference in intake between 2 consecutive days that was always positive, indicating a continuous increase in intake throughout the task. Overall, only a small proportion of the mice (7/35, all non-avoiders) reached a plateau in their consumption, which somewhat contrasts with the apparent titration observed at the population level, either here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tuesta et al., 2017</xref>). Avoiders and non-avoiders (phenotypes defined as above throughout the manuscript) showed on average similar nicotine intake for low concentrations of nicotine (10 and 50 µg/ml, p&gt;0.05), but while nicotine intake increased throughout the task for non-avoiders (16.9±2.9 mg/kg/day for 200 μg/ml of nicotine) it dropped down to 2.6±0.4 mg/kg/day for such high nicotine concentration in avoiders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and almost reached zero over the last 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The percent nicotine consumption was fairly constant throughout the task in non-avoiders, whereas in avoiders, it drastically decreased as nicotine concentration increased, to approximate zero at the end of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then compared the level of aversion produced by nicotine in avoiders and non-avoiders, with that produced by quinine, a notoriously bitter molecule. We found that all naive mice actively avoided the quinine-containing solution, and showed near-zero percent quinine consumption, as was observed with nicotine for avoiders, but not for non-avoiders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then used lower concentrations of quinine, and found that nicotine avoidance was not correlated with quinine avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that individuals who avoid nicotine have a strong aversion to the drug that is not directly tied to their sensitivity to the bitter taste of nicotine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The concentration of nicotine that triggers aversion differs among mice</title><p>Owing to the oral nature of the test, it may be difficult for mice to associate consumption in a particular bottle with the physiological effects (positive or negative) of nicotine. We thus systematically analyzed the percent nicotine consumption throughout the task in individual mice, to examine variability in their choice patterns and behavioral alterations. We found that some non-avoiders actively tracked the side associated with nicotine when the bottles were swapped (e.g. mouse #1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating a strong preference for the nicotine-containing bottle and active consumption. Other non-avoiders displayed a strong side preference and never alternated drinking side (e.g. mouse #2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and hence consumed nicotine in a more passive fashion. In contrast, all avoider mice (n=17) displayed active avoidance of the nicotine-containing solution, whether they initially tracked the nicotine solution (e.g. mice #3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or not (e.g. mice #5 and 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To quantify the evolution of nicotine consumption at the individual level throughout the task, and to better account for the passive consumption behavior of some of the mice, we mapped each profile in a pseudo-ternary plot where the base represents the nicotine consumption index (from 0 to 100%), while the upper apex represents 100% side bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Such a ternary representation enables us to graphically distinguish between mice that actively track the nicotine bottle (bottom right apex, 100% nicotine consumption index), mice that actively avoid nicotine (bottom left apex, 0% nicotine consumption index), and mice that have a strong side bias (top apex), and to calculate the shortest distance for each mouse to each of the three apices. In addition, by representing the trajectory for each individual from the water condition to the 200 μg/ml nicotine condition, this graph can be used to reveal and quantify behavioral adaptations (or lack thereof) in each individual. Overall, we found that the behavior of non-avoiders was on average fairly consistent throughout the task, that is their distance from the three apices was not really impacted by the modifications in nicotine concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), whether they consumed nicotine actively or passively. In contrast, the behavior of avoiders was highly nicotine concentration-dependent, with mice going further away from the 100% nicotine apex as nicotine concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Aversion to nicotine in avoider mice mainly occurred at the transition from 100 to 200 μg/ml, but some mice displayed aversion at concentrations as low as 10 μg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A and C</xref>). Together, these results show that most mice can actively track or avoid nicotine, indicating that they can discriminate nicotine from the control solution. Avoiders started actively avoiding the nicotine-containing bottle once a specific drug concentration was reached, suggesting the existence of a threshold at which nicotine aversion is triggered, which apparently differs between mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nicotine intake was negatively correlated with the amplitude of the response to nicotine in IPN neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative examples of choice behaviors (% consumption on the right vs. left bottle) in WT mice when the right-hand side bottle contains either nicotine +saccharine (red dots, grey stripe) or saccharine only (white dots, white stripes).

To answer this question, we added at the end of the two-bottle choice task, that is after the 200 µg/ml nicotine concentration, a condition with a low concentration of nicotine (50 µg/ml) for 4 days. We chose 50 µg/ml of nicotine because avoiders and non-avoiders initially displayed comparable nicotine intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and percent consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) at this concentration. We hypothesized that if avoiders increased their percent nicotine consumption at the 200–50 µg/ml transition, this would indicate a rapid adjustment to the concentration proposed, in order to maintain their level of intake constant. In contrast, if avoiders maintained a steady, low percent nicotine consumption, this would indicate that nicotine aversion persists, regardless of the dose. Indeed, we found that lowering nicotine concentration from 200 to 50 µg/ml did not increase percent nicotine consumption in avoiders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), at least for the 4 days that mice were subjected to this concentration. We then performed a complementary experiment, in which mice were directly subjected to a high concentration of nicotine (200 µg/ml), followed by 8 days at 50 µg/ml. We found that, overall, mice avoided the 200 µg/ml nicotine solution, and that the following increase in nicotine preference was gradual at 50 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This slow adjustment to a lower-dose contrasts with the rapid (within a day) change in intake observed when nicotine concentration increases (see for instance <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). If we look at individuals, we observe that half of the mice (6/13) retained a steady, low nicotine preference (&lt;20%) throughout the 8 days at 50 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which is similar to what was observed for avoiders in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that some mice, the non-avoiders, rapidly adjust their intake to adapt to changes in nicotine concentration in the bottle. In contrast, for avoiders, aversion to nicotine may involve a learning mechanism that, once triggered, results in prolonged cessation of nicotine consumption.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nicotine consumption negatively correlated with the amplitude of nicotine-evoked currents in the IPN</title><p>We then investigated the neural correlates of this nicotine aversion. We hypothesized that the IPN, which has been implicated in nicotine aversion and in negative affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fowler and Kenny, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLaughlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wills et al., 2022</xref>), might be activated differently by nicotine in avoiders and non-avoiders. Therefore, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices to assess, at completion of the two-bottle choice task, the functional expression level of nAChRs in IPN neurons. We recorded neurons from the rostral IPN (IPR), because these neurons have high nAChR density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolfman et al., 2018</xref>). To record nicotine-evoked currents, we used a local puff application of nicotine at a concentration (30 µM) close to the EC50 for heteromeric nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fenster et al., 1997</xref>). We found that the amplitude of nicotine-evoked currents was higher in IPN neurons of avoider mice than in those from non-avoiders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Specifically, there was a negative correlation between the average amplitude of nicotine-evoked current in IPN neurons, and nicotine consumption (measured over the last 24 hr prior to the patch-clamp recording, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Because there are many types of neurons in the IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ables et al., 2017</xref>) with heterogenous responses to nicotine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we verified that there was no anatomical sampling bias between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also found that there was no relationship between the amplitude of nicotine-induced current and the anatomical localization of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

The concentration of nicotine in the minipump (10 mg/kg/day) was chosen to match the average voluntary nicotine intake in the two-bottle choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To the best of our knowledge, no description of in vivo recordings of IPN neurons, and thus no criteria for identification, have been reported as yet, so we solely considered for analysis neurons that were labelled in vivo with neurobiotin and confirmed to be within the IPN. We found that nicotine i.v. injections in naive WT mice induce an increase in the firing rate of IPN neurons compared with saline injection, and that this acute effect of nicotine was reduced after the prolonged (4 weeks) passive exposure of the mice to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The anatomical distribution of recorded neurons was similar between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that the effect of chronic nicotine is unlikely to be due to sampling variability. There was a correlation in both groups between the response to nicotine and the mediolateral (ML), but not the dorso-ventral (DV) coordinates of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Regarding the spontaneous activity of IPN neurons, we found no correlation with their anatomical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), nor any effect of chronic nicotine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In both nicotine- and saline-treated animals, the amplitude of the response to nicotine was positively correlated with spontaneous activity: neurons with high basal activity responded to nicotine with a greater change in firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Some IPN neurons responded to nicotine by decreasing their firing rate and, as with nicotine-activated neurons, the response was of smaller amplitude in the chronic nicotine-exposed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Together, these ex vivo and in vivo recordings demonstrate that prolonged exposure to nicotine markedly reduces the amplitude of the drug response in mouse IPN neurons.</p><p>To verify the hypothesis that altered cholinergic activity in IPN neurons impacts nicotine aversion, we performed a series of experiments. First, we evaluated the consequence of prolonged nicotine exposure on nicotine consumption. Mice were implanted with an osmotic minipump to passively deliver nicotine and, after 20 days, were subjected to a modified two-bottle task that involved a direct exposure to a high concentration of nicotine (100 µg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We chose this protocol to avoid the confounding effects of a gradual exposure to nicotine, and to evoke strong aversion in the mice. We found that mice pretreated with saline (controls) avoided nicotine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which may indicate aversion to such high nicotine concentration. In contrast, mice pretreated with nicotine did not avoid nicotine, suggesting that they may have developed a tolerance for the aversive effects of the drug. Looking at the data day by day, we observed that control mice abruptly decreased their percent consumption when nicotine was introduced, while for nicotine-treated animals, the decrease was more gradual over the course of the 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Overall, nicotine consumption was greater in the nicotine-treated group than in the saline-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Focusing on individuals, we observed that a single saline-pretreated mouse (1/23) increased its percent consumption when nicotine was introduced in the task, while the vast majority of the mice actively avoided nicotine (close to the 0% Nicotine apex). In contrast, a marked proportion of the mice treated with nicotine (8/25) increased their percent consumption when nicotine was introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> p-value = 0.037 Chi-squared). The two groups were identical in the water/water session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, top). However, in the water/nicotine session, mice pretreated with nicotine showed a greater distance from the 0% nicotine consumption apex, and a shorter distance from the 100% nicotine consumption apex than mice pretreated with saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, bottom), indicating decreased aversion and increased preference for nicotine in the nicotine-pretreated group. Overall, these electrophysiological and behavioral data demonstrate that prolonged exposure to nicotine both decreases nicotine efficacy in the IPN, and also decreases aversion to nicotine in individuals, leading to increased drug use. However, chronic nicotine may produce adaptations in other brain circuits, and it remains to be demonstrated whether the neurophysiological changes observed in the IPN are causally related to the variations in aversion sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nicotine avoidance involves β4-containing nAChRs</title><p>We turned to mutant mice deleted for the gene encoding the β4 nAChR subunit (<italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice), because of the strong and restricted expression of this subunit in the MHb-IPN pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grady et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shih et al., 2014</xref>).

In this paradigm, mice are given free access to two bottles, only one of which contains nicotine, and allowed to choose which one they drink. Because it does not involve active lever pressing, this method cannot provide as much information as intravenous self-administration about the reinforcing effects of the drug. Yet it remains a simple and classical test to measure the animal’s preference (or lack thereof) for the drug, while minimizing stress from handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). In this test, WT mice showed on average no real preference for the nicotine-containing bottle at any of the concentrations tested, as is typically observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matta et al., 2006</xref>). However, it should be noted that, at the individual level, some mice actively tracked the nicotine-containing bottle and showed effective preference. On average, WT mice titrate to a nicotine dose of approximately 10 mg/kg/day, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antolin-Fontes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tuesta et al., 2017</xref>), while mutant mice lacking the β4 nAChR subunit did not, resulting in greater nicotine intake, notably at high nicotine concentrations. These results are consistent with the greater intracranial self-administration observed at high nicotine doses in these knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Husson et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, they are also consistent with the results obtained with transgenic TABAC mice overexpressing the β4 subunit at endogenous sites, which avoid nicotine and consequently consume very little (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frahm et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, it should be noted that conflicting results have also been reported regarding the role of β4 nAChRs in nicotine consumption. Notably, another study reported that <italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit lower intravenous self-administration of nicotine, even though their VTA is more sensitive to nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, self-administration is higher in TABAC mice despite reduced activation of the VTA by nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallego et al., 2012</xref>). The increased consumption at high nicotine concentration reported here for <italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice resembles what was observed in mutant mice either lacking the α5 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>) or with low levels of the α3 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elayouby et al., 2021</xref>), likely because the α3, α5, and β4 nAChR subunits, which are encoded by the same gene cluster, co-assemble in brain structures, notably the MHb-IPN pathway, to produce functional heteromeric nAChRs.</p><p>It is increasingly acknowledged that in mice, as in humans, there is a substantial variability in the susceptibility for developing drug use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dongelmans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Rivas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juarez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nesil et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piazza et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siciliano et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, it is still unclear why some individuals are more susceptible than others to become regular users. We discovered important inter-individual differences in nicotine vulnerability: about half of the WT mice, the avoiders, durably quit nicotine at a certain concentration, whereas the other half, the non-avoiders, continued consumption even at high concentration of nicotine, classically described as aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>). Avoiders displayed variable concentration thresholds required for triggering aversion, and some even developed aversion at the beginning of the two-bottle choice task, when nicotine concentrations were still low. The nicotine concentration threshold required to trigger aversion differed among avoiders, and was likely not reached in non-avoiders and <italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We conducted experiments with adult male mice only, so it remains an open question whether nicotine aversion varies with sex and age. Importantly, very few mice showed what might be considered titration (plateau consumption), emphasizing the needs to consider individual, as opposed to group, behavior in addiction research.</p><p>We also found that the functional expression level of β4-containing nAChRs in the IPN underlies these different sensitivities to the aversive properties of nicotine. Indeed, nicotine aversion was nearly eliminated in <italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, none of which quit drinking nicotine, and was restored after selective re-expression of the β4 subunit in the IPN. This local re-expression experiment, together with the absence of correlation between nicotine and quinine aversion, discards the possibility that different sensitivities to the bitter taste of nicotine solutions explain the different drinking profiles of avoiders and non-avoiders. We observed a negative correlation between nicotine consumption and the response of the IPN to the drug: mice consuming large amounts of nicotine displayed lower nicotine-evoked currents in the IPN than mice consuming small amounts of nicotine. Accordingly, <italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and nicotine-treated WT mice, both of which display reduced responses to nicotine, consume greater amounts of the drug. It should be noted that there is a variety of neuronal types in the IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ables et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Guillén et al., 2021</xref>) and our electrophysiological recordings did not address this genetic diversity. That said, we sampled similar populations of neurons across groups, and found little evidence of a relationship between anatomical localization and response to nicotine, allowing for comparisons across conditions. We also found that nAChRs that contain the β4 subunit represent the vast majority of nicotinic receptors in the IPN. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression level of β4-containing nAChRs in the IPN may determine the level of aversion to the drug, and consequently its intake.</p><p>We suggest that β4-containing nAChRs, by engaging the IPN circuitry, initiate a primary response to nicotine that, if above a certain threshold, will trigger acute aversion to the drug, impacting the balance between drug reward and aversion to limit drug consumption. Consistent with this, pharmacological or optogenetic stimulation of the MHb-IPN pathway directly produces aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tuesta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolfman et al., 2018</xref>), while pharmacological inactivation of this pathway increases nicotine intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>). We further found that aversion to nicotine is not just an acute adaptation to the dose, but can last for days. This is consistent with findings in humans, where an initial unpleasant reaction to cigarettes is associated with a reduced likelihood of continued smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiFranza et al., 2004</xref>). Such a sustained aversive reaction to nicotine was conditioned, in mice, by nicotine itself, and required β4-containing nAChRs of the IPN for its onset, but most likely involves other brain circuits for its long-term persistence. Identifying the molecular and cellular mechanism of long-term aversion to nicotine in mice will be instrumental to progress in our understanding of human dependence to tobacco.</p><p>We did not observe major differences in nicotine intake between avoiders and non-avoiders at the beginning of the two-bottle choice experiment, for low concentrations of nicotine (&lt;100 μg/ml), but we cannot completely rule out pre-existing inter-individual differences that could explain the opposite trajectories taken by the two groups. Indeed, the mice used in this study were isogenic, yet epigenetic changes during development or differences in social status, which are known to affect brain circuits and individual traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Torquet et al., 2018</xref>), may affect the responses of the IPN to nicotine. It is indeed tempting to speculate that external factors (e.g. stress, social interactions…) that would affect either the expression level of β4-containing nAChRs in the IPN or the availability of nicotine in the brain (through different metabolic activities for instance), will have a strong impact on nicotine consumption. In addition to pre-existing differences, history of nicotine use could produce long-lasting molecular and cellular adaptations in the IPN circuitry and consequently alter nicotine aversion and consumption. Indeed, we discovered that prolonged nicotine exposure downregulated and/or desensitized β4-containing nAChRs of the IPN, as evidenced by the decreased response to nicotine both ex vivo and in vivo, and the absence of effect in Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>This observed functional downregulation of nAChR currents contrasts with previous findings. Chronic nicotine was shown to cause functional upregulation of nicotinic currents in MHb neurons of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arvin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2020</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2020</xref>), as well as in IPN neurons of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao-Shea et al., 2013</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tapia et al., 2022</xref>). However, it should be noted that upregulation is highly cell-type as well as receptor-subtype dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nashmi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao-Shea et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, in the mouse IPN, functional upregulation was shown only in SST-positive neurons, which constitute a small fraction of IPN neurons, and no increase in β4 subunit expression was reported in SST-negative neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in cell culture, it was found that β2-, but not β4-containing nAChRs were upregulated after nicotine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 1998</xref>), which agrees with our findings. Upregulation is likely due to an increase in receptor number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banala et al., 2018</xref>), yet it can be masked by receptor desensitization, which occurs during prolonged nicotine treatment. In some of the reports of nicotine-induced upregulation, currents were recorded only after nicotine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2016</xref>), leaving enough time for the receptors to recover from desensitization. Here, we recorded responses to nicotine in vivo, while nicotine was still present, and found that they were reduced in amplitude, which fits with the downregulation we observed in slices. Furthermore, our behavioral data in nicotine-treated WT and <italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are in complete agreement: both displayed reduced responses to nicotine (ex vivo and in vivo) in IPN neurons, as well as increased nicotine intake compared to naive, WT animals.</p><p>We suggest that long-term exposure to nicotine decreases the likelihood to reach the threshold at which mice develop aversion to the drug, which ultimately leads to increased drug consumption. In other words, nicotine intake history weakens the ability of nicotine to induce aversion in mice. In most nicotine replacement therapies, such as gums or patches, nicotine is slowly administered over prolonged periods of time, ostensibly to mitigate negative emotional reactions elicited by nicotine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018</xref>). However, our data indicate that mice under prolonged nicotine administration will also develop tolerance to the aversive effects of nicotine, underscoring the necessity to develop alternative medical approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Eight- to sixteen-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 J (Janvier labs, France) and <italic>Chrnb4</italic> knock-out (<italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) male mice (Pasteur Institute, Paris) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 1999</xref>) were used for this study. <italic>Chrnb4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were backcrossed onto C57BL/6 J background for more than twenty generations.

The secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse (1:500 dilution) and alexa488-conjugated anti-chicken (1:1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-165-150 and 703-545-155, respectively). For the juxtacellular immunostaining, the recorded neurons were identified with the addition of AMCA-conjugated streptavidin (1:200 dilution) in the solution (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slices were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, P36930). Microscopy was carried out either with a confocal microscope (Leica) or with an epifluorescence microscope (Leica), and images were captured using a camera and analyzed with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were computed using R (The R Project, version 4.0.0). Results were plotted as a mean ± s.e.m. The total number (n) of observations in each group and the statistics used are indicated in figure legends. Classical comparisons between means were performed using parametric tests (Student’s T-test, or ANOVA for comparing more than two groups when parameters followed a normal distribution [Shapiro test p&gt;0.05]), and non-parametric tests (here, Mann-Whitney or Friedman) when the distribution was skewed. Multiple comparisons were corrected using a sequentially rejective multiple test procedure (Holm-Bonferroni correction). All statistical tests were two-sided. p&gt;0.05 was considered not to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the recommendations for animal experiments issued by the European Commission directives 219/1990, 220/1990 and 2010/63, and approved by Sorbonne Université.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80767-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Prolonged nicotine exposure reduces aversion to the drug in mice by altering nicotine transmission in the antiparticle nucleus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The three reviewers raised many concerns regarding the experimental designs, data analysis, controls, statistics, sex bias in experiments, insufficiency in electrophysiological properties, and gene-phenotype relationship. Specifically, their main concerns included that the oral nicotine drinking model does not test nicotine reinforcement, and the electrophysiological recordings lack cell specificity, etc. We hope that you will find our reviewers' comments helpful and that you will soon receive a more encouraging response elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In overall, the concern of the reviewer is the insufficiency in addressing the differences in beta4-nAchR of &quot;avoiders&quot; versus &quot;non-avoiders&quot;. How is Î²4 distributed in IPN? What is the cell type specificity? The &quot;avoiders'&quot; and &quot;non-avoiders'&quot; behavioral and electrophysiological relationship with Î²4 expression should be addressed.</p><p>2. The authors used a pseudo-ternary plot to differentiate nicotine &quot;avoiders&quot; and &quot;non-avoiders&quot;. The main behavioral and electrophysiological factors that differentiate &quot;avoiders&quot; from &quot;non-avoiders&quot; can be but were not fully drawn, from the data presented. Also, there is still apparent heterogeneity between &quot;avoiders&quot; and &quot;non-avoiders&quot; (Figure 2A). How these differences relate to IPN nicotine-evoked currents, and if the power of the plot is sufficient for dissecting the population, can be further explored.</p><p>4. The change of in vivo activity of the IPN in Î²4 KO or OE rescue should be documented.</p><p>5. The individual difference in sensitivity to the bitterness of nicotine should be excluded by using nicotine/quinine vs. quinine preference tests.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors need to provide the sex of the mice used in each experiment. If both sexes were used across the study, the authors should describe how and if the estrus cycle was monitored.</p><p>– The authors should describe the power analysis used to determine the sample sizes of the current data set. For example, it is unclear why a double number of mice/neurons were recorded in N-Av while the related s.e.m. is 50% lower (Figure 2) compared to the Av group.</p><p>– The IPn is a heterogeneous brain structure. Also, the authors should further describe the location of the recorded neurons and the viral expression.</p><p>– The Y-axis in supplement figure 1D doesn't align well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The oral model is a major weakness. I suggest using an alternative model (and/or species) with more translational relevance. Relatedly, it will be important for this work to use concentrations and doses of nicotine that are relevant to human tobacco users.</p><p>– The fact that there are a variety of identifiable types of neurons in the IPN is a very important issue because this work did not take this into account. Differences in nicotine receptor function, noted by the authors, could be simply from sampling variability rather than due to the action of chronic nicotine. A version of this paper that makes a strong impact on the field will need to link changes in nAChR currents to specific types of neurons in the IPN.</p><p>– This paper had aspects that were not novel, which prevented the paper from making a strong impact on the field. The manuscript needs a limitations section that provides a measured assessment of the weaknesses of the paper.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Prolonged nicotine exposure reduces aversion to the drug in mice by altering nicotinic transmission in the interpeduncular nucleus&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kate Wassum (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some minor points that need to be addressed. Reviewer #3 mentioned that beta4 functional responses tend to be up-regulated following contingent or non-contingent nicotine treatment in the MHb/IPN pathway in multiple species. Elaboration in the discussion of this point is recommended.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present revision is improved over the previous version and has addressed most of the review concerns. A key finding remains at odds with other findings in the literature, though. The manuscript reports that chronic, passive exposure to nicotine results in down-regulation of nAChRs, presumably beta4-containing receptors (identification of beta4-containing was inferred, not demonstrated with pharmacology). The paper discusses that their results are contradictory to those of Arvin et al. and offer speculation that this is due to methodological differences. The finding of nAChR down-regulation following nicotine treatment is actually contradictory to findings reported in many papers, across several labs, and across several species/preparations. Consider the following regarding the medial habenula / IPN pathway (where beta4 receptors are enriched) and in cultured cells:</p><p>1. Shih et al. (Mol Pharm 2015). Chronic nicotine treatment in mice (mini pumps) results in upregulation of nAChRs in medial habenula, a brain area with similar beta4-containing nAChRs.</p><p>2. Banala et al. (Nature Methods 2018). MHb nAChR upregulation following chronic nicotine in mice (nicotine drinking water).</p><p>3. Jin et al. (eNeuro, 2020). Upregulation of nAChRs in MHb following nicotine self-administration in rats, shown with ACh puff experiments.</p><p>4. Tapia et al. (Neuropharm. 2022). Nicotine self-administration in rats results in upregulation of nAChRs in IPN – demonstrated with ACh puff experiments, not uncaging.</p><p>5. Zhao-Shea et al. (Current Biology 2013). Beta4-containing receptors are upregulated (functionally and mRNA) in dorsal IPN in response to chronic nicotine treatment in mice (nicotine drinking water).</p><p>6. Mazzo et al. (J. Neurosci. 2013). Alpha3beta4 receptors are upregulated by nicotine treatment in vitro.</p><p>Thus, the finding of downregulation of nAChRs in the present manuscript is interesting. The paper would be strengthened if there was an improved discussion of this issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80767.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Unfortunately, there is no good antibody specific to b4. However, images from a transgenic mouse line (Chrnb4-Cre, or OL57) that expresses the enzyme Cre recombinase under the promoter of the b4 nAChR gene are available on the following Gensat webpage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the mouse line mouse line is however no longer alive in the Gensat colony):</p><p>http://www.gensat.org/creGeneView.jsp?founder_id=84314&amp;gene_id=400&amp;backcrossed=false</p><p>These images show that b4 is expressed in IPN neurons. More specifically, labeled cell bodies are found in the rostral part of the IPN (IPR), and in its ventral and central parts (IPC), both of which receive cholinergic inputs from the medial habenula (MHb). In contrast, no b4-labelled cells are not found in the lateral parts of the IPN (IPL and IPDL), two subnuclei that do not receive cholinergic inputs from the MHb (Frahm et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). We could potentially, if allowed, add these images to supplementary figures (or eventually a link to these images in the text), should the reviewers and editors deem it necessary.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80767-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In our experiments, we have recorded either solely from the IPR (whole-cell patch clamp experiments) or mostly from the IPR and IPC (juxtacellular electrophysiology). We now provide maps of the recorded neurons for all figures. Several of our findings confirm that b4 constitutes the large majority of functional nAChRs in IPN neurons. First, we found, using patch clamp recordings, that nicotine-evoked currents are reduced by about 80% in b4<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 4D). Second, the in vivo response to nicotine is also largely reduced (by about 65%) in mice deleted for b4 (Figure 4E). Finally, b4<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a strong phenotype (they consume large amounts of nicotine and show no avoidance to the drug) and local re-expression of b4 in the IPN restores WT consumption profiles.Furthermore, we found that the amplitude of the response to nicotine (whether in patch or in vivo) were mostly not correlated with the anatomical localizations of the neurons (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). Hence, even though IPN neurons are heterogenous, the various types of neurons are probably distributed throughout the IPN, and they were sampled in a similar way in our recordings. Therefore, in our point of view, further addressing neuronal diversity is not needed in the current study. In addition, the fact that our results are robust (e.g. 80% decrease in current in brain slices) without having to address neuronal diversity of the IPN further demonstrate the robustness of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors used a pseudo-ternary plot to differentiate nicotine &quot;avoiders&quot; and &quot;non-avoiders&quot;. The main behavioral and electrophysiological factors that differentiate &quot;avoiders&quot; from &quot;non-avoiders&quot; can be but were not fully drawn, from the data presented. Also, there is still apparent heterogeneity between &quot;avoiders&quot; and &quot;non-avoiders&quot; (Figure 2A). How these differences relate to IPN nicotine-evoked currents, and if the power of the plot is sufficient for dissecting the population, can be further explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We classified mice in two groups (avoiders and non-avoiders) and recognized, in the original version of the paper, that there was heterogeneity within each group (Figure 2A). For this reason, we illustrated the diversity in consumption profiles using ternary plots, in which all individual mice are represented. Avoiders and non-avoiders were distinguished on the basis of their consumption profile (Figure 1), not on the basis of the ternary plots (Figure 2). The analysis of consumption in terms of choice using ternary plots does not aim to identify sub-populations (hence, there is no power problem). Rather, it shows that the two groups were associated with different consumption patterns (Figure 2C-D) and different amplitudes of nicotine-evoked current (Figure 2E,F), which not only reinforces our first classification, but also allows us to establish correlations between these parameters. In the following figures (Figure 3-5), we make a more direct link between these variables. In particular, we manipulate nAChR currents (either by chronically exposing mice to nicotine or by using mutant mice in which nAChR expression is altered) and link these effects to drug use and choice patterns.</p><p>In terms of further linking behavioral heterogeneity to nicotine responses, we performed a new analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We looked for a correlation between current amplitude and distance from each apex (0% nicotine apex, 100% nicotine apex and side bias apex). Unfortunately, we did not find a statistically-significant correlation (except for side bias), probably because of low power (n too small). We thus prefer not to include these analyses in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80767-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The change of in vivo activity of the IPN in Î²4 KO or OE rescue should be documented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed this experiment as requested. We virally re-expressed b4 (or GFP for controls) in the IPN of b4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and recorded the response of IPN neurons to i.v. injections of nicotine (30 ug/kg). We found that the responses to nicotine were restored (new Figure 5C). These results confirm what we initially observed at the whole-cell level in patch clamp experiments, and fully validate our viral rescue strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The individual difference in sensitivity to the bitterness of nicotine should be excluded by using nicotine/quinine vs. quinine preference tests.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by all three reviewers, we have now performed a two-bottle choice experiment to verify whether different sensitivities to the bitterness of the nicotine solution could explain the different sensitivities to the aversive properties of nicotine. Indeed, even though we used saccharine to mask the bitterness of the nicotine solution, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the taste capacity of the mice could affect their nicotine consumption. Reviewers 1 and 2 suggested to perform nicotine/quinine versus quinine preference tests, but we were afraid that forcing mice to drink an aversive, quinine-containing solution might affect the total volume of liquid consumed per day, and also might create a “generalized conditioned aversion to drinking water – detrimental to overall health and a confounding factor” as pointed out by reviewer 3. Therefore, we designed the experiment a little differently.</p><p>In this two-bottle choice experiment, mice were first proposed a high concentration of nicotine (100 µg/ml) which has previously been shown to induce avoidance behavior in mice (Figure 3C). Then, mice were offered three increasing concentrations of quinine: 30, 100 and 300 µM. Quinine avoidance was dose dependent, as expected: it was moderate for 30 µM but almost absolute for 300 µM quinine. We then investigated whether nicotine and quinine avoidances were linked. We found no correlation between nicotine and quinine preference (new Figure: Figure 1- supplementary figure 1D). This new experiment strongly suggests that aversion to the drug is not directly tied to the sensitivity of mice to the bitter taste of nicotine.</p><p>Other results reinforce this conclusion. First, none of the b4<sup>-/-</sup> mice (0/13) showed aversion to nicotine, whereas about half of the virally-rescued animals (8/17, b4 re-expressed in the IPN of b4<sup>-/-</sup> mice) showed nicotine aversion, a proportion similar to the one observed in WT mice. This experiment makes a clear, direct link between the expression of b4 nAChRs in the IPN and aversion to the drug.</p><p>Furthermore, we also verified that the sensitivity of b4<sup>-/-</sup> mice to bitterness is not different from that of WT mice (new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B). This new result indicates that the reason why b4<sup>-/-</sup> mice consume more nicotine than WT mice is not because they have a reduced sensitivity bitterness.</p><p>Together, these new experiments strongly suggests that interindividual differences in sensitivity to the</p><p>bitterness of nicotine play little role in nicotine consumption behavior in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The authors need to provide the sex of the mice used in each experiment. If both sexes were used across the study, the authors should describe how and if the estrus cycle was monitored.</p></disp-quote><p>Information on sex (males only) was provided both in the abstract and in the Results section, but was omitted in the methods section. This is now corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should describe the power analysis used to determine the sample sizes of the current data set. For example, it is unclear why a double number of mice/neurons were recorded in N-Av while the related s.e.m. is 50% lower (Figure 2) compared to the Av group.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not calculate power, notably because we had no a priori idea of the expected results (difference between the two groups and variances). Furthermore, the distribution is non-gaussian, which makes the power calculation much more complicated. In Figure 2E and F, we initially included mice that underwent a slightly different behavioral protocol (they stopped the 2BC at 100 µg/ml instead of 200 µg/ml). We realize that this was not sufficiently explained in the manuscript, quite misleading, and in fact not necessary. In this new version of the manuscript, we therefore included only the mice that underwent the full protocol (up to 200 µg/ml), that is 7 nonavoiders (52 neurons) and 7 avoiders (57 neurons). The number of mice and neurons between the two groups is now more even. The difference in current amplitude between the two groups still holds (p = 0.0027) and the correlation is even slightly better (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.47, p = 0.004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The IPn is a heterogeneous brain structure. Also, the authors should further describe the location of the recorded neurons and the viral expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, reviewer is right, and this could impact the interpretation of the results. As described above, we now provide maps of the neurons recorded both ex-vivo (patch-clamp recordings) and in-vivo (juxtacellular recordings). Overall, we have recorded in largely overlapping areas in most of the experimental groups (new supplementary figures, see details above). In addition, we haven’t observed any strong link between the medio-lateral or dorsoventral coordinates and the response to nicotine in the IPN (ex and in vivo). Therefore, we are confident that the effects we observe under chronic nicotine and after deletion of b4 are not due to sampling variabilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The Y-axis in supplement figure 1D doesn't align well.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The oral model is a major weakness.

But these limitations do not disqualify the method and for some aspects, and in particular regarding consumption strategies, this test is much more interesting than self-administration. Finally, the doses of nicotine used are totally in line with a large body of literature, see details in Matta, S. G. et al. 2006. Guidelines on nicotine dose selection for in vivo research.

The reviewer suggests that differences in nicotine receptor function could be simply from sampling variability rather than due to the action of chronic nicotine. We now provide maps of the recorded neurons (in slices and in vivo), as well as evidence that neurons were sampled similarly between the different experimental conditions. We think, and we thank the three reviewers for pointing that issue out, that our findings are much more convincing now and that showing that nicotinic transmission in the interpeduncular nucleus impact nicotine preference in a free choice test is important to understand basic mechanisms that underly response to nicotine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– This paper had aspects that were not novel, which prevented the paper from making a strong impact on the field.

Reviewer #3 mentioned that beta4 functional responses tend to be up-regulated following contingent or non-contingent nicotine treatment in the MHb/IPN pathway in multiple species.

A key finding remains at odds with other findings in the literature, though. The manuscript reports that chronic, passive exposure to nicotine results in down-regulation of nAChRs, presumably beta4-containing receptors (identification of beta4-containing was inferred, not demonstrated with pharmacology). The paper discusses that their results are contradictory to those of Arvin et al. and offer speculation that this is due to methodological differences. The finding of nAChR down-regulation following nicotine treatment is actually contradictory to findings reported in many papers, across several labs, and across several species/preparations. Consider the following regarding the medial habenula / IPN pathway (where beta4 receptors are enriched) and in cultured cells:</p><p>1. Shih et al. (Mol Pharm 2015).

We have added a paragraph in the Discussion section, to address the remaining comment of reviewer 3. Notably, we discuss now in greater details the issue that the functional downregulation we have observed contrasts with previous findings. We also have added a few references, as listed by reviewer 3. We agree that this additional paragraph strengthens the discussion.</p><p>Our added paragraph (line 549-570): “This observed functional downregulation of nAChR currents contrasts with previous findings. Chronic nicotine was shown to cause functional upregulation of nicotinic currents in MHb neurons of mice (Arvin et al., 2019; Banala et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2016; Shih et al., 2015; Tucker and Drenan, 2020) and rats (Tucker and Drenan, 2020), as well as in IPN neurons of mice (Zhao-Shea et al., 2013) and rats (Tapia et al., 2022). However, it should be noted that upregulation is highly cell-type as well as receptor-subtype dependent (Nashmi et al., 2007; Shih et al., 2015; Zhao-Shea et al., 2013). For instance, in the mouse IPN, functional upregulation was shown only in SST-positive neurons, which constitute a small fraction of IPN neurons, and no increase in b4 subunit expression was reported in SST-negative neurons (Shih et al., 2015). Moreover, in cell culture, it was found that b2-, but not b4-containing nAChRs were upregulated after nicotine treatment (Wang et al., 1998), which agrees with our findings. Upregulation is likely due to an increase in receptor number (Banala et al., 2018), yet it can be masked by receptor desensitization, which occurs during prolonged nicotine treatment. In some of the reports of nicotine-induced upregulation, currents were recorded only after nicotine withdrawal (Pang et al., 2016), leaving enough time for the receptors to recover from desensitization. Here, we recorded responses to nicotine in vivo, while nicotine was still present, and found that they were reduced in amplitude, which fits with the downregulation we observed in slices. Furthermore, our behavioral data in nicotine-treated WT and Chrnb4-/- mice are in complete agreement: both displayed reduced responses to nicotine (ex vivo and in vivo) in IPN neurons, as well as increased nicotine intake compared to naive, WT animals.”</p><p>We have also added one sentence in the Results section, to refer to the GENSAT data, and added the corresponding reference.</p></body></sub-article></article>
