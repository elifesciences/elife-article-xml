(rhizobiome) affects plant health, stress tolerance, and nutrient use efficiency. However, it remains unclear to what extent the composition of the rhizobiome is governed by intraspecific variation in host plant genetics in the field and the degree to which host plant selection can reshape the composition of the rhizobiome. Here, we quantify the rhizosphere microbial communities associated with a replicated diversity panel of 230 maize (<italic>Zea mays L</italic>.) genotypes grown in agronomically relevant conditions under high N (+N) and low N (-N) treatments. We analyze the maize rhizobiome in terms of 150 abundant and consistently reproducible microbial groups and we show that the abundance of many root-associated microbes is explainable by natural genetic variation in the host plant, with a greater proportion of microbial variance attributable to plant genetic variation in -N conditions. Population genetic approaches identify signatures of purifying selection in the maize genome associated with the abundance of several groups of microbes in the maize rhizobiome. Genome-wide association study was conducted using the abundance of microbial groups as rhizobiome traits, and n=622 plant loci were identified that are linked to the abundance of n=104 microbial groups in the maize rhizosphere. In 62/104 cases, which is more than expected by chance, the abundance of these same microbial groups was correlated with variation in plant vigor indicators derived from high throughput phenotyping of the same field experiment. We provide comprehensive datasets about the three-way interaction of host genetics, microbe abundance, and plant performance under two N treatments to facilitate targeted experiments toward harnessing the full potential of root-associated microbial symbionts in maize production.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>rhizobiome</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>host-microbe interaction</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd><kwd>nitrogen</kwd><kwd>rhizosphere</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Maize</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cooperative Agreement OIA-1557417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jinliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive analyses of host genetics, root-associated microbiomes, and plant phenotypes under two nitrogen treatments reveals host genetic control of microbe abundance which, in turn, affects plant performance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Symbiotic relationships between plant hosts and root-associated microbes have been shaped through natural selection over millions of years of coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Limborg and Heeb, 2018</xref>), and have been a driver of crop performance and yield in agricultural production since the beginning of plant domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>). Microbial actors in the rhizosphere have been shown to promote plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saleem et al., 2019</xref>), improve nutrient use efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>), and reduce abiotic stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>). The promise of high throughput screens for plant growth promoting activity in isolated microbial strains or synthetic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yee et al., 2021</xref>) is the potential discovery of microbial agents that can be used as seed or soil additives to improve crop performance under field conditions. Promising results have been observed in controlled environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Gerrewey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), but it remains a challenge to achieve similar outcomes in crops under agriculturally relevant field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sessitsch et al., 2019</xref>), as many microbial inoculants struggle to compete with naturally occurring microbes in the rhizosphere and rarely survive for extended periods of time in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piromyou et al., 2011</xref>). An improved understanding of how plants shape the composition of their rhizobiomes under diverse field conditions would make it more feasible to identify beneficial plant-microbe interactions that will be persistent and replicable in field environments. Moreover, studying the effects of plant genetics on microbial communities may identify opportunities to breed crop plants that recruit and maintain superior growth-conducive microbial communities from the natural environment.</p><p>Few studies to date have addressed the relationship between plant genetics and rhizobiomes in field settings, mainly because large-scale rhizosphere sampling (as opposed to leaf microbiome sampling) and DNA sequence analysis of microbial communities in diverse plant hosts is time-consuming, expensive, and poses significant logistical and technical challenges. It has been shown that plant genetics can explain variation in both root architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bray and Topp, 2018</xref>) and exudation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mönchgesang et al., 2016</xref>). If these factors in turn shape microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sasse et al., 2018</xref>), variation in the root-associated microbial groups (hereafter referred to as rhizobiome traits) may also result from genetic factors. Recent studies suggested that the variation in the composition of rhizobiomes is likely controlled by plant genetic factors (i.e., heritable) in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peiffer et al., 2013</xref>), sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2021</xref>), and switchgrass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sutherland et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains unclear to what extent these heritable microbes are affected by the plant host and contribute to variation in the crop phenotype. Like any other trait under heritable genetic control, rhizobiome traits can be targeted in selective breeding experiments. To explore this idea, previous efforts have been directed towards identifying plant genetic loci that are associated with rhizobiome traits. Initial studies have shown that rhizosphere microbial communities differ between distinct genotypes of the same host species, which has been shown in a study on 27 maize genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peiffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walters et al., 2018</xref>) and more recently, in a diversity panel of 200 sorghum lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2021</xref>). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has successfully revealed associations between plant genes and rhizobiome traits at high-level measures of rhizosphere community dissimilarity (i.e. using principal components) in an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> diversity panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergelson et al., 2019</xref>) or at order level (derived from operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) in a sorghum diversity panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2021</xref>). However, previous attempts at linking plant genes to the abundance of specific groups of microbes have had limited success due to small population size, limited host genetic diversity, or due to insufficient taxonomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beilsmith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). It was observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) that soil microbial communities drastically change in response to N fertilization. In bulk soil, this is likely due to a direct effect of N application or lack thereof. In rhizospheres, however, only a subset of the observed changes can be attributed to direct effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization, while particular microbial groups may be subject to indirect effects induced by the plant host in response to N availability or deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meier et al., 2021</xref>). A possible explanation for this could be that during most of the interval between maize domestication and the present, beneficial plant-microbe interactions have evolved in low-input agricultural systems characterized by relative scarcity of nutrients, predominantly nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brisson et al., 2019</xref>). This is in stark contrast to the modern agricultural environment that has been the norm since the 1960s, in which plants are supplied with large quantities of inorganic N fertilizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). As a consequence, previous selection pressure to retain traits favorable under low N conditions, including plant growth-promoting microbes, has been largely reduced in modern maize breeding programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haegele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, if a microbial group is indeed under host genetic control and has an effect on plant fitness (i.e. promotes plant development or increases crop yield) under either N condition, we would expect the rhizobiome trait to be under host selection.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluate the role that selection on plant genetic factors has played in shaping the maize rhizobiome under different N conditions. We employ the Buckler-Goodman maize diversity panel, a set of maize lines selected for maximum representation of genetic diversity and growth in temperate latitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flint-Garcia et al., 2005</xref>). This population has previously been used to determine the heritability of leaf microbiome traits and to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on a number of different phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wallace et al., 2018</xref>). We collected replicated data on the rhizobiome of 230 lines drawn from this panel when grown under either high nitrogen (+N) and low nitrogen (-N) conditions in the field. For 150 microbial groups present in the rhizosphere (referred to as ‘rhizobiome traits’), which were abundant and consistently reproducible, we quantify the degree to which variation is subject to plant genetic control, and test for evidence of selection under either or both N conditions. Using a set of 20 million high-density single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we perform GWAS for each rhizobiome trait identifying genomic loci that are associated with one or more rhizobiome traits. Through comparison with gene expression data generated for the same population, we determine whether genes near microbe-associated plant loci are preferentially expressed in root tissue. Lastly, we evaluate whether the abundance of each microbial group in the rhizosphere is correlated with plant performance traits measured in the field, and whether microbe abundance and plant performance depend on the allele variant at selected microbe-associated plant loci. The results presented in this study lay the groundwork for future endeavors to investigate the molecular mechanisms of specific plant-microbe interactions under agronomically relevant conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the rhizobiome for diverse maize genotypes under two different N conditions</title><p>3,313 rhizosphere samples from 230 replicated genotypes of the maize diversity panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flint-Garcia et al., 2005</xref>) were collected from field experiments conducted under both +N and -N conditions (Materials and methods).

Rhizobiome traits were comparatively more heritable under -N than +N conditions (paired Student’s t-test, p=0.021, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found 34/150 (22.7%) microbial groups to be significantly heritable (permutation test, p&lt;0.05, Materials and methods) under both N conditions, 18/150 (12%) only under +N conditions, and 27/150 (18%) only under -N conditions. Twelve rhizobiome traits exhibited estimated h<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.6 in both +N and -N conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Notably, closely related microbial groups did not exhibit obvious patterns of shared high or low estimated heritabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As heritabilities and responses to treatments can vary considerably within families, genera, and lower taxonomic ranks, this underscores the importance of adequate taxonomic resolution when analyzing rhizosphere microbial communities.

To reduce biases due to environmental covariances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lande and Arnold, 1983</xref>), the standardized BLUP values of the microbial traits were fitted into the fitness function (See Materials and methods). For the selection differential estimation, the canopy coverage (CC) obtained from UAV imaging was used as a proxy for plant fitness. As a result, we identified 58 unique rhizobiome traits exhibiting significant linear selection differentials (bootstrapping p-value &lt;0.05) under +N (28 traits) and -N (46 traits) treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To evaluate the mode of selection at the genomic level, a Bayesian-based method (Genome-wide Complex Trait Bayesian analysis, or GCTB) was used to test for each rhizobiome trait (Materials and methods). A set of n=834,975 independent SNPs was used to estimate their effects on 150 rhizobiome traits as well as 17 conventional plant traits collected from the same population in the same field experiments (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Using the relationship between effects of non-zero SNPs and their minor allele frequencies (MAFs) as a proxy for the signature of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>), the S parameter was jointly estimated from the GCTB analysis for rhizobiome traits and plant traits. According to Zeng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>), if S=0 (i.e. the posterior distribution of S is insignificantly different from zero), the SNP effect is independent of MAF, suggesting neutral selection. If there is selection acting on the trait, the SNP effect can be positively (S&gt;0) or negatively (S&lt;0) related to MAF, indicating positive and purifying selection, respectively.</p><p>We report 10 rhizobiome traits that showed both significant linear selection differentials and significant S parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Under these stringent criteria, nine rhizobiome traits show evidence of purifying selection under +N or under -N. One microbial group (<italic>Bacillus fumarioli</italic>) showed positive S values indicating that this trait might have been a target of positive selection. Relative to rhizobiome traits, plant leaf traits and nutrient traits were both more likely to exhibit evidence of selection within this maize population. Three out of 15 plant leaf traits, that is leaf area (LA), leaf fresh weight (FW), and leaf dry weight (DW) (Materials and methods), exhibited S&gt;0 values under the +N condition, consistent with positive selection, while only one of the three exhibited a slightly negative S value in the -N condition and in that case exhibited a pattern consistent with weak purifying selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Note that the three leaf-related traits are not independent. The pairwise correlation coefficients are 0.92, 0.91, and 0.94, for LA and FW, LA and DW, FW and DW, respectively. Of the 11 micronutrient traits evaluated, 9/11 and 4/11 showed significantly negative S values in trait data collected under +N and -N conditions, respectively. From the same GCTB analysis, estimates of the number of SNPs with non-zero effects were substantially lower for rhizobiome traits than for conventional plant traits, whereas the differences were insignificant between the two N treatments for both rhizobiome and plant traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Through a 16 S rDNA-sequencing based approach, we identified a set of 150 rhizobiome traits based on 3626 ASVs that were highly abundant and consistently reproducible in this maize diversity panel. The phylogenetic tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> may deviate from the consensus microbial phylogeny since only the 350 bp ribosomal V4 region was used to establish the relationship between groups, and more accurate phylogenetic clustering should be considered in future studies with emphasis on the evolution of plant-microbe associations. In total, 79 out of the 150 rhizobiome traits (52%) showed significant evidence of being influenced by host plant genotype in one or more environmental conditions. The estimated heritability of rhizobiome traits in this study ranged from 0 to 0.757 for the +N treatment (mean 0.320) and from 0 to 0.839 for the -N treatment (mean 0.352). A comparable study of the rhizobiomes in a sorghum diversity panel estimated similar values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2021</xref>). A previous study on the same maize diversity panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wallace et al., 2018</xref>) investigated the heritability of 185 individual OTUs and 196 higher taxonomic units measured in the leaf microbiome. The study reported only two OTUs and three higher taxonomic groups showing significant heritability using the same permutation test we employed in this study. This may indicate that plant genetics have a stronger influence on rhizosphere colonizing microbes than on leaf colonizing microbes. One reason for this may be that there is a direct pathway for plant-to-microbe communication via root exudates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doornbos et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, no equivalent exchange of chemical information has been reported above ground, with the possible exception of aerial root mucilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Deynze et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We observed relatively higher heritability for rhizobiome traits quantified from plants grown in the -N treatment than under the +N treatment. This outcome is consistent with a model where the partnerships between microbiomes and plants were established in natural and early agricultural systems which were predominantly N limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brisson et al., 2019</xref>). N insufficiency in maize induces dramatic changes in physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciampitti et al., 2013</xref>), gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2013</xref>), root architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaudin et al., 2011</xref>), and root exudation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudoin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haase et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this, N fertilization or the lack thereof has substantial consequences on plant-microbe associations. In this study, 12% of rhizobiome traits were only significantly heritable under the +N treatment, and 18% only under the -N condition, and GWAS revealed plant-microbe associations at different genomic loci depending on the N treatment. Previous observations have also reported that rhizosphere microbial communities are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, in particular to N deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). This finding emphasizes the need to optimize microbial communities not only for a specific host but also for specific levels of N fertilization.</p><p>Our results suggest that the capacity of maize plants to encourage or discourage colonization of the rhizosphere by specific microbiota has been a target of selection. The BayesS method leverages the relationship between the variance of SNP effects and MAF as a proxy of natural selection in the distant past. This method detects signatures of natural selection on SNPs associated with microbiome traits but is not directly indicative of selection acting on the particular microbes. Indeed, we observed purifying selection acting on genetic variants associated with the abundance of nine rhizosphere traits, 7 in the +N and 7in the -N environment, respectively. Several rhizosphere denizens whose abundance showed evidence of being a target of purifying selection in the host genome have been linked to plant growth promoting activities, most notably <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oteino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Preston, 2004</xref>) and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernabeu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurepin et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Bacillus fumarioli,</italic> which showed evidence of positive selection, has previously been observed in plant rhizospheres, particularly in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garbeva et al., 2008</xref>), and several strains of <italic>Bacillus</italic> plant growth promoting activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, not all traits that are heritable are expected to be under selection, as traits can be heritable, that is transmitted from one generation to the next, without impacting the fitness or performance of offspring individuals under the conditions under which recent natural and/or artificial selection has occurred. Additional functional analyses (i.e. inoculation experiments) are warranted to further approve the beneficial effects of the microbes on plant fitness, and to investigate how naturally occurring microbe-plant symbiosis may be harnessed for further crop improvement.</p><p>Among the 150 rhizobiome traits analyzed here, 62 showed a significant correlation with measurements of canopy coverage collected from the same field experiment. In particular, the observed link between heritability of microbes and correlation with plant performance may indicate a symbiotic relationship of the host plant and root-associated microbes. However, while our data show correlations between microbe abundance and plant phenotypes, further experiments are required to determine the direction of causation and investigate potential mechanisms by which microbe abundance could influence phenotypic changes in the host. We observe that the majority of rhizobiome traits that are correlated with canopy coverage are both heritable and associated with one or more microbe-associated plant loci (MAPLs), and genes linked to variation in rhizobiome traits via GWAS were highly expressed in roots across genotypes in multiple independent gene expression datasets. This suggests a number of potential mechanisms for host plant genotypes to influence the composition of the rhizobiome.</p><p>For example, two of the three genes associated with the MAPL highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (Zm0001d023838 and Zm0001d023839) are preferentially expressed in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). According to MaizeGDB, both are protein coding genes that have not yet been characterized in maize. Known Zm0001d023838 orthologs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> encode AUXILIN-LIKE1 and AUXILIN-LIKE2, and overexpression of auxilin-like proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been shown to inhibit endocytosis in root hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ezaki et al., 2007</xref>). Overexpression of auxilin-like proteins has also been shown to confer resistance to root-borne bacterial pathogens in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2017</xref>). This indicates a possible link between root hair physiology and an altered microbiome. Although substantial further experimentation and study remains necessary, adjusting the expression of particular MAPL genes identified here may be an avenue to directly influence and engineer the abundance of targeted microbial groups in the rhizosphere to the benefit of the plant.</p><p>We evaluated associations between rhizobiome traits and a number of whole plant phenotypes. The Buckler-Goodman maize diversity panel has been and continues to be utilized in field experiments to determine the genetic basis of many phenotypes across diverse environments. The datasets generated here link the abundance of 150 microbial groups in the rhizosphere to genetic variation in 230 genotypes across two N treatments. Combining these public datasets with plant phenotypes collected from the same genotypes in additional environments may lead to the identification of other cases where MAPLs are associated with variation in plant phenotypes or plant performance. The results presented in this study add to an increasing body of evidence that microbial communities are actively and dynamically shaped by host plant genetic variation and may serve as the foundation for future research into particular plant-microbe relationships that may be harnessed to sustainably increase crop productivity and resilience to abiotic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Field and experimental design</title><p>In this study, 230 maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> subsp. <italic>mays</italic>) lines from the maize diversity panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flint-Garcia et al., 2005</xref>) were planted in May of 2018 and 2019 in a rain-fed experimental field site at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Havelock Farm (N 40.853, W 96.611). In both years, the experiment followed commercial maize.

Eight weeks after planting (2018: July 10 and 11; 2019: July 30, 31 and August 1), plant roots were dug up to a depth of 30 cm and rootstocks were manually shaken to remove and discard loosely adherent bulk soil.

Heritability was tested for significance using a permutation test.

The complete set of genotypes was planted in each quadrant where possible. Each quadrant was in turn divided into 4 split plots and a subset of the maize association panel was randomly assigned to each split plot based on the distributions of flowering time and plant height. Phenotypes were divided at the median value to create 4 flowering time / height categories: early/tall, late/tall, early/short, and late/short. Each split plot was further divided into 3 split plot blocks, and each split plot block was divided into 21 subplots in 3 ranges and 7 columns. Thus 252 subplots were available in each quadrant of the field. In each of 12 split plot blocks per quadrant, a t least one subplot was randomly selected and assigned the hybrid genotype (B73xMo17) to be used as a check to test for differences between geographical field locations. two check genotypes (B73xMo17 and B37xMo17) were used in 2018, and a single check genotype (B73xMo17) was used in 2019.

These include, B73, the roothairless3 mutant of B73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2017</xref>), two check hybrids (B73xMo17 and B37xMo17) and a subset of the Buckler-Goodman panel including 16 parent lines of the nested association mapping population (NAM) described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McMullen et al., 2009</xref>. 8 weeks after planting, 2 subsamples per genotype were collected per quadrant and 12 subsamples for checks, where each subsample was taken from the combined root material of two adjacent plants. This resulted in a total of 26*4*2+2*4*12=304 samples. In 2019, rhizosphere samples were collected in triplicates from all 1,008 subplots within 3 days, 8 weeks after planting, when the majority of plants had reached the tasseling stage. One of the two rows in each subplot was randomly selected, and 3 individual randomly selected plants within the row (subsamples) were sacrificed for rhizosphere collection. As a small fraction of subplots had poor germination and/or no surviving plants on the day of sampling, the final number of rhizosphere samples collected was 3,009. Rhizosphere samples were placed on ice immediately after collection and shipped to the lab to be processed on the same day.</p><p>To wash the tightly adherent rhizosphere soil layer off the roots, tubes were filled up to the 40 ml mark with autoclaved PBS buffer (46 mM NaH2PO4, 60 mM Na2HPO4, 0.02% Silwet-77), and shaken horizontally at 8000 rpm for 30 s. Rhizosphere suspension was filtered through a 100 μm nylon cell strainer (Celltreat Scientific Products, Pepperell, MA, USA) into a fresh 50 ml tube to capture root debris and large soil particles. Rhizosphere samples were frozen in suspension at –20 °C until further processing. DNA was isolated from rhizosphere soil using the MagAttract PowerSoil DNA KF Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and purified using the KingFisher Flex Purification System (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) with minor modifications to the protocol: Rhizosphere samples that were kept in suspension were thawed on ice, pelleted soil was resuspended by inverting tubes, and 500 μl soil suspension was added to the 96-well sample plates. To avoid cross contamination of wells during pipetting, plates were sealed beforehand with parafilm and the cover was pierced with the pipette tip to transfer the rhizosphere suspension into the intended well. Two plates were prepared at a time and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 x g to pellet soil. Supernatant was carefully removed with a multichannel pipette and 96-well plates with approximately 100–250 mg rhizosphere soil per well were frozen at –20 °C until further processing. On the day of DNA isolation, the bead mill substrate was added to the frozen soil pellets, soil was thawed on ice and the remainder of the protocol was followed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. We recommend this modified procedure for large numbers of samples as it is cleaner, faster, and better reproducible than scooping soil from pellets in sample tubes. Concentration of isolated DNA was measured fluorometrically with the QuantiFluor dsDNA System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA isolation was repeated for any samples that failed to reach a concentration of at least 1 ng/μl.</p><p>A 350 bp stretch of 16 S rDNA spanning the V4 region was amplified using V4_515 F_Nextera (<named-content content-type="sequence">TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA</named-content>) and V4_806 R_Nextera (<named-content content-type="sequence">GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT</named-content>) primers on several Illumina MiSeq runs.

To construct the microbiome dataset, 350 bp raw sequencing reads were trimmed using filterAndTrim() at 240 bp (forward reads) and 200 bp (reverse reads), respectively. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred using dada() and forward and reverse reads were merged with mergePairs(). A sequence table was generated using makeSequenceTable() and chimaeras were removed using removeBimeraDenovo(). Taxonomy was assigned to ASVs with assignTaxonomy() using the SILVA database version 138 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yilmaz et al., 2014</xref>) as a reference.

Constrained ordination and PERMANOVA analyses of the 4,632 ASVs identified a strong effect of N treatment as well as other experimental factors on ASV abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous observations that environmental factors play an important role in determining the composition of the root associated microbiome diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Floc’h et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlatter et al., 2020</xref>). Of the 4,632 common ASVs, 3,728 (or 80.5%) were highly abundant and observed in samples collected from both the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons (step 7). Removing ASVs that could not be repeatedly observed in multiple years reduced the complexity of the data set by 19.5% at the cost of a 2.3% loss in diversity (Shannon diversity reduced from 6.4 to 6.3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2s1">Appendix 1—figure 2—Figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, removing taxa (genus or family) with less than 5 observed ASVs yielded a dataset of 3,626 ASVs, 3,306 samples, and 105,745,986 total ASV counts. This final core microbiome encompasses &lt;1% of initial ASVs and ~50% of initial observations.

First, the 3,626 ASVs in the present study were grouped at the family level (the lowest taxonomic rank for which all ASVs were successfully annotated) and the phylogenetic tree derived from 16S V4 alignment was plotted alongside taxonomic annotation at the genus and species level. Because the ASVs are derived from short reads and may constitute variations not covered in the SILVA database, annotation at the genus and species level was often not possible. To close these gaps and form biologically meaningful groups of ASVs at low taxonomic ranks with better confidence, we examined the overall abundance of each ASV as well as the differential abundance in response to the N treatment alongside the sequence-based clustering. The premise here is that ASVs derived from biologically closely related individual microbes are similarly abundant in our dataset and respond similarly to the N treatment imposed on the field, in addition to similar 16 S sequences due to common ancestry. An example is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> with a subset of ASVs assigned to the <italic>Burkholderiaceae</italic> family.

(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic clustering of ASVs based on 16S V4 alignment. ASVs are annotated at the genus and species level using the SILVA database. Note that for some ASVs, annotation at the species level is missing, although the phylogenetic tree suggests divergent groups at the species level. Overall abundance in the dataset (<bold>B</bold>) of each ASV and differential abundance in response to the N treatment (<bold>C</bold>) were used in tandem with sequence-based clustering to group ASVs with similar features into microbial groups at sub-genus resolution (labeled in green). In this example, the genus <italic>Ralstonia</italic> constitutes a monophyletic cluster of ASVs which were all successfully assigned to the species <italic>R. pickettii</italic> (<bold>A</bold>). This uniform group is also reflected in relatively uniform abundance (<bold>B</bold>) and positive response to N treatment (<bold>C</bold>). On the other hand, most ASVs in the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> genus could not be annotated at the species level, even though the phylogeny suggests at least 4 distinct groups below the genus level. The first group, <italic>Burkholderia insecticola</italic> was identified at the species level without fail and once again, this is reflected in uniform abundances as well as a consistently negative response to N treatment. Within the next cluster two ASVs are assigned to <italic>Paraburkholderia caffeinilytica</italic>, and we assigned all other ASVs in the same cluster to the same species because they showed consistent abundance and response to treatment.

Thus, we opted to instead report the mean p-value of all significant SNPs in each 10kb genomic window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Incidentally, this also eliminated the need to filter out the strongest signals using quantiles, which are arbitrary and difficult to interpret.

Am I missing something here?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this insightful suggestion. A similar question was raised by Reviewer #1. We agree that the ultimate goal is to explain the relationship between plant genotype, microbiome composition, and plant phenotype in a unified model. However, to our knowledge, there is no such model readily available, and to develop such a three-variable model to connect genotype, microbiome, and plant phenotype altogether is challenging. Our group has attempted to build such a model for several years. For example, we leveraged a classical causal inference method, termed mediation analysis, to establish a causal chain from genotype to intermediate mediator to plant phenotype. We found the initial model can detect large effect mediators through extensive simulation. Using publicly available RNA-seq data as the mediators, we conducted empirical mediation analysis and identified mediator genes consistent with their known biological functions. As a next step, we will fit the microbiome data as the mediator. To get meaningful results, however, additional simulations and model fine-tuning need to be done. We believe the simulation and empirical results by fitting microbiome features as the intermediate mediators in a three-variable causal analysis is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>For the current work, we opted to apply more established methods to investigate associations between microbe abundance and plant genetics, and between microbe abundance and plant performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The relative abundance and the prevalence of ASVs is essentially ignored, beyond the initial screening described in the appendix. It would be important to know for example if heritable taxa are also abundant ones?</p></disp-quote><p>We briefly reported the differential abundance of microbial groups in Supplementary Figure 2. It is an interesting consideration to test whether heritable taxa are also abundant ones. To do this, we plotted the heritability of each taxonomic group vs. the mean abundance and added an extra panel to Supplementary Figure 2. There is indeed a positive correlation between heritability and microbe abundance, suggesting that the low measured heritability of some low abundance microbes might result from the less precise quantification of abundance provided by smaller read counts for these taxa.
