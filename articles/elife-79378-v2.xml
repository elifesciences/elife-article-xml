We recently developed videocystometry in rodents, which combines intravesical pressure measurements with X-ray-based fluoroscopy of the LUT, allowing the in vivo analysis of the process of urine storage and voiding with unprecedented detail. Videocystometry relies on the precise contrast-based determination of the bladder volume at high temporal resolution, which can readily be achieved in anesthetized or otherwise motion-restricted mice but not in awake and freely moving animals. To overcome this limitation, we developed a machine-learning method, in which we trained a neural network to automatically detect the bladder in fluoroscopic images, allowing the automatic analysis of bladder filling and voiding cycles based on large sets of time-lapse fluoroscopic images (&gt;3 hr at 30 images/s) from behaving mice and in a noninvasive manner. With this approach, we found that urethane, an injectable anesthetic that is commonly used in preclinical urological research, has a profound, dose-dependent effect on urethral relaxation and voiding duration. Moreover, both in awake and in anesthetized mice, the bladder capacity was decreased ~fourfold when cystometry was performed acutely after surgical implantation of a suprapubic catheter. Our findings provide a paradigm for the noninvasive, in vivo monitoring of a hollow organ in behaving animals and pinpoint important limitations of the current gold standard techniques to study the LUT in mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Healthy adults empty their bladder many times a day with little thought.

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lower urinary tract (LUT), consisting of the bladder and urethra, plays an important role in our daily life functioning. It is responsible for storing urine and emptying the bladder at an appropriate time and place. Proper LUT functioning is the result of complex communication pathways between the LUT and central nervous system. An estimated 20% of the population suffers from some sort of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTd), such as urinary incontinence, frequency, urgency, or bladder pain, which can have a strongly negative impact on health and wellbeing. Current treatments for LUTd generally lack efficacy and often come with bothersome side effects. Therefore, there is a high need for new treatment options, which depend on adequate preclinical models to study mechanisms of LUT control and to test potential novel therapies.</p><p>Due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, their cost-effectiveness, and the availability of a vast number of genetically modified strains, mice are favored models in preclinical LUT research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ito et al., 2017</xref>). In the last decades, cystometry has been considered the gold standard technique to study bladder function in mice in vivo. Cystometry is an experimental procedure whereby the bladder is continuously filled via an implanted catheter, and pressure inside the bladder is monitored during multiple filling and voiding cycles. More recently, this technique has sometimes been complemented with urethral electromyography (UEM) to provide simultaneous information regarding the activity of the urethral sphincters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kadekawa et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas these approaches have fueled important advances in our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that steer the LUT, they also come with important drawbacks. First, cystometry and UEM do not provide quantitative information regarding the filling state of the bladder or the urethral flow, whereas changes in these parameters are hallmarks of various LUTds. Second, cystometry and UEM require the introduction of, respectively, a catheter in the bladder wall and metal electrodes in the urethral sphincter, both of which can affect LUT function. Third, cystometry and UEM are mostly performed on urethane anesthetized or physically restrained mice to avoid complications and artifacts due to animal movement. The consequences of these procedures on LUT function in mice are incompletely understood.</p><p>To overcome some of these limitations, we recently introduced videocystometry, a new approach combining cystometry with continuous, fluoroscopy-based bladder imaging. By imaging the contrast-filled bladder at video rate, this approach provides quantitative and time-resolved measurements of bladder volume and urethral flow, along with other relevant aspects of LUT function such as vesicoureteral reflux and micromotions of the bladder wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franken et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the accurate analysis of bladder volume and urethral flow during consecutive filling–voiding cycles relies on the precise delineation of the bladder. This is readily achieved in anesthetized or otherwise motion-restrained mice, where the constant background of fluoroscopic images can be subtracted. However, in awake, unrestrained, and behaving animals, the position of the bladder relative to other structures visible in the fluoroscopic images (e.g., bones) changes constantly. Therefore, our earlier analyses relied on manual tracking of the border of the bladder, which is feasible for a limited number of fluoroscopic images but clearly unworkable for typical minutes-to-hours-long imaging sessions at 30 images/s, yielding &gt;10<sup>5</sup> images.</p><p>To address this problem, we developed a machine-learning approach where we trained a neural network that automatically and faithfully detects the bladder in large sets of time-lapse fluoroscopic images in mice, allowing accurate determination of volume- and flow-related parameters in behaving mice. The combination of videocystometry and machine learning allowed us to pinpoint the profound effects of urethane, an injection anesthetic standardly used in preclinical bladder research, on the function of the LUT. Furthermore, we provide proof of principle for the use of fluoroscopy combined with machine-learning-based image analysis to noninvasively monitor bladder function in awake animals, which reveals the significant impact of suprapubic catheterization on functional bladder capacity (BC).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Machine-learning-based analysis of fluoroscopic images of the LUT</title><p>We combined classic cystometry with fluoroscopy-based imaging to study LUT function in awake, unrestrained mice. In previous work, we had established two methods to determine bladder volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>ves</sub>) from fluoroscopic images. The first method, which is based on the linear relation between background-corrected opacity and volume of contrast-filled bladders, is only applicable to recordings with a stable background, that is in anesthetized or otherwise immobile animals. The second method, which is based on the approximation of the bladder as a spheroid, depends on the delineation of the bladder wall but does not require background subtraction, making it, in principle, suitable to determine bladder volume from images of moving mice. However, considering that our videocystometry experiments lasted up to 3 hr, at a sampling rate of 30 images/s, manual delineation of the bladder wall in these large sets of time-lapse fluoroscopic images was impossible. We therefore developed a machine-learning protocol to automatically identify the bladder border in fluoroscopy images, independent of the position or posture of the mouse or the degree of bladder filling. To achieve this, we performed several cycles of training of a neural network using a set of human-annotated fluoroscopy images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A machine-learning protocol for the automated annotation of the bladder in fluoroscopic images.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image analysis protocol using artificial intelligence-based automatic annotation of the bladder border.

Also shown in are the time courses of bladder volume that would be calculated when using a rolling average with the indicated number of frames (<italic>N</italic>).

As expected, further increasing the number of images for averaging (30 or 60 frames) leads to a gradual broadening of the void, associated with a shift and decrease of the voiding peak. Note that this simulation was done for a void with a short duration (<italic>t</italic><sub>20–80</sub> = 1.2 s), comparable to the results obtained in catheterized mice.

During efficient voids, the lowest volume at which the bladder was successfully detected by the machine-learning protocol was 4.1 ± 2.2 µl (<italic>n</italic> = 15 voids from 3 animals). We calculated the Dice similarity index (DISI; see Materials and methods) to benchmark the performance of the neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dice, 1945</xref>). This analysis yielded a median DISI value of 0.95 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 0.92 ± 0.13), indicating overall excellent agreement between human annotation and network prediction. We therefore used this approach to determine time-dependent changes in bladder volume based on the spheroid approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), along with other volume-related voiding parameters: BC, residual volume (RV), and voiding efficiency (<italic>E</italic><sub>voiding</sub>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franken et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dose-dependent effect of urethane anesthesia on voiding function</title><p>Next, we used this approach to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of urethane, the most predominantly used anesthetic during in vivo cystometry in rodents, on LUT function. Urethane was administered at four time points, leading to a stepwise increase of the total dose from 0 to 1.2 g/kg bodyweight, the latter being the typical dose used in most rodent studies. This protocol caused the animals to gradually transit from a nonanesthetized state, where they could freely move within the boundaries of the recording box, to a fully anesthetized, largely immobile state. Before dosing and after each urethane administration, videocystometry was performed during 40 min (<italic>n</italic> = 5), resulting in 200-min-long recordings. These encompass approximately 360,000 time-lapse fluoroscopy images per experiment, from which we derived time-dependent changes in volume and the various volume-related parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Urethane did not have a statistically significant effect on BC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but exhibited a pronounced and dose-dependent effect on RV and <italic>E</italic><sub>voiding</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Indeed, whereas awake animals completely emptied their bladder at each void, urethane at doses &gt;0.3 g/kg caused a dose-dependent increase in the volume that remained after each void and a corresponding decrease in <italic>E</italic><sub>voiding</sub> from ~100% to below 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The intercontractile interval (ICI) decreased concomitantly with the reduced efficiency of voiding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Note that animals that were immediately treated with a single 1.2 g/kg-dose yielded similar values for BC, RV, and <italic>E</italic><sub>voiding</sub> as animals that reached this dose at the end of the stepwise dosing protocol, indicating that the reduced voiding efficiency and increased RV are due to the urethane rather than to fatigue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, blue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franken et al., 2021</xref>).

These findings demonstrate that incomplete bladder emptying at higher urethane doses is the result of both shorter void duration and reduced flow rate of urine expulsion from the bladder during a void.

Taken together, these findings reveal that urethane has a profound and dose-dependent effect on voiding efficiency, which can be attributed to a reduction in the extent and duration of urethral relaxation.

The impact of this invasive intervention on bladder function is poorly understood. We adapted our fluoroscopy-based approach to monitoring bladder volume in a noninvasive manner in awake, unrestrained animals. Injection of a bolus of contrast solution subcutaneously in the scruff region resulted in the excretion of iodine-containing urine, enabling fluoroscopy-based imaging of the bladder without catheter implantation. In this setting, the filling rate of the bladder is solely determined by the renal urine output, which we accelerated within a physiologically acceptable range using a diuretic. Animals were imaged during 120 min, during which voids occurred spontaneously at a rate of 1–2 voids per hour, and the machine-learning protocol was used to automatically detect the bladder border. In these experiments, we measured an average filling rate of 7.3 ± 2.8 μl/min (mean ± SD). This approach, fluoroscopic volumetry, allowed for the first time to accurately and continuously quantify volume- and flow-related parameters noninvasively in awake and behaving animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), albeit without concomitant pressure measurement.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Noninvasive fluoroscopic volumetry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluoroscopic image showing the presence of a contrast agent in the scruff (arrow) and in the bladder of an awake and nonrestrained mouse, as well as the automatic annotation of the bladder border.

Like in the catheterized animals, we detected complete voiding in the awake animals, whereas anesthetized animals had substantial RV, corresponding to a voiding efficiency of ~60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). In comparison with catheterized animals, both the maximal UFR and the void duration were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>).

Dysregulation of these processes can lead to a plethora of bothersome LUT disorders, for which current treatments are often unsatisfactory. Rodents are widely used in preclinical research aimed at understanding the (patho)physiology of the LUT and at the development of novel treatments. However, the current state-of-the-art methods and approaches to study bladder function in rodents have various drawbacks, which may affect interpretation and compromise translation of the findings to the human situation. For instance, the gold standard technique in the assessment of LUT function in rodents, cystometry, requires the surgical implantation of a catheter through the bladder wall – the consequences of this invasive technique on bladder sensitivity and storage capacity are poorly understood. Moreover, invasive techniques such as cystometry and UEM are generally performed on anesthetized or physically restrained mice, which may substantially affect LUT function. Existing noninvasive techniques in awake, freely moving rodents, which depend on the detection of voided urine on filter paper or balances, lack detailed temporal resolution and deliver only limited information on the voiding process. Finally, none of these techniques provides precise and continuous measurements of the bladder volume.</p><p>Recently, we introduced videocystometry, combining cystometry with high-speed fluoroscopy imaging of the contrast-filled bladder. We established that bladder volume and urethral flow can be accurately derived from fluoroscopic images, based either on image opacity after background correction or on precise annotation of the bladder border. In awake and nonrestrained animals, determination of bladder volume based on image opacity is not feasible due to the continuously changing background of the behaving animal. Manual annotation of the bladder border is unworkable for typical hours-long imaging sessions at 30 images per second, yielding several &gt;300,000 images per experiment. In this study, we have overcome this limitation by developing and successfully implementing a machine-learning protocol, which allowed the automated identification of the bladder border and derived volumetric parameters from large sets of time-lapse images in awake, behaving mice.</p><p>Next, we used the machine learning-assisted fluoroscopy to quantify the effect of anesthesia on LUT function. Urethane, which can be administered subcutaneously, intraperitoneal, or intravenously, is the most commonly used anesthetic in LUT research, preferred above other anesthetics that are known to suppress the micturition reflex or that create a less stable anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Field and Lang, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Matsuura and Downie, 2000</xref>). Despite its broad use in preclinical LUT research, the mechanism of action of urethane is not clearly understood, and the impact on LUT physiology remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Matsuura and Downie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Maggi and Meli, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cannon and Damaser, 2001</xref>). We performed videocystometry in mice implanted with a suprapubic catheter, where we started the recording in awake animals and monitored changes in bladder function upon stepwise increases in urethane dose up to a final 1.2 g/kg, which is a standard dose in LUT research. Urethane did not affect intravesical peak pressure during voiding, but dose-dependently suppressed nonvoiding contractions, in line with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, urethane caused a strong and dose-dependent reduction of the voiding efficiency. Indeed, whereas in the awake animals, the bladder was completely emptied at every void, RV increased with mounting doses of urethane, causing voiding efficiency to decrease to around 50% at the highest dose. As these findings conform to previously published data on bladder volume and voiding efficiency in urethane-anesthetized mice, the suppressive effect of urethane on voiding cannot be attributed to gradual fatigue of the detrusor muscle in the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franken et al., 2021</xref>). Detailed analysis of individual voids allowed us to attribute the reduction in voiding efficiency to both shorter void durations and a reduction in maximal UFC. These results indicate that urethane reduces the duration and extent of urethral relaxation during a void, leading to a pronounced reduction in voiding efficiency. Throughout these experiments, we observed that animals receiving the lowest dose of urethane (0.3 g/kg) were awake and behaving, but displayed a more tranquil behavior than nonanesthetized animals. Likewise, both pressure and volume data showed less artifacts in these animals treated with 0.3 g/kg, and there was a trend – albeit not statistically significant – for larger BC, longer ICI, and increased UFR and UFC when compared to nonanesthetized animals. Possibly, the analgesia provided by this low dose of urethane may reduce bladder pain caused by the surgical catheter implantation, thereby improving bladder function. Therefore, the use of urethane at a dose of 0.3 g/kg may be considered a good compromise between experimental/analytical ease and physiological conditions.</p><p>In order to measure bladder function in a noninvasive manner, we developed fluoroscopic volumetry, whereby subcutaneously administered contrast allowed fluoroscopic imaging of the bladder and monitoring of bladder volume during physiological filling, eliminating the need of catheter implantation. In line with the findings in the catheterized animals, we observed complete voiding in awake animals and a strong reduction of the voiding efficiency after urethane anesthesia. Notably, we also found a striking, fourfold larger BC when compared to mice undergoing videocystometry acutely after surgical implantation of the catheter, both in awake and anesthetized animals. Concurrent with the larger bladder capacities, we also measured a larger voided volume during individual voids in the noncatheterized animals, which we could attribute to longer void durations and larger peak UFRs. Surprisingly, whereas urethane caused a shortening of the void duration in catheterized animals, it lead to longer voids in the nonoperated animals – future research is warranted to elucidate the origin of this differential effect.</p><p>The above findings indicate that the use of a surgically implanted suprapubic catheter to infuse the mouse bladder has by itself a dramatic effect on bladder function. Several mechanisms may contribute to the fourfold reduced BC. First, the implantation of a catheter into the bladder dome and fixation using a purse-string suture inevitably leads to a reduction of the area of the bladder wall and thus the bladder volume. However, since the affected surface generally does not exceed 10% of the bladder wall, this surface reduction may only explain a small part (&lt;20%) of the capacity reduction. Second, the surgical implantation will inevitably induce local bladder irritation and inflammation, which may contribute to the observed reduction in BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boudes et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas we performed our measurements within hours following surgery, earlier studies have used a 7-day recovery period in between surgery and cystometry to reduce the influence of inflammation on bladder function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Yao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mann-Gow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cornelissen et al., 2008</xref>). Notwithstanding the introduction of recovery period, these studies report voided volumes in the range of 50–140 μl for adult C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Yao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mann-Gow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cornelissen et al., 2008</xref>), similar to the values we obtained acutely after surgery, and substantially lower than the mean voided volume of 380 μl in the awake, noncatheterized animals. Lastly, in the fluoroscopic volumetry experiments on furosemide-treated mice we measured a filling rate of ~7 µl/min, which is lower than the 20 μl/min that we used in the videocystometry experiments, but higher than physiological rate of urine production in freely behaving mice of ~1–2 µl/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meneton et al., 2000</xref>). Further research is needed to establish the influence of the bladder filling rate on voiding behavior. These findings raise an important caveat when interpreting (video)cystometric results and highlight the usefulness of fluoroscopic volumetry to study bladder function noninvasively, albeit at the expense of intravesical pressure recordings.</p><p>In conclusion, we have combined fluoroscopy with a machine learning-assisted analysis method to monitor the function of the LUT at high temporal resolution in mice, thereby providing a powerful approach for the noninvasive study of bladder function in awake, behaving mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Janvier</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">12- to 16-week-old females</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Isoflurane</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dechra veterinary products</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Iso-vet</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anesthesia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Carprofen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zoetis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rimadyl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Analgesia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Surgical skin glue</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vygon</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Iomeprol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bracco Imaging Europe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Iomeron 250</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Contrast agent</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Iodixanol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GE Healthcare</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Visipaque 320 mg I/ml</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Contrast agent</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Urethane</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anesthesia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Furosemide</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sanofi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lasix</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Diuretic</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ/FIJI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Welcome74">NIH</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Image processing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Igor Pro</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wavemetrics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Data processing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origin 9.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Originlab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014212">SCR_014212</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Data processing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NIS-Elements; NIS.ai</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nikon</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014329">SCR_014329</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Image processing</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were conducted on 12- to 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Janvier).

In short, a PE-50 catheter was implanted into the bladder dome of five female mice through an abdominal midline incision while under 2% isoflurane anesthesia (Iso-vet, Dechra veterinary products, Bladel, The Netherlands). At the start of surgery, the anesthetized animals received carprofen (5 mg/kg bodyweight; Zoetis, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) diluted in NaCl 0.9% by SC injection to achieve analgesia during videocystometry. At the end of surgery, the implanted catheter was tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the scruff. At the point of exteriorization, the catheter was secured to the skin using surgical skin glue (Derma+flex, Vygon, Brussels, Belgium), to prevent dislocation. After the animals recovered from surgery, they were placed in a small radiolucent container (4 cm × 3 cm × 7 cm) in which the animals were not restrained. Next, the container was placed in an X-ray-based small animal fluoroscopy system (LabScopeTM, Glenbrook Technologies, New Jersey, USA), and the PE-50 catheter was connected to a pressure sensor and to an infusion pump through a three-way stopcock.

We trained this neural network using a set of manually annotated fluoroscopy images in which the contrast-filled bladder was imaged from various angles and at different stages of the filling/voiding cycle. The neural network was then applied to identify the bladder in similar but different datasets. It was repeatedly retrained using images where the bladder was not properly identified until satisfactory identification of the bladder border was achieved in all experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The neural network was then used to generate an image sequence with an overlay tracing the bladder border, used for quantifying the long and short axes of the bladder and the bladder area, for large sets of time-lapse fluoroscopy images.</p><p>To benchmark the performance of the neural network, 20% of the ground truth annotations were kept aside, as described in the BIAFLOWS collaborative framework for quality control of object segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Rubens et al., 2020</xref>), and used to calculate the DISI:<disp-formula id="equ2">,<mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>∩</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>X</italic> is the area of the ground truth binary mask, <italic>Y</italic> the area of the prediction binary mask, and <italic>X</italic>∩<italic>Y</italic> the area of overlap between the ground truth and prediction masks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dice, 1945</xref>).</p><p>To comply with recent publications on AI reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Walsh et al., 2021</xref>), the trained neural network, the user manual, the training dataset, and the annotations can be found here (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6004234">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6004234</ext-link>). As the network will only be usable from within NIS, with our training data and the annotations (.nd2 file) researchers can apply a similar strategy to detect the bladder in awake mice using a comparable imaging setup providing similar quality images. The user manual describes in detail the requirements and workflow on how the different scripts can be opened and implemented in NIS-Elements.</p><p>From the time course of <italic>V</italic><sub>ves</sub>, we determined a set of parameters related to volume alterations during urine storage and voiding (BC, RV, and <italic>E</italic><sub>voiding</sub>) and to urine flow during voiding (UFR and UFC), as established earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franken et al., 2021</xref>), with an additional Savitzky–Golay digital filter applied to <italic>V</italic><sub>ves</sub> for data smoothing before differentiation to calculate UFR. As a measure of void duration, we determined <italic>t</italic><sub>20–80</sub>, which represents the interval between the time points at which the bladder volume was reduced by 20% and 80% of the total void volume.</p><p>Raw data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> are available via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19826050.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19826050.v1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis and graphing were performed in OriginPro 9.0 (Originlab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess normality of the data. Paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance were used for analysis of the data. Except where indicated otherwise, all summary data are reported as mean ± standard error. The sample sizes were calculated based on our earlier work, which yielded that a sample size of four to five animals was sufficient to detect a 40% change in key parameters such as <italic>E</italic><sub>voiding</sub> and UFR<sub>max</sub> with a power of 80% and a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. Animals were randomly assigned to each experimental condition. All measurements were performed on distinct animals; no animals were used in multiple experiments. Analysis was performed automatically, eliminating the need for blinding.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Ruggieri (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Upon addressing the essential revisions and the reviewer's concerns we would recommend this manuscript to be a &quot;Short Report&quot; type of article for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important finding in this manuscript is that the bladder capacity is drastically reduced in catheterized animals, both in awake and anaesthetized conditions. It is unclear however if this ~4 fold reduction is (mostly) due to acute injury/ inflammation as a result of the bladder catheter implantation surgery or of catheterization in general.</p><p>Furthermore, cystometry in awake animals often involves animals having the catheter tunneled subcutaneously, exteriorized (into a harness for easy-access) to be connected to an infusion system. Most researchers performing awake cystometry allow up to 7 days before starting the recordings.</p><p>– To support your claim that bladder capacity is affected by catheterization rather than due to catheter implantation surgery: can you either (i) evaluate the bladder capacity, with catheter implanted, at a time that the animal is recovered from the surgery and any injury/ inflammation has subsided (see reviewer #2 comments)? Or (ii) incorporate the word 'acutely' in this sentence? &quot;Bladder capacity was decreased ~4-fold when cystometry was performed acutely after surgery, in awake and anaesthetized mice&quot;.</p><p>Also, we would like to request additional details to the description of how the PE50 tubing implanted into the bladder exited the animal for allowing freedom of movement (in the awake un-restrained catheterized condition).</p><p>2) The ai training process and the use of the neural network would benefit from more description:</p><p>– &quot;The neural network was repeatedly retrained until satisfactory identification of the bladder was achieved&quot;: Please provide some statistics about the accuracy and failure rate of bladder identification.</p><p>– Can the software (as shared here) be readily used in NIS Elements or other commercially available environments, or does the machine learning algorithm have to be set up freshly in any lab through the use of the Nikon ai Suite?</p><p>– Could you address and incorporate into the manuscript the machine learning-related questions of the reviewers?</p><p>3) Please revise text, Figures and Figure legends in line with reviewer's recommendations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Page 5 bottom – second paragraph of results: Suggest restating the criteria used to define a successful identification of the bladder border such as: &quot;The machine-learning protocol was able to successfully identify the bladder border compared to manual bladder wall delineation in timelapse image sequences, irrespective…&quot;</p><p>Throughout the manuscript the term &quot;catheterization&quot; is used which many may confuse with urethral catheterization and this was not done to these mice.

Figure 1BandC: suggest using a higher contrast color for the identified bladder border such as white or bright yellow as opposed to the blue color used in the figure.</p><p>Figure 2C-F: Suggest stating what the blue horizontal line indicate or removing these lines.</p><p>Figure 2 legend: suggest changing the first line to &quot;Short excerpts of simultaneous bladder volume and intravesical pressure recordings traces at increasing cumulative doses of urethane in suprapubic catheter implanted animals.&quot;</p><p>Figure 3A: Because urethral flow conductance is defined by the authors as urethral flow divided by intravesical pressure, suggest including an additional row of graphs between the PVES and UFC rows for urethral flow rate alone (UFR (ml/s)) so the readers may better understand this novel measure of urethral flow mechanics.</p><p>Figure 3B: The description of these &quot;2D/3D&quot; graphs is confusing. Suggest including labels for each of the axes. If only 100 seconds of time is displayed on the horizontal axes of each of these graphs, and pressure is on the vertical axes then it seems that neither the color scale nor the third axes of the 3D plots are necessary and only cause confusion. The legend for figure 3B is also confusing. The statement &quot;Each row represents the pressure during one individual void.&quot; is unclear because there is only one row of 2D/3D graphs in figure 3B. Suggest changing the legend to something like &quot;Representative pressure plots from an individual animal showing 100 seconds of pressure recordings aligned to a voiding contraction at 80 seconds.&quot;</p><p>Figure 3D: It seems that this is the maximal urethral flow rate and if so, the vertical axis label needs to be changed to &quot;UFR max (ml/s)&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is an excellent approach to not instrument the mice and yet get the functional data of the bladder dynamics. It is a breakthrough in the field. The dramatically larger BC in non-catheterized mice bladder compared to catheterized bladder can be a cause for concern for many researchers who perform cystometry. It is of particular interest to note that the BC of awake catheterized mice is same as that of a full dose urethane supplemented, catheterized mice. The authors have given various hypothesis as to why this would happen. One of the hypotheses relates to supraphysiological-filling rate which might reduce bladder capacity as was shown previously (ref, 10); However, BC was not measured in reference 10, sentence needs to be corrected.</p><p>Since in vivo cystometry in awake rodents (implanted bladder catheter) is widely practiced, it begs the important question, as to why does catheterization affect the functional bladder parameters. Is bladder injury the main cause of the decreases in bladder metrics? The authors have mentioned, bladder inflammation may be a primary factor in decreasing the BC. Since one of the important conclusions of the manuscript is the ~ 4 fold reduction of BC in mice that were catheterized, compared to non-catheterized, I believe it is important to address this issue, as it would give clarity on use of catheter for researchers in the field of urology.</p><p>To address if it is the bladder injury/ inflammation or the mere presence of a catheter that is the cause of reduced BC, the authors could perform a sham surgery where a catheter is inserted into bladder as was done in the catheterized mice, but catheter is immediately removed after insertion into bladder and puncture is sutured. This would give insight into effect of bladder injury on BC.</p><p>To check if the presence of the catheter is cause of reduced BC, the catheter could be implanted in the bladder as was done previously, let the animal recover for about 6-7 days and then perform videocystometry. The catheter can be tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized around the neck area. Any bladder injury or inflammation should be healed by that time. Another option is to implant the catheter, seal the open end of the catheter outside the bladder and leave it in the subcutaneous space. Then after a 6-7 day recovery perform the same experiments as was done for mice without catheter.</p><p>It was shown that bladder inflammation subsides within a week after implantation of the catheter (refs URL: https://www.jove.com/video/55588 and Yao et al., Front Neuroscience. 2019 Jun 25;13:663).</p><p>Urethane and reduced voiding efficiency: Authors attribute reduced voiding efficient to shorted voiding duration and reduction in maximal UFC. Since UFC is urine flow rate/ unit pressure, it would suggest that UFC decreased, either due to an increase in resistance along the urine flow path or that the muscle contraction is weak. Further, it's unclear how shortened voiding duration per se would affect voiding efficiency since voiding efficiency does not involve time. Perhaps the authors meant to say incomplete or partial voiding leads to a short void duration and therefore decreased voiding efficiency.</p><p>In figure 3., although void duration decreases as urethane dose is increased, UFR and UFC increases at 0.3 g/kg urethane. Would authors like to comment on it?</p><p>How many times did the non-catheterized mice void during the 40 minutes of recording when the contrast agent was delivered in the neck region?</p><p>Questions about AI:</p><p>1. &quot;AI was trained until satisfactory identification of the bladder was achieved&quot; – can the authors give some statistics about the accuracy and failure rate of bladder identification.</p><p>2. After a void when the bladder is almost empty AI cannot recognize the bladder border. Therefore, from what point of bladder filling does AI start to reliably draw the bladder contours? Similarly, during a void, till what percentage of bladder volume does it reliably draw the bladder outlines?</p><p>3. With a camera frame rate of 30, FPS and a void duration of 1-2 seconds, would smoothing using rolling average of 15 frames, lead to loss to temporal resolution or a shift in time of peak pressure?</p><p>4. The manuscript mentions &quot;we provide the trained neural network for other researchers, including a description on how to use it in within the NIS environment (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6004234). We also provide the training data and the annotations, such that researchers can apply a similar strategy to detect the bladder in awake mice using a comparable imaging setup providing similar quality images (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6004234).&quot;</p><p>The figshare site shows some files containing data and software. Is the software independent or it has a dependency on having other programs from Nikon? Information on how to use or run it is unclear.</p><p>Figure 1. In the figure legend please indicate if these (B and C) are the awake or urethane anaesthetized mice. Panel B picture 3 of bladder shows significant residual volume, would that be urethane anaesthetized?</p><p>Figure 3. In figure legend, indicate that the mice are catheterized.</p><p>Figure 4. The legend mentions that urethane catheterized mice values taken from figure 2 and 3. However, the residual volume (RV) of urethane dosed mice (catheter, green dot) in figure 4E is &lt; 25 ul, whereas in figure 2D urethane dosed (catheter, blue) mice RV is ~ 60 ul.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79378.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important finding in this manuscript is that the bladder capacity is drastically reduced in catheterized animals, both in awake and anaesthetized conditions.

Reduced voiding efficiency can effectively be the result of a shortened void duration: if voiding stops before the bladder is emptied, the voiding efficiency will be reduced. Oppositely, if the void duration is unaltered but the urethral conductance/flow is reduced, there will be less urine expelled during the void, again leading to a reduced voiding efficiency. Here we see both, indicating that urethane affects the extent and duration of urethral relaxation. We have further clarified this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure 3., although void duration decreases as urethane dose is increased, UFR and UFC increases at 0.3 g/kg urethane.

We also provide the training data and the annotations, such that researchers can apply a similar strategy to detect the bladder in awake mice using a comparable imaging setup providing similar quality images (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6004234).&quot;</p><p>The figshare site shows some files containing data and software. Is the software independent or it has a dependency on having other programs from Nikon? Information on how to use or run it is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>These aspects have been clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1. In the figure legend please indicate if these (B and C) are the awake or urethane anaesthetized mice.
