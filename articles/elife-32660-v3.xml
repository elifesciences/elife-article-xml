Antibodies also simulate potent immune signalling from inside the cell via the cytosolic antibody receptor TRIM21, but how this is regulated is unknown. Here we show that TRIM21 signalling is constitutively repressed by its B-Box domain and activated by phosphorylation. The B-Box occupies an E2 binding site on the catalytic RING domain by mimicking E2-E3 interactions, inhibiting TRIM21 ubiquitination and preventing immune activation. TRIM21 is derepressed by IKKβ and TBK1 phosphorylation of an LxxIS motif in the RING domain, at the interface with the B-Box. Incorporation of phosphoserine or a phosphomimetic within this motif relieves B-Box inhibition, promoting E2 binding, RING catalysis, NF-κB activation and cytokine transcription upon infection with DNA or RNA viruses. These data explain how intracellular antibody signalling is regulated and reveal that the B-Box is a critical regulator of RING E3 ligase activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32660.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibodies are molecules made by the immune system that protect us from infections. They were discovered over 100 years ago, and for most of that time scientists thought they only worked in the bloodstream. Yet recent research showed that when a virus infects our cells it also carries antibodies in with it. Once inside the cell, a protein called TRIM21 recognises the antibody-covered virus and – together with other proteins called ubiquitin enzymes – targets it for destruction via the cell’s waste disposal system. At the same time TRIM21 sends a signal to the cell’s nucleus to activate certain genes that protect cells across the body from subsequent infection.</p><p>The genes activated by TRIM21 have potent antiviral activity. Yet they can also damage the body’s own tissues if they are switched on at the wrong time, which may lead to autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. It is thus critical that TRIM21 is carefully regulated and only activated during an infection, but it was not clear how this is achieved.</p><p>Dickson, Fletcher et al. now show that although TRIM21 is made all the time and is always ready to detect an incoming virus it is made in an inactive state. This is because part of TRIM21, called a B-Box, inhibits the protein’s own activity. This was an unexpected discovery because, although the B-Box domain is found in around 100 other human proteins, it was unclear what it did. Dickson, Fletcher et al. then combined structural biology and biochemical approaches to show that the B-Box mimics specific enzymes that work with TRIM21, and blocks them from binding to it. This keeps TRIM21 in an inactive state.</p><p>Next, Dickson, Fletcher et al. discovered that TRIM21 becomes active when a chemical tag, specifically a phosphate group, is added to the protein. This modification displaces the B-Box, allowing ubiquitin enzymes to bind to TRIM21 and switch on its activity. Further experiments then showed that this process helps regulate TRIM21 during infections with different viruses, including rhinovirus – the virus behind the common cold – and adenovirus – a common cause of respiratory infection.</p><p>Antibodies are now used to treat many medical conditions, but present technologies are based on our understanding of how antibodies work outside cells. By revealing the basis of antibody immunity inside cells, these new findings may lead to new treatments for a range of conditions. Future studies could also explore how failures in the TRIM21 system contribute to autoimmune diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Antibodies</kwd><kwd>Fc receptors</kwd><kwd>Virology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Fellowship APP1110116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickson</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105181010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neuhaus</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Leo C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105178934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neuhaus</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200594/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Leo C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation deactivates TRIM21 B Box autoinhibition to licence proinflammatory signalling by cytosolic antibodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies are an essential component of protective immunity and their induction is a major aim of vaccination. They mediate a sufficiently rapid inflammatory response upon pathogen re-exposure that infection is halted before host colonization can occur. However, the consequences of inappropriate antibody-induced inflammation are severe, including lethal cytokine storms, autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suntharalingam et al., 2006</xref>). It is therefore essential that antibody immunity is precisely regulated and tightly controlled. Antibody Fc receptors (FcRs) are essential for the diverse effector responses mediated by antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Woof and Burton, 2004</xref>). Classical FcRs are expressed on the surface of immune cells. Their signalling induces phagocytosis, antigen presentation, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), degranulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guilliams et al., 2014</xref>). Regulating FcR signalling controls the antibody response. FcR immune signalling is influenced at multiple levels by; varying cell type expression and abundance, balancing the activity of inhibitory vs activatory receptors, requiring receptor crosslinking, setting minimal activation thresholds and by synergising with other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vogelpoel et al., 2015</xref>). These diverse mechanisms, deciphered over many decades, operate individually and synergistically to precisely regulate extracellular antibody immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruhns and Jönsson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recent work from our lab has shown that, in addition to classical FcR immunity mediated at the cell-surface, antibodies exert potent immune function from inside cells via a unique cytosolic IgG receptor called TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">James, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mallery et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McEwan et al., 2013</xref>). TRIM21 is structurally, functionally and evolutionarily distinct from surface FcRs and binds antibodies with a significantly higher affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">James et al., 2007</xref>). TRIM21 is also distinct in being constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in most cell types and tissues. TRIM21 protects cells from pathogen infection by stimulating a dual effector and sensor response. Upon infection, antibody-coated pathogens are detected in the cytosol by TRIM21. TRIM21 recruits cellular degradation machinery, including the AAA ATPase VCP and the proteasome, resulting in the destruction of viral particles and neutralization of infection. TRIM21 simultaneously activates immune transcription pathways, including NF-κB, leading to potent upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, CXCL10, IL-6 and IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McEwan et al., 2013</xref>). TRIM21 activation results in cytokine upregulation in mice within hours of infection and is a significant component of the inflammatory response induced by protective antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watkinson et al., 2015</xref>). Deletion of TRIM21 compromises the efficiency of protective antibody immunity and causes virus-induced mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vaysburd et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to cell-surface FcRs, and despite its capacity for such rapid and potent inflammatory signalling, it is unclear exactly how TRIM21 is regulated. The regulatory mechanisms that exist for classical FcRs are not applicable to TRIM21. TRIM21 is not expressed at the cell surface and therefore cannot be activated by clustering in lipid rafts or employ this as a mechanism to discriminate monomeric IgG from immune complex. Furthermore, as TRIM21 is dimeric, it is capable of binding both heavy chains of a single IgG simultaneously and forming a 1:1 complex. This is in contrast to other FcRs, which bind asymmetrically to a single heavy chain. There is also no known complementary inhibitory receptor to TRIM21 as exist for surface FcRs. Finally, TRIM21 lacks the ITAM and ITIM motifs that drives the function of other FcRs, and whose signalling can be precisely regulated by recruitment of Src family kinases and inositol-lipid phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vogelpoel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>TRIM21 is a member of a large family of ~100 proteins with a common ‘tripartite motif’ architecture, comprising N-terminal RING, B-Box and coiled-coil domains. Instead of recruiting Src and Syk kinases, TRIM21 stimulates immune signaling via the activity of its RING domain, which catalyses the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains. TRIM21 first recruits the E2 Ube2W to modify itself with an N-terminal monoubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fletcher and James, 2016</xref>). This acts as a primer for the synthesis of an anchored K63-chain catalysed by the heterodimer Ube2N/2V2. TRIM21 is further modified with K48-ubiquitin chains, culminating in proteasomal recruitment. The 19S-resident proteasomal deubiquitinase Poh1 subsequently liberates K63 chains from TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fletcher and James, 2016</xref>), and these then activate signal transduction pathways via TBK1, TAB/TAK and NEMO. We therefore hypothesized that TRIM21 immune signaling must be regulated at the fundamental level of its ubiquitination activity.</p><p>Here we show that initiating ubiquitination is a key step in regulating TRIM21 activity and that a novel mechanism of autoinhibition and kinase-induced E2 enzyme recruitment controls its potent pro-inflammatory activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the regulation of TRIM21 we tested whether over-expression in the absence of antibody stimuli triggers NFκB. As a positive control, we compared its activity to that of TRIM5α, a related antiviral TRIM protein whose over-expression is sufficient to drive spontaneous NFκB signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pertel et al., 2011</xref>). While transfection of full-length TRIM5α caused dose-dependent activation of NFκB, full-length TRIM21 failed to activate NFκB at any dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When activated, both TRIM21 and TRIM5α autoubiquitinate, thereby making themselves a degradative substrate for the proteasome. Consistent with the NFκB result, while endogenous TRIM5α underwent rapid recycling we found little evidence of TRIM21 turnover even after several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together these observations suggest either that TRIM21 is constitutively inactive and its ubiquitination activity tightly regulated or it is a less active E3 ligase than TRIM5α. However, comparing the ubiquitination activity of TRIM5α and TRIM21 isolated RING domains (T5-R or T21-R) in vitro revealed that TRIM21 was the more active E3, capable of forming ubiquitin chains within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). RING dimerization via higher order assembly is the proposed mechanism by which TRIMs autoregulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>). TRIM5α self-assembles and mutations that disrupt RING dimerization inhibit catalytic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore introduced structurally corresponding mutations into TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) to test whether RING dimerisation is required for activity. SEC MALS and AUC demonstrated that while the wild-type RING is in monomer-dimer equilibrium, mutants M10E and M10E/M72E do not undergo detectable dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). However, both mutants remained active and could catalyse unanchored K63 chain synthesis, Ube2W-primed anchored K63 chain extension and ubiquitin discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>), albeit less efficiently than wild-type. These results demonstrate that a pre-formed TRIM21 RING dimer is not a pre-requisite for ubiquitination activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32660.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRIM21 NFκB signalling is constitutively silent despite monomeric RING K63 chain synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TRIM5α (T5) but not TRIM21 (T21) overexpression in 293Ts activates an NFκB-luciferase reporter.

Instead, dimerization of RING E3s is thought to be needed for additional contacts with the E2-charged ubiquitin. Mutations in the partner RING at this interface reduce TRIM25 catalytic activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>). Equivalent mutations in TRIM21 had no impact on ubiquitination, confirming that RING dimerization is not an intrinsic requirement for TRIM21 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). The mutation E10R reduces ubiquitination by TRIM25, possibly by disrupting a hydrogen bond with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koliopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). We hypothesised that the corresponding glutamate (E13) in TRIM21 may allow a monomeric RING to contact both E2 and bound ubiquitin simultaneously, obviating the requirement for dimerization. Consistent with this hypothesis, E13R reduced TRIM21 catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together these data show that the monomeric TRIM21 RING is a highly active E3. Thus, the lack of constitutive TRIM21 NFκB activity must be the result of tight regulation, independent of higher order oligomerisation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32660.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TRIM21 RING dimerization is not required to catalyse ubiquitin release from E2:Ub.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of the TRIM25 RING:Ube2N:Ub complex (5EYA), showing interactions between ubiquitin and both RING monomers.

Comparing the activities of RING, RING-Box and MiniTRIM21 proteins (based on a monovalent MiniTRIM5 that preserves the Box-coiled coil interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>)), revealed that the presence of the B-Box significantly reduces ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is due to direct inhibition of catalytic activity, as the B-Box prevented ubiquitin discharge from either Ube2D1 or Ube2N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To understand how the B-Box modulates TRIM21 catalysis we solved a 2 Å crystal structure of the RING-Box protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Surprisingly, this revealed that the B-Box occupies the E2 binding site on the RING domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Comparison to the TRIM5α RING:E2 complex shows that the B-Box is located where helix 1 of the E2 would normally be positioned during RING binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Crucially, the B-Box is able to occupy the E2 binding site on the RING by acting as an E2 mimic, forming similar electrostatic interactions. The RING surface contains a negatively charged patch, which is complementary to a strongly positively charged patch on both the E2 and the B-Box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In particular, Box-RING interaction is stabilized through a salt bridge between residues R118 and E12, which is analogous to the interaction between E2 residue R14 and RING residue E11 in the TRIM5:Ube2N structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To test directly whether the B-Box prevents E2 binding we assigned <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of monomeric (M10E) RING and RING-Box constructs and measured chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) upon titration with Ube2N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Titration of Ube2N into the RING resulted in significant CSPs in E2 interface residues (denoted by the green shaded regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, no evidence of Ube2N binding to the RING-Box was observed. Taken together, these data suggest that the B-Box may be an autoinhibitory domain whose function is to regulate RING activity by preventing E2 recruitment.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32660.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The Box is an autoinhibitory domain which supresses E3 ligase activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Catalysis of Ube2N/Ube2V2 driven polyubiquitin-chain synthesis by T21 RING (<bold>R</bold>), RING-Box (RB) and MiniTRIM21 (MT).

To ensure that IKKβ was acting directly rather than inducing the expression of a second kinase via NFκB, we repeated the experiment in the presence of proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, which inhibits the degradation of IκBα and blocks NFκB activation. Efficient IKKβ phosphorylation of TRIM21 was observed even under conditions where NFκB signaling was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

There were also changes in residues at the base of helix 2, within the linker and on B-Box residues that contact the RING. This is consistent with restoration of E2 binding and the stabilization of an active conformation in which the B-Box domain is displaced. To further demonstrate B-Box displacement, we compared the dynamics of wild-type and S80E proteins. The {<sup>1</sup>H}<sup>15</sup>N NOE ratios reveal that the most dynamic region is the linker (residues 83–102) between the RING and B-Box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This is in agreement with the higher temperature factors observed for these residues in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

TRIM21 activates immune transduction pathways upon sensing an antibody-coated pathogen by synthesizing K63-ubiquitin chains. Controlling synthesis of these chains allows TRIM21 signalling to be regulated at the fundamental level. Here we have shown that this is accomplished by keeping TRIM21 in a constitutively silent state through an autoinhibitory mechanism that blocks E2 enzyme recruitment. Autoinhibition is mediated by the B-Box, providing a function for this ubiquitous but hitherto enigmatic TRIM protein domain. The B-Box inhibits E2 recruitment by acting as an E2 mimic and competing for RING binding. We also show that TRIM21 contains a variant of an IKKβ and TBK1 phosphorylation motif and is phosphorylated at residue S80. Phosphorylation of S80 or its replacement by a phosphomimetic displaces the B-Box, allowing E2 recruitment and potentiating TRIM21 ubiquitination activity, NF-κB signalling and cytokine transcription upon infection with DNA or RNA viruses.</p><p>Although TRIM21 regulation is seemingly distinct from that of cell-surface FcRs, parallels exist. For instance, signalling by both types of antibody receptor involves regulation by kinases. In the case of TRIM21, this involves a <italic>p</italic>LxxIS motif (where <italic>p</italic> is hydrophilic) and the kinases IKKβ and TBK1 while in other FcRs this involves an YxxL/I motif and recruitment of Src kinases. Importantly, it is not clear for either receptor type exactly how kinase activation occurs. For surface FcRs, this is thought to involve receptor clustering via cross-linking but why this causes Src recruitment and activation is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 1992</xref>). TRIM21 may also undergo clustering, via cross-linking or higher order assembly, when it is recruited to opsonized pathogens. This may provide a basal activity that is amplified by kinase phosphorylation. The co-option of IKKβ and TBK1 as amplifying kinases suggests that TRIM21 could participate in its own positive-feedback loop. Again there are parallels to surface FcRs, where tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to promote receptor clustering, which promotes phosphorylation and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobota et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Both types of Fc receptor also synergise with other PRRs and immune signalling pathways to amplify and diversify the resulting inflammatory response. Surface FcRs are known to exhibit cross-talk with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), greatly amplifying the production of cytokines such as TNFα during phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">den Dunnen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vogelpoel et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, TRIM21 has been shown to synergise with cytosolic nucleic acid receptors such as RIG-I and cGAS, resulting in pathogen-specific responses and multiple signalling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watkinson et al., 2015</xref>). Whether there is direct collaboration between TRIM21 and surface FcRs is currently unknown and will be important to determine in future work. Both immune signalling and antigen processing functions of TRIM21 are well placed to synergise with FcR immune complex capture and sorting activities, for instance to promote class I presentation. Precedence exists in the form of collaboration between FcRn and surface FcRs to drive antigen processing by dendritic cells (DCs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qiao et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>TRIM21 belongs to a large family of structurally related proteins, many of which have known roles in cell signalling. They include other proteins with roles in immune signalling, such as the antiretroviral TRIM5(<italic>14</italic>) and RIG-I activator TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gack et al., 2007</xref>). While progress has been made in understanding the structure and function of TRIMs, it is still unclear how TRIM proteins are activated and regulated. Existing models of activation were solely based on substrate-induced aggregation or higher order assembly. This was thought to be necessary for dimerization of the RING domains located at either end of the molecule, which was assumed to be a pre-requisite for ubiquitination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koliopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). However, our data show that this is not the case for TRIM21, and so cannot be assumed for other members of the TRIM family. Furthermore, higher order assembly alone does not explain the discrepancy between in vitro and cellular TRIM ubiquitination activity. TRIM RINGs, including those of TRIM5, 25 and 32, are active in vitro at concentrations where they are monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yudina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koliopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). Given that TRIMs are not constitutively active in cells, there must be another level of regulation. It has been proposed that binding of a ubiquitin-conjugated E2 may drive RING equilibrium towards the dimeric form, explaining the in vitro activity. However, this would not explain the absence of activity in cells where the same phenomenon would occur. Moreover, if E2-Ub can drive TRIM RING dimerization then a pre-existing dimer is by definition no longer a pre-requisite for function and higher order assembly cannot be the sole regulator. It seems likely that the activation and regulation of TRIMs is a complex process that is regulated at multiple levels. This is exemplified by TRIM21 whose neutralization and signalling functions are both mediated by ubiquitination, but only signalling requires release of B-Box inhibition. Previously we have observed that TRIM21 signalling has a distinct threshold whereas neutralization takes place at very low antibody occupancy (&lt;2 antibodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>) and under conditions of sub-optimal TRIM21:antibody and antibody:antigen kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bottermann et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, basal activity via higher order assembly may be sufficient for neutralization but not signalling. Strict regulation of signalling is intuitive, as it ensures a proportional response and avoids inappropriate triggering. Setting activation thresholds and regulating signalling may mitigate against any endosomal leakage of antibodies into the cytosol. The activation of TRIM21 by leaked immune complexes in lysosome-maturation-defective macrophages of lupus-prone mice illustrates the consequences of such an event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monteith et al., 2016</xref>). However, while the requirement for tight regulation of TRIM21 signalling is intuitive the mechanism behind this has remained elusive. Our data suggest that it is achieved by a novel autoinhibitory mechanism in which the B-Box domain prevents ubiquitination by acting as an E2 mimic and the kinases IKKβ and TBK1 promote ubiquitination by phosphorylating the RING to relieve B-Box inhibition. Use of innate immune kinases intimately associates TRIM21 with the antiviral state not only at the level of gene expression as an ISG but also post translationally and in a similar manner to key immune adaptors MAVS, STING and TRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>Ube1, Ube2N, Ube2V2, Ube2D1, TRIM21<sup>RING-Box</sup> (residues 1–129) were produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Intracellular antibody signalling is regulated by IKK phosphorylation of the Fc receptor TRIM21&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>TRIM21 is a unique cytosolic IgG receptor that detects antibody-coated pathogens in the cytosol. Detection of pathogen-antibody complex by TRIM21 drives two distinct events; 1) TRIM21 drives degradation of the pathogen-antibody complex by recruiting the VCP/p97 and proteasome, 2) TRIM21 activates innate immune signaling by generating unanchored K63-linked chains.</p><p>Here, the authors revealed one of the regulatory mechanisms of TRIM21 ubiquitin ligase activity that leads to the generation of K63 chains. Ligase activity of TRIM21 is constitutively auto-inhibited by its B-box domain. The authors showed that B-box binds to its RING domain and inhibits E2 recruitment by using crystal structure and NMR analysis. The authors also show that phosphorylation at S80 in the RING domain by IKK disrupts the B-box-RING binding and releases B-box inhibition to activate its ubiquitin ligase activity.</p><p>This finding is important for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of TRIM family ubiquitin ligase, and this study is generally and technically well performed and includes appropriate controls. However, two issues should be addressed:</p><p>1) In regard to TBK1, whether TBK1 can also phosphorylate TRIM21 or not;</p><p>2) Whether physiological stimulation can induce phosphorylation of TRIM21 or not.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In Figure 5, the authors detected the phosphorylation of S80 by IKK overexpression. It would be valuable to learn whether S80 is or is not phosphorylated in physiological conditions. It is well known that IKK is activated by various stimuli such as TNF-, IL-1, LPS. When IKK is activated by such a cytokine, can phosphorylation of S80 be detected? If so, is TRIM21 involved in the enhancement of cytokine stimulation? Moreover, S in the <italic>p</italic>LxIS motif is also phosphorylated by TBK1 (Liu et al., 2015). It is of great interest to know whether or not S80 is also phosphorylated by TBK1 in overexpression vs. more physiological settings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32660.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] This finding is important for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of TRIM family ubiquitin ligase, and this study is generally and technically well performed and includes appropriate controls.

We chose poly(I:C) as our stimulating ligand rather than LPS because 293T cells lack the LPS receptor TLR4. In all three separate experiments, we observed an increase in TRIM21 phosphorylation (Figure 6C-E). TRIM21 is not constitutively required to enhance cytokine stimulation during immune stimulation, as we have shown in Watkinson et al., 2015, but preventing S80 phosphorylation does inhibit TNF induction by TRIM21 during infection in the presence of antibody (present manuscript, Figure 8C). In addition to this data, we have performed experiments to show that TBK1 phosphorylates TRIM21 both in vitro and in cells (Figure 6A-B). We are extremely grateful for the suggested revisions, as showing TRIM21 phosphorylation by different kinds of immune stimuli and by both IKK and TBK1 has significantly bolstered the significance of our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
