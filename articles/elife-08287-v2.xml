Usually, a cell divides in such a way that both daughter cells inherit a complete set of chromosomes. However, the sex cells (sperm and egg cells) are formed in a different process – called meiosis – that results in these cells having only half the number of chromosomes that the parent cell had. This ensures that when animals reproduce, an egg cell and a sperm fuse together to make a new cell that contains a full set of chromosomes.</p><p>During meiosis, sections of chromosomes are rearranged so that the sperm and egg cells will end up with different combinations of the DNA inherited from the animal's mother and father. Matching chromosomes from the mother and father pair up with each other and the DNA - which is made of two strands - breaks at precise locations throughout the chromosomes. Then, sections of DNA around the double-strand breaks are exchanged between the matching chromosomes by a process known as crossover. An incorrect number of double-strand breaks, or a failure to position them properly, can lead to genetic abnormalities like Down's syndrome, in which cells contain the wrong number of chromosomes.</p><p>Cells tightly regulate the formation of double-strand breaks, but in most organisms the number of breaks formed exceeds the number of crossovers. This implies that there must be a process that selects certain double-strand breaks to form crossovers. Although fruit flies are often used as a model to study animal cells, we do not know how they select which double-strand breaks will form crossovers.</p><p>Lake et al. studied meiosis in fruit flies and identified a new protein called Vilya that is required for double-strand breaks to form. This protein is similar to a group of “Zip3-like” proteins that act on double-strand breaks in other animals. Vilya is found at the double-strand break sites that go on to form crossovers and interacts with a small protein called Mei-P22, which is known to be involved in the formation of double-strand breaks.</p><p>Lake et al.apos;s findings show that Vilya links the process of forming double-strand breaks to the selection of the breaks that will undergo crossover. Future studies will focus on understanding the molecular details of how Vilya works.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08287.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08287.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>double-strand break</kwd><kwd>recombination nodule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id/><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawley</surname><given-names>R Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP-05-086-06DDC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawley</surname><given-names>R Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Zip3-like protein Vilya links the initiation of meiotic recombination with crossover formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes in germ cells by half. This is achieved by coupling one round of DNA replication with two rounds of chromosome segregation. During the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes segregate away from each other. At the second (mitosis-like) meiotic division sister chromatids segregate from each other, producing four meiotic products. Successful completion of the first meiotic division requires the proper completion of several key events, each of which must occur at a specific time and place during prophase. For instance, programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs), required for the initiation of meiotic recombination, are spatially and temporally controlled. Failure to initiate recombination, to create the correct number of DSBs, or to position the DSBs properly can lead to aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murakami and Keeney, 2008</xref>), which in humans can result in disorders of chromosome number such as Down, Klinefelter, or Turner syndrome.</p><p>The reason a failure in initiating recombination induces chromosome missegregation is because a subset of DSBs are repaired into crossovers, and, in most cases, it is the physical linkage (chiasmata) of the homologs by crossovers that ensures chromosomes segregate properly at the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Page and Hawley, 2003</xref>). Crossovers are formed within the context of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved proteinaceous structure formed between homologs during early meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>). The SC consists of two lateral elements (LEs) and a central region that contains both the central element (CE) and transverse filament (TF) proteins. Although crossover formation almost universally requires the presence of SC, the degree to which DSB formation depends on SC formation, or vice versa, differs between organisms. In yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roeder, 1997</xref>), SC formation is dependent on DSBs, as DSB sites appear to be the location for the initiation of SC synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chua and Roeder, 1998</xref>); and in mammals, SC formation between homologs is dependent on DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudat et al., 2000</xref> <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000</xref>)</bold>. However, in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jang et al., 2003</xref>) and worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>), SC formation is not dependent on DSB formation, and in fact, DSBs are formed after full-length SC is constructed. Moreover, in the absence of SC formation in flies, DSB formation in the oocyte is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although DSBs are induced by the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>), many poorly conserved accessory proteins have been identified that are required either to facilitate the formation of the DSBs themselves or position the DSBs within the euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Massy, 2013</xref>). Indeed, the process of DSB formation is tightly controlled, both in terms of DSB number and position. Recently, a feedback mechanism has been proposed that links the process of DSB repair to the DSB formation process in both yeast and worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thacker et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the position of DSBs within the genome is nonrandom, and in many organisms is often controlled by specific sequence motifs that create recombinational hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Massy, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In most organisms the number of DSBs far exceeds the number of crossover events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Massy, 2013</xref>). For example, the ratio of DSBs to crossovers is 10 to one in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moens et al., 2002</xref>), while in flies there are at least three times more DSBs than there are crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindsley et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>). Therefore, there must be a selection process that differentiates those DSBs that become crossovers from those that will be repaired by processes that create noncrossover gene conversions. Recent studies have identified components of the multistep process that selects those DSBs that will become crossover-competent DSBs. These steps appear to be controlled by the ever-growing Zip3 family of proteins and their regulators.</p><p>Zip3 was first identified in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ouspenski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>), and homologs have now been identified in many other model organisms. Recently it has been suggested that there are two subgroups within the Zip3 family: the Zip3/RNF212 group and the Hei10 group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>). All the members within both subgroups are required for the formation of crossovers and are similar in terms of protein structure; they contain a RING-type zinc finger domain, an internal coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal domain that tends to be serine rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>). However, not all organisms possess members of both subgroups. Both budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>) and worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>) are predicted to carry only a single member of the Zip3/RNF212 group, whereas the Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>), rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and Sordaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>) genomes are thought to encode only a member of the Hei10 group. The genomes of mammals, like humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toby et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kong et al., 2008</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strong and Schimenti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>), appear to encode members from each subgroup.</p><p>The two subgroups display key differences in their overall enzymatic activity. Zip3/RNF212 group members appear to act solely as SUMO E3 ligases, whereas some members of the Hei10 group appear to possess both ubiquitin E3 ligase and SUMO E3 ligase activity. Yeast Zip3, which is required to regulate SUMO modification along meiotic chromosomes, has SUMO E3 ligase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>), and genetic studies have implicated Zhp-3, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Zip3 homolog, in the SUMO pathway as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, human Hei10 has been shown biochemically to have ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toby et al., 2003</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that mouse Hei10 may also function as a SUMO E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strong and Schimenti, 2010</xref>). These observations suggest that the relationship between SUMOylation and ubiquitination of proteins in the vicinity of the DSB determines which DSBs become competent to crossover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Very little is known about how DSBs become crossover-competent DSBs in Drosophila. Prior to this study, homologs for most of the proteins required for this process in other organisms (Msh4/Msh5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>), RNF212, Hei10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strong and Schimenti, 2010</xref>), Mlh1/Mlh3) had not been identified in Drosophila. In this manuscript we describe a new meiosis-specific gene that we have named <italic>vilya</italic>. Vilya is a Zip3-like RING-containing protein that is required for programmed DSB formation. Vilya interacts with another DSB accessory protein, Mei-P22, and these proteins localize to sites of DSBs as identified by the chromatin modification γH2AV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>). When an epitope-tagged version of Vilya is expressed in the female germline, it shows a dynamic localization pattern that is dependent on DSB formation. In early pachytene, Vilya localizes both to the central region of the SC and to discrete foci. As the oocyte matures into early/mid-pachytene, Vilya is primarily found at discrete foci. The number and distribution of these foci along the euchromatic SC of each chromosome arm parallels the number and position of crossover events. Indeed, we show that Vilya is a component of recombination nodules (RNs) by immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM), making it the first RN protein component identified in Drosophila. We speculate that Vilya has functions that have recently been described for several members of the Zip3 group, such as DSB fate determination and crossover formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Meiosis in Drosophila</title><p>Drosophila females provide an excellent system to analyze the progression of very early events of the first meiotic division because egg chambers within each ovariole of the ovary are arranged according to developmental age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King et al., 1956</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a schematic of the Drosophila germarium, which is the structure at the very tip of the ovariole and is where meiosis begins.

As the cyst progresses in region 2A, it enters into pachytene where full-length SC is formed. In Drosophila, meiotic DSBs are formed by the Spo11 homolog, Mei-W68, after the SC is fully formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>). DSBs can be visualized in Drosophila by the rapid phosphorylation of the histone 2A variant (γH2AV) at DSB sites that occur in all 16 nuclei within the cyst (in both the pro-oocytes and surrounding nurse cells) in region 2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>). As the cyst progresses into region 2B (early/mid-pachytene), only two nuclei have complete SC, and DSB numbers are reduced from those found in early pachytene. By region 3, or mid-pachytene, the oocyte nucleus has been selected and most of the γH2AV staining at DSB sites is removed, indicating that repair is either in progress or complete.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of the <italic>vilya</italic> mutant</title><p>A germline clone screen for EMS-induced meiotic mutations on the <italic>X</italic> chromosome produced a novel meiotic mutation, known initially as <italic>mei-826,</italic> that caused high levels of nondisjunction at the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2012</xref>).

Specifically, we wondered if it affected SC formation or two processes that depend on the SC: the pairing and clustering of centromeres and the pairing of homologous chromosomes. We first assayed the processes of centromere clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) in early pachytene nuclei.

Similarly, <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> was not defective in euchromatic homolog pairing as assayed for the <italic>X</italic> chromosome by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of early pachytene nuclei did not reveal defects in the ability of the SC protein Corolla to localize properly in <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> germaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–a,b</xref>). As well, we did not detect defects in timing or localization of the TF SC protein, C(3)G, or Orb, a cytoplasmic marker for oocyte determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, we were unable to detect significant defects in any of the processes that occur prior to the initiation of DSBs.</p><p>However, the formation of DSBs, as assayed with an antibody recognizing γH2AV, was greatly reduced in <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> and <italic>Df/vilya<sup>826 </sup></italic>oocytes. Specifically, we assayed the initiation of DSBs that occur in all nuclei in region 2A cysts within the germarium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) by comparing the timing and presence of γH2AV foci of <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> homozygotes and <italic>Df/vilya<sup>826 </sup></italic>transheterozygotes to that observed in wild type, in an SC mutant (<italic>c(3)G</italic>) that initiates DSBs albeit at reduced levels in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>), and in two DSB-defective mutants (<italic>mei-W68</italic> and <italic>mei-P22</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We found that unlike wild-type and <italic>c(3)G</italic> females, where γH2AV foci are readily observed in region 2A cysts, <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> and <italic>Df/vilya<sup>826 </sup></italic>females show an almost complete absence of γH2AV staining, similar to <italic>mei-W68</italic> and <italic>mei-P22</italic>. These observations strongly suggest that <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> and <italic>Df/vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> oocytes are defective in DSB formation.</p><p>Immunofluorescence analysis of <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup> </italic>also reveals a severe failure to initiate programmed DSBs in oocytes in early pachytene compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–a,b</xref>). This defect is not caused by a delay in DSB formation, as no γH2AV foci were detected in later stages of pachytene in the germarium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The near complete absence of the γH2AV foci in <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> oocytes was also not due to an inability of <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> to modify the histone at DSB sites, as γH2AV was detected in <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> oocytes when DSBs were artificially induced by X-ray treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,C</xref>). Finally, the failure to induce DSBs in <italic>vilya</italic> mutant females is solely due to the lack of functional Vilya because germline expression of <italic>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></italic> is able to rescue DSB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–d</xref>).</p><p>To rule out the possibility that the observed reduction of DSBs by this assay was not due to an increased rate of DSB repair in <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> oocytes, we analyzed the ability of <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> to rescue the defects associated with the DSB repair-deficient mutant, <italic>okra</italic> (homolog of yeast Rad54). In <italic>okra</italic> mutant-bearing oocytes, DSBs are left unrepaired, leading to the activation of a DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghabrial et al., 1998</xref>). Activation of this checkpoint induces several observable phenotypes, which are bypassed by mutants that fail to form DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghabrial and Schupbach, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lake et al., 2011</xref>). We examined the effect of the <italic>vilya</italic> mutant on two of these phenotypes. First, in <italic>okra</italic> mutant-bearing oocytes, the presence of unrepaired breaks leads to sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghabrial et al., 1998</xref>). In <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup>/</italic>+ oocytes, which carry one wild-type copy of <italic>vilya</italic>, homozygosity for <italic>okra</italic> causes near complete sterility, producing only 0.2 progeny per female on average. However, in the <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup> okra</italic> double mutant, the fertility was similar to <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> alone, averaging 14.4 and 16.3 progeny per female, respectively, and the rate of <italic>X</italic> and <italic>4th</italic> chromosome nondisjunction in the double mutant was similar to the <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup> </italic>single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, the reduction of DSBs due to the <italic>vilya</italic> mutation resulted in the rescue of fertility (about 30% as fertile as wild type) caused by the <italic>okra</italic> mutation. Second, in <italic>okra</italic> mutant oocytes the presence of unrepaired DSBs results in an inability to form the spherical meiotic chromosome mass, known as the karyosome, in late pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghabrial et al., 1998</xref>). In the presence of DSBs, but in the absence of repair, the karyosome structure is fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> was also able to rescue the karyosome defect seen in <italic>okra</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that DSBs are formed and repaired in a <italic>rad54/okra</italic>-independent manner so quickly that we are unable to detect them in our assay, these studies strongly support the conclusion that programmed DSBs are rarely formed in <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> oocytes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08287.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> rescues the fertility and karyosome defects of the DSB repair-deficient mutant <italic>okra</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> rescues the fertility defect of the DSB repair-deficient mutant <italic>okra</italic> and displays an increase in chromosome nondisjunction in the double mutant, similar to that of the single <italic>vilya</italic><sup>826</sup> mutant.

The absence of the discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci at mid-pachytene may suggest that the foci seen earlier have disassembled; however, the significance of this relocalization of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> to the central region at the later stages of pachytene is unclear. The specificity of the anti-HA antibody for both types of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> staining (discrete foci and linear tracks) can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> where there is a complete absence of staining on wild type tissue.</p><p>To further characterize the localization of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci, we analyzed the number and distribution of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci within the SC in early/mid-pachytene region 2B oocytes.

Using SIM, 3D visualization, and the spot function in Imaris, we were able to trace five independent tracks of SC in five oocytes and determine the distribution of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci within each SC track.

While a strong correlation between crossover position and the distribution of Vilya foci would strongly support the hypothesis that the establishment of discrete Vilya foci plays a role in crossover formation, the finding of a lack of consistency for the distribution and/or in the position of the foci might indicate the foci are an artifact from using this overexpression system. A summary of the number and distribution of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci from the five early/mid-pachytene nuclei in which we could clearly identify all five SCs between homologous chromosome arms is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Examining these five oocyte nuclei, which contain a total of 25 stretches of SC, we observed 24 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci or an average of 4.8 foci per oocyte. The majority (22/24) of the SC between homologous chromosome arms were associated with only one Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> focus. A small fraction (1/22) contained two foci (corresponding nucleus shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and 2/22 were not associated with any Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci. These numbers correspond well to the observed distribution of crossovers in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In addition, as is seen in the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C-a,b</xref> and corresponding <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci were found exclusively within the euchromatic SC, and no Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci were detected in the less-defined heterochromatic SC. Consistent with this observation we failed to detect any colocalization of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci with the histone variant (CID, the CENP-A homolog) that localizes in the pericentromeric heterochromatin throughout early/mid-pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus the number of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci in early/mid-pachytene oocytes are consistently found and correspond well to the known number and position of crossover events in flies, with each stretch of euchromatic SC between homologous chromosome arms primarily containing one focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindsley et al., 1977</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Vilya localizes to RNs as detected by immuno-EM</title><p>Due to the position and distribution of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci on the SC between homologous chromosome arms during early/mid-pachytene, as well as the persistence of these foci into mid-pachytene, we speculated that Vilya might be localizing to sites of crossovers. Unlike many model organisms where crossover-specific proteins have been identified and reagents have been made to analyze their localization, no such proteins or reagents exist in Drosophila. However, early studies by Carpenter in Drosophila show that sites of crossovers form large electron-dense structures known as RNs within the central region of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter, 1975a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter, 1975b</xref>).</p><p>We performed immuno-EM using a secondary antibody labeled with gold particles on oocytes expressing <italic>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></italic>.

We performed randomized controls, rotating the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> image stack, to determine the degree of colocalization that would occur by chance for the 11 oocytes analyzed above (see Materials and Methods for details). In the 11 early pachytene oocytes that showed an association frequency of 60.5%, only 8.6% (7 of the 81 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci) remained associated after rotation of the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> channel, suggesting the observed degree of association between Vilya<sup>3XHA foci</sup> and the γH2AV modification cannot be explained by coincidence (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, binomial test).</p><p>We also analyzed the number of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci and their association with DSBs in a DNA repair-deficient mutant. For this experiment we chose to use the mutant <italic>spnB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghabrial et al., 1998</xref>), which is located on a separate chromosome from both the expression construct and the germline driver and could easily be combined genetically for this analysis. SpnB, the XRCC3 or Rad51-like protein, is required for programmed DSB repair, and therefore in the absence of <italic>spnB</italic> function, DSBs fail to be repaired and can be seen by immunofluorescence as γH2AV foci accumulating in mid-pachytene oocytes (region 3). We find that in the absence of DSB repair, the number of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci in region 3 increases from an average of 3.2 (SD = 0.9) in an otherwise wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) to 7.5 (SD = 1.6, n = 10 oocytes). The frequency of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci associated with γH2AV marks was 68% (51 of the 75 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci in 10 oocytes), comparable to the 60.5% seen in early pachytene when DSB repair is progressing normally (p = 0.93, binomial test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and 6B-b</xref>’). In addition, similar to the DSB repair-proficient background above, in the absence of DSB repair the frequency of association between Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> and γH2AV was reduced to 10.6% (8 of the 75 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci) upon rotation of the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> channel (p &lt; 0.0001, binomial test).</p><p>In order to determine whether the SC was required for Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> to localize properly at pachytene, we expressed <italic>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></italic> in the absence of the TF protein C(3)G and assayed for the presence of both linear staining and discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci. The SC is not required for the temporal induction of DSBs in nurse cells in early pachytene (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), however it is required for wild-type levels of DSB formation in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>). Although it is difficult to distinguish oocyte nuclei from nurse cell nuclei in the absence of <italic>c(3)G</italic>, occasionally the oocyte can be located by the weak haze of nuclear Corolla staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2014</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we find that in the absence of C(3)G, Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> is able to localize in early pachytene oocytes to discrete foci that are often associated with γH2AV marks (75% of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci, 34 of 45, colocalize with γH2AV marks in 14 oocyte nuclei analyzed). As the number of DSBs in oocytes of a <italic>c(3)G</italic> mutant are reduced to 15–20% of normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>), as expected, Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci are also reduced in number compared to wild type in region 2A (an average of 3.2 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci per oocyte compared to 8.0 in wild type). Interestingly, we failed to see a persistence of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> in region 2B oocytes that we could identify by Corolla staining. Of the seven region 2B oocytes we analyzed that no longer contained γH2AV staining, only two had a single Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> focus while the remaining had none. We speculate that the absence of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci at this stage is a consequence of a failure to form RNs and thus repair those DSBs into crossovers. At this time, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the levels of expression of <italic>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></italic> using the Gal4-UAS system in the <italic>c(3)G</italic> mutant is less than in our wild-type background.

It is currently unclear as to whether this increase in Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci in the absence of DSB repair indicates more DSBs are selected to become crossovers, or whether we may be underestimating the number of Vilya foci throughout pachytene due to the temporal nature of DSB formation and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Exogenous DSBs can recruit Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> to discrete foci</title><p>To determine whether exogenous DSBs can recruit Vilya to them, which would support a downstream role for Vilya in addition to its role in DSB formation, we analyzed whether the localization pattern of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> in a <italic>mei-W68</italic> mutant changed after X-ray treatment.

We substituted each of the cysteines for serines and the histidine for a tyrosine in the RING domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each of the mutations ablates the ability of Vilya to interact with Mei-P22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The failure of the RING domain mutants to interact with Mei-P22 is not due to altered protein expression levels or degradation, as we do not observe any obvious differences in the amount or size of the RING domain mutant proteins compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, as is the case for virtually all yeast two-hybrid studies, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that mutating key residues of the RING domain may alter the protein conformation, thus creating a failed interaction. These studies, however, do suggest that a functional RING domain within the Vilya protein is critical for Vilya and Mei-P22 interaction.</p><p>Based on these studies, Vilya and Mei-P22 likely interact in vivo, and their interaction is dependent on the RING domain of Vilya. Previous studies using the expression construct <italic>hsp83:mei-P22<sup>3XHA</sup></italic> have shown that Mei-P22<sup>3XHA</sup> localizes to discrete foci, which are found on chromatin closely associated with the SC and are not dependent on DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we anticipate that Mei-P22 localization is also not dependent on Vilya. The persistence of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> at discrete foci into early/mid-pachytene, and the absence of Mei-P22<sup>3XHA</sup> staining at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>), suggests that Vilya may have additional functions at the DSB site, such as in crossing over, that are independent from Mei-P22.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Vilya’s role in DSB formation and crossing over</title><p>Vilya, in conjunction with another DSB accessory protein, Mei-P22, acts to facilitate the initiation of recombination during meiotic prophase. As shown in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), DSBs are not formed in the absence of Mei-P22, Vilya, or Mei-W68 (<italic>Dm</italic> Spo11), resulting in the absence of crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>) (this study). Unlike Mei-P22, whose localization to discrete foci in early pachytene is not dependent on DSBs (or at least <italic>mei-W68</italic> function) but is dependent on the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>), Vilya’s ability to localize to discrete foci appears to require only the formation of DSBs but not the SC. In the absence of either Mei-P22 or Mei-W68, the discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci, which are first apparent in early pachytene and often persist throughout mid-pachytene, do not form. Our studies also suggest that the localization of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> along the central region of the SC is not required for its localization to discrete foci, as we did not detect any linear staining of Vilya in a <italic>c(3)G</italic> mutant, but we did detect discrete foci often colocalizing with γH2AV marks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, Vilya is not only required for the formation of DSBs, but it’s localization to discrete foci, which can be found at a significant number of DSBs (based on γH2AV staining), is dependent on DSB formation. Based on these observations, along with the finding that Mei-P22 and Vilya interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay, we propose that Mei-P22 acts upstream of Vilya, and recruits Vilya and Mei-W68, which catalyzes DSBs. Vilya is recruited to at least a subset of DSBs, which are then visualized as discrete foci in early pachytene often colocalizing with γH2AV marks.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08287.022</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model of DSB formation in Drosophila female oocytes.</title> <p>(Left) In wild-type oocytes, Mei-P22, which localizes to discrete foci prior to the time γH2AV foci are present, is located at chromatin adjacent to the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Vilya localizes to the central region of the SC and is required along with its binding partner, Mei-P22, and Mei-W68 (the Spo11 homolog) for formation of DSBs. Although initially Vilya may localize to a vast majority of, if not all, DSBs, as the oocytes mature into early/mid-pachytene, Vilya is retained and/or recruited to form discrete foci at sites of crossing over. Failure to accumulate Vilya at DSB sites would direct that DSB to a noncrossover fate. (Right) In the absence of Mei-P22 or Mei-W68, and thus in the absence of DSB formation, Vilya fails to localize to discrete foci and is found exclusively along the central region of the SC. In the absence of Vilya, we speculate, based on the fact that Mei-P22 can localize to discrete foci in the absence of Mei-W68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>), that Mei-P22’s localization is unaffected. However, DSB formation would fail due to the absence of <italic>vilya</italic> function. In the absence of Mei-W68, Mei-P22 is able to bind normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2002</xref>), however, due to the absence of DSBs, Vilya does not form discrete foci.

We base this proposal on the observation in budding yeast that the differential enrichment of Zip3 at DSBs positively biases the DSB toward the crossover pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Serrentino et al., 2013</xref>). We know from our studies that exogenous DSBs have the ability to recruit or concentrate Vilya to a subset of them, in the absence of SC there appears to be a failure to maintain Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> at discrete foci in early/mid-pachytene oocytes, and our immuno-EM analysis of oocytes expressing <italic>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></italic> indicate that Vilya is indeed a component of the RN. Together, these data suggest that Vilya plays an active role at the sites of crossing over. Although we do not have direct evidence that Vilya controls DSB fate by promoting crossover maturation, our demonstration that Vilya is recruited to the sites of DSBs in a similar number and position to that of RNs strongly supports this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Is Vilya a Zip3 homolog?</title><p>It is very tempting to place Vilya within the Zip3 family of homologs based on findings presented here. DIOPT, the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu, et al., 2011</xref>), predicts that Vilya is orthologous to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Zip3 (also known as Cst9) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Zhp-3, however, no homologs for Vilya were identified in other organisms including mice and humans using this tool (FlyBase). Here, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref> the sequence alignment of Vilya to Zip3 homologs of selected plants, fungi, worms, and vertebrates. These selected sequences were used to generate a maximum likelihood tree to show the relationship of Vilya to these homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with the BLAST similarity network findings of Chelysheva et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>), two groups could be identified. One contains the Hei10-like homologs of plants, fungi and vertebrates; and one contains the Zip3-like members including Zip3, Zhp-3 and RNF212. This analysis suggests that evolutionarily Vilya is more closely related to the Zip3-like members than Hei10 members. In addition, based on predicted protein structure and domains, there is an overall similarity between members within the Zip3 group members and Vilya. These similarities include an N-terminal RING domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which predicts E3 ligase activity, an internal coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal serine-rich domain, which many Zip3 members possess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>). We have shown above that Vilya’s RING domain is required for the interaction with Mei-P22 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and its coiled-coil domain suggests Vilya would localize to the central region of the SC.</p><p>In addition to these three domains, Vilya also has a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SUMO-IM) and three putative RXL cyclin-binding domains that are also common to Zip3 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>). In budding yeast, the SUMO-IM in Zip3 has been shown to be required, along with the RING domain, for its interaction with the E2 enzyme Ubc9. These domains are also thought to be required for Zip3’s SUMO E3 ligase activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>). Studies in Sordaria have shown that the RXL motif of Hei10, along with the RING domain, are required to modulate the levels of SUMOylation along the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>). Although we have not specifically determined whether the SUMO-IM and RXL motifs in Vilya are required for its function, in preliminary studies we have not been able to detect an interaction between Vilya and the Drosophila Ubc9 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Nor have we been able to identify SUMOylation of proteins at the SC in Drosophila oocytes using an antibody to Drosophila SUMO (Abgent AP1287b, San Diego, CA). Therefore, although structurally Vilya bears a strong resemblance to the Zip3 family, we have no evidence Vilya possess SUMO E3 ligase activity, interacts directly with an E2 enzyme, or that SUMOylation plays a role at the SC in Drosophila at this time.</p><p>Vilya is also similar to some members of the Zip3 family in terms of its dynamic localization pattern. In early pachytene, using the expression system shown in this manuscript, Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> localizes along linear tracks as well as discrete foci. As the oocyte progresses into early/mid pachytene, the discrete foci predominate and the signal along the central region of the SC appears to diminish (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In oocytes that have progressed past mid-pachytene, the discrete foci disappear and the signal along the central region becomes uniform (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). This dynamic localization is unlikely to be a result of the overexpression system we are using because in this same system in the absence of meiotic recombination initiation we fail to observe this pattern and only linear central region staining is present. Moreover, similar dynamic localization patterns have been seen for <italic>C. elegans</italic> Zhp-3, mouse RNF212, and Arabidopsis and rice Hei10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>). The general dynamic trend seems to begin with the localization along the SC as continuous linear tracks or arrays of discrete foci, and culminates with localization at discrete foci that mark the sites of crossing over. In the absence of meiotic recombination initiation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>), Zhp-3 and RNF212, respectively, were also found to localize along the SC, albeit the SC of nonhomologous chromosomes in mice, and failed to coalesce into discrete foci. However, we cannot rule out that the reappearance of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> to the central region of the SC in late pachytene is not a consequence of this ectopic expression since we have not discerned a later function for Vilya.</p><p>Although Vilya clearly has a unique function not found in any other Zip3 family member so far (i.e. being required for meiotic DSB formation), other unique functions for some Zip3 family members have been identified as well. For example, Zip3 in budding yeast appears to be the only member required for SC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>), and Hei10 in Sordaria is uniquely required for processes involving spindle pole body dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>). Because DSB accessory proteins are highly divergent and Drosophila appear to lack homologs of the meiosis-specific MutS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>), which are required to stabilize strand invasion during crossing over, and the crossover-specific complex MutLγ, to which Zip3 family members bind, perhaps then it is not surprising that Drosophila has found an unique way to couple the events of DSB formation to those of crossing over.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila genetics</title><p>All Drosophila strains were maintained on standard food at 25°C unless otherwise noted.

Protein expression of each of the Vilya point mutants, as well as full-length wild-type protein, was verified by Western blotting. Briefly, a 50 mL culture of transformed Y187 yeast cells was inoculated from an over-day 5 mL culture in minimal media lacking Trp. After 7 hr, the OD<sub>600</sub> was determined, and equal amounts of yeast based on OD<sub>600</sub> were pelleted before being frozen.

Three- to five-day-old females were collected and yeasted overnight in the presence of males. Ovaries were dissected in PBS for no longer than 20 min prior to fixing (200 µL of PBS containing 2% formaldehyde (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus 600 µL heptane) at room temperature. Ovaries were then washed three times for 10 min in PBS with 0.1% Tween (PBST). Late stage egg chambers were removed by cutting the ovaries with forceps, and the ovarioles containing the germarium tips were teased apart before being blocked in PBST with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (EMD Chemicals, San Diego, CA) for one hr. Primary antibody diluted in PBST was incubated with germarium tips overnight at 4°C while nutating.

Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit Alexa-488 and anti-rat ultra-small gold (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). After washing 6 x 10 min, ovaries were post-fixed as before except at RT. Ovaries were then washed in distilled water for 3 x 20 min and gold was enhanced with Aurion R-GENT SE-EM (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 1 hr 15 min. Following silver enhancement, samples were treated with 0.03 M sodium thiosulfate in distilled water for 5 min, followed by 3 x 10 min washes with distilled water.

We recorded the percent transmission (which stayed consistent) and exposure time in each channel for each of the acquired images. We averaged the five exposure times for each filter. We fixed these as values for our wild-type image acquisition. The images were then deconvolved as above. In addition, we recorded the exposure time on wild type for each of the filters when using a target intensity value of 3000.

For the DAPI the ratio was 1.0:0.9, TRITC (HA) 1.0:5.78 and Cy5 (Corolla) 1.0:1.2.

We identified the number of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci for each nucleus analyzed as described above. We then rotated the images in 3D to verify that the γH2AV signal was not simply above or below the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> focus. We scored those signals that overlapped, as well as those signals that were adjacent (no apparent gap between the foci), but not separated above or below in 3D, as being associated. To verify the relevance of their association, we took each 3D cropped oocyte nucleus and rotated the channel for the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci by 180 degrees using ImageJ software. First, we split each of the channels of the image. We selected the channel with the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci, and used the transform function to flip the z-series horizontally. We then used the stack tool to reverse the stack. Together these two manipulations are equivalent to a 180 degree rotation of the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> channel. After merging the channels back together, we again analyzed the association of γH2AV and Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci as before.</p><p>3D projections and tracing of SC between homologous chromosome arms was performed using Imaris software, and maximum intensity projections were made unless otherwise noted.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Based on a previous germline mutagenesis screen (Collins et al., 2012) and a complementation assay (this study), the authors identified a gene named Vilya, involved in meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The use of Î³H2AV antibody developed in an earlier study (Lake et al., 2013) has allowed the authors to quantify DSB formation and conclude that a truncation of the Vilya gene causes defect in DSB formation. The protein shares some features characteristic of the yeast Zip3 protein family, important for crossover designation. Vilya interacts with the DSB accessory protein Mei-P22, is localized in oocytes along the synaptonemal complex, and forms foci that appear to be recombination nodules by electron microscopy. Altogether, the results suggest that Vilya plays an important role in DSB formation and/or repair, and help to provide a more complete model of meiotic recombination pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females, where several recombination factors well conserved among eukaryotes appear to be absent.</p><p>Overall, the data quality are excellent and the writing is clear. The discovery of Vilya is important for several reasons: it is the first (likely) member of the Zip3/Rnf212 family discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is the first protein component clearly demonstrated for <italic>Drosophila</italic> recombination nodules, and it is the first example in any species of a role for a protein in this family in promoting DSB formation.</p><p>However both the proposed roles of Vilya in DSB formation and in crossover control need to be further substantiated: Additional experiments to further evaluate the implication of Vilya for DSB formation and to determine its relationship with C(3)G and to demonstrate a role downstream of DSB formation should solve these issues. Some straightforward control experiments and clarifications in text and figures would strengthen the paper.</p><p>Important revisions:</p><p><italic>Questions related to the role of Vilya for DSB formation:</italic></p><p>1) It is not entirely clear if one can conclude that no DSB are formed in the absence of Vilya. In the subsection “<italic>vilya</italic> is required for programmed DSB formation in early pachytene”, the authors state: &quot;Immunofluorescence analysis of early pachytene oocytes reveals a complete failure to initiate programmed DSBs&quot;. It would be better to use more nuanced language: This experiment suggests a failure or a strong reduction, and the resolution of the picture does not allow for the conclusion &quot;complete&quot; failure. What is the estimated limit of sensitivity of the gH2AV staining? The data of the recombination map is clear but if Vilya is required for CO, then some remaining DSB could be repaired to NCO in the mutant.</p><p>2) Is Vilya required for DSB formation in nurse cells? This is quite important and would allow to distinguish between a direct role for DSB formation and a regulatory role as observed for C(3)G.</p><p>3) Also, an alternative interpretation, may be not likely, but that should be mentioned is that the mutant phenotypes could be explained by assuming a fast repair of DSB to NCO (or sister) in Vilya mutant and not requiring Rad54.</p><p>4) The interplay between Vilya and C(3)G should be better documented: Is Vilya localization dependent on C(3)G? If yes, how could one explain the DSB activity detected in C(3)G mutant? What is the DSB level in Vilya C(3)G double mutant?</p><p>5) An important test for the deficiency of DSB formation is the suppression of okra mutant phenotypes. One missing piece of information is the detection of gH2AV in vilya okra double mutant (region 2A and region 3).</p><p>6) The interpretation of the ring mutations on the interaction with MeiP-22 is not convincing as the mutant protein may have an improper folding or conformation, this alternative should be taken into account in the Discussion. Western blots should be provided as well as two hybrid data for the RING domain mutants.</p><p>7) The colocalization of Vilya with gH2Av is not convincing. If Vilya foci mark CO, one does not expect a high colocalization frequency between gH2AV and Vilya (may be only 30% or less). In addition the protocol used for image analysis and evaluating colocalization is poorly described. What does closely associated mean? What does adjacent mean? How is this different from expected by chance? Randomization controls should be performed to evaluate the degree of overlap, e.g., by flipping one of the fluorescence channels by 180° and re-evaluating the degree of fortuitous overlap. In the third paragraph of the subsection “The formation of discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci is dependent on programmed DSB formation”: The difference in Vilya-gH2AV association does not appear to be significant (Fisher's exact test gives p = 0.175). Please clarify.</p><p>8) In terms of Vilya foci quantification, it is not clear what the parameters to identify a focus are, in particular taking into account that their intensity varies and that there is signal in the central region. For instance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, there seems to be more than 12 Vilya foci in the nucleus.</p><p><italic>Questions related to the role of Vilya for Crossover control:</italic> </p><p>9) To firm up the speculation about a possible late role for Vilya and to reconcile the cytology and the phenotypic analysis, do X-rays rescue Vilya foci in a mei-P22 or mei-W68 mutant? This experiment would help clarify whether Vilya has functions downstream of DSB formation, as speculated.</p><p>10) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Vilya's role in DSB formation and crossing over” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: The authors' model is not convincing as spelled out. If Mei-W68 catalyzes DSBs at Mei-P22 sites, and if Vilya is then recruited to a subset of DSB sites, one should expect to see more Mei-P22 foci than Vilya foci. This data is missing in the manuscript and is important to support the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Furthermore, in Liu et al., 2002, the average number of Mei-P22 foci per SC containing cell in region 2A was calculated at 8.7, which is not significantly higher than the average number of Vilya3XHA foci in early pachytene region 2A calculated at 8.0 in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, the poor colocalization (13,5%) observed between Î³H2AV and MEI-P22 foci in Mehrotra &amp; Mckim, 2006 doesn't fit with MEI-P22 being a mark of future DSB sites. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened if these issues could be addressed. Why not integrate trem in the model?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: As Vilya3XHA shows two distinct types of staining (linear and foci), the specificity of the anti-HA antibody should be shown in a control experiment (e.g. anti-HA on a WT oocyte).</p><p>12) Information about the level of expression of the transgene (relative to endogene) expressing tagged Vilya is needed.

What is the estimated limit of sensitivity of the gH2AV staining? The data of the recombination map is clear but if Vilya is required for CO, then some remaining DSB could be repaired to NCO in the mutant.</italic> </p><p>We now use more nuanced language throughout the manuscript, suggesting that there is a strong reduction rather than asserting that there is a complete elimination of DSB formation during pachytene. In support of our assertion that there is a very strong reduction in crossing over, we have also added a recombination analysis for the entire <italic>3rd</italic> chromosome to complement the <italic>X</italic> chromosome recombination data already included (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These new data show that the frequency of recombination on the <italic>3rd</italic> chromosome in <italic>vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> is reduced over 50-fold compared to wild type. In addition, we have now included DSB numbers for the transheterozygote (<italic><underline>Df</underline>/vilya<sup>826</sup></italic>). Together with the data already included in the manuscript, these experiments show that there is a very strong reduction in both the initiation of DSBs and in crossing over.</p><p><italic>2) Is Vilya required for DSB formation in nurse cells? This is quite important and would allow to distinguish between a direct role for DSB formation and a regulatory role as observed for C(3)G.</italic> </p><p>We have included data regarding the lack of induction of DSBs in nurse cells in the <italic>vilya</italic> mutant in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In this figure we show the pattern of DSB induction within all nuclei in region 2A for both wild type and <italic>c (3)G</italic> (which shows a pattern similar to wild type). However, we show that <italic>mei-W68, mei-P22, vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> and <italic>Df/vilya<sup>826</sup></italic> all exhibit a strong reduction in the initiation of DSBs in both nurse cells and oocyte nuclei. These images further demonstrate that Vilya has a general role in DSB formation, similar to Mei-W68 and Mei-P22, rather than an oocyte-specific regulatory role in DSB formation, as has been reported for C(3)G (Mehrotra and McKim, 2006).</p><p><italic>3) Also, an alternative interpretation, may be not likely, but that should be mentioned is that the mutant phenotypes could be explained by assuming a fast repair of DSB to NCO (or sister) in Vilya mutant and not requiring Rad54.</italic> </p><p>We have added this as a possibility in the subsection “Meiosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”.</p><p><italic>4) The interplay between Vilya and C(3)G should be better documented: Is Vilya localization dependent on C(3)G? If yes, how could one explain the DSB activity detected in C(3)G mutant?</italic> </p><p>We have now included data to show that the localization of Vilya to discrete foci is not dependent on C(3)G. However no linear element Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> staining was observed in the <italic>c (3)G</italic> mutant. Our data show that 75% of the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci observed in region 2A oocytes colocalize/associate with the Î³H2AV marks (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, very few region 2B oocyte nuclei retained any Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci. We speculate that the inability to retain Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> at discrete foci is the result of the failure to convert the DSBs that do form into crossovers – a process known to require the SC. We have added these observations to the subsection “The formation of discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci is dependent on programmed DSB formation but not the SC” in the Results section.</p><p><italic>What is the DSB level in Vilya C(3)G double mutant?</italic> </p><p>Previous correspondence with the editor led to an agreement that the analysis of the <italic>vilya; c (3)G</italic> double mutant, while interesting, was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>5) An important test for the deficiency of DSB formation is the suppression of okra mutant phenotypes. One missing piece of information is the detection of gH2AV in vilya okra double mutant (region 2A and region 3).</italic> </p><p>Again, previous discussions with the editor regarding measuring the DSB level in the <italic>vilya; okra</italic> double mutant led to the agreement that such experiments could be deferred to a future paper.</p><p><italic>6) The interpretation of the ring mutations on the interaction with MeiP-22 is not convincing as the mutant protein may have an improper folding or conformation, this alternative should be taken into account in the Discussion. Western blots should be provided as well as two hybrid data for the RING domain mutants.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the failed interaction between Mei-P22 and the Vilya RING domain point mutants may be the result of improper protein folding or confirmation. We have now added this possibility to the Results section. We have also provided the yeast two-hybrid data and the Western blot as a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we have added a new Materials and methods section regarding this experiment in the yeast two-hybrid section, as well as a figure legend for the new figure.</p><p><italic>7) The colocalization of Vilya with gH2Av is not convincing. If Vilya foci mark CO, one does not expect a high colocalization frequency between gH2AV and Vilya (may be only 30% or less). In addition the protocol used for image analysis and evaluating colocalization is poorly described. What does closely associated mean? What does adjacent mean? How is this different from expected by chance? Randomization controls should be performed to evaluate the degree of overlap, e.g., by flipping one of the fluorescence channels by 180° and re-evaluating the degree of fortuitous overlap. In the third paragraph of the subsection “The formation of discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci is dependent on programmed DSB formation”: The difference in Vilya-gH2AV association does not appear to be significant (Fisher's exact test gives p = 0.175). Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>We have added more details regarding the process of image analysis to the Materials and methods. Our definition of adjacent simply means no apparent gap between the foci. In addition, as suggested, we performed randomization controls (see subsection “The formation of discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci is dependent on programmed DSB formation but not the SC” of Results and subsection “Microscopy and image analysis “of Materials and methods) and have now included them in the Results and Methods sections. Since we wanted to be able to perform the randomization controls on all oocytes scored for colocalization, we used only images that contained one oocyte – many region 2A oocytes cannot be individually and completely cropped due to their proximity to another SC-containing nucleus, even though you can clearly distinguish between the two nuclei in 3D. This is why the numbers in the Results section regarding this data have changed in the revised version. The overall association of Î³H2AV and Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci changed only slightly from 58% to 60.5% in scoring these 11 nuclei.</p><p>We have also attempted to better explain the uncertainties that surround the quantitative relationship between the numbers of Vilya and Î³H2AV foci in terms of laying the groundwork for the model presented in the Discussion of the paper. As Vilya is required for DSB formation (a dynamic process) and is also likely marking CO sites which no longer bear the Î³H2AV mark, it is more difficult to predict the frequency of association that would be predicted in region 2A when DSBs are being induced. We do know that the number of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci in region 2B is consistent with that of RNs/COs.</p><p><italic>8) In terms of Vilya foci quantification, it is not clear what the parameters to identify a focus are, in particular taking into account that their intensity varies and that there is signal in the central region. For instance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, there seems to be more than 12 Vilya foci in the nucleus.</italic> </p><p>We understand how the reviewer came to the conclusion that there were more than 12 foci in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. In this particular image, a few Vilya foci are not in the main nucleus shown. This is because it is sometimes difficult to crop out a region 2A nucleus in such a manner as to be free of sections from neighboring nuclei. In region 2A, up to four neighboring nuclei contain full-length SC and enter meiosis. Although you can clearly see the boundary in 3D, upon projection of the entire stack, these nuclei looked connected, when in fact they are not. In retrospect we should have chosen a better image that was able to be cropped and displayed as information from a single nucleus. We have now changed that image and also added in the Materials and methods section more information on foci quantification (for both Vilya and DSBs).</p><p>Questions related to the role of Vilya for Crossover control:</p><p><italic>9) To firm up the speculation about a possible late role for Vilya and to reconcile the cytology and the phenotypic analysis, do X-rays rescue Vilya foci in a mei-P22 or mei-W68 mutant? This experiment would help clarify whether Vilya has functions downstream of DSB formation, as speculated.</italic> </p><p>We were able to include the experiment suggested by the reviews in analyzing whether DSBs created by X-ray can recruit Vilya to them as discrete foci. The short answer is that “yes” X-ray-induced breaks can induce Vilya to form foci. We have included that new data as a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p><italic>10) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Vilya's role in DSB formation and crossing over” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: The authors' model is not convincing as spelled out. If Mei-W68 catalyzes DSBs at Mei-P22 sites, and if Vilya is then recruited to a subset of DSB sites, one should expect to see more Mei-P22 foci than Vilya foci. This data is missing in the manuscript and is important to support the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Furthermore, in Liu et al., 2002, the average number of Mei-P22 foci per SC containing cell in region 2A was calculated at 8.7, which is not significantly higher than the average number of Vilya3XHA foci in early pachytene region 2A calculated at 8.0 in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, the poor colocalization (13,5%) observed between Î³H2AV and MEI-P22 foci in Mehrotra &amp; Mckim, 2006 doesn't fit with MEI-P22 being a mark of future DSB sites. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened if these issues could be addressed. Why not integrate trem in the model?</italic> </p><p>As we pointed out in our response to reviewer concern number 6, we were not able to obtain additional information regarding the localization of Mei-P22 during the revision process. Therefore, we have chosen to produce a minimalistic model with the information we currently have. As we only ever see a fraction of the DSBs made in region 2A using the antibody to Î³H2AV (the only marker we have in flies), we cannot predict what the expected number of Mei-P22<sup>3XHA</sup> or Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci should be in this region (see above) compared to the number of Î³H2AV foci. We can only report on the number of foci per stage of meiosis and their overall trend throughout the germarium. We have also removed the suggestion that Mei-P22 is marking future DSB sites.</p><p>Although we would like to eventually incorporate Trem into the model, the null allele of <italic>trem</italic> doesn't allow us to look at localization of Vilya in this mutant. This is because the <italic>P</italic>-element insertion in <italic>trem</italic> is a <italic>pBac[WH]</italic> element that contains a UAS in the 5' UTR of the <italic>trem</italic> gene. Therefore, expression of Vilya using the GAL4-UAS system in this <italic>trem</italic> null allele also expresses <italic>trem</italic>. In the future we will need to make either a tagged germline <italic>vilya</italic> expression construct for this analysis or use CRISPR to tag the enodogenous <italic>vilya</italic> gene, as we have been completely unsuccessful at making a Vilya antibody after numerous attempts (three additional attempts even during this revision process). Therefore, until we are able to fully analyze their relationship or get preliminary data, we have chosen to leave Trem out of the model for now.</p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3: As</xref> Vilya3XHA shows two distinct types of staining (linear and foci), the specificity of the anti-HA antibody should be shown in a control experiment (e.g. anti-HA on a WT oocyte).</italic> </p><p>We have added a control image of the rat anti-HA antibody as part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> we show a region 2A nucleus that has both types of staining (where the foci predominate) and a later stage (stage 4) showing the specificity to the linear staining. (Stage 4 is a stage between the region 3 and the stage 6 already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>.) In both cases the controls show insignificant staining levels. The remaining panels in this figure have been moved from B and C to C and D. We have also added details regarding how the control images were collected in the Materials and methods and have pointed to this location in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>12) Information about the level of expression of the transgene (relative to endogene) expressing tagged Vilya is needed. Possible artefacts due to overexpression should be discussed for interpreting the localization of Vilya.</italic> </p><p>We mention in the manuscript that we are using an overexpression system that is highly expressed throughout the ovariole. We also have been very aware to use throughout the manuscript the 3XHA reference when discussing the localization of Vilya, as to remind the reader this is a tagged overexpressed construct. We have included in the manuscript caveats to using an overexpression construct for certain experiments as well.</p><p>We have not included levels of expression of the transgene for the following reasons: 1) We know and mention that in using the <italic>nos</italic>-GAL4-UAS system, we are highly expressing Vilya at all stages of oogenesis. 2) The nurse cells undergo many rounds of endoreduplication leading to hundreds of copies of the genome per each of the 15 nurse cells. These nurse cells synthesize both protein and RNAs, which are dumped into the oocyte. We would be unable to determine whether a certain level of increase in mRNA resulted in that level of protein expression, as well due to the inability to isolate germarium, we are unable to look at expression levels specifically in the area of the ovary we are studying in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
