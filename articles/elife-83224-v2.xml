are critical for its reproductive program. Thus, a mechanism that allows the animal to sense and adjust to its environment should make for a more efficient reproductive physiology. Here, we demonstrate that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> specific sensory neurons influence onset of oogenesis through insulin signaling in response to food-derived cues. The chemosensory neurons ASJ modulate oogenesis onset through the insulin-like peptide (ILP) INS-6. In contrast, other sensory neurons, the olfactory neurons AWA, regulate food type-dependent differences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> fertilization rates, but not onset of oogenesis. AWA modulates fertilization rates at least partly in parallel to insulin receptor signaling, since the insulin receptor DAF-2 regulates fertilization independently of food type, which requires ILPs other than INS-6. Together our findings suggest that optimal reproduction requires the integration of diverse food-derived inputs through multiple neuronal signals acting on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oogenesis</kwd><kwd>fertilization</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>insulin signaling</kwd><kwd>bacterial food type</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006710</institution-id><institution>Wayne State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Assistantship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Shashwat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroAge 242666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ch'ng</surname><given-names>QueeLim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000690</institution-id><institution>Research Councils UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ch'ng</surname><given-names>QueeLim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM108962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alcedo</surname><given-names>Joy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>On different bacterial diets, which also serve as different environments for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, specific sensory neurons and insulin-like peptides integrate food-derived signals to modulate oocyte biology, and hence reproduction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The survival of an individual and its species involves reproductive mechanisms that are subject to food-dependent modulation. In the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, sensory neurons influence food-dependent survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier et al., 2010</xref>) and germline physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dalfó et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sowa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perez et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests the intriguing possibility that sensory perception optimizes survival by modulating the germline in a given environment, which makes it important to understand how the sensory system affects germ cells.</p><p>In the germline of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite, germ cells first undergo spermatogenesis, before switching to oogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</xref>). After oogenesis begins, oocytes undergo arrest at the diakinesis stage of prophase I (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenstein, 2005</xref>). Oocytes are released from this arrest in an assembly-line manner by a hormone secreted from sperm, where the oocyte most proximal to the spermatheca matures first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2001</xref>). Once released from arrest, the oocyte is also immediately ovulated into the spermatheca, where it is fertilized by a sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites, the rate of oocyte maturation determines the rate of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>C.</italic> <italic>elegans</italic> exhibit early oogenesis and faster fertilization rate in response to a specific bacterial food source.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive developmental program, which depicts the timing of the spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch at L4.

However, it remains unclear whether the same sensory neurons regulate germline differentiation and fertilization or what signaling mechanisms underlie these sensory influences.</p><p>Insulin signaling could mediate the sensory responses to food (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2015</xref>). Worms have 40 insulin-like peptides (ILPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duret et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003</xref>), many of which are expressed in sensory neurons and could act alone or combinatorially to regulate several physiological programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornils et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes de Abreu et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, two ILPs, <italic>ins-3</italic> and <italic>ins-33</italic>, have already been shown to regulate germ cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Michaelson et al., 2010</xref>); however, the cells that secrete these signals that affect the germline are unknown.</p><p>In this study, we find that specific sensory neurons and ILPs regulate the timing of oogenesis and fertilization through food type-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In response to a specific food type, we show that the chemosensory neuron ASJ promotes early oogenesis. This ASJ-dependent effect on oogenesis involves ASJ-specific expression of the ILP <italic>ins-6</italic>. In contrast, an olfactory neuron, AWA, regulates food type-dependent fertilization rates through mechanisms that differ from insulin receptor signaling. The insulin receptor pathway alters fertilization rates independent of food cues and employs other ILPs. Thus, our work demonstrates that oogenesis onset and fertilization are subject to different ILP signals and sensory neuron activities, which ensure optimal reproduction within a changing environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The bacterial food source modulates onset of oogenesis and fertilization rate in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Previously, we have shown that different <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that serve as food for <italic>C. elegans</italic> can modulate the animals’ reproductive physiology, independent of their somatic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier et al., 2010</xref>). Wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> fed two different <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, OP50 and CS180, developed through four larval stages (L1 to L4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) at about the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), before they molted into young adults. However, <italic>C. elegans</italic> grown on CS180 produced fewer progeny when compared to animals grown on OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This CS180-dependent phenotype was not because the animals had restricted food intake, since they showed no delay in developmental rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In fact, CS180-fed animals exhibited faster fertilization rates during the first 24 hr of adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), which is opposite of what would be expected for food level-restricted animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the total number of sperm made before the gametogenesis switch to oogenesis can limit the number of progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>). Consistent with this idea, animals fed CS180 not only had fewer progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), but also fewer sperm than animals on OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To test the hypothesis that the lower sperm number in <italic>C. elegans</italic> on CS180 was because of an earlier switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis, we examined when the oogenesis marker <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spike et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noble et al., 2016</xref>) was first expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F to H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We found that a significant fraction of worms on CS180 began to express the oogenesis marker <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> at the mid-L4 stage, which was before the marker was observed in any worms on OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Worms fed OP50 started to express <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> only at late L4 (34%), when most animals on CS180 (69%) had already expressed the GFP marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To confirm further the effect of the CS180 diet on oogenesis, we also analyzed the initial expression of a second oogenesis reporter, <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Detwiler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin, 2003</xref>), on CS180 or OP50. Similar to what we observed with <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic>, worms fed CS180 started to express <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic> at mid-L4 (20%), again before any OP50-fed worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The gonads of CS180-fed animals also had more arrested oocytes than the gonads of age-matched adults on OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the fewer progeny on CS180 can reflect earlier oogenesis on this food source. Together with the increased rate of fertilization in CS180-fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), which would depend on the oocyte maturation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>), our data suggest that CS180 promotes earlier and faster oocyte development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CS180-derived cues that affect oocyte development are absent from the K-12 HT115 bacteria and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic></title><p>OP50 is derived from an <italic>E. coli</italic> B strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>); CS180, from an <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pradel et al., 1992</xref>). One of the differences between the two bacterial strains is the outer core structures of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on their cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier et al., 2010</xref>, and references therein). The OP50 LPS is shorter than the CS180 LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier et al., 2010</xref>). To test if this difference in LPS alters oogenesis onset and fertilization rate, we examined wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte development on <italic>E. coli</italic> CS2429, which is a K-12 strain that is derived from CS180 but has a truncated LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pradel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, like on CS180, worms on CS2429 still displayed a lower number of progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), early oogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), and faster fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This indicates that this difference in LPS structure is insufficient to affect oocyte development.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The CS180 effects on oogenesis are independent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) length and absent in HT115 and other bacteria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The LPS of <italic>E. coli</italic> B and K-12 strains.

This raises the likelihood that other neurons regulate fertilization. In fact, we find that worms lacking ASI, ASK, and AWB neurons fertilize at a slower rate at certain or at all time points on OP50 and CS180, when compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F, and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).

This means that ASI, ASK, and AWB are not required to regulate food-type effects on fertilization, but might have a role that are independent of food. A mechanism that includes several neurons to regulate fertilization would be expected, since it is a dynamic process that proceeds for several days. This makes it necessary for the worms to sense environmental changes continuously and adjust their reproductive physiology accordingly. Thus, the involvement of multiple sensory neurons would make for a more sensitive and efficient physiology.</p><p>Interestingly, at least one of the sensory neurons that inhibits germline proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2017</xref>), ASJ, also promotes food type-dependent early oogenesis (this work).

Hence, distinct ILP signaling mechanisms that can respond to disparate environmental cues might also explain the variability in the number of progeny of <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>ILPs might encode and integrate diverse cues that influence oocyte development. Considering the pleiotropic effects of insulin signaling on metazoan reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das and Arur, 2017</xref>), it is possible that the multiple ILPs present in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2015</xref>) will also have specific roles in coordinating oogenesis with fluctuations in a given environment. Thus, our study suggests that successful fertilization will require the careful integration of multiple environmental inputs through ILPs acting on the germline from neuronal, and potentially non-neuronal, cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and culture</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>General maintenance</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were cultured on NGM agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>) seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, CS180, CS2429, or HT115 or with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> strains.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Patrick J Hu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide more insight into bacterial factors that might be contributing to the CS180 oogenesis phenotype;</p><p>2. Perform oogenesis experiments using an additional readout distinct from the lin-41::GFP reporter;</p><p>3. Strengthen evidence in support the roles of ASJ and INS-6 in mediating the CS180 early oogenesis phenotype (e.g., ASJ-specific deletion of ins-6);</p><p>4. Address the issue of aberrant kinetics of lin-41::GFP expression in the ASJ ablation strain (potentially with a different oogenesis readout).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Lines 84-85: I think the conclusion that the decreased progeny phenotype on CS180 is a readout for oogenesis is premature, as there are no data presented to show that the oocytes in CS180-fed animals are as functional as those from OP50-fed animals. Is there a reduction in cross-progeny from CS180-fed hermaphrodites compared to from those fed OP50?</p><p>2. Lines 173-181 (Figures 4B and 4D): Two issues here. First, the daf-16 data presented in panels B and D differ. Which is correct? Second, daf-16;daf-2 double mutants should be tested; if daf-16 does not suppress the daf-2 phenotype, it might indicate that this is a daf-16-independent function of daf-2, which would be of interest.</p><p>3. Lines 186-188 (Figure 4D): the daf-16;ins-6 data suggest that the roles of ins-6 and daf-16 in this process are complex. daf-16 is epistatic to ins-6, but daf-16 inactivation does not restore the food type difference in progeny that is observed in wild-type animals, as one might expect if INS-6 were simply inhibiting DAF-16 by activating DAF-2. This should be discussed.</p><p>4. Lines 208-209 (Figure 5A): is the ASJ ablation phenotype daf-16-dependent?</p><p>5. Lines 224-226 (Figure 5C): is the ins-6 mutant phenotype daf-16-dependent?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. CS180/OP50 mixing experiments could help indicate whether the onset of oogenesis phenotype, for example, is caused by the presence or absence of something in CS180. But even then, relative to a number of studies that have better defined what microbial determinants induce host changes, the current study is lacking in molecular insight.</p><p>2. The daf-16 loss-of-function phenotype and suppression of daf-2 and ins-6 mutant phenotypes could be performed for the lin-41::GFP expression phenotype.</p><p>3. If the authors insist on arguing that ins-6 expression in ASJ is induced by CS180 vs. OP50 to cause the observed phenotype, which as noted above seems somewhat implausible, then a strain carrying an ASJ-specific loss of ins-6 expression could be generated to provide support for the authors' model, both with respect to the involvement of ins-6 and ASJ in the observed phenotype.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I'd like the authors to address two issues:</p><p>1) The authors test only a very limited set of bacteria and do the experiments at a single temperature (25C), making the generality of these effects hard to extrapolate.

Part of the issue is that the &quot;absolute time&quot; the germ cells spent developing into sperm before switching to oocytes was measured indirectly in the assay by measuring at &quot;developmental milestones&quot; in the soma (ie reaching a phenotypic milestone in the development the vulva) and not absolute time (eg hours post hatching, or hours post molt). I would have preferred the analysis to treat the data as a cumulative distribution of fraction expressing vs time and the comparison to focus on whether there is a shift in the distributions to later time points. But redoing the experiments as longitudinal measurements would be very laborious and unlikely to yield much of a difference. In any case, that shift should result in a change in the proportion of germ cells that developed into sperm, as shown for wild type in figure 1E. The number of sperm is the biologically relevant endpoint measurement, while the fraction expressing ling-41::GFP at some timepoints could be influenced by other variables, such as length of development (which is affected also by insulin signaling: extended in daf-2 mutants). The &quot;total sperm number before fertilization begins&quot; measurements were not done in the ins-6, odr-7 and would be very informative in testing the model that was proposed. In addition, it would be nice to get sperm counts in the daf-16 and daf-2 mutants, which did not fit quite neatly as ins-6 and odr-7 into the proposed division of labor between ASJ and AWA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83224.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Because CS180 is an <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain, we also tested the effects of another <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain on <italic>C. elegans</italic> oogenesis onset. Interestingly, the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 HT115 does not elicit the same response as CS180. Unlike the CS180 diet, but like the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet, HT115 does not promote early oogenesis in wild-type worms. This is shown in Figure 2E of the revised manuscript. Together our data suggest that the bacterial derived cue(s) that promote early oogenesis are specific to CS180 and its derivative CS2429 (Figure 2C).</p><p>To start elucidating the nature of the CS180 cue(s), we filtered CS180-conditioned LB media through a nylon membrane that has a pore size of 0.45 µm. The resultant filtrate was added to worms fed OP50. However, supplementation of OP50 with the CS180 filtrate had no effect on worm oogenesis onset (Figure 2G), which shows that the CS180-derived oogenic-inducing cue(s) were lost upon filtration. This also means that the CS180 cues are unlikely to be free, small metabolites. While the identification of these cues are important, it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Perform oogenesis experiments using an additional readout distinct from the lin-41::GFP reporter;</p></disp-quote><p>We also thank the Reviewers for this suggestion. Thus, we used a second oogenesis marker, <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic> (Lin, Dev Biol 2003, vol 258, pp 226-239). The <italic>oma-1</italic> gene is expressed later than <italic>lin-41</italic> in the differentiating oocytes (Detwiler et al., Dev Cell 2001, vol 1, pp 187-199; reviewed by Albarqi and Ryder, Front Cell Dev Biol 2023, vol 10, 1094295). Through <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic>, we confirmed that wild-type worms fed CS180 underwent earlier oogenesis at mid L4, in contrast to worms fed OP50 (boxed panel in Figure 1I). This observation is consistent with what we saw when wild-type worms express <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> (boxed panel in Figure 1H).</p><p>Moreover, when we ablated the ASJ neurons or deleted the <italic>ins-6</italic> gene in worms expressing <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic>, we saw delayed oogenesis on CS180 (please compare boxed panels in Figure 5E), similar to what we previously observed in <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic>-expressing worms lacking their ASJ neurons or the <italic>ins-6</italic> locus (please compare boxed panels in Figure 5A, D, and F). Together our data support the model that ASJ and <italic>ins-6</italic> are important in promoting early oogenesis at mid L4 when animals are fed an <italic>E. coli</italic> CS180 diet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Strengthen evidence in support the roles of ASJ and INS-6 in mediating the CS180 early oogenesis phenotype (e.g., ASJ-specific deletion of ins-6);</p></disp-quote><p>There is strong evidence from several labs, Zhang’s, Buelow’s and ours, that the <italic>ins-6</italic> expressed from ASI has a different function from the <italic>ins-6</italic> expressed in ASJ (Chen et al., Neuron 2013, vol 77, pp 572-585; Tang et al., Curr Biol 2023, vol 33, pp 3835-3850; and this work). Using the same transgenes that we used in our cell-specific rescue experiments for oogenesis onset, the Zhang lab (Chen et al., 2013) showed that INS-6 from ASI, but not ASJ, rescues the aversive learning phenotype of <italic>ins-6</italic> mutants. We showed a different cell-specific requirement for INS-6 in oogenesis: INS-6 from ASJ, but not ASI, rescues the CS180-dependent oogenesis onset phenotype of <italic>ins-6</italic> mutants (Figure 6B). Recently, findings from the Buelow lab further supported the functional differences between the INS-6 peptides produced from ASI and ASJ (Tang et al., 2023). Tang et al. (2023) showed that <italic>ins-6</italic> from ASJ, and not from ASI, alters the neural circuit that promotes salt-dependent associative learning in adult worms. This could be a general mechanism, since there are published examples in the literature where a secreted peptide shows rescue when expressed from one cell or tissue but not from another (e.g., for the insulin-like peptide INS-1; see Kodama et al., Genes Dev 2006, vol 20, pp 2855-2960; Tomioka et al., Neuron 2006, vol 51, pp 613-625). While the mechanism(s) underlying the functional differences between the INS-6 peptides produced by ASI versus ASJ remain unclear, the neuron-specific activities of INS-6 are undeniable and supported by our data and others in the literature.</p><p>In addition to showing in this manuscript that it is the ASJ-specific expression of <italic>ins-6</italic> that rescues the oogenesis phenotype of <italic>ins-6</italic> mutants on CS180 (Figure 6B), we now removed <italic>ins-6</italic> specifically from ASJ, but not from ASI. During the decision period for oogenesis onset, around the mid-to-late L3 larval stage (Figure 3B), we previously showed that <italic>ins-6</italic> is only expressed in ASI and ASJ neurons, but only ASJ show increased <italic>ins-6</italic> levels on CS180 (Figure 6A). In the revised manuscript, we showed that ASJ-specific deletion of <italic>ins-6</italic> led to a delay in oogenesis onset on the CS180 diet (Figure 6C). Thus, we demonstrated that ASJ-expressed <italic>ins-6</italic> is both sufficient and necessary to promote early oogenesis on CS180.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

With this in mind, it is to be expected that loss of ASJ might have a more dramatic effect on oogenesis than the deletion of <italic>ins-6</italic> alone, which is a more precise experimental manipulation than eliminating all ASJ-expressed signals.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ recommendation, we did use a second oogenesis marker, <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic> (Lin, 2003; please see our response above, Essential Revisions, comment 2). Based on the temporal expression of the two oogenesis markers, <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> and <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic>, our data support the model that ASJ and <italic>ins-6</italic> are important in promoting early oogenesis at mid L4 when animals are fed <italic>E. coli</italic> CS180.</p><p>The stronger phenotype observed with <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> expression than with <italic>oma-1::GFP</italic> expression upon ablation of ASJ (please compare Figure 5A and E) might be explained by the different temporal requirements and functions of these two genes (Detwiler et al., 2001; Albarqi and Ryder, 2023). Not only is <italic>lin-41</italic> expressed prior to <italic>oma-1</italic> during oogenesis, but <italic>oma-1</italic> also acts redundantly with another RNA-binding protein <italic>oma-2</italic> (Albarqi and Ryder, 2023). Thus, it is possible that multiple signals in ASJ regulate the multiple functions of <italic>lin-41</italic> during oocyte development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Lines 84-85: I think the conclusion that the decreased progeny phenotype on CS180 is a readout for oogenesis is premature, as there are no data presented to show that the oocytes in CS180-fed animals are as functional as those from OP50-fed animals. Is there a reduction in cross-progeny from CS180-fed hermaphrodites compared to from those fed OP50?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that decreased progeny on CS180 might be a readout for more than oogenesis onset. Thus, we qualified this statement in the manuscript by presenting it as a hypothesis that total progeny can reflect earlier oogenesis on CS180 (lines 89-90). Indeed, we later showed that the two phenotypes can be uncoupled, since the mechanism(s) that regulate total progeny are not the same as those that regulate oogenesis onset. First, both <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 bacteria, CS180 and HT115, reduce the total progeny of wild-type worms, in contrast to the <italic>E. coli</italic> B strain OP50 (Figure 2—supplement 1). However, of the three bacterial strains, only CS180 elicited earlier oogenesis (Figure 2E). Second, the loss of food-type differences in the total progeny of <italic>ins-6</italic> mutants was restored when <italic>daf-16</italic> was also deleted (Figure 4B, D, and E). This suggested that the effect of <italic>ins-6</italic> on this phenotype is <italic>daf-16</italic>-dependent. Yet, we showed that to promote early oogenesis, <italic>ins-6</italic> acts independent of <italic>daf-16</italic> (Figure 5F), highlighting the mechanistic differences that underlie the two phenotypes.</p><p>Are oocytes of CS180-fed animals more functional or less functional than the oocytes of OP50-fed animals? While we have not assessed the cross-progeny of CS180-fed animals versus those of OP50-fed animals, which is beyond the scope of this manuscript, we did show that the oocytes of CS180-fed animals are fertilized faster than oocytes of OP50-fed animals (Figure 1D). Animals on CS180 produced more live progeny within the first 24 hours of adulthood than animals on OP50 (please see “Measuring the rates of fertilization” in the Materials and methods section). This would argue against a reduction in functionality of the oocytes of CS180-fed animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lines 173-181 (Figures 4B and 4D): Two issues here. First, the daf-16 data presented in panels B and D differ. Which is correct?

After multiple trials, we found that the number of progeny of <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants is variable (Figure 4B and E, Figure 4—supplement 1). However, <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants do exhibit food-type differences in their number of progeny (Figure 4B and E). In this manuscript, we focused on the epistasis analysis between <italic>ins-6</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> (please see below). The DAF-2 receptor can bind multiple ILP ligands from multiple cells, some of which might be <italic>daf-16</italic>-dependent, while others might be <italic>daf-16</italic>-independent, in influencing an animal’s number of progeny.

Lines 186-188 (Figure 4D): the daf-16;ins-6 data suggest that the roles of ins-6 and daf-16 in this process are complex. daf-16 is epistatic to ins-6, but daf-16 inactivation does not restore the food type difference in progeny that is observed in wild-type animals, as one might expect if INS-6 were simply inhibiting DAF-16 by activating DAF-2. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to comment 1 of the Reviewer, the food type-dependent effect of <italic>ins-6</italic> on total progeny requires <italic>daf-16</italic>. The loss of food-type differences in the number of progeny of <italic>ins-6</italic> mutants is restored when <italic>daf-16</italic> was also removed in these animals (Figure 4E). On the other hand, we observed that <italic>ins-6</italic> acts independent of <italic>daf-16</italic> in promoting early oogenesis on CS180 (Figure 5F). A worm’s number of progeny will be affected by the timing of the spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch and by successful fertilization. Thus, <italic>daf-16-</italic>dependent and <italic>daf-16</italic>-independent mechanisms that regulate both aspects of oocyte biology and that can respond to different environmental cues might explain the variability in the total progeny phenotype of <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants.

CS180/OP50 mixing experiments could help indicate whether the onset of oogenesis phenotype, for example, is caused by the presence or absence of something in CS180. But even then, relative to a number of studies that have better defined what microbial determinants induce host changes, the current study is lacking in molecular insight.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study focused on how specific sensory neurons mediate the effects of different bacterial diets on three different aspects of <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive physiology—total progeny, oogenesis onset and fertilization rates. We examined the effects of three different bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, CS180 and CS2429, on these three phenotypes and the effects of two <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> strains, Db11 and Db1140, on oogenesis onset. Of these five bacteria, only CS180 and its derivative CS2429, promote early <italic>C. elegans</italic> oogenesis.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we included the effects of a fourth <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, the K-12 HT115 on total progeny (Figure 2—supplement 1), oogenesis onset (Figure 2E) and fertilization rates (Figure 2F). We found that HT115 does not elicit the same response as CS180 on oogenesis onset and fertilization rates. Thus, the oogenic-inducing and fertilization-enhancing cue(s) appear to be specific to CS180 and its derivative CS2429. We started characterizing the potential nature of these CS180-derived cue(s). So far, we found that these cues are unlikely to be free, small metabolites, since they were lost upon filtration of the CS180-conditioned LB media through a nylon membrane that has a pore size of 0.45 µm (Figure 2G and H). While we agree with the Reviewer that the identification of these cues are important, we believe that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>More importantly, we showed that the sensory neuron ASJ does modulate the timing of oogenesis and that this involves the insulin-like peptide <italic>ins-6</italic> (please see our responses to the Essential Revisions section and Figures 5 and 6). We also showed that ASJ (Figure 7G and K) or <italic>ins-6</italic> (Figure 8D) does not affect the food type-dependent fertilization rates, which are modulated by a different sensory neuron, the olfactory neuron AWA (Figure 7J and K). AWA in turn has no effect on the timing of oogenesis (Figure 7L). Thus, this manuscript links specific sensory neurons and insulin-like peptides to distinct aspects of oocyte biology, which we believe is a significant advance in the field of reproductive biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The daf-16 loss-of-function phenotype and suppression of daf-2 and ins-6 mutant phenotypes could be performed for the lin-41::GFP expression phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted an epistasis analysis between <italic>ins-6</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> with regard to early oogenesis onset on the CS180 diet. Through recombination of <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> with the <italic>daf-16</italic> deletion mutation on chromosome I, we showed that <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants exhibit early oogenesis at mid L4 on CS180 (Figure 5C and F), which is unlike the <italic>ins-6</italic> deletion (null) mutants or the reduction-of-function mutations in <italic>daf-2</italic>. Both <italic>ins-6</italic> and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants exhibit delayed oogenesis on CS180 (Figure 5B, D, and F). Interestingly, the delayed oogenesis phenotype of <italic>ins-6</italic> null mutants was not rescued by loss of <italic>daf-16</italic>, suggesting that wild-type <italic>ins-6</italic> promotes early oogenesis independent of <italic>daf-16</italic> (Figure 5F). This is reminiscent of the Arur lab’s findings, where <italic>daf-2</italic> promotes germline meiotic progression independent of <italic>daf-16</italic> in response to food availability (Lopez et al., Dev Cell 2013, vol 27, pp 227-240).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. If the authors insist on arguing that ins-6 expression in ASJ is induced by CS180 vs. OP50 to cause the observed phenotype, which as noted above seems somewhat implausible, then a strain carrying an ASJ-specific loss of ins-6 expression could be generated to provide support for the authors' model, both with respect to the involvement of ins-6 and ASJ in the observed phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this in Essential revisions, point 3. Briefly, we disagree that this is puzzling, since several labs have already shown that there are functional differences between the INS-6 produced from ASI versus the INS-6 produced from ASJ, using different experimental approaches (Chen et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2023; and this work). Indeed, the cell-specific activities of a secreted signal is not limited to INS-6, but has also been described for other secreted peptides, such as INS-1 (Kodama et al., 2006; Tomioka et al., 2006; Takeishi et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020, vol 9, e61167). Thus, the interesting question is why functional differences exist between the INS-6 peptides from the two neurons. This is a fascinating question, but beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>We disagree that [the <italic>ins-6</italic> change in expression in ASJ] is modest and that the oogenic effect of such a change is implausible.</p><p>First, the change in <italic>ins-6p::mCherry</italic> expression in ASJ on CS180 is comparable to other physiologically-important expression changes that have been reported for other genes (for example, Entchev et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015, vol 4, 4:e06259, for the tryptophan hydroxylase <italic>tph-1</italic> and the TGF-β <italic>daf-7</italic>; and Tataridas-Pallas et al., PLoS Genet 2021, vol 17, e1009358, for the neuronally expressed NRF transcription factor <italic>skn-1b</italic>). Second, it is worth noting that we were using a single-copy reporter for <italic>ins-6</italic> expression, where detected changes will be smaller but should be closer to physiological responses. It is possible that multiple-copy reporters will give larger changes, but that would be further from a physiological response. Third, the change in <italic>ins-6p::mCherry</italic> expression is comparable in scale to the <italic>ins-6</italic> mutant phenotype. Our results showed that the 35% increase in ASJ expression of <italic>ins-6</italic> is due to food type (Figure 6A; mean fluorescence on OP50 = 1526 + 94; mean fluorescence on CS180 = 2056 + 104). This change in magnitude is similar to the loss of <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic> expression in mid L4 of <italic>ins-6</italic> mutants versus controls. About 30% to 43% of control worms express <italic>lin-41::GFP</italic>, whereas 0% of <italic>ins-6</italic> mutants express the same reporter at mid L4 on CS180 (Figure 5 and its associated supplement).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I'd like the authors to address two issues:</p><p>1) The authors test only a very limited set of bacteria and do the experiments at a single temperature (25C), making the generality of these effects hard to extrapolate.
