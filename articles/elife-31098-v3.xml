target oncogenic RAS signaling from inside the cell, little effort has focused on the cell-surface. Here, we used quantitative surface proteomics to reveal a signature of proteins that are upregulated on cells transformed with KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, and driven by MAPK pathway signaling. We next generated a toolkit of recombinant antibodies to seven of these RAS-induced proteins. We found that five of these proteins are broadly distributed on cancer cell lines harboring RAS mutations. In parallel, a cell-surface CRISPRi screen identified integrin and Wnt signaling proteins as critical to RAS-transformed cells. We show that antibodies targeting CDCP1, a protein common to our proteomics and CRISPRi datasets, can be leveraged to deliver cytotoxic and immunotherapeutic payloads to RAS-transformed cancer cells and report for RAS signaling status in vivo. Taken together, this work presents a technological platform for attacking RAS from outside the cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer target discovery</kwd><kwd>antibody engineering</kwd><kwd>oncogenic RAS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA191018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinko</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name><name><surname>Julien</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006436</institution-id><institution>Celgene</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinko</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM097316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinko</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name><name><surname>Julien</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowships Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinko</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomics and functional genomics coupled to an antibody discovery pipeline revealed the influence of oncogenic RAS signaling on the cell-surface proteome and resulted in the discovery of potential therapeutic targets for RAS-driven cancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>RAS is a family of three ubiquitously expressed small GTPases found in all animal cell types. RAS is localized to the intracellular leaflet of the cell membrane where it serves as a major communication hub that relays extracellular growth factor-dependent signaling to as many as a dozen different intracellular signaling pathways, including the classically studied MAPK and PI3K pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Downward, 2003</xref>). Collectively, these pathways induce dramatic changes to cells including transcriptional reprogramming, promotion of cell survival, suppression of apoptosis, metabolic rewiring, promotion of proliferation, and increased cell invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). Many of these phenotypes are well-known hallmarks of cancer survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Nearly one third of all human malignancies areÂ driven by mutational activation of one of the three RAS isoforms: KRAS, NRAS and HRAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roberts and Der, 2007</xref>). Hence, oncogenic RAS has been an important focus of the cancer biology and drug discovery communities for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ledford, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stephen et al., 2014</xref>). In efforts to identify tractable drug targets in RAS-driven cancers, tremendous research emphasis has been placed on understanding oncogenic RAS and its role in the dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Papke and Der, 2017</xref>). Despite these intense efforts to target intracellular pathways, little is understood about how RAS signaling can regulate the cell surface proteome, the surfaceome.</p><p>The surfaceome represents the dominant means by which cells communicate, interact, obtain nutrients, and engage the immune system. Overexpression of oncogenic RAS in model cell lines contributes to loss of adhesion, increased invasive properties, and evasion of immune responses, phenotypes that depend on the function of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that RAS-driven transcriptional reprogramming coordinately regulates the expression of cell surface proteins to exert malignant phenotypes. We believe systematic efforts are needed to identify the influence of oncogenic RASÂ on surface protein expression. Such studies would aid in progressing our fundamental understanding of how RAS drives malignancy. Additionally, they may lead to the identification of novel targets for next generation antibody and cellular therapy based intervention in RAS-driven cancers.</p><p>Here, we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics on an isogenic diploid epithelial cell model, MCF10A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soule et al., 1990</xref>), to measure the influence of oncogenic KRAS signaling on the expression of proteins in the surfaceome. We find that KRAS dramatically alters the expression of membrane proteins and coordinately regulates groups of proteins critical for managing cell adhesion and migration. Using pharmacological inhibitors to interrogate the contribution of individual effector pathways, we find that the oncogenic KRAS-induced changes in the surfaceome are driven predominantly through the MAPK effector pathway. From these discovery efforts, we derived a panel of recombinant antibodies to half a dozen of these differentially expressed targets, and applied the antibodies to confirm their surface expression patterns in a panel of mutant KRAS-driven cancer cell lines.</p><p>To further focus our efforts on those upregulated surface targets that are most critical for KRAS- driven cell growth, we conducted a CRISPRi screen to assess the relative functional importance of more than 1600 proteins in the oncogenic KRAS surfaceome as compared to control cells. We discovered KRAS-transformed cells have a selective dependence on the surfaceome to maintain both Integrin and Wnt signaling, pathways critical for regulation of adhesion and cell migration, respectively. One of these targets, <underline>C</underline>UB <underline>D</underline>omain <underline>C</underline>ontaining <underline>P</underline>rotein 1 (CDCP1), a protein known to drive loss of adhesion through integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casar et al., 2014</xref>), was a common hit in both our MS and CRISPRi screens. We focused on this example and showed that recombinant antibodies to CDCP1 can be used to selectively deliver therapeutic cytotoxic payloads or recruit and activate T-cells to pancreatic cancer cells while sparing normal control cells. We further show in mouse xenograft models for pancreatic cancer that CDCP1 expression level is an abundant biomarker for RAS signaling through the MAPK signaling pathway. Our studies provide a mechanism for how oncogenic KRAS can influence the expression and function of membrane proteins, and how this knowledge can be leveraged to identify potential targets to attack RAS from outside the cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the oncogenic KRAS surfaceome</title><p>The three major cancer types in which RAS mutations are the most prevalent (pancreatic, lung, and colorectal) all arise from epithelial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stephen et al., 2014</xref>). To begin to isolate the effects of KRAS transformation on the cell surfaceome, we chose a well-characterized, non-tumorigenic immortalized epithelial cell line, MCF10A, to generate an isogenic model for KRAS transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Debnath et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martins et al., 2015</xref>). The diploid MCF10A cell line is often used for oncogenic transformation studies because it is non-malignant and harbors only small genetic modifications typical of a culture adapted cell line. In addition, MCF10As are readily transduced with lentivirus, which enabled the rapid generation of the isogenic model as well as the possibility to engineer these cells further for downstream validation studies. Importantly, MCF10A cells stably transduced with oncogenic KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> undergo numerous phenotypic changes characteristic of malignant transformation, including increased proliferation and significant loss of cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stolze et al., 2015</xref>). While MCF10A cells are mammary in origin, and RAS is rarely implicated in breast cancer, we believe that the benefits of this model outweighs this caveat. Moreover, we hypothesized RAS signaling in any epithelial cell type would result in a common transcriptional program and signature of cell-surface protein expression. Recently, we showed using initial proteomics discovery experiments that the surfaceome does indeed change substantially in MCF10A cells expressing oncogenic KRAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). However, to determine the therapeutic potential of exploiting differences in the surfaceome in RAS-driven cancers, we needed to quantitatively measure the extent to which these proteins change.</p><p>To measure changes in the cell surface proteome in an unbiased manner, we applied the recently established glycoprotein capture and enrichment proteomic method. This is advantageous because greater than 90% of surface proteins contain Asn-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schiess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wollscheid et al., 2009</xref>). We adapted the method to quantitatively compare the surface protein levels on the two isogenic cell lines, MCF10A cells with or without oncogenic KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ong and Mann, 2006</xref>). Isotopically labeled cells were harvested and treated with sodium periodate to oxidize the vicinal diols on the cell surface glycans. Subsequently, cells were treated with biocytin-hydrizide to label the oxidized glycans with biotin for pull-down and enrichment. The proteins were captured on streptavidin beads, trypsinized, washed, and N-glycosylated peptides were released from the beads by N-glycanase (PNGase) treatment. Released peptides were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oncogenic KRAS signaling coordinately regulates the expression of cell surface proteins in a model epithelial cell.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental strategy for quantitative SILAC surface proteomics to compare surfaceomes of MCF10A empty vector cells to MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells (Top), or MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells treated with vehicle versus RAS pathway inhibitors (Bottom).

Of 2943 tryptic peptides, 1460 contained the deamidated asparagine mass (0.984 Da) shift generated by N-glycanase treatment, providing high confidence it contained an asparagine-linked modification. Next, we eliminated proteins for which only a single peptide was identified, to distill to a higher confidence set. Lastly, the data were filtered bioinformatically to isolate proteins annotated in UniProt to be localized to the cell surface, resulting in 1257 high confidence peptides originating from 258 membrane-associated proteins found in both light and heavy samples. Biological replicates showed 88% overlap in the common membrane proteins identified, and good correlation in terms of SILAC ratios (R<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.7676) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). In total, we identified 17 proteins that were significantly upregulated, and 22 that were significantly downregulated (fold-change &gt;Â±1.75; p-value&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; The full dataset can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these significantly altered proteins in our datasets revealed significant enrichment for proteins involved in cell adhesion, cell motion, and cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next wanted to understand how different signaling pathways emanating from RAS were contributing to the changes we observed in the surfaceome. We employed the same proteomics approach but instead examined the consequences of treatment with well-established pharmacological inhibitors, MEKi (PD0325901) and AKTi (MK2206) that block the two classic pathways downstream of RAS, MAPK and PI3K respectfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>). As a control, we also tested the effect of Gefitinib, which inhibits EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase found upstream of RAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moasser et al., 2001</xref>). In each experiment, isotopically labeled MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells were treated with subtoxic concentrations of drug for 72 hr and compared to non-isotopically labeled vehicle treated MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For the MEKi experiment, we were able to quantify the relative expression levels of 250 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; The full dataset can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Biological replicates showed similar overlap and reasonable correlation in fold-changes in expressionÂ Â±Â MEKi (R<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.61), indicating biological and technical reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). Remarkably, 13 of the proteins that were significantly altered by KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> signaling were reversibly influenced by MEKi in the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, when the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells were treated with AKTi or EGFRi, very few significant changes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>; Full datasets can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for AKTi and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for EGFRi). Others have shown the importance of the MAPK pathway for RAS-mediated transformation and tumerogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roberts and Der, 2007</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, our findings indicate that the MAPK pathway is the dominant pathway by which RAS mediates influence on the surfaceome in the MCF10A model. Taken together with our unbiased GO analysis, these results suggest a model wherein RAS signaling through the MAPK pathway promotes the coordinate expression of proteins that may contribute to increased invasiveness, metastasis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition.</p><p>To further characterize the influence of oncogenic KRAS on the surface proteome, we performed RNAseq on both the MCF10A empty vector control and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells. The correlation between expression level changes observed in the SILAC proteomic data with those from RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>;Â TheÂ full RNAseq dataset can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.) was modest but significant (R2Â = 0.422). This modest correlation is not surprising as there are many possible points of regulation between synthesis of an mRNA and trafficking of a protein to the cell surface that can blur the connection between steady state RNA and protein levels. Others have reported aÂ similar degree of correlation between levels of cytosolic proteins and their mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lundberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">SchwanhÃ¤usser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wiita et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the combination of the proteomic and transcriptomic data reinforces that KRAS transformation drives significant and coordinated changes in the cell surface. Additionally, we identified a large cluster of genes found to be upregulated in both data setsÂ thatÂ provides a set of high-confidence KRAS signaling surface markers for further validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation of recombinant antibodies that target the KRAS surfaceome</title><p>In order to orthogonally validate these results in a variety of cellular settings, we soughtrobust antibody tools to detect and study KRAS regulated surfaceome proteins. Unfortunately, recombinant monoclonal antibodies are not commercially available for the vast majority of cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wollscheid et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, others have shown that up to half of all commercially available antibodies are unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker, 2015</xref>). Hence, we sought to generate and validate recombinant monoclonal antibodies using antibody phage display for a set of the most interesting KRAS-induced targets. Recombinant antibodies are particularly useful as they are renewable, thus creating a reliable resource. Furthermore, they can be bioengineered for many useful applications including therapeutic payload delivery and in vivo imaging. We leveraged the quantitative proteomic and RNAseq data to manually choose seven high-confidence KRAS-induced single-pass transmembrane receptors to advance to a recombinant antibody engineering campaign. We chose single-pass receptors as they are more amenable to antibody discovery using soluble extracellular domains (ECD) and were well-represented in our data. All candidates were at least 2-fold upregulated as observed by mass spectrometry in the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells as compared to empty vector. In most cases, the candidates were also at least 2-fold upregulated in the same context as determined by RNAseq. The representative targets had a range of functions critical for tumor survival. For example, CDCP1, ICAM1, and ITGB5 all play roles in cell adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huttenlocher and Horwitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kevil et al., 2004</xref>); NT5E is a nucleotidase that contributes to immune cell evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonioli et al., 2016</xref>); LTBR is a cytokine receptor involved in maintenance of lymphoid microenvrionments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lukashev et al., 2006</xref>); CD55 is a complement system inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 1999</xref>), and ANPEP is a protease thought important for metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">SÃ¸rensen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To enable the rapid expression and purification of these target proteins for generation of antibodies by phage display, we expressed their ECDs as Fc-fusion proteins in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czajkowsky et al., 2012</xref>). We introduced a biotin-acceptor-tag at the C-terminus, and a TEV proteolysis site between the ECD and Fc-domain. These tags allowed for site-selective capture of the ECD-Fc fusion on magnetic streptavidin beads, and release of each ECD containing bound Fab-phage after TEV treatment. This âcatch-and-releaseâ strategy ensured selective release of Fab-phage bound to each ECD, while avoiding enrichment of unwanted Fab-phage that either bound the Fc-domain or the streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hornsby et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To facilitate production of the biotinylated construct, a stable HEK293T cell line was engineered to overexpress the bacterial biotin ligase, BirA, with an ER retention tag. This allowed for site-specific biotinylation to be performed in cells, thus eliminating the need for in vitro labeling. Western blots confirmed that these cells expressed and secreted quantitatively (typicallyÂ &gt;90%) biotinylated Fc-fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Each Fc-fusion protein was transiently expressed in the engineered HEK293T cells and purified by Protein A affinity purification from the media for use in phage-antibody selections. We conducted 4 rounds of âcatch-and-releaseâ selections with a well-validated synthetic Fab-phage library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Persson et al., 2013</xref>). After each selection, we isolated 95 individual phage clones and screened them for target binding by phage ELISA followed by DNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Selections resulted in the identification of 116 unique antigen-binding sequences against the seven ECD-Fc fusion targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). None of these clones demonstrated appreciable binding to the Fc-domains fused to the antigen, a testimony to the efficiency of the catch-and-release strategy.

Firstly, we generated a stable cell line for each target that overexpressed the protein ECD fused to a fluorescent protein expression reporter and a generic single-pass transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Selections to each of the seven targets produced multiple antibodies showing dramatically increased binding to cells over-expressing the target ECD as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). We further validated the specificity of the antibodies using CRISPRi knockdown of each target in the MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>). In each case, we identified at least one antibody that showed significant staining on the MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells and little to no binding for the CRISPRi knockdown corresponding cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Importantly, these data also corroborated the proteomics observation that these membrane proteins are highly expressed in the MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Validation of oncogenic KRAS-induced membrane proteins</title><p>To orthogonally validate the observations made by MS-based proteomics and RNAseq analysis, we measured the relative cell-surface abundance of each protein by flow cytometry using our recombinant antibodies.

Moreover, the flow cytometry data generated with the Fabs generally correlatedÂ well with the proteomic measurements.

These three cancer types have the highest occurrence of oncogenic KRAS. For five of the seven targets (CDCP1, CD55 NT5E, ICAM1 and LTBR) we observed high levels of expression in at least half of the eight cancer cell lines. Most strikingly we observed that one protein, CDCP1, was ubiquitously abundant in expression across the entire panel. In contrast, two of the proteins, ANPEP and ITGA5, showed little detectable expression in all cases. In general, variability of expression should not be surprising, as these cells vary in tissue origin and also harbor other cancer driving mutations beyond oncogenic RAS. While ANPEP and ITGA5 may be present if we were to screen a larger panel of cells, another possibility is that they are proteins specific to the MCF10A cell surface. A HEK293T control showed no expression of any of the targets.</p><p>We next tested by immunostaining how RAS pathway inhibitors would affect the expression of these seven target proteins. Indeed, most of these proteins (CD55, NT5E, CDCP1, and ICAM1) had expressionÂ levels that wereÂ affected by KRAS pathway perturbation, while inhibition upstream of KRAS by EGFRi had little effect in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, AKTi inhibition caused increased expression of CDCP1, NT5E, and CD55 in multiple cases. A potential explanation is that MK-2206 inhibition resulted in feedback-driven MAPK signaling as has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iida et al., 2013</xref>). Also notable was that MEK inhibition resulted in highly decreased CDCP1 expression levels in nearly every cell line tested. This is consistent with our observations in the MCF10A cells and with previous reports in mutant RAS non-small cell lung cancer cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uekita et al., 2014</xref>). We further validated this result by western blot, demonstrating that MAPK signaling drives both CDCP1 expression and cell-surface localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, our antibody profiling providesÂ corroborative evidence that oncogenic RAS influences the expression of specificÂ membrane proteins at the cell surface. We believe this collection of highly specific recombinant antibodies constitute an expandable and enriched tool kit that may be useful for interrogating RAS-transformed cells and tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Functional characterization of the KRAS surfaceome in MCF10As using a CRISPRi screen</title><p>In addition to identifying proteins upregulated by expression of oncogenic KRAS, we explored how oncogenic KRAS signaling can influence howÂ cells depend onÂ specific surface proteins. We tested the impact on cell proliferation of selective knockdown of more than 1600 annotated membrane proteins using CRISPRi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; The sequences of all sgRNAs in the library can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). These target proteins included nearly all of those found in our mass spectrometry screen. We introduced the stable expression of dCas9-KRAB into both the wild type and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> MCF10A cells using well-established constructs and standard lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). We transduced a surfaceome targeted lentiviral sgRNA library consisting of 5 sgRNAs per gene and 150 non-targeting controls into either the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> MCF10A or the parental cell line. Cells were grown for 12 days, and at least 10 doublings. The MCF10A cells require the addition of growth factors (EGF, Insulin) to proliferate, whereas KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> MCF10A cells are growth factor independent. Thus, we screened the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> MCF10A cells with and without growth factors in an attempt to maintain KRAS addiction while knocking down genes. After conducting the three screens, cells were harvested and genomic DNA was isolated. The sgRNA barcodes were PCR amplified and subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify the effect of each sgRNA on growth rate. Genes were scored based on the average phenotype of the three strongest sgRNAs and p-values were calculated by a Mann-Whitney test against a non-targeting control set as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kampmann et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, individualÂ knockdown of more than fifty genes caused a significant reduction (phenotype&lt;-1 and p-value&lt;0.05) in growth rate in the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells grown without growth factor, while only four genes caused a significant growth advantage when knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; The full datasets for all three screening conditions can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

Not surprisingly, EGFR was critical for growth of wild type MCF10A grown in the presence of EGF. However, it was not critical to the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells grown either in the presence or absence of growth factors, which reflects the fact that constitutively active KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> can drive the growth of these cells independent of EGFR signaling. Furthermore, the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells showed a strong dependence on proteins within the MAPK signaling pathway (RAF/MEK/ERK) and little to no dependence on the PI3K/AKT pathway, consistent with previous reports highlighting the importance of RAS-driven MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roberts and Der, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, RALGDS, a lesser-studied RAS effector protein, was of intermediate importance relative to MAPK and PI3K. Taken together, these results provide mechanistic insight as to how oncogenic KRAS drives signaling in MCF10A transformed cells. These self-consistent data in MCF10A cells recapitulate many known features of oncogenic RAS signaling, and rationalize the CRISPRi screening results. The set of genes that are critical for the growth factor independent proliferation of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells but unimportant for the growth of wild type cells notably fell into two main categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). One group constitutes core components of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, while the other included major proteins involved in Wnt signaling. Recently, others have observed an essential role for Wnt signaling in KRAS malignancies, a finding which our data recapitulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the CRISPRi results suggest a previously underappreciated dependency on integrin signaling proteins at the cell surface for growth factor independent proliferation driven by oncogenic KRAS.</p><p>Remarkably, there was very little overlap for proteins upregulated by KRAS as measured by mass spectrometry, and those showing synthetic growth reduction with KRAS in the CRISPRi screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This is not surprising since differential expression and acquired essentiality are different properties. However, two genes were identified as hits in both experiments, ITGB5 and CDCP1. CDCP1 has been previously implicated as an elevated marker in solid cancers and a driver of cancer cell growth, metastasis, and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikeda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leroy et al., 2015</xref>). CDCP1 was also observed in our earlier discovery proteomics screen using several membrane enrichment methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, several groups have demonstrated that CDCP1 signaling can be mediated by interactions with integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wright et al., 2016</xref>). Using an individual sgRNA to CDCP1, we observed aÂ ~40% reduction in growth over 15 days of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells with CDCP1 knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We confirmed that CDCP1 was indeedÂ &gt;98% reduced in expression by antibody staining.</p><p>While our results provide a large number of interesting proteins for follow-up, we decided to focus on targeting CDCP1 with our validated recombinant antibodies. Our antibodies did not appear to functionally inhibit CDCP1 (data not shown), however, we were motivated by the fact that we find it over-expressed in many RAS-driven cell lines. Moreover, its importance to growthmakes it unlikely to be down-regulated as a resistance mechanism. These qualities suggest that CDCP1 could be a particularly attractive target for an antibody drug conjugate (ADC).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Antibodies can selectively deliver toxic and immunotherapy payloads to mutant KRAS pancreatic cancer cells</title><p>Oncogenic KRAS is nearly ubiquitously expressed in pancreatic cancers and these cancers are particularly dependent on MAPK pathway signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eser et al., 2014</xref>).

Having the recombinant form facilitated simple conversion of the Fab to an IgG1 for the experiment. The HPAC or non-tumorigenic HPNE cells were treated with CDCP1 IgG1 that can bind a commercially available secondary antibody coupled to a non-cell permeable cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor, Monomethyl Auorstatin F (MMAF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that while the normal HPNE cells were unaffected by treatment of up to 20 nM of antibody complex, oncogenic KRAS containing HPAC cells were sensitive to ADC treatment at concentrations as low as 10pM. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). More than 60% reduction of viability was observed at 0.8 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that the CDCP1-selective antibody can selectively internalize and deliver the cytotoxic payload. Similar levels of toxicity were observed in two additional mutant RAS cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). It is not surprising that all cells were not killed since these are rapidly dividing cells in culture that create a steady state of apoptosis and proliferation. It is also possible that directly coupling MMAF to the recombinant antibody could further improve its potency as an ADC.</p><p>Recently, the FDA approved the first example of a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody immunotherapy that binds both a tumor selective antigen, and CD3 on the surface of cytotoxic T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). The BiTE recruits the T-cell to the tumor cell, induces T-cell activation, and tumor cell killing. Many similar BiTEs are currently being tested in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuraszeck et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that the CDCP1 recombinant Fab could be engineered in a BiTE modality to selectively target oncogenic KRAS PDAC cells. We genetically fused the CDCP1 Fab to the clinically utilized OKT3 anti-CD3 scFv, and tested whether it could mediate T-cell activation with an NFAT-GFP reporter Jurkat T-cell in co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Remarkably, 1 nM of the CDCP1 BiTE was sufficient to activate 75% of T-cells when co-cultured with mutant KRAS HPAC cells, while co-culture with HPNE cells, or treatment with BiTE lacking the anti-CD3 scFv, resulted in minimal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Application of antibodies for in-vivo detection of oncogenic RAS-dependent MAPK signaling</title><p>As a final proof of concept application of our antibodies, we tested to see whether CDCP1 expression level could be used as an in vivo imaging marker for RAS signaling in a mouse xenograft model for pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The CDCP1-4A06 Fab was labeled with a positron-emitting radioisotope <sup>89</sup>Zr and used for positron-emission-tomography (PET) imaging in mice with mutant RAS HPAC xenographs. As a negative control, <sup>89</sup>Zr-Fab was heat denatured prior to administration. As an additional control, we used xenograft mouse models with A549 cells that express only 60,000 copies of CDCP1 per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Although A549 cells also harbor an oncogenic RAS mutation, previous work has shown that growth and MAPK signaling in these cells are not significantly diminished by knockdown of KRAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). Within four hours of administration of the <sup>89</sup>Zr-Fab, tumor localization was observed, and by eight hours staining was highly pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Significantly reduced tumor staining was observed using the heat denatured <sup>89</sup>Zr-Fab. Strikingly, in the HPAC xenograft mice treated with subtoxic MEKi, <sup>89</sup>Zr-Fab tumor localization was also highly diminished. These animal data provide further evidence to the hypothesis that CDCP1 expression is a direct consequence of RAS dependent MAPK signaling even in the complex milieu of a tumor. Excised tumors were used to quantify PET signal, confirming the trends seen in the qualitative images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>)</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Exploiting an unbiased approach of globally and quantitatively profiling the oncogenic RAS surfaceome that relies on MS-based proteomics and CRISPRi targeted screening, we begin to demonstrate the logic of how constitutive RAS activation influences the expression and function of membrane proteins to exert oncogenic phenotypes. Our results suggest that RAS signaling can coordinately regulate a network of surface proteins in order to drive malignant hallmarks such as loss of adhesion, cell migration, and cell growth. Specifically, our work reveals that proteins involved in integrin signaling are enriched both in terms of function and expression level at the RAS cell surface. For example, we observed that cells with oncogenic KRAS display high expression levels of several integrins (ITGB5/ITGB1/ITGA5/ITGA3) in combination with CDCP1. Previous work has identified a signaling axis through which CDCP1/integrin complexes can drive AKT dependent loss of adhesion, cell growth, and anti-anoikis signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casar et al., 2014</xref>). We found that knockdown of CDCP1 or ITGB5 slows the growth of cells addicted to RAS signaling, supporting the idea that oncogenic RAS promotes the expression of these proteins to enable tumor cell growth. This also suggests that the invasive potential and propensity for metastasis of RAS-driven cancers may partially be a consequence of these differentially expressed proteins working in concert. Furthermore, the evidence for this signaling axis is found in the TCGA for pancreatic cancer, where CDCP1 and all four identified integrins show significantly elevated mRNA levels in cancers with RAS mutations.</p><p>Activation of RAS can lead to signaling through a dozen effector pathways; however, our work suggests that the MAPK pathway is most important for regulating the surface proteome. Nearly half of the proteins we observed to be enriched on the surface of KRAS-transformed MCF10As were decreased in expression level when cells were treated with a MEK inhibitor. Conversely, treatment with EGF and AKT inhibition had little consequence on this set of RAS enriched membrane proteins. Consistent with this observation, we found the same cells were sensitive to knockdown of proteins in the MAPK pathway, but insensitive to CRISPRi knockdown of proteins involved in PI3K signaling. We used CDCP1 as an example to validate that these observations extend beyond MCF10As to patient derived cancer cell lines and even to xenograft mouse models for PDAC. These data provide mechanistic insight from the perspective of cell surface proteins to support previous reports that the MAPK pathway is the most potent of the RAS effector pathways in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and oncogenesis. Furthermore, our data suggest that a subset of these proteins could serve as new biomarkers for both RAS dependent MAPK signaling and drug efficacy of MAPK pathway inhibitors.</p><p>Our follow up investigation of CDCP1 exemplifies the utility of our technological pipeline, validates our approach of studying RAS signaling in a simple isogenic MCF10A model, and most importantly, provides a validated example of a cell surface marker for oncogenic RAS signaling in multiple cancer types. Our initial observation that CDCP1 expression was driven by RAS dependent MAPK signaling in MCF10As was recapitulated in more than a dozen mutant RAS cancer cell lines as well as an in vivo model for pancreatic cancer. While previous work has suggested a connection between RAS signaling and CDCP1 in lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uekita et al., 2014</xref>), our work now demonstrates MAPK signaling-dependent expression of this protein in multiple epithelial-derived RAS-driven malignancies as well as in vivo. Additionally, we show that CDCP1 is important for proliferation in RAS-addicted cells, suggesting a significant link between its function and its upregulated surface expression. Here, we applied our novel antibodies to CDCP1 to begin to validate its potential as a therapeutic target and as a biomarker in RAS-driven cancers dependent on MAPK signaling.</p><p>More preclinical studies beyond the scope of this work are necessary to fully validate CDCP1 as a therapeutic target. Nonetheless, we saw tumor localization of our CDCP1 antibodies in mouse xenograft models for PDAC, and MEK-dependent expression providing mechanistic validation in vivo. This mouse experiment does not provide a fair assessment of tumor selective expression of CDCP1, as our antibody did not show cross reactivity with the mouse homolog of CDCP1 (data not shown). However, analysis of the GTEX tissue expression database reveals that CDCP1 normal tissue expression is quite restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In comparison to the classical antibody-targeted cell-surface protein, HER2, normal tissue expression for CDCP1 is far lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Additionally, we showed that mutant RAS PDAC cells express nearly 3 million copies per cell, a number comparable to the estimated 2 million copies per cell that can be observed in HER positive breast cancers. More extensive expression profiling of human tissues is needed to truly estimate the therapeutic potential of this protein. However, we believe that our collective observations provide motivation for the further exploration of CDCP1 an antibody target for RAS mutant cancers.</p><p>In summary, the results described herein validate and provide a mechanistic basis for the hypothesis that RAS signaling can meaningfully remodel the surface proteome to support malignant phenotypes. The strength of our linked target discovery and antibody generation pipeline was exemplified in the engineering of recombinant antibodies to CDCP1, and in demonstrating that these antibodies can be used to selectively deliver therapeutic payloads to RAS-transformed cells and report in vivo on RAS signaling status. Overall, this work presents a novel technological pipeline for the systematic discovery and generation of antibodies to surface markers coordinately regulated by oncogene signaling pathways. Ultimately, we hope this pipeline can be applied towards the discovery of therapeutic antibodies to target previously âundruggableâ oncogenes, including RAS, from the outside.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell surface protein enrichment</title><p>For all stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) experiments, cells were cultured in DMEM SILAC media (Thermo) containing L-[<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>]lysine and L-[<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>] arginine (heavy label) (CIL) or L-[<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>14</sup>N<sub>2</sub>]lysine and L-[<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>14</sup>N<sub>4</sub>]arginine (light label) for seven doublings to ensure full incorporation of the isotopic labels.

Infected and non-infected cells were counted and seeded at a 1:1 ratio in 96 well plates. In parallel, infected cells were grown in mono-culture so that sgRNA expression could be monitored. Triplicate samples for each sgRNA were grown under standard conditions for the MCF10A empty vector, or with media lacking insulin and EGF for the MCF10A KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>. All cells grown in mono-culture were grown under standard conditions. The percentage of cells expressing GFP (indicating sgRNA expression) was measured at several time points (0 days, 5 days, 12 days). The relative fraction of sgRNA positive cells was determined by the percentage of cells that maintained expression of GFP (indicating sgRNA expression) normalized to the percentage of GFP positive cells on the day of doxycycline addition (day 0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Expression of BiTE and IgG</title><p>Expi293 (Life Technologies) cells were transiently co-transfected with two pFUSE (InvivoGen) vectors harboring either the Fab heavy chain and the Fab light chain genetically fused to the Î±CD19 scFv, or the Fab heavy chain fused to a human Fc and the Fab light chain, at a ratio of 1:1 for BiTE and IgG respectfully.

The SW620, SW403, SW1116, and CAPAN-1 cell lines were a gift form the laboratory of Frank McCormick and were maintained in McCoyâs 5A medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X Pen/Strep. The Panc1, BXPC3, CAPAN-2, PL5, H5667, HPAC, MiaPaCa-2, and HPNE cells were a gift from the laboratory of E. Scott Seeley and were maintained in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X Pen/Strep. The H1792, H358, and H1299 cells were a gift from the laboratory of Kevan Shokat and were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X Pen/Strep. The HEK293T cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X Pen/Strep. Jurkat NFAT reporter cell lines were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mg/mL G418 (Thermo) and 1X Pen/Strep. Cell line identities were authenticated by morphological inspection. Symptoms for mycoplasma contamination were not observed and thus no test for mycoplasma contamination was performed. To the best of our knowledge, all cell lines that were received as gifts were previously authenticated and tested for mycoplasma.</p><p>To construct the CRISPRi cell lines, MCF10A empty vector and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells were lentivirally transduced with constructs encoding dCas9-BFP-KRAB. Three rounds of sorting for stable BFP expression by flow cytometry using a BD FACS Aria2 were used to generate homogeneous polyclonal populations of each CRISPRi cell line. A second round of lentiviral transduction was used to introduce expression of sgRNAs. Cells expressing sgRNAs were selected for in puromycin (2 Âµg/mL) and validated by confirming either GFP (single sgRNA) or BFP (sgRNA library) expression using fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry.</p><p>To construct the ECD displaying HEK293 cell lines, Flp-In T-REx (ThermoFisher) cells were co-transfected with the pOG44 vector (ThermoFisher) and a construct encoding each ECD fused to the transmembrane anchoring domain of platlet-erived Growth Factor with a YPET tag in the pcDNA5/FRT Mammalian Expression vector (ThermoFisher). Cells displaying each ECD were selected for in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 Âµg/mL Hygromycin (ThermoFisher).

The saturation binding assays were done in a range of 9 different concentrations between 0.65 to 80 nM of <sup>125</sup>I-CDCP1 Fab in each well. The non-specific binding was determined at three different concentrations (0.65, 20 and 80 nM) by co-incubation of cells with 1000 fold excess over the Kd of the unlabeled anti-CDCP1 Fab. Following incubation for 1 hr, the cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and retained for analysis (unbound fraction). The cells were lysed with 1 mL of 1M NaOH and collected (cell associated fraction). The unbound and cell-associated fractions were counted in a gamma counter and expressed as a percentage of the total activity added per number of cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The specific binding was obtained by subtracting the non-specific binding from the total binding. A Rosenthal plot was used to determine the Bmax.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Immunoreactivity fraction</title><p>The immunoreactive fraction was determined by measuring the percentage of radiolabeled Fab bound to antigen under conditions of antigen excess. Using a concentrated cell suspension of HPAC cell lines, five different dilutions of cells ranging from 0.5 to 10 million cells/mL were prepared in PBS solution containing BSA. For each cell concentration, <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-CDCP1 (10 Î¼Ci) was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Following the incubation, the cell suspensions were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged. The unbound radioactivity was removed and counted along with the cell-bound activity. The inverse of cell-bound radioactivity (total over bound) was plotted against the inverse of cell concentration. The data were fitted with a least squares linear regression method (PRISM). The Y-intercept of the regression line represents the inverse of the immunoreactive fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>In vivo imaging</title><p>Three to five week old male nu/nu immunocompromised mice were purchased from Charles River. Nu/Nu mice were inoculated with 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> HPAC or A549 cells subcutaneously into one flank in a 1:1 mixture (v/v) of PBS and Matrigel (Corning). Tumors were palpable within 21â30 days with HPAC and 14â21 days with A549 after injection. Tumor-bearing mice (nÂ =Â 5 per treatment arm) received between 50 to 300 Î¼Ci of <sup>89</sup>Zr-CDCP1 or <sup>89</sup>Zr-heat denatured Fab solution in 100 Î¼L saline solution volume intravenously using a custom mouse tail vein catheter with a 28-gauge needle and a 100â150 mm long polyethylene microtubing.Â ~300 Î¼Ci was injected for the mice for imaging andÂ ~50 Î¼Ci for the mice for biodistribution. The mice were imaged at different time points (4 hr, 8 hr, 24 hr) on a dedicated small animal PET/CT scanner (Inveon, Siemens Healthcare, Malvern, PA). Animals were scanned for 20 min for PET, and the CT acquisition was 10 min. The coregistration between PET and CT images was obtained using the rigid transformation matrix from the manufacturer-provided scanner calibration procedure since the geometry between PET and CT remained constant for each of PET/CT scans using the combined PET/CT scanner. Animals were anesthetized with gas isoflurane at 2% concentration mixed with medical grade oxygen. The photon attenuation correction was performed for PET reconstruction using the coregistered CT-based attenuation map to ensure the quantitative accuracy of the reconstructed PET data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Drug treatment for in vivo experiments</title><p>Tumor-bearing mice were treated with MEK inhibitor (PD0325901).

The mass of <sup>89</sup>Zr-CDCP1 formulation injected into each animal was measured and used to determine the total number of counts (counts per minute, [c.p.m.]) by comparison to a standard syringe of known activity and mass. Count data were background- and decay-corrected and the tissue uptake measured in units of percentage-injected dose per gram (%ID/g) was calculated by normalization to the total amount of activity injected.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank E Scott Seeley, Martin McMahon, Charles Craik, Frank McCormick, Brian Lee, Tet Matsuguchi, Jia Liu, Karolina Wypisniak, Michael Hornsby, Jacqueline Villalta, Yun Mou, James Koerber, and Victoria Assimon for helpful discussions and technical advice.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Martinko and co-authors have generated a toolkit of recombinant antibodies targeting cell surface proteins induced by activated Ras in cancer cells as a therapeutic strategy. Initially using an isogenic cell line pair based on MCF10A mammary epithelial cells with or without mutationally activated KRAS, they characterized the cell surface proteome by mass spec to identify Ras-induced surface proteins. These were enriched for proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, and the effects were largely dependent on Ras-MEK pathway signaling. Parallel analysis of RNA expression revealed only a small correlation between Ras-induced surface proteins and corresponding RNAs, suggesting that the mass spec approach can reveal novel candidate targets. They made recombinant antibodies targeting some of these surface proteins, which validated the observed Ras-induced surface expression. They then used CRISPi screening of 1600 annotated surface proteins to look for those demonstrating functional dependency specifically in Ras-transformed cells. They prioritized efforts focused on one of these genes, which encodes CDCP1, an integrin-associated protein previously implicated in cancer/ Using CDCP1 antibodies conjugated to a cytotoxin, they demonstrated the potential utility of such an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CDCP1 as a therapeutic.</p><p>Overall, while these studies are technically well executed, and represent a potentially useful application of recombinant antibody technology coupled with mass spec analysis of the surface proteome of cancer cells, the manuscript reads like a collection of somewhat orthogonal observations that are not logically well-connected. Moreover, as described below, the emphasis on CDCP1 detracts from the overall enthusiasm, since this has been previously implicated as a target in Ras-driven cancers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The logical flow, as presented, complicates the interpretation of the key conclusions. For example, the authors emphasize that the correlation was weak between cell surface proteome and RNA expression; however, the highlighted example CDCP1, has already been reported to be a Ras-induced gene at the RNA level. Similarly, the authors used CRISPRi to establish a list of surface proteins that are functionally required in Ras-transformed cells; however, they then went on to use the CDCP1 antibody to deliver a toxic payload to cancer cells, rather than exploring a function-blocking antibody. This is confusing since it raises a question about the rationale for the CRISPRi analysis.</p><p>2) CDCP1 is not an ideal candidate to emphasize as the key example, largely due to the fact that it has been previously published as a Ras-induced candidate target. Notably, in the Discussion, the authors state that,&quot;our work now demonstrates MAPK dependent expression of this protein [â¦]&quot;; however, the previous report from Uekita (which is cited) had already demonstrated the role of MAPK signaling in Ras-induced CDCP1 expression. So, the novelty is quite limited here.</p><p>3) The authors argue strongly and for the most part convincingly that the use of MCF10A was reasonable for these experiments. However, the authors should discuss that they may well have missed important cell surface targets using this approach. This is particularly salient given the wide variability of expression of the proteins that they found across other cell lines. MCF-10A is a curious choice for these studies when considering that breast cancer is often highlighted as one of the few cancer types that never harbor KRAS mutations. The authors should probably highlight in more detail why they chose this cell line as the starting point, even if it is just for technical reasons. There are now multiple examples (from different tissue types) of cancer cell lines that are engineered to be +/- KRAS.</p><p>4) To address the points raised above, the authors should substantially revise the manuscript to emphasize the recombinant antibody technology as applied to targeting the surface proteome of cancer cells, while reducing the significance of selectively targeting Ras mutant cancer cells. Furthermore, the manuscript should include a more realistic discussion of the implications of the work. Not all KRAS mutant cancers are driven by MAPK and not all of these will have CDCP1 up-regulated. Moreover, since no normal cells or tissues were analyzed (neither MCF-10A or HPNE cells are normal), it is unclear from these experiments whether a therapeutic window really exists for CDCP1 targeting, especially given that no anti-tumor activity is shown.</p><p>5) For Figure 3C, the authors mentioned that the 8 cell lines were selected because pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers have the highest frequency of KRAS mutation. It is very nice to see that CDCP1 showed high surface expression in almost every cell line tested. However, the other 6 proteins did not. Although a full characterization of all of these proteins goes beyond what is necessary in this report, it would be helpful to have a more robust discussion of this issue.</p><p>6) In addition to Figure 5C, it would be more convincing to repeat the same experiment in other cell lines: pancreatic or other lineages that have been shown in Figure 3C to have high expression of CDCP1.</p><p>7) In Figure 6B, the BRAF inhibitor SB590885 did not decrease phospho-ERK levels? Is this correct?</p><p>8) In Figure 6B, is it a robust result that the AKT inhibitor MK2206 only decrease the surface localization of CDCP1 but not CDCP1 total protein level?</p><p>9) NCI-H1299 cells have wild-type KRAS and NRAS-Q61K mutation, not KRAS-Q61 as stated in the text and Figure 6C. More RAS-mutant cell lines should be tested to further support the claim that CDCP1 expression is coupled with activation of MAPK signaling.</p><p>10) The authors have used publicly available databases to assess whether CDCP1 is overexpressed in KRAS mutant cancers. It would be helpful to determine this by a different method than probing gene expression (mRNA) as this is not entirely reliable.</p><p>11) The experiment described in Figure 3C is not very informative given that no RAS WT cell lines are shown. Moreover, without some sort of KRAS perturbation (knockdown or MEK inhibition), there is no evidence that the expression of any of these proteins has anything to do with RAS mutation status.</p><p>12) The type of data shown in Figure 5Ais not very informative from a therapeutic point of view. Even though KRAS mutant and WT are statistically different at the population level, in truth only 7% of PDAC over-express CDCP1. 91% of PDAC (in the TGCA dataset) have mutant KRAS, so, regardless of the claims made in the paper, the general relationship between mutant KRAS is unclear. The Discussion should probably be more frank about this. Moreover, Figure 1F shows a less than impressive correlation between transcriptomics and proteomics, yet they are trying to make an important conclusion about CDCP1 protein expression from transcriptomics data on primary tumors. It would be useful if they could comment specifically on the correlation between RNA and protein for CDCP1 in their original analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Targeting RAS Driven Human Cancer Cells with Antibodies to Upregulated and Essential Cell-Surface Proteins&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The Abstract, which emphasizes biological findings, remains unchanged. For example, the statement, &quot;we discovered a signature of proteins critical for metastasis that are upregulated on cells transformed with KRASG12V, and driven by MAPK pathway signaling.&quot; is misleading in light of the findings presented. Similarly, the phrasing of the statement describing CDCP1 findings still leads readers to conclude that this protein has been newly identified by these studies. The authors need to edit the Abstract to appropriately represent the key novel claims, and the emphasis on the new technology.</p><p>The authors have not adequately addressed a concern that was raised regarding the transition from the CRISPRi discovery of a requirement for CDCP1 and the experiments in which it was targeted using an ADC strategy (subsections âFunctional characterization of the KRAS surfaceome in MCF10As using a CRISPRi screenâ and âAntibodies can selectively deliver toxic and immunotherapy payloads to mutant KRAS pancreatic cancer cellsâ). In the reply to reviewer comments, the authors refer to a statement they make where they write: &quot;One of the most common mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies is loss of expression of the protein target.&quot; But this is not true. In fact, most targeted therapies are directed to proteins that are required by cancer cells and such targets are therefore not typically reduced in expression as a resistance mechanism. The authors should remove or restate this. More notably, the authors should explain in the transition between these two sections that the dependency of RAS-transformed cancer cells on CDCP1, together with its high surface expression, makes it an attractive ADC target-which is unlikely to be selected against as a resistance mechanism due to its requirement in these cancer cells. Therefore, they explored the ADC approach. They should also comment on the fact that their antibody to CDCP1 is apparently not a function-blocking antibody-since it does not seem to affect cell viability.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31098.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The logical flow, as presented, complicates the interpretation of the key conclusions.

We were also heartened to see that the increase in target expression from the proteomics was confirmed by the antibodies we developed, a completely orthogonal metric.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the authors used CRISPRi to establish a list of surface proteins that are functionally required in Ras-transformed cells; however, they then went on to use the CDCP1 antibody to deliver a toxic payload to cancer cells, rather than exploring a function-blocking antibody.

In this case one needs a binding antibody (like anti-CD19) and to know that the target is critical so resistance cannot be easily achieved by loss of expression the target protein, which is the most common means of resisting a therapeutic antibody for cancer. Thus we feel that proteomics and CRISPRi functional genomics are important companions to discover new targets. To clarify this point we have edited the text:</p><p>âOne of the most common mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies is loss of expression of the protein target.

Uekita only reported this connection in non-small cell lung cancers. We now demonstrate the connection between RAS and CDCP1 in lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cell models for mutant RAS cancers and include this new data in Figure 3D. Moreover the data shows a very broad MEKi dependent decrease for CDCP1 relative to AKTi or EGFRi, and that this decrease is much more pronounced than other targets in the panel.</p><p>Because we now demonstrate the connection between RAS signaling and CDCP1 in the context of Figure 3, we chose to eliminate the more sparse data set and diagram from panels A and B in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue strongly and for the most part convincingly that the use of MCF10A was reasonable for these experiments.

The combined figure presents systematic approaches to demonstrate the utility of the antibodies generated from our technological pipeline. These methods are straightforward and can be readily applied to any of the recombinant antibodies we generate, exemplified in this case for CDCP1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the manuscript should include a more realistic discussion of the implications of the work.

Thus we have modified the text:</p><p>âMore extensive expression profiling of human tissues is needed to truly estimate the therapeutic potential of this protein.

In the case of the western blot, cells were lysed, and total protein amount was normalized by BCA quantitation prior to loading on the gel. In the case of the flow cytometry, expression level was quantified on a single cell basis. Thus, one possible explanation for this result is that AKTi treatment, which reduces translation, caused a global reduction in protein level in cells, but that CDCP1 expression relative to a housekeeping control was unchanged. To avoid confusion, we have removed this experiment from the manuscript.</p><p>In place of this, we have performed a broader experiment where we measured the expression profiles of 8 cancer cells lines treated with AKTi. This new experiment more thoroughly explores the impact of AKTi on CDCP1 expression as well as the expression of 6 other candidate RAS surface markers we identified. Interestingly, AKTi appears to cause CDCP1 to increase slightly (also seen in new Figure 3). This perhaps could be due to a feedback mechanism whereby cells compensate for AKT inhibition by increasing signaling flux through ERK. This data is discussed in more detail in response to question 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) NCI-H1299 cells have wild-type KRAS and NRAS-Q61K mutation, not KRAS-Q61 as stated in the text and Figure 6C. More RAS-mutant cell lines should be tested to further support the claim that CDCP1 expression is coupled with activation of MAPK signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for noticing our mistake. The NCI-H1299 label has been corrected to note that the oncogenic mutation is in NRAS and not KRAS.</p><p>In addition, we have included more support in Figure 3 for the claim that CDCP1 is coupled to MAPK signaling activation. Briefly, we performed experiments in an additional 6 cell lines, where in 5/6 cases we observed dramatic reduction of CDCP1 expression levels after treatment with subtoxic concentrations of MEK inhibitor (PD0325901 100 nM). This is discussed in more detail in response to comment 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors have used publicly available databases to assess whether CDCP1 is overexpressed in KRAS mutant cancers. It would be helpful to determine this by a different method than probing gene expression (mRNA) as this is not entirely reliable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers that probing mRNA expression is not entirely reliable as we see above. We parsed through all available Pancreatic cancer datasets on the MSKCC Cancer Genomics Data Server, but there is a dearth of datasets featuring quantitative protein abundance measurements associated with genome sequenced cancers. This lack of proteomics data motivated us to profile the KRAS-induced cell surfaceome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The experiment described in Figure 3C is not very informative given that no RAS WT cell lines are shown. Moreover, without some sort of KRAS perturbation (knockdown or MEK inhibition), there is no evidence that the expression of any of these proteins has anything to do with RAS mutation status.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that more compelling evidence would help to support the notion that the expression observed in Figure 3C is KRAS signaling dependent. We have now included a RAS WT cell line, HEK293T cells, for comparison in Figure 3B. We found little detectable expression for all 7 targets probed.</p><p>While comprehensive expression profiling of hundreds of cancer cell lines would more thoroughly address the second point made by the reviewer, it is unfortunately outside the scope of what can be accomplished here. As an alternative, we heeded the reviewersâ suggestion to perturb KRAS signaling in the cells we measured through treatment with pharmacological inhibitors (MEKi, AKTi, EGFRi) as shown in the new Figure 3D mentioned above. Interestingly, we observed that several of these proteins (CD55, NT5E, CDCP1, and ICAM1) had expression that was responsive to KRAS pathway perturbation in mutant RAS cancer cell lines. Importantly, inhibition upstream of KRAS by EGFRi had little effect in most cases. We believe this data strengthens our claim that the observed expression of our panel of proteins was influenced in expression level by oncogenic KRAS signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The type of data shown in Figure 5A is not very informative from a therapeutic point of view. Even though KRAS mutant and WT are statistically different at the population level, in truth only 7% of PDAC over-express CDCP1. 91% of PDAC (in the TGCA dataset) have mutant KRAS, so, regardless of the claims made in the paper, the general relationship between mutant KRAS is unclear.

As we have tried to articulate in the paper, we believe that RNA expression level may not be strongly predictive of protein abundance, and thus the direct link between KRAS mutational status and CDCP1 in PDAC needs further experimental support. While we are excited to further explore this link, we believe it goes beyond the scope of this manuscript to generate this data broadly. Hence, we have removed Figure 5A from the manuscript and used different language to articulate our exploration of CDCP1 in PDAC in the text:</p><p>âOncogenic KRAS is nearly ubiquitously expressed in pancreatic cancers, and these cancers are particularly dependent on RAS signaling through the MAPK pathway (Eser et al., 2014).
