unclear. Here we performed single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments and uncovered two conformations of complexin-1 bound to the ternary SNARE complex. In the <italic>cis</italic> conformation, complexin-1 induces a conformational change at the membrane-proximal C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex that specifically depends on the N-terminal, accessory, and central domains of complexin-1. The complexin-1 induced conformation of the ternary SNARE complex may be related to a conformation that is juxtaposing the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. In the <italic>trans</italic> conformation, complexin-1 can simultaneously interact with a ternary SNARE complex via the central domain and a binary SNARE complex consisting of syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25A via the accessory domain. The <italic>cis</italic> conformation may be involved in activation of synchronous neurotransmitter release, whereas both conformations may be involved in regulating spontaneous release.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16886.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16886.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16886.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells communicate via electrical signals that travel at high speeds. However, these signals cannot pass across the gaps – called synapses – that separate one nerve cell from the next. Instead, signals pass between nerve cells via molecules called neurotransmitters that are released from the membrane of the first cell and recognized by receptors in the membrane of the next. Prior to being released, neurotransmitters are packaged inside bubble-like structures called vesicles. The synaptic vesicles must fuse with the cell membrane in order to release their contents into the synaptic cleft. Proteins called SNAREs work together with other proteins to allow this membrane fusion to occur rapidly after the electrical signal arrives.</p><p>Complexin is a synaptic protein that binds tightly to a complex of SNARE proteins to regulate membrane fusion. This protein activates the quick release of neurotransmitters, which is triggered by an increase in calcium ions as the electrical signal reachess the synapse. Complexin also regulates a different type of neurotransmitter release, which is known as “spontaneous release”. The complexin protein is made up of different regions, each of which is required for one or more of the protein’s activities. However, it is not clear how these regions, or domains, interact with SNAREs and other proteins to enable complexin to perform these roles.</p><p>Choi et al. have now investigated whether the different activities of mammalian complexin are related to the structure that it adopts when it interacts with the SNARE complex. Complexes of SNARE proteins were assembled with one of the SNARE proteins tethered to a surface for imaging. Next, a light-based imaging technique called single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (or FRET) was used to monitor how complexin interacts with the SNARE complex. This technique allows individual proteins that have been labeled with fluorescent markers to be followed under a microscope and can show how they interact in real-time.</p><p>Using this approach, Choi et al. showed that complexin could adopt two different shapes or conformations when it binds to the SNARE complex. In one, complexin interacted closely with the SNARE complex so that it made part of the complex change shape. In the other, complexin was able to bridge two SNARE complexes. Complexin can therefore interact with SNARE complexes in different ways by using different regions of the protein.</p><p>These findings provide insight into how complexin may regulate membrane fusion via the SNARE complex. In the future, single molecule FRET could be used to study other proteins found at synapses and understand the other steps that regulate the release of neurotransmitters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16886.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16886.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synaptic vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>calcium triggering</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Complexin can have two conformations when bound to a ternary SNARE complex, one of which induces a conformational change of the SNARE complex at the C-terminus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles is orchestrated by synaptic proteins, including neuronal SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor), the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor synaptotagmin, complexin, and other components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Südhof, 2013</xref>). This work focuses on the cytoplasmic protein complexin and its interactions with SNAREs. Complexin has multiple functions: it activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synchronous release, regulates spontaneous release, and increases the primed pool of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohrmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</xref>). Here we summarize some of the key properties of complexin relevant to this work. Synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release depends critically on complexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McMahon et al., 1995</xref>), and this activating role of complexin is conserved across all species and different types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced exocytosis studied to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hobson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2015</xref>). Complexin also regulates spontaneous release, although this effect is less conserved among species and experimental conditions: for example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spontaneous release increases with knockout of complexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jorquera et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, knockdown in cultured cortical neurons increases spontaneous release, although knockout of complexin in mice differently affects spontaneous release depending on the particular neuronal cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We study here the homolog complexin-1 of the mammalian complexin family whose primary sequence is highly conserved (96%) in mouse, rat, and human. Complexin-1 binds with high affinity (~10 nM) to the neuronal ternary SNARE complex consisting of synaptobrevin-2, syntaxin-1A, and SNAP-25A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McMahon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pabst et al., 2002</xref>). Complexin consists of four domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): the N-terminal domain (amino acid range 1–27) is required for activation of synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release, the accessory domain (amino acid range 28–48) is required for regulation of spontaneous release, the central domain (amino acid range 49–70) is required for all functions of complexin-1, and the C-terminal domain (amino acid range 71–134) is involved in vesicle priming and binds to anionic membranes with curvature sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Snead et al., 2014</xref>). The key roles of the four domains of complexin-1 have been reproduced in a reconstituted single vesicle fusion system with neuronal SNAREs, synaptotagmin-1, and complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). By varying the complexin-1 concentration, this <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggested that the regulatory effect on spontaneous fusion and the activating role on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release are governed by distinct molecular mechanisms involving different subsets of the four domains of complexin-1. Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments revealed that the accessory domain is entirely dispensable for activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion, although it is essential for regulation of spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, genetic experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also suggest distinct mechanisms for activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release and regulation of spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16886.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain diagram of complexin-1, mutants, and truncations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain diagram for full-length wildtype complexin-1 (Cpx [1–134]) and complexin-1 mutants (SC, superclamp; NC, no-clamp; 4M, mutation of the central helix that prevents binding to ternary SNARE complex).

This interaction is antiparallel, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the direction of the α-helix of the accessory domain of complexin-1 is antiparallel to the direction of the α-helices in the ternary SNARE complex. Functional studies, along with molecular modeling suggested that complexin-1 may inhibit full ternary SNARE complex formation by preventing the C-terminal part of synaptobrevin-2 from binding to the syntaxin-1A / SNAP-25A components of the ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>). However, a subsequent crystal structure of the 'superclamp' mutant of complexin-1 (D27L, E34F, R37A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in complex with a partially truncated SNARE complex (containing a truncated synaptobrevin-2 fragment, amino acid range 25–60), along with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and light scattering experiments instead found that complexin-1 bridges two partially truncated SNARE complexes: one partial SNARE complex binds to the central domain of complexin-1 while another partial SNARE complex weakly binds to the accessory domain of the same complexin-1 molecule (PDB IDs <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3RK3">3RK3</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3RL0">3RL0</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2015</xref>). However, this weak interaction of the accessory domain was not observable by NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>), and its relevance has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the ongoing studies of the biophysical interactions involving the accessory domain of complexin-1, this domain is essential for regulation of spontaneous fusion both in neurons and in reconstituted systems. For example, in rescue experiments with complexin knockdown in cultured neurons, the complexin-1 superclamp mutant slightly decreased the mEPSC (miniature excitatory postsynaptic current) frequency, while a 'poor-clamp' mutant (K26E, L41K, E47K) of complexin increased the mEPSC frequency compared to wildtype control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, genetic rescue experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that the superclamp mutant decreased spontaneous release, whereas the no-clamp mutant (L41E, A44E, A30E, A31E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) slightly increased spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>) compared to wildtype control. Moreover, introduction of a helix breaking mutation into the accessory domain of complexin increased spontaneous release in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Different models have been proposed to explain the regulatory function of the accessory domain of complexin on spontaneous release: first, the accessory domain inserts itself into the C-terminal half of a partially assembled SNARE complex and, thus, transiently inhibits full assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>); second, the accessory domain inserts itself into another SNARE complex, bridging two SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2015</xref>); third, the accessory domain is not involved in protein interactions, but instead acts by electrostatic repulsion with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>); fourth, the accessory domain stabilizes the α-helix of the central domain of complexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In order to gain more insights into the molecular mechanisms of complexin-1, we studied the complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) efficiency experiments.

The surface of the microscope slide was passivated using biotinylated BSA and a phospholipid bilayer to prevent non-specific binding and to ensure that the tethered proteins are isolated single molecules in an environment surrounded by lipids. Single molecules consisting of the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-1A were tethered to the deposited bilayer through a biotin-streptavidin linkage, leading to a more uniform distribution of the tethered proteins on the surface compared to when using reconstituted full-length syntaxin-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2012</xref>).

These SNARE label pairs probe the syntaxin-1A / synaptobrevin-2 subconfiguration within the ternary SNARE complex at both ends of the complex. These three label pairs are expected to produce high FRET efficiency for properly assembled ternary SNARE complex based on the crystal structure (PDB ID 1SFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). As expected, the smFRET histograms of the three label pairs showed the expected high FRET states, but they also revealed low FRET efficiency states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Nearly 50 percent of the complexes exhibited low FRET efficiency when integrating the corresponding broad peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Such low FRET efficiency states had been observed in previous single molecule studies: they are related to improperly assembled SNARE complexes, including antiparallel syntaxin-1A / synaptobrevin-2 subconfigurations, when mixed in the absence of other factors that assist proper SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weninger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to obtain more uniform ternary SNARE complexes, we added the C-terminal fragment of the cytoplasmic domain of synaptobrevin-2 (referred to as 'dN-SB', amino acid range 49–96 of synaptobrevin-2) during ternary SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We assembled ternary SNARE complexes in the presence of dN-SB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, referred to as 'dN-SB method' in the following). Remarkably, this method nearly eliminated the low FRET efficiency states and the resulting smFRET histograms consisted mainly of one high FRET efficiency state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).</p><p>Our single molecule experiments now provide an explanation of why C-terminal peptides of synaptobrevin produce more SNARE-dependent vesicle fusion when incubating binary (syntaxin-1A / SNAP-25A) SNARE complexes with such peptides prior to <italic>trans</italic> SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Melia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pobbati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>): the presence of the dN-SB fragment during ternary SNARE complex assembly prevents improper syntaxin-1A / synaptobrevin-2 subconfigurations which are probably not fusogenic.

However, these previous experiments may not have revealed the full conformational space that is available to the complexin-1 accessory domain due to ensemble averaging. In order to fully explore the conformational space of complexin-1 when bound to SNARE complex, we performed smFRET efficiency experiments with fluorescent labels attached to both complexin-1 and the ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We tested this interaction by mutations of complexin-1.

Thus, the complexin-1 superclamp mutant interacts with the binary SNARE complex with three-fold higher affinity than wildtype complexin-1. In contrast, binary SNARE complex binding events with the no-clamp mutant were very rare within our observation period of 100 s and, consequently, we were unable to determine a dissociation constant for the no-clamp mutant, consistent with the notion that it is the complexin-1 accessory domain that establishes the interaction with the binary SNARE complex in our experiment.

Thus, surface adsorption effects could not have contributed to the observed antiparallel subconfigurations since the ternary SNARE complex was assembled in solution before reconstitution and surface tethering. An independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>) also suggested the existence of antiparallel SNARE subconfigurations. Using label pairs attached to synaptobrevin-2 and SNAP-25A, a low smFRET efficiency state was observed, consistent with a subpopulation of antiparallel subconfigurations (Figure S4A and supplementary material pages 2–3 for the case without αSNAP in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryu et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weninger et al., 2003</xref>), antiparallel syntaxin-1A / synaptobrevin-2 subconfigurations can be suppressed by extensive purification of the ternary SNARE complex, including an additional urea wash step.

Our smFRET experiments indicate that the dN-SB method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pobbati et al., 2006</xref>) also results in the proper parallel syntaxin-1A / synaptobrevin-2 subconfiguration within the ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

This method is related to an earlier report using a slightly different synaptobrevin fragment, the Vc peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Melia et al., 2002</xref>). There is independent evidence that improperly assembled SNAREs (including antiparallel subconfigurations) may be a feature of SNAREs in other contexts as well: for vacuolar fusion, proof-reading by the HOPS complex is essential for maximal fusogenic trans SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zick and Wickner, 2014</xref>).

Remarkably, a substantial fraction of the ternary SNARE complex exhibited a conformational change upon addition of complexin-1 as indicated by the emergence of a low FRET efficiency state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This complexin-1 induced conformational change of the ternary SNARE complex depends on interactions involving the N-terminal, accessory, and core domains of complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), suggesting an intimate interaction between all of these domains of complexin-1 and the ternary SNARE complex. Thus, the low FRET efficiency state likely corresponds to the <italic>cis</italic> conformation of complexin-1 when bound to the ternary SNARE complex. In support of this notion, mutations of the accessory helix of complexin-1 also had an effect on the conformations of complexin-1 when bound to the ternary SNARE complex. When attaching FRET label pairs on complexin-1 and syntaxin-1A within the complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex, the superclamp mutant slightly increased the population of the high FRET efficiency state (i.e., an increase of the <italic>cis</italic> conformation) compared to wildtype complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

However, the authors noted that the spectra were sharper than those for solvent exposed residues on the surface of an α-helix that is part of a globular protein.

Since we have shown that the <italic>cis</italic> conformation of complexin-1 induces a conformational change at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex through a mechanism that involves both the accessory and the N-terminal domains of complexin-1, we speculate that the <italic>cis</italic> conformation of complexin-1 is related to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release, although it could also play a role in regulation of spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, we note that mutations of the accessory domain of complexin-1 do not affect the activating function of complexin-1 compared to wildtype neurons in rescue experiments with complexin-1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2013</xref>). Moreover, recent in vitro experiments revealed that the accessory domain is entirely dispensable for activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2016</xref>). These observations can be reconciled with the findings in this work by postulating that the interaction of the N-terminal domain of complexin-1 occurs for the <italic>trans</italic> SNARE complex that is juxtaposed between the membranes regardless of the accessory domain. In contrast when starting from fully assembled ternary SNARE complex, both the accessory and N-terminal domains are required to induce the observed conformational change at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex. We speculate that the complexin-1 induced conformation of the SNARE complex may be related to the conformation of a <italic>trans</italic> SNARE complex that juxtaposes the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right panel).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16886.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models of the cis and trans conformations of complexin-1.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16886.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16886.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-16886-fig7-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The <italic>trans</italic> conformation of complexin</title><p>We studied interactions of complexin-1 in the <italic>trans</italic> conformation by first binding complexin-1 to a surface-tethered ternary SNARE complex via the central domain of complexin-1. The resulting complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex should allow the N-terminal, accessory, and C-terminal domains of bound complexin-1 to be accessible for other interactions when it is in the <italic>trans</italic> conformation. The binary (syntaxin-1A / SNAP-25A) SNARE complex bound weakly to the preassembled complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex via the accessory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Together with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>), one complexin-1 molecule in the <italic>trans</italic> conformation can bridge a variety of SNARE complexes. The correlations between complexin-1 mutants and this bridging interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>) suggests that it is probably specific rather than merely a consequence of the flexible character of the binary SNARE complex that may expose hydrophobic elements in certain configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weninger et al., 2008</xref>).

Similar to the complexin-1 induced conformational change at the C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex that we observe, a low FRET population was induced by αSNAP that increased as the αSNAP concentration was increased (compare Figure S4B in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>] with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, no conformational change was observed at the N-terminal end of the SNARE complex upon αSNAP binding. Since two quite different factors (complexin-1 and αSNAP) can induce a conformational change at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex, this suggests that the C-terminal end has different conformational properties than the N-terminal end. This finding is also consistent with multistage un-zippering of the SNARE complex by single molecule pulling experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marniemi et al., 1975</xref>). Taken together, the observed plasticity of the membrane-proximal C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex likely has a functional role in membrane fusion, and the N-terminal domain of complexin-1 assists this process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins: plasmids, expression, and purification</title><p>The cytoplasmic domain of rat syntaxin-1A (amino acid range 1–265), fused with a C-terminal biotinylation sequence (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE), was cloned into the pTEV5 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rocco et al., 2008</xref>) with a N-terminal TEV cleavable 6x-histidine tag.

Fluorescence anisotropy experiments (see below, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) also show that dye orientations are not affected by complexin-1 binding to the ternary SNARE complex. After application of the γ-corrections to the FRET efficiency histograms, the low FRET efficiency population is still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), suggesting that the induction of the low FRET efficiency population must be due to a genuine conformational change of the ternary SNARE complex that is induced by complexin-1. Moreover, for both SFC1 and SFC2 label pairs, the individual γ-factors for the low and high FRET populations are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Estimation of FRET efficiencies from crystal structures</title><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> we estimated the distances for FRET pairs from the known high-resolution structures as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCann et al., 2012</xref>).

For protein complexes singly labeled with Alexa 555, we used an excitation wavelength of 532 ± 5 nm and an emission wavelength of 575 ± 5 nm. For protein complexes that were singly labeled with Alexa 647, we used an excitation wavelength of 651 ± 5 nm and an emission wavelength of 671 ± 5 nm. The absorbance value for both dye labeled samples at the respective excitation wavelengths were adjusted to 0.05 AU for all samples to perform ensemble anisotropy measurements. SNARE proteins were individually purified and labeled with donor (Alexa 555) and acceptor (Alexa 647) dye molecule before complexes were formed. SNARE complex was assembled by mixing syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 aliquots followed by addition synaptobrevin-2 fused to a N-terminal 6x-histidine tag at a ratio of 1:2:5, respectively, overnight at 4°C. The protein mixture was rebound to Nickel-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and washed extensively with TBS (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM TCEP). Additional washing with TBS containing 7.5 M was used in order to favor the correct assembly and folding of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weninger et al., 2003</xref>). TEV was added to the eluted samples to cleave off the hexa-histidine tag of the synaptobrevin-2 construct for 1 hr at room temperature. The sample was then further purified by a Superdex 75 size exclusion column chromatography (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) in TBS in order to remove unbound SNAP-25A and synaptobrevin-2 molcules.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Test of the surface tethering method</title><p>In order to test the surface tethering method used throughout this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we compared complexin-1 binding with previous binding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McMahon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pabst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2011</xref>). Syntaxin-1A was labeled with acceptor dye at the C-terminus at residue 249. The donor dye labeling site of complexin-1, residue 26, was chosen based on the crystal structure (PDB ID 1KIL) of the complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) to produce high FRET efficiency when bound to the ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Representative traces of real time measurements showed stochastic bursts of acceptor fluorescence upon complexin-1 binding to syntaxin-1A, binary, and ternary SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>). We used hidden Markov modeling to extract dwell times of the bound and unbound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKinney et al., 2006</xref>). Histograms of individual dwell times were fitted with an exponential function to extract the kinetic rate constants k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>). From the measured rate constants, we calculated equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).</p><p>For the complexin-1 interaction with the ternary SNARE complex, the k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> rate constants were 0.12 ± 0.03 s<sup>-1</sup> and 1.62 ± 0.1 μM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 0.07 ± 0.01 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–H</xref>). These values agree reasonably well with previous single molecule measurements with ternary SNARE complex that used reconstituted full length syntaxin-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2007</xref>), validating the surface-tethering method used in this work. For the complexin-1 interaction to the binary SNARE complex the k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> rate constants were 1.8 ± 0.07 s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.92 ± 0.03 μM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 2.0 ± 0.03 μM, in good agreement with previous isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.4 ± 0.2 μM, ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2011</xref>]). For the complexin-1 interaction to syntaxin-1A alone, the k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> rates constants were 2.96 ± 0.44 s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.16 ± 0.001 μM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 18.5 ± 2.8 μM. In summary, complexin-1 has a weak affinity to syntaxin-1A alone, and binds progressively more strongly from binary to ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).</p><p>We tested if the superclamp and no-clamp mutations affect binding to ternary SNARE complex in our single molecule binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–K</xref>). As control we also tested the 4M mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The kinetic rate constants of both the superclamp and no-clamp mutants were similar to that of wildtype complexin-1, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 0.063 ± 0.01 μM and 0.068 ± 0.01 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–K</xref>). As expected, the k<sub>on</sub> rate for the complexin-1 4M mutant was not measurable on the time scale of our experiment, and k<sub>off</sub> rate was 1.34 ± 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is more than 10 times weaker than that for wildtype complexin-1. The lack of an effect of the no-clamp and superclamp mutants on the affinity between complexin-1 and SNARE complex suggests that under the particular conditions of this experiment, the binding is dominated by the interaction between the core domain of complexin-1 and ternary SNARE complex.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jeremy Leitz for

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Complexin is thought to be a major regulator of neuroexocytosis and the structural basis for its regulation of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion is of great significance and interest. Choi et al. use single-molecule FRET to show that complexin can be in one of two conformations when bound to the SNARE complex. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that complexin has the capacity to disturb the C-terminal region of the SNARE complex, which potentially provides a structural basis for the &quot;clamping mechanism&quot;. Further, the authors show that complexin bound to the ternary SNARE complex can make an intermolecular bridge to the syntaxin-SNAP25 binary complex, which supports the &quot;trans-insertion model&quot; proposed by Rothman and coworkers. Finally, the authors report a method using co-incubation with the C-terminal fragment of synaptobrevin to allow proper SNARE complex assembly of immobilized SNARE complexes.</p><p>The reported findings are very important for our current understanding of complexin function in regulating neurotransmission. Complexin clearly has multiple functions that have been localized to distinct domains of the protein, but contradictory models (all with substantial experimental support) have been put forth as the molecular mechanisms for these roles. The current study dramatically extends the molecular picture of the configurations of complexin interacting with the SNARE complex and the authors make convincing arguments about the connections between these configurations and complexin function. These results excitingly bridge several contradictory models, and thus the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> will receive the current work with broad interest.</p><p>However, the manuscript has a number of issues that should be resolved before further consideration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Previous work by Lu et al. (JMB 2010; 396:602) is not cited in the manuscript, but has significant overlap with the results presented in this work. Intriguingly, their results and conclusions are contradictory to those presented in the current manuscript:</p><p>1) Lu et al. attached the nitroxides to positions 28, 35, 42 near or in the accessary helix region and investigated with EPR. In that work, Lu et al. did not observe two components that would reflect two different conformations of complexin when bound to the ternary SNARE complex. Although EPR is an ensemble technique, it is highly sensitive to protein conformational changes. Further, the method is fast enough to pick up the type of conformational changes discussed in the current manuscript.</p><p>2) In Lu et al.'s JMB paper they labeled the C-terminal positions of synaptobrevin 2. Again, complexin binding to the SNARE complex did not bring about spectral changes that reflects the large conformational change observed with FRET in this study.</p><p>Using single-molecule FRET data, the authors derive distances that are then compared to the distances obtained from the crystal structures. Distance information from smFRET experiments is notoriously unreliable; many factors such as local protein interactions and dye conformation play a role in the conversion between FRET values and distance. As is the convention in the field, it is much safer to use FRET values to classify conformational states and draw correlations between these values and different distances observed in crystal structures.</p><p>In discussing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors make statements related to average distances corresponding to the two states in the smFRET experiments being equal to the distance derived from the ensemble-averaged experiments. This argument is mathematically incorrect: in a bulk-averaged FRET experiment one observes the average of two FRET values that each have a highly nonlinear dependence on the distance (1/R<sup>6</sup>), so that the average FRET value will certainly not be the same as a FRET value calculated using the average of the two distances. Furthermore, comparisons between FRET values derived from these two studies can only be made when the label sites and fluorophores/linkers are identical. This issue is connected to the inaccuracy of FRET experiments reporting on distance: one can only compare FRET values obtained with the exact same proteins and labeling, with conformation being the only difference.</p><p>The experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are very insightful and present a nice way to probe the role of complexin in mediating interactions between two different SNARE complexes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the authors show a raw trace of acceptor and donor intensity, but surprisingly FRET events correspond to only an increase in the acceptor intensity; the donor intensity remains unchanged. I assume that the 100 nM donor concentration in solution gives rise to a high background, but judging from the signal height and noise levels one should certainly see a drop in the donor signal when FRET occurs. The authors should explain this experiment in much more detail.</p><p>One concern with the experiments could be the use of fluorescent labels in the SNARE C-terminal region to probe conformational changes induced by complexin binding near the same region. Direct complexin contacts with the dyes or environmental changes due to close complexin binding could be speculated to impact FRET signals without conformational changes. The authors have taken substantial care to address such potential concerns. In particular, anisotropy studies of the fluorophores at these locations do not show changes with or without complexin (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), and γ factor analysis of FRET pairs Figure 4—figure supplements 3 and 4) also are unchanged with or without complexin. These results suggest dye rotational motion or quantum yields are not significantly altered by complexin binding. In addition, the authors might wish to further emphasize the observation that their measurement of binding kinetics and equilibrium binding constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) for labeled proteins that agree with literature values of unlabeled proteins suggests the fluorophores are not interfering with the biding interfaces. One more point is that the sum of donor and acceptor intensities for the traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> are all nearly the same in all of the FRET states. This suggests that there is no large Protein Induced Fuorescence Enhancement that is seen in some systems when a protein binds near a fluorophore (Hwang H. and Myong S. &quot;Protein induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) for probing protein-nucleic acid interactions&quot; Chem. Soc. Rev. 2014; 43:1221), further suggesting FRET changes are not an artifact.</p><p>The concentration dependence of complexin's effect on the C-terminal SNARE complex seems weaker (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C and 4E</xref>) than the equilibrium binding constant of complexin for the SNARE complex reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and in the second paragraph of the subsection “Test of the surface tethering method by single molecule binding assay” as 70 nM. Am I misinterpreting the effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>/E, or does this suggest that there is another process beyond simple bimolecular binding involved in this phenomenon of rearranging the SNARE c-terminal? Maybe this point could be emphasized in the paper if the authors agree.</p><p>In the subsection “Calculation of distances from FRET efficiency and error estimation”, is the width of a Gaussian FRET peak the best estimate for σ_sub_E? The width of FRET peaks for static conformations is typically dominated by statistical shot noise in the intensity signals. For the estimate of the error in the dye separation R, the uncertainty that is relevant is that in the accuracy of the peak value from the Gaussian fits used as the value E. Maybe this uncertainty in E is hard to determine as it is probably due to systematic variations and the width of the peak is some sort of estimate, but it is not clear how closely they are related. Maybe a cautionary comment is appropriate?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16886.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Previous work by Lu et al.

Although EPR is an ensemble technique, it is highly sensitive to protein conformational changes. Further, the method is fast enough to pick up the type of conformational changes discussed in the current manuscript.</italic></p><p>Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Lu et al.(2010) monitored protein interactions between the accessory helix of complexin-1 and the C-terminal domain of ternary SNARE complex. By spin-labeling five residues of the accessory domain of complexin-1 (shown in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), most of these spin labels showed spectral broadening when quaternary complex was formed with the SNARE complex. Lu et al.concluded that this broadening is due to formation of an α-helical conformation of the accessory domain of complexin-1. However, the authors noted that the spectra were sharper than those for solvent exposed residues on the surface of an α-helix that is part of a globular protein. Such sharpening could be due to motion between several conformations that are sampled by the accessory domain, consistent the range of conformations that are suggested by our smFRET efficiency histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, assuming that the <italic>cis</italic> conformation of complexin-1 would involve more tertiary interactions with the SNARE complex, it would result in a broader spectrum than for the <italic>trans</italic> conformation. Yet, the average of these spectra would be somewhere between these two cases and we believe that it would be difficult to uncover individual states of the system by these particular EPR experiments.</p><p><italic>2) In Lu et al's JMB paper they labeled the C-terminal positions of synaptobrevin 2. Again, complexin binding to the SNARE complex did not bring about spectral changes that reflects the large conformational change observed with FRET in this study.</italic> </p><p>Lu et al.(2010) labeled five residues of synaptobrevin (A69C, Q76C, K83C, R86C, W89C). Only positions 69 and 76 showed EPR spectral broadening when complexin-1 bound to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in Lu et al., 2010). <sub>1</sub>H-<sub>15</sub>N TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra of <sub>15</sub>N-labeled SNARE complex revealed chemical shifts for positions in all four SNARE components at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex in the presence of full-length complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> in Xue et al., 2010), consistent with our observation of an interaction of full-length complexin-1 with the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex that depends on the presence of the N-terminal domain of complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, considering the NMR data by Xue et al., the absence of a change in line width observed by EPR is apparently consistent with the existence of interactions or conformational changes at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex. However, we agree that the EPR results argue against dissociation of the C-terminal half of synaptobrevin-2 since the resulting motion of the C-terminal half of synaptovrevin-2 would be predicted to result in line sharpening. We apologize if we gave the impression of implying such a dissociation of the synaptobrevin-2 C-terminal half. Rather, our results suggest a conformational change of the SNARE complex where all the SNARE components are still interacting. We clarified the Discussion accordingly.</p><p> <italic>Using single-molecule FRET data, the authors derive distances that are then compared to the distances obtained from the crystal structures.

We have now plotted the actual donor intensity with respect to the scale that is provided on right y-axis of the panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).
