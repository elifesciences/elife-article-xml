tuberculosis</italic> infection, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and determine the best predictors of death, utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes—<italic>MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C</italic>, and <italic>CD4</italic>—were strong TBM mortality predictors. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculous meningitis is a dangerous condition caused by the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis spreading from the lungs to the brain. It affects more than 150,000 adults a year worldwide, and results in death or brain damage in half of all patients. People living with HIV are particularly at risk for negative outcomes.</p><p>These severe forms of tuberculous meningitis may be linked to the immune system becoming over-active while trying to fight the disease and harming the brain in the process. Detecting this hyperinflammation via blood sample analyzes has remained challenging so far, as traditional approaches can only offer partial information on the inflammatory response.</p><p>In response, Hai, Nhat et al. took advantage of new genetic approaches to examine the expression of around 20,000 genes in the blood of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with tuberculous meningitis or lung tuberculosis, as well as in healthy individuals. Identifying which genes are more or less expressed in the different groups of volunteers can help to better understand the mechanisms associated with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in its most dangerous forms. Such analysis could also allow scientists to pinpoint which genes to monitor to efficiently detect patients at higher risk of severe complications.</p><p>The results show that tuberculous meningitis mortality was associated with a distinct pattern of immune cell response; white blood cells known as neutrophils were increasingly activated while T and B cells showed decreased activity. Increased mortality was also linked to different patterns of gene activity between patients living with or without HIV. Overall, inflammatory genes were more activated in HIV-positive tuberculous meningitis patients than in their HIV-negative counterparts. Finally, Hai, Nhat et al. found that the blood activity levels of just four specific genes formed a signature associated with increased risk of death from tuberculous meningitis.</p><p>In the future, medical professionals may be able to use this signature to rapidly identify patients who require intensive care and more specialized treatments. The findings also reveal immune system processes and molecules that may serve as potential drug targets for future therapies against this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tuberculous meningitis</kwd><kwd>mortality</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>prognostic</kwd><kwd>whole blood RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/206724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thuong Thuong</surname><given-names>Nguyen Thuy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/106680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thwaites</surname><given-names>Guy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/110179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thwaites</surname><given-names>Guy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

TBM is the most severe form of TB, causing death or neurological disability in half of all cases. Overall, TBM mortality is around 25%, but rises to around 50% in those with HIV, with most deaths occurring in the first 3 months of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadelman et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The poor outcomes from TBM are strongly associated with the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huynh et al., 2022</xref>), with both a paucity and an excess of inflammation linked to death from TBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rohlwink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thuong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thuong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Laarhoven et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Laarhoven et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cresswell et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms behind these observations remain uncertain. Immune responses in TBM are thought to be compartmentalized within the central nervous system. Studies have shown that immune cell counts, cytokine concentrations, metabolites and transcriptional responses differ between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Laarhoven et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rohlwink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardiansyah et al., 2023</xref>). In adults with TBM, leukocyte activation is higher in the CSF than in peripheral blood, although a marked myeloid response in peripheral blood has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Laarhoven et al., 2019</xref>). Blood transcriptomic analysis has found increased neutrophil-associated transcripts and inflammasome signaling in those with HIV-associated TBM and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marais et al., 2017</xref>). In children with TBM, whole blood transcriptional profiles showed increased inflammasome activation and decreased T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rohlwink et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest the inflammatory response associated with TBM may have a greater systemic component than originally thought and its characterization may help define the immune mechanisms leading to death and disability.</p><p>The accurate and early detection of patients at highest risk of complications and death from TBM may help to target treatment for those most in need. The British Medical Research Council (MRC) grades have been used to categorize TBM severity for almost 80 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Commitee, Medical Research Council, 1948</xref>), and the system strongly predicts TBM mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thao et al., 2018</xref>). Previously, we and others developed new prognostic models from studies of 1699 adults with TBM using clinical and laboratory parameters, including MRC grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huynh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thao et al., 2018</xref>). These models predicted outcomes more accurately than MRC grade alone. However, they might be improved by measures of host inflammatory response. Host-based peripheral blood gene expression analysis has been used to identify active or progressive pulmonary TB and in pulmonary TB treatment monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sweeney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Penn-Nicholson et al., 2020</xref>), but has yet to be applied to TBM.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated whole blood RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptional profiles in 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary TB (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. Our objective was to use weighted gene co-expression network analysis, an unbiased and well-evaluated approach, to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis and assess the predictive value of gene expression for early mortality from TBM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characteristics and outcomes of the cohorts</title><p>Four RNA-seq cohorts (all ≥18 years) were used in the study, representing a total of 606 participants. The characteristics of these cohorts are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. There were 281 adults with TBM; 207 HIV-negative and 74 HIV-positive. In the HIV-negative TBM adults, the median age was 46 years (IQR 34, 58), 127 (61%) were male, and the median Body Mass Index (BMI) was 20.0 (IQR 18.2, 22.3). HIV-positive TBM were more likely than HIV-negative TBM to be male, younger, have lower BMI, have previously received TB treatment, and to have microbiologically confirmed TBM. Total white cell counts in blood and CSF in HIV-positive TBM were lower than in HIV-negative TBM. Median CD4 cell counts in HIV-positive TBM was 67 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 19, 124) and 28 (39%) were under antiretroviral therapy. The PTB cohort consisted of 295 HIV-negative adults with the median age of 44 years (IQR 31, 52), 228 (77%) were male, the median of BMI was 19.4 (IQR 17.7, 21.6) and 129 (48%) had pulmonary cavities on chest X-ray. Of the 30 healthy controls, 11 (37%) were male, and the median age was 33 (IQR 29, 37). In real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validation cohort, 132 HIV-negative TBM adults have similar characteristics as HIV-negative TBM RNA-seq cohort (<xref ref-type="table"

The overall three-month mortality rate was 21.7% (61/281) for TBM regardless of HIV status: 16.4% (34/207) in HIV-negative and 36.5% (27/74) in HIV-positive (p&lt;0.001). We did not observe differences in mortality by sex, age and diagnostic category. Greater disease severity, MRC grades 2 and 3 at enrolment, was associated with increased mortality compared to grade 1 (p&lt;0.001). In those who died, CSF and peripheral blood neutrophil counts were higher and peripheral blood lymphocyte count lower, compared to those who survived.</p><table-wrap id="table2"

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was initially performed to identify common hub genes and pathways related to TBM mortality.

Gene modules are clusters of genes that have highly interconnected expression, usually related to their biological functions. Hub genes are genes with high connectivity to other genes within a respective module. First, we used WGCNA to construct a network of gene modules in the discovery cohort. Then we validated the presence of these transcriptional modules in the validation cohort, labelling the modules with different colors.

In general, previous studies investigating TBM pathogenesis have been small, testing for relatively small numbers of selected genes or molecules, and have been unable to take an unbiased and broader view of the inflammatory response. This study investigated the pathways associated with death from TBM at a whole-genome transcriptome level in whole blood, characterizing a global dysregulation in immune responses, including inflammation, and revealing specific functional pathways and hub genes involved in TBM and the mechanisms leading to death.</p><p>We sought to understand better the pathogenesis of TBM by identifying pretreatment blood transcriptional gene modules associated TBM disease severity and three-month mortality. Four out of five identified modules were involved in immunological functions, indicating multiple functional pathways of systemic immunity are involved in the pathogenesis of TBM. In particular, mortality was strongly associated with increased acute inflammation and neutrophil activation, and decreased adaptive immunity and T and B cell activation. Whilst there appeared to be many common pathways involved in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals, there were differences: death was associated with increased expression of angiogenesis genes in HIV-positive adults, and with TNF signaling and down regulated extracellular matrix organization in HIV-negative adults. We also identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status.</p><p>TBM mortality was associated with increased acute inflammatory responses, the regulation of inflammatory responses, and neutrophil activation. Previous blood transcriptome studies have shown that IFN-inducible neutrophil-driven transcripts were over-expressed in blood neutrophils from active TB patients compared to those with latent TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Singhania et al., 2018</xref>). Another study described that TBM adults who developed IRIS during treatment, also had significantly more abundant neutrophil-associated transcripts that preceded the development of TBM-IRIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marais et al., 2017</xref>). Our own earlier studies have also suggest a role for neutrophils in TBM pathogenesis, with high pretreatment CSF bacterial loads being correlated with high neutrophil numbers in both CSF and blood and more frequent new neurological events or paradoxical inflammatory complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thuong et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together with previous studies, our findings support an important role for over-activation of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses in TBM pathogenesis and its lethal complications. Looking further into specific pathways, TBM mortality was neither associated with inflammatory response and cytokine signaling pathways in general, nor with interferon or inflammasome activation. However, increased transcripts in some specific immunity pathways, including TNF signaling, Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, were associated with TBM mortality. These pathways are involved as activators or effectors in the process of neutrophil activation and regulation, leading to an exacerbated inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castro-Alcaraz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sabroe et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We found blood transcriptional responses of T cells and B cells were under-expressed in those who died from TBM, indicating an impairment in adaptive immunity in fatal disease. A reduction of activities in both T cell and B cell receptor signaling pathways in death were identified, independent of over-expression of neutrophil-mediated immune responses, indicating that multiple functional pathways influence TBM mortality. TBM pathogenesis is known to be associated with T cell impairment. Previous studies have shown lower numbers of T cells, reduced ability to respond to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> antigens or reduced expression of activation markers and cytokine production in TBM compared to PTB and healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Laarhoven et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davoudi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shridhar et al., 2022</xref>. This impaired T cell function has correlated with disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in participants with PTB and TBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Laarhoven et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hemingway et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>B cells and antibodies also influence humoral immunity against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Studies have shown a decreased memory B cell proportion, and lower levels of IgG, IgM antibodies and Fcγ receptors binding capacity in plasma in those with active lung TB compared to those with latent TB or healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">La Manna et al., 2022</xref>). But little is known about the role of B cells in TBM. The observed association between TBM mortality and decreased transcriptional responses in B cell activation and B cell receptor signaling pathways suggest an unanticipated role for B cells and humoral immunity in TBM pathogenesis that needs further investigation.</p><p>Transcriptomic profiles from four cohorts, including healthy controls and PTB, provide a broad view of host responses in different TB clinical forms. Our data showed common transcriptional pathways and genes between PTB and TBM. A range of immune responses, involving in inflammation, cytokines, interferon, inflammasome and neutrophil signaling pathways, were activated in both PTB and TBM, but with significantly greater activation in HIV-positive TBM than HIV-negative TBM. This finding aligns with our previous data showing a dysregulated hyper-inflammation in HIV-associated TBM, with significantly higher CSF cytokine concentrations than in those without HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thuong et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest that different forms of TB are associated with similar inflammatory responses, but with different degrees of host responses, exemplified by hyper-inflammation in those with HIV.</p><p>The HIV-driven differences in TBM-associated inflammation appear sufficient to influence response to adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids. An earlier randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in 545 predominantly HIV-negative Vietnamese adults showed they significantly improved survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thwaites et al., 2004</xref>). Our group recently completed a similar sized trial exclusively in HIV-positive adults without any clear benefit upon mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donovan et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, the differences in gene expression associated with TBM mortality in the current study – with angiogenesis activation linked to HIV-positive TBM mortality only, for example – may provide an explanation for the poor response and offer alternative therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have shown that angiogenesis is induced by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, which then contributes to inflammation, tissue damage and is correlated with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Developing prognostic models for TBM is important for guiding clinical decision making and improving outcomes. Several studies have developed and validated prognostic models for TBM using clinical, laboratory and radiological variables. These models have demonstrated moderate to high accuracy in predicting mortality and functional outcomes from TBM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sharawat et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we used blood transcriptional signatures and co-expression network analysis to identify module-representative hub genes. We identified a four-gene set at the start of treatment (<italic>MCEMP1</italic>, <italic>NELL2</italic>, <italic>ZNF354C,</italic> and <italic>CD4</italic>) whose expression strongly predicted three-month TBM mortality. Our prognostic models combining this four-gene host response in blood and two routine clinical predictors achieved very good performance, with AUC 0.80 and 0.86 for HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals with TBM, respectively. This is proof-of-concept that whole blood RNA host response might be a useful pre-treatment biomarker to predict early TBM mortality. Although further investigation and validation is needed, we have identified potential gene candidates for future development as prognostic biomarkers.</p><p>In summary, we present a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the gene transcripts associated with TBM severity and mortality. Our data open a new window on TBM pathogenesis, with dysregulation in both innate and adaptive immune responses strongly associated with death from TBM. Furthermore, we have identified similarities and differences in the inflammatory response associated with TBM in HIV-positive and negative adults, which may explain the different therapeutic effects of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. We also revealed a four-gene host response signature in blood that might represent a novel biomarker for defining those at highest risk of death, regardless of their HIV status.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We collected data and whole peripheral blood samples for transcriptomic profiling from adults (≥18 years) with TBM enrolled into two randomized controlled trials conducted in Vietnam.

The LAST-ACT trial (NCT03100786) completed enrollment of 720 HIV-negative adults with TBM in March 2023, with the last participants due to complete follow-up in March 2024.</p><p>In TBM RNA-seq cohorts, peripheral blood samples were taken from 281 trial participants: the first 207 consecutively enrolled HIV-negative participants from the LAST-ACT trial, and 74 randomly selected HIV-positive participants from the ACT-HIV trial. In qPCR TBM cohorts, 132 HIV-negative participants was randomly selected from remaining participants of LAST-ACT trial with an enrichment for non-survival cases. The samples were taken at enrollment, when patients could not have received more than 6 consecutive days of two or more drugs active against M. tuberculosis. All trial participants then received standard 4-drug anti-tuberculosis treatment for 2 months, followed by 3 drugs for 10 months, and were randomly allocated to dexamethasone or identical placebo for the first 6–8 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donovan et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2018a</xref>). The investigators remain blind to the treatment allocation until the last participant completes follow-up and the database has been locked. Therefore, an analysis of the direct influence of corticosteroids on inflammatory response and outcome is not included in the current study. However, the metadata were approved to be unblinded but with double coded patient ID. We also blinded the treatment effect in the differential gene expression analysis. This was done by extracting only the log fold change difference between survival groups in the linear regression model, in which gene expression was outcome and survival groups and treatment were covariates.</p><p>Peripheral blood samples were taken for transcriptional profiling from two other cohorts: 295 adults with PTB and 30 healthy controls. The 295 PTB was enrolled in Pham Ngoc Thach hospital and District TB Units in Ho Chi Minh city, randomly selected from HIV-negative participants from a prospective observational study of the host and bacterial determinants of outcome from PTB (n=900) due to the very low prevalence of HIV in the study population. Participants had culture-confirmed PTB, either drug susceptible TB or a new diagnosis of multidrug-resistant TB. All participants in this cohort had &lt;7 days of anti-TB drugs at enrolment and did not have clinical evidence of extra-pulmonary TB.

Briefly, blood transcriptional profiling was generated from four cohorts of 207 TBM HIV-negative, 74 TBM HIV-positive, 279 PTB and 30 healthy controls. To define transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality, data from all 281 TBM participants were used. To ensure reproducibility, in our main analysis we randomly split our TBM data into two datasets, a discovery cohort (n=142) and a validation cohort (n=139). After identifying gene modules associated with mortality, related functional pathways and hub genes were determined. In a broader view, gene enrichment and expression from significant pathways and hub genes were illustrated across all four cohorts. Next, outcome prediction models were developed for TBM. Finally, the association of hub genes and outcome prediction then was validated in qPCR HIV-negative TBM cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sample processing and RNA-seq</title><p>Whole blood samples, collected from participants at enrollment, were stored in PAXgene collection tubes at –80 °C.

Batch 2 was done in 2022 including 43 HIV-positive TBM and 30 Healthy control. RNA samples were isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA kits (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions, except for an additional washing step before RNA elution. DNA was digested on columns using the RNase-free DNase Set (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Quality control of the RNA extraction was performed using the Epoch spec for quantity and quality, and Tapestation Eukaryotic RNA Screentape for integrity. Samples with RNA integrity number below 4 were exclude for further steps. RNA-seq was performed by the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (Sydney, Australia). One microgram of total RNA was used as input for each sample, using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Ribo-zero Globin kit (Illumina). Libraries were generated on the Sciclone G3 NGS (Perkin Elmer, Utah, USA) and the cDNA was amplified using 11 PCR cycles.

Briefly, the quality of the sequencing fastq files was analyzed using FastQC (v0.11.5) and poor quality samples were excluded from further analysis. Sequence reads were adapter and quality trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.36), followed by duplicated optical read removal using BBMap (v38.79) tool. STAR aligner (v2.5.2a) was used to align the reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38 build 99) downloaded from Ensembl, allowing for maximum 2 mismatches in each 25 bp segment and a maximum of 20 alignment hits per read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>).

In brief, 20,000 most variant genes out of 60,067 genes in the expression matrix were first selected and normalized by variance stabilizing transformation method built in DESeq2 package in R. The batch effect was removed on normalized expression data using combat function in the SVA package. After removing batch effect, 5000 most variable genes across 281 TBM were input in unsupervised principle component analysis to check for potentially outlying individuals. Specifically, we declared individuals as outliers if they were &gt; 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean first or second principle component. No individual was classified as outliers using these criteria. Using WGCNA, the similarity matrix between each pair of genes across all samples was calculated based on its Pearson’s correlation value. Then, the similarity matrix was transformed into an adjacency matrix. Subsequently, the topological overlap matrix (TOM) and the corresponding dissimilarity (1-TOM) value were computed based on soft threshold <italic>β</italic> = 8 which meet the criteria for scale-free topology property of the co-expression network (R<sup>2</sup>-cutoff for scale-free topology  = 0.85). Finally, a dynamic tree cut algorithm with deepSplit of 2, cut height of 0.975 and minimum module size of 30 genes, was employed to detect gene co-expression modules, groups of genes with a similar expression. The expression patterns of each gene module were summarized by the first principle component (PC1). Pairs of modules were subsequently merged if the correlation between the modules’ PC1 exceeded 0.7. Genes that did not fit the clustering criteria were combined in a leftover group named grey.</p><p>If a module in the discovery dataset is not determined randomly, it will be reproduced in validation dataset. In this study, module preservation statistics was used to validate whether a defined module in discovery dataset could also be found in validation dataset. The WGCNA used two composite preservation statistics for module preservation: First, Z-summary distinguished preserved modules from non-preserved ones through the permutation test (n Permutations = 1000). Values below 2 of Z-summary indicate non-preserved modules, while values over 2 represent moderately preserved modules, and values over 10 provides strong evidence of module preservation. Next, median ranks were computed. In comparisons of the two modules, the one with a higher median rank was considered to have a lower preservation tendency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langfelder et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>WGCNA consensus analysis in HIV-negative and HIV-positive TBM cohorts</title><p>Similar to preservation analysis, 5000 most variance genes were input in WGCNA consensus analysis.

Considering the diverse statistical properties between different HIV-negative and HIV-positive data sets, we scaled and transformed the HIV-positive TOM to make it equivalent to that HIV-negative and obtained consensus modules between two TBM cohorts; the consensus TOM was calculated with component-wise (‘parallel’) minimum of the TOMs for each set. To obtain large modules, the ‘minModuleSize’ parameter, indicating the minimum module size of the modules, was set as 30. Genes with similar expression patterns were separated into different modules with the ‘cutreeDynamic’ function; to evaluate and group the co-expression similarities of all modules, the eigengenes (MEs) were calculated, clustered, and mapped to the related consensus modules; then, modules with a correlation of 0.75 were merged with ‘mergeCloseModules’ function using default parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Validation of hub genes by Microfluidic multiplex RT-qPCR</title><p>Whole blood samples were collected, stored and RNA extraction was performed as described in previous section.

We constructed the contradicted matrix with survival and death status adjusted for covariates including: age, HIV status, corticosteroid treatment (LAST-ACT trial investigators remained blind). Linear models were used to assess DEGs using limma R package. Empirical Bayes moderated-t p-values were computed for each genes and Benjamini-Hochberg were used for correcting multiple testing (FDR). We defined the DEGs with the parameters (fold change &gt;1.5 and FDR &lt;0.05). To visualize samples clustering in the four cohorts, an unsupervised principal component analysis was performed on 20,000 normalized genes, and the first principle component was plotted against the second principle component. The 95% confidence ellipse was drawn for each group using multivariate t-distribution ellipse. To compare enrichment activity of interested pathways between death vs survival, TBM vs PTB or healthy controls, enrichment scores of these pathways were calculated for single patient using single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm (ssGSEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbie et al., 2009</xref>).

Subsequently, we conducted a <italic>module-trait association analysis</italic> to identify modules associated with the clinical traits of mortality and TBM severity. For the association analysis with mortality, we used a <italic>Cox regression model</italic> with the PC1 of the module as an independent variable.

We corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) for the dependent hypotheses by using the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure. Target modules were defined as modules associated with mortality in both the discovery and validation cohorts at FDR &lt;0.05. Hub genes within each targeted module were identified based on three criteria: being protein coding gene, module membership cut off 0.85 (MM) and high rank of gene significance rank (GS). MM defined as correlation between individual gene and the module’s PC1. GS defined as -log<sub>10</sub> p value association of gene with mortality using Cox regression model adjusted for age, HIV status and dexamethasone treatment. Genes were first filtered for protein coding function and MM above 0.85. Genes then was ranked based on its GS and top 20 hub genes were selected if number of genes in module above 500, otherwise top 10 genes were selected.

We conducted similar association analyses for TBM severity and mortality as in the preceding WGCNA analysis for both the HIV-negative and HIV-positive cohorts. We visualized the results using a heatmap. We focused on modules that failed to form consensus associations with mortality due to opposite associations in the two cohorts and defined as HIV-positive-specific signals and HIV-negative-specific signals. Additionally, the functional enrichment ORA was performed for these consensus modules and the HIV-specific modules. Top 5 hub genes from HIV-specific modules were selected based on criteria described in primary analysis, which included being protein-coding genes and having high MM and high rank GS.

Candidate predictors in HIV-negative TBM consisted of the combination of common hub genes, HIV-negative specific hub genes and clinical biomarkers: age, TBM severity and CSF lymphocyte count. Similarly, for HIV-positive TBM, candidate predictors consisted of common hub genes, HIV-positive specific hub genes and clinical biomarkers. We performed the analysis with 1,000 bootstrap sampling with replacement. The chosen variables were (1) among the top 75% of selected variables and (2) one representative hub gene per module.

We also assessed predictive performance of chosen variables in each cohort by 1000 times bootstrapping sampling approach and reported the overall model performance <italic>optimism-corrected Brier score</italic>, the discrimination (<italic>optimism-corrected AUC</italic>), and calibration (<italic>optimism-corrected calibration-slope</italic>) of the developed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Steyerberg et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration NCT03100786; NCT03092817.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review board at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital and the ethics committee of the Ministry of Health in Vietnam, and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, UK (OxTREC 52-16, 36-16, 24-17, 33-17 and 532-22).

TBM is especially prevalent in people who are immunocompromised (e.g. HIV-positive). Delays in diagnosis and treatment could lead to severe disease or mortality. In this study, the authors performed the largest ever host whole blood transcriptomics analysis on a cohort of 606 Vietnamese participants. The results indicated that TBM mortality is associated with increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways. Furthermore, increased angiogenesis was also observed in HIV-positive patients who died from TBM, whereas activated TNF signaling and down-regulated extracellular matrix organisation were seen in the HIV-negative group. Despite similarities in transcriptional profiles between PTB and TBM compared to healthy controls, inflammatory genes were more active in HIV-positive TBM.

Our stated objective was to use bioinformatics tools to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis and the eLife assessment affirms we have investigated ‘the transcriptional landscape of tuberculous meningitis’. To more precisely define aspects of the biology will require another study with different design and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is one of the most severe forms of extrapulmonary TB. TBM is especially prevalent in people who are immunocompromised (e.g. HIV-positive). Delays in diagnosis and treatment could lead to severe disease or mortality. In this study, the authors performed the largest-ever host whole blood transcriptomics analysis on a cohort of 606 Vietnamese participants. The results indicated that TBM mortality is associated with increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways. Furthermore, increased angiogenesis was also observed in HIV-positive patients who died from TBM, whereas activated TNF signaling and down-regulated extracellular matrix organisation were seen in the HIV-negative group. Despite similarities in transcriptional profiles between PTB and TBM compared to healthy controls, inflammatory genes were more active in HIV-positive TBM. Finally, 4 hub genes (MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4) were identified as strong predictors of death from TBM.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a really impressive piece of work, both in terms of the size of the cohort which took years of effort to recruit, sample, and analyse, and also the meticulous bioinformatics performed. The biggest advantage of obtaining a whole blood signature is that it allows an easier translational development into a test that can be used in the clinical with a minimally invasive sample. Furthermore, the data from this study has also revealed important insights into the mechanisms associated with mortality and the differences in pathogenesis between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients, which would have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The data on blood neutrophil count is really intriguing and seems to provide a very powerful yet easy-to-measure method to differentiate survival vs. death in TBM patients. It would be quite useful in this case to perform predictive analysis to see if neutrophil count alone, or in combination with gene signature, can predict (or better predict) mortality, as it would be far easier for clinical implementation than the RNA-based method. Moreover, genes associated with increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation both have significantly higher enrichment scores in TBM (Figure 9) and in morality (Figure 8). While I understand the basis of selecting hub genes in the significant modules, they often do not represent these biological pathways (at least not directly associated in most cases). If genes were selected based on these biologically relevant pathways, would they have better predictive values?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted a sensitivity analysis including blood neutrophil as a potential predictor in the multivariate Cox elastic-net regression model for important predictor selection (Table S14). In this analysis, all six selected important predictors (genes and clinical risk factors) identified in the original analysis (Table S13) were also selected, together with blood neutrophil number. Additionally, we evaluated the predictive value of blood neutrophil alone, which demonstrated poor performance, with an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.63 for all TBM, 0.67 for HIV-negative TBM, and 0.70 for HIV-positive TBM. Even when combined with identified gene signatures, blood neutrophil did not improve the overall performance of predictive model (optimism-corrected AUC of 0.79 for all TBM, 0.76 for HIV-negative TBM, and 0.80 for HIV-positive). These results indicate that identified hub genes exhibit better predictive values compared to blood neutrophil alone or in combination. These findings have been incorporated into our manuscript results.</p><p>To test whether pathway representative genes have better predictive values than hub genes, we included all these genes in the analysis for important predictor selection. Pathway representative genes comprised ANXA3 and CXCR2 representing neutrophil activation and IL1b representing acute inflammatory response. We observed that all hub genes (MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4) consistently emerged as the most important genes with the highest selection in the models, compared to the rest, in both the HIV-negative TBM and HIV-positive TBM cohorts. Additionally, these identified hub genes were still selected when testing together with other hub genes representing relevant biological pathways associated with TBM mortality, such as CYSTM1 involved in neutrophil activation, TRAF5 involved in NF-kappa B signaling pathway, CD28 and TESPA1 involved in T cell receptor signaling. These results show that selected genes based on known biologically relevant pathways did not give better predictive values than the identified hub genes in the significant modules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the analysis of blood transcriptomic data from patients with TB meningitis, with and without HIV infection, with some comparison to those of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy volunteers.

At best, they require independent validation for a given context. As a result, the conclusions are not adequately substantiated. The identification of a prognostic blood transcriptomic signature uses an unusual discovery approach that leverages weighted gene network analysis that underpins the bioinformatic analyses. However, the main problem is that authors seem to use all the data for discovery and do not undertake any true external validation of their gene signature. As a result, the proposed gene signature is likely to be overfitted to these data and not generalisable. Even this does not achieve significantly better prognostic discrimination than the existing clinical scoring.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in response to the eLife assessment, our objective was to use bioinformatics tools to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis. We agree that ‘This analysis cannot be used to make causal inferences’: that would require different study design and approaches. The proposed gene signature has higher AUC values than the existing clinical model alone or in combination with clinical risk factors (Table 4). We agree that independent validation of the gene signature will be a crucial next step for future utility. We have performed qPCR in another sample set, and have added these results in the revision (Table 4 and supplementary figure S8)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have a few additional comments most of which are relatively minor:</p><p>(1) Can the authors please clarify if all the PTB cases are also HIV-negative?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For Table 1, can the authors please list the total number of patients with microbiologically confirmed TB regardless of the methods used?

Is there information on the median and IQR on the number of days that the patients would have received Rx, especially between the groups? Did the authors control for this variable when analysing for DEGs?</p></disp-quote><p>One of criteria to enroll participants in LAST-ACT and ACT-HIV trials is that they must receive less than 6 consecutive days of two or more drugs active against M. tuberculosis. However, the information of the days that the patients would have received Rx was not recorded and we could not control this variable when performing differential expression analysis for DEGs. This has been clarified further in the methods section: ‘The samples were taken at enrollment, when patients could not have received more than 6 consecutive days of two or more drugs active against M. tuberculosis.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) I am a little bit concerned with the reads mapping accuracy (57%) to the human genome, which is fairly low.

Please clarify whether this cohort excluded HIV-positive participants by design or by chance.</p></disp-quote><p>The inclusion criteria for the pulmonary TB cohort were described in the methods section. Due to the very low prevalence of HIV in this prospective observational study, HIV-positive participants were excluded. We have clarified in the amended manuscript that the pulmonary TB cohort only included HIV-negative participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Baseline characteristics of HIV-positive participants (Table 1) should include CD4 count, HIV viral load, and whether anti-retroviral therapy was naïve or experienced.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included pre-treatment CD4 cell count, information on anti-retroviral therapy, and HIV viral load data in Table 1, as well as described these information in the results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I note that the TBM samples were derived from RCTs of adjunctive steroid therapy, but not stratified in the present analysis by treatment arm allocation. Clearly, this may affect the survival/mortality outcomes that are the central focus of this manuscript. Therefore, they should be included in the models for differential gene expression analysis and prognostic signature discovery. To do so, the authors may need to wait until they are able to unblind the trial metadata.</p></disp-quote><p>With permission from the trial investigators, we were able to adjust the analyses for treatment with corticosteroids. The investigators remained blind to the allocation and we have not reported any direct effects of corticosteroids on outcome – such an analysis could only be done once the LAST-ACT trial has been reported (which won’t be until the end of 2024). Treatment outcome and effect were blinded by extracting only the fold change difference between survival and death in the linear regression model, in which gene expression was outcome and survival and treatment were covariates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I understood from the methods (lines 460-461) that batch correction of the RNAseq data was necessary. However, it is not clear how the samples were batched. PCA of the transcriptomes before and after batch correction with batch and study group labels should be provided. I would also advocate for a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the main findings without batch correction. I assume Fig2A represents batch-corrected data, but this is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added information about the RNA sequencing batch and the batch correction approach, analyses and data visualizations utilized batch-corrected data in the methods section. We have also updated results related to batch correction in Fig. 2A and Supplementary Figure S9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) I would encourage the authors to include a differential gene expression analysis to directly compare the transcriptome of TBM to that of pulmonary TB. I think it would add additional value to their focus on describing the transcriptome in TBM.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for reviewer’s suggestion. Conducting differential gene expression analysis to compare the transcriptome of TBM with that of PTB is beyond the scope of this manuscript and we will examine this question separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) I don't really understand the purpose of splitting their data set into test and validation for the purposes of showing that WGCNA analysis is mostly reproduced in the two halves of the data. I would advocate that they scrap this approach to maximise the statistical power of their analysis in the descriptive work.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response to reviewer #1 in question #3, the purpose of splitting data is to ensure the reproducibility of the data analysis as suggested by Langfelder et al. (PMID: 21283776). This approach served two purposes: (i) to affirm the existence of functional modules in an independent cohort and (ii) to validate the association of interested modules or their hub genes with survival outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors should soften the confidence in their interpretation of the GO/KEGG annotations of WGCNA modules. At least, they should include a paragraph that explicitly details the limitations of their analyses, including (i) the accuracy GO/KEGG annotations are not validated in this context (if at all), (ii) that none of the data can be used to make causal inferences and (iii) that peripheral blood assessments that are obviously impacted by changes in cellular composition of peripheral blood do not necessarily reflect immunopathogenesis at the site of disease - in fact if circulating cells are being recruited to the site of disease or other immune compartments, then quite the opposite interpretations may be true.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment. (i) In our analysis, we initially confirmed the existence of Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) modules in discovery cohort and validated the association of these modules with mortality outcomes in validation cohort. We then applied GO/KEGG annotations to define the biological functions involved in WGCNA modules. Finally, we performed Qusage analysis to directly test the association of top-hit pathways of each WGCNA module with mortality outcomes (see supplementary S6). This analysis approach helped to identify and validate modules and biological pathways associated with TBM mortality in this context, avoiding potential false positives in GO/KEGG annotations of WGCNA modules. (ii) We agree with the assessment that 'This analysis cannot be used to make causal inferences,' as that would require a different study design and approach. (iii) The focus of this study is to investigate the pathogenesis of TBM in the systemic immune system. We have highlighted this focus in the title and the aim of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) For the prognostic signature discovery and validation, I strongly recommend the authors include more robust validation. For example, to undertake an 80:20 split for sequential discovery (for feature selection and derivation of a prognostic model), followed by validation of a 'locked' model in data that made no contribution to discovery. In two separate sensitivity analyses. I also suggest they split their dataset (i) by treatment allocation in the RCT and (ii) by HIV status. In addition, their method for feature selection has to be clearer- precisely how they select hub genes from their WGCNA analysis as candidate predictors is not explained. Since this is such a prominent output of their manuscript, the results of this analysis should really be included in the main manuscript, and all performance metrics for discrimination should include confidence intervals.</p></disp-quote><p>Employing an 80:20 split for training and testing models is a good approach for an internal validation. However, we addressed the issue of overestimating the performance of a prognostic model by bootstrapping sampling approach proposed by Steyerberg et al. (PMID: 11470385). This approach has been proven to provide stable estimates with low bias. The overall model performance for discrimination, reported in our manuscript, was corrected for “optimism” to ensure internal validity. This adjustment was achieved through a 1000-times bootstrapping approach, which effectively accounted for estimation uncertainty. As such, there is no need to present confidence intervals for these metrics.</p><p>Moreover, in our revision, to confirm prognostic signatures independently, we have evaluated the predictive value of identified gene signatures using qPCR in another set of samples. The results have been added in Table 4, supplementary Figure S8 and the results section.</p><p>For the reasons given above (comment 4), we are unable to split our dataset by treatment allocation in this analysis. But as described, we have adjusted the analysis for corticosteroid treatment. Once the primary results of the LAST ACT trial have been published, we will examine the impact of corticosteroids on TBM pathophysiology and outcomes, seeking to better understand the mechanisms by which steroids have their therapeutic effects.</p><p>Given the difference in pathogenesis and immune response by HIV-coinfection, we stratified our analysis by HIV status. As the reviewer’s suggestion, we have provided additional details in the methods section regarding the selection of hub genes from associated WGCNA modules and the feature selection process for predictive modeling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
