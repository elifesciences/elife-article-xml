However, treatment with classical substrate-site-directed TS inhibitors induces over-expression of this protein and development of drug resistance. We thus pursued an alternative strategy that led us to the discovery of TS-dimer destabilizers. These compounds bind at the monomer-monomer interface and shift the dimerization equilibrium of both the recombinant and the intracellular protein toward the inactive monomers. A structural, spectroscopic, and kinetic investigation has provided evidence and quantitative information on the effects of the interaction of these small molecules with hTS. Focusing on the best among them, <bold>E7</bold>, we have shown that it inhibits hTS in cancer cells and accelerates its proteasomal degradation, thus causing a decrease in the enzyme intracellular level. <bold>E7</bold> also showed a superior anticancer profile to fluorouracil in a mouse model of human pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Thus, over sixty years after the discovery of the first TS prodrug inhibitor, fluorouracil, <bold>E7</bold> breaks the link between TS inhibition and enhanced expression in response, providing a strategy to fight drug-resistant cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thymidylate synthase</kwd><kwd>protein dimer destabilizers</kwd><kwd>cancer growth

to bind at specific pockets of the monomer/monomer interface of a dimeric protein may perturb the dimeric assembly to the limit of disrupting it, and thus alter metabolic pathways associated with the cellular functions of the monomeric and dimeric protein forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taddia et al., 2015</xref>). Such a drastic structural change of the protein may open the way to unexpected events, such as a higher liability to intracellular degradation of the protein monomers relative to the dimers.</p><p>Human thymidylate synthase (hTS) is an obligate, stable homodimer (K<sub>d</sub> = 80 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Genovese et al., 2010</xref>) with two active sites, each including residues from both monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costi et al., 2005</xref>). As a dimeric enzyme, it provides the sole de novo pathway to deoxythymidylate (dTMP) synthesis in human cells by catalyzing the reductive methylation of deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to dTMP using methylenetetrahydrofolate (mTHF) as the one-carbon methyl donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carreras and Santi, 1995</xref>). By interacting with its own and other mRNAs, this protein regulates its own levels and those of other proteins involved in apoptotic processes, including bcl2, c-myc, and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jennings and Willis, 2015</xref>). Its inhibition is usually achieved with compounds that bind at the protein active-site, competing either with the dUMP substrate, such as 5-fluorodeoxyurdine 5’-monophosphate (FdUMP), or with the folate cofactor, such as raltitrexed (RTX) and pemetrexed (PMX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carreras and Santi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jennings and Willis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, these drugs induce cells to develop drug resistance associated with increased hTS levels which eventually leads to therapy failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peters, 2018</xref>). A drastic change of strategy, based on the design of new compounds with different mechanisms of action, is thus necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voeller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardinale et al., 2011</xref>). Here we report the discovery of molecules that bind at the hTS monomer/monomer interface and, despite their small size, markedly shift the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the enzyme towards the inactive monomeric form. Acting as destabilizers of the hTS dimer, they not only inhibit the activity of this obligate homodimeric enzyme but also favor its intracellular degradation and, hence, decrease its level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Drug target sites on hTS: the active-site (<bold>A,B</bold>) and the Y202 pocket (<bold>C–F</bold>).</title><p>Drugs that are directed to the active site of hTS can mimic either the cofactor MTHF or the substrate dUMP and bind in their binding pockets.

We then employed molecular modeling and medicinal chemistry to modify the fragments and develop inhibitors able to bind WT hTS guided solely by their affinities for the interface region. For these small molecules, we propose a model able to quantitatively account both for the dissociation of the hTS dimer, observed spectroscopically, and for the corresponding activity inhibition. We have also shown that their ability to induce the TS-dimer dissociation in cells lies below their efficacy in inhibiting growth of colon, ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells. One of our hTS-dimer destabilizers, compound <bold>E7</bold>, induced apoptosis in cancer cells and a decrease of hTS levels due to enhanced proteasomal degradation of the enzyme monomers with respect to the dimers. Remarkably, in a mouse model of orthotopic pancreatic cancer, this dimer disrupter caused a higher reduction of cancer growth and had lower toxicity than 5-fluorouracil (<bold>5-FU</bold>), the prodrug of 5-FdUMP. Like what we observed in vitro, the molecular analysis of exported treated cancer tissues demonstrated decreased hTS protein and mRNA levels. These findings establish <bold>E7</bold> as a new lead with an hTS dimer-disruptive ability and link the dimer-to-monomer equilibrium shift of this protein to its faster intracellular degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Choice of the ligand binding-site on the target protein surface</title><p>To target the monomer-monomer interface and dissociate the hTS dimer, we applied the ‘cysteine tethering’ approach to fragment-based drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erlanson et al., 2000</xref>).

It is large enough (22 Å<sup>3</sup>) to accommodate a phenyl group and has several smaller crevices around it. During the MD simulations of monomeric hTS, the side chain of Y202 moved away leaving a larger pocket and behaving like a gate. We therefore made the Y202C mutant and screened for compounds able to form a covalent disulfide bond with C202 from a library of organic disulfides. We also mutated the active site cysteine to serine to prevent the selection of compounds that bound at the active site (C195S).

In agreement with the described computational and crystallographic data (see above), Y202C is the most exposed of these three cysteines and is thus easily available for disulfide-bond formation with the RS fragments, being therefore suitable for tethering experiments. Other reasons to select the Y202 pocket are that Y202 is not predicted to be part of the mRNA binding region and has the capability to interact with various functional groups. Hence, despite the difficulties in the identification of the precise cysteine to which the fragments could bind, all the above arguments support the choice of the Y202 pocket at the hTS interface as a suitable binding site for further structure-based studies.

For the FRET-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Genovese et al., 2010</xref>), we conjugate one protein monomer with red-emitting tetramethylrhodamine (T) and the other with green-emitting fluorescein (F). Only when the monomers are close to each other, that is, combined to form a dimer, F-to-T excitation energy transfer occurs, a FRET signal is detected, and its efficiency determined. We can thus investigate the dimer/monomer equilibrium of hTS, characterize it by the corresponding dissociation equilibrium constant and evaluate the effect of a tested compound thereupon.</p><p>Among the 26 compounds selected by VS, <bold>B12</bold> and <bold>B26</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4A</xref>), caused low but reproducible decreases in the efficiency of FRET (ΔΦ<sub>FRET</sub> = -0.13 and ΔΦ<sub>FRET</sub> = -0.02, respectively), thus indicating some ability to perturb the enzyme dimeric assembly. In the docked poses, interactions were established by <bold>B12</bold> with Y202 through the <italic>o</italic>-chloro-phenyl ring and with R175 through the <italic>p</italic>-nitro-pyridyl ring, and by <bold>B26</bold> with Y202 through the piperidin-1-yl ring and with R175 through the quinoline ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we designed and synthesized four sets of compounds (<bold>C-F</bold>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) to develop <bold>B26</bold> into biologically active compounds that exhibited the ability to both disrupt the dimer and inhibit recombinant hTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig7">7</xref>). The most relevant compounds were <bold>C2</bold>, <bold>C3</bold>, <bold>C4, E5</bold>, <bold>E6,</bold> and <bold>E7</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4B-E</xref>). The former three, differing only for the position of the carboxylic group on the phenyl ring, featured IC<sub>50</sub> values 5.25, 83 and 246 μM vs. 300 nM hTS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and were selected for a quantitative mechanistic analysis of FRET and inhibition data with recombinant hTS (see the next paragraph). It was however compounds <bold>E5</bold>, <bold>E6,</bold> and <bold>E7</bold> that proved to be the most interesting to continue our study. They featured IC<sub>50</sub> values against 300 nM recombinant hTS of 40, 10 and 7 μM respectively, and decreased FRET efficiency by –0.24 at 50 μM (<bold>E5</bold>, <bold>E6</bold>) and –0.1 at 10 μM (<bold>E7</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Compound <bold>E7</bold>, that was the most active on cells, was determined to be a racemic mixture of two enantiomers that equilibrated with a half-life of 56 min (Appendix 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Additional evidence of the ability of compounds <bold>C3</bold> and <bold>E5</bold> to bind hTS and destabilize its dimers was provided by anion-exchange (AE) chromatographic experiments. Two bands, separated by ca. 2 min, both corresponding to fractions characterized by the absorption spectrum of hTS, were found in the AE chromatogram based on absorbance at 280 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The relative area of the second band was only about 3.5% that of the first one and decreased further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) when the protein was loaded together with dUMP and Raltitrexed, both at 250 μM, a concentration more than one order of magnitude larger than their dissociation constants from hTS. Because binding of hTS to its nucleotidic substrate stabilizes the active, dimeric form of the enzyme, and consistently with the expectations based on protein size and the correlated elution times, we attribute the two bands to the hTS dimers the first one, and monomers the second. In keeping with this assignment, when hTS was loaded on the AE column after a 1 hr incubation with compound <bold>C3</bold> at three concentrations, namely 4, 40, and 80 μM, the monomer band was delayed by additional 3–4 min relative to the dimer band in the chromatograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>) and its relative area increased markedly, from 0.035 to 0.08, to 0.24 and to 1.09, respectively. Co-elution, hence stable non covalent binding of the <bold>C3</bold> inhibitor with hTS, was established by the observation that the fractions containing the hTS dimers and monomers also exhibited absorption at 350 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), a wavelength at which no absorption comes from the protein. Accumulation of compound <bold>C3</bold> in these fractions was confirmed by identifying and quantifying it in the AE chromatographic fractions by high-resolution mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Absorbances at 350 nm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> indicated similar concentrations of the compound in the fractions corresponding to the protein dimers and monomers, in spite of the fact that the 280 nm dimer chromatographic band was much more intense than the monomer band. This finding suggests a somewhat larger affinity of the ligand for the latter. Consistently, parallel MS experiments in which 4 μM <bold>E5</bold> was loaded on the AE column with hTS identified this ligand mainly in the fractions containing the protein monomers (see additional information in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). So, overall, the results synthesized here show that these small compounds co-elute with hTS, thus proving beyond doubt that they remain bound to it, possibly to the monomer more tightly than to the dimer, throughout the AE chromatographic runs. Also, they qualitatively show the ability of these ligands to de-stabilize the hTS dimers in favor of the monomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mechanistic analysis of dissociative inhibition</title><p>The nitrothiophenyl derivative, <bold>C3</bold> and its isomers, <bold>C2</bold> and <bold>C4</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4B</xref>), are structurally similar to compound <bold>E7</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4D</xref>) and are much more soluble in water.

This was analyzed as reported in the <italic>Appendix 4</italic>. We searched for evidence of the disruptive character of compound <bold>C3</bold> by investigating the dependence of its dose-effect curves on total protein concentration, E<sub>T</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>As expected for a dissociative inhibition mechanism, the limit values of Φ<sub>FRET</sub> at high <bold>C3</bold> concentrations were consistent with a 5-fold increase in the equilibrium dissociation constant for the protein bound to <bold>C3</bold> with respect to the free protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>From the common limit values of Φ<sub>FRET</sub> at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we conclude that, when saturating hTS, compounds <bold>C2-C4</bold> have similar effects on the dimer stability. The fivefold increase in the protein-dimer dissociation equilibrium constant and the corresponding decrease in ΔG° for dimer disruption, from 40.5 to about 36.5 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>, ΔΔG° = –4 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>, are evidence of the dimer-destabilizing ability of compounds <bold>C2-C4</bold>. On the other hand, their different abilities to decrease the FRET efficiency at lower concentrations can be attributed to different affinities for the protein dimers, with K<sub>I</sub>’’s of 2.8x10<sup>–5</sup>, 1x10<sup>–5</sup> and 2x10<sup>–5</sup> M, for <bold>C2</bold>, <bold>C3,</bold> and <bold>C4</bold>, respectively. Thus, the observed overall effect of such an inhibitor results from a combination of affinity for the protein and ability to destabilize its dimeric assembly by impairing crucial attractive inter-monomer interactions.</p><p>Binding of compounds <bold>C2-C4</bold> at the Y202 pocket of the hTS monomer/monomer interface is supported by computational docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In the hTS dimer, the aromatic ring of the Y202 residue forms a π-π interaction with the phenyl ring of the F59’ residue from the opposite subunit. Such a ring is replaced by the phenyl ring of the benzoic acid portions of <bold>C2-C4</bold> in their modeled complexes with hTS. Thus, these compounds mimic some of the residue side chains from the opposite monomer in the dimer, providing similar interactions in this region. This finding is supported by the higher affinities of the inhibitors for the hTS monomer (K<sub>I</sub> = 10<sup>–6</sup> M) than for the dimer (K<sub>I</sub>’=1.7 x 10<sup>–5</sup> M), as obtained by fitting of the FRET data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>The reliability of our docking virtual experiments was strengthened by their ability to explain the observed higher affinity for hTS of compound <bold>C3</bold> relative to its isomers, <bold>C2</bold> and <bold>C4</bold>. While the nitro-groups of all these ligands can make head-to-head hydrogen-bonding interactions with R64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>), only the <italic>para</italic> carboxylic group of compound <bold>C3</bold> arranges properly to establish an additional H-bond with R175. Instead, the <italic>meta</italic> and <italic>ortho</italic> carboxylic groups of <bold>C2</bold> and <bold>C4</bold> do not have the correct orientations for interacting with this arginine residue.</p><p>As for the mechanism of inhibition of the enzymatic activity of hTS by compounds <bold>C2-C4</bold>, we show that the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> can account for the dependence of the initial reaction rate (<italic>v</italic>) on the substrate concentration at different inhibitor concentrations with very reasonable fitting parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Simple observation of the dependence of <italic>v</italic> on [<bold>C3</bold>] with total enzyme concentration (E<sub>T</sub>) 300 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) indicates a regular decrease with increasing [<bold>C3</bold>] to a limiting rate that is about 1/5 the rate in the absence of inhibitor. On the other hand, the E<sub>T</sub>-dependent limiting value of Φ<sub>FRET</sub> was about half the full one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This difference in the limit behaviors of <italic>v</italic> and Φ<sub>FRET</sub> suggests that, when bound to the inhibitor, the dimeric enzyme is less catalytically active than when free. Or, in terms of the dissociative/noncompetitive model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, K<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>3</sub> are larger than K<sub>1</sub>, or k’ and/or k’’ are smaller than k. The curves that go through the kinetic data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are plots of eq. <italic>v</italic> = x<sub>r</sub><sup>2</sup>S<sub>T</sub>D that was obtained by fast-equilibrium solution of the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (for the derivation of the equation and the meanings of the symbols therein, see the <italic>Appendix 4</italic>). Remarkably, the fitting parameters, provided in the caption, are consistent with the results of the FRET-based analysis of the equilibria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and the limit behaviors of the initial rate and of Φ<sub>FRET</sub>. More in detail: (i) k’’ is much smaller than k and k’, that is, M<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> is almost catalytically inactive, a feature typical of noncompetitive inhibition; (ii) K<sub>3</sub> is larger than K<sub>1,2</sub>, i.e., inhibitor binding reduces the enzyme affinity for MTHF; (iii) K<sub>I</sub>’ and K<sub>I</sub>’’ remain one order of magnitude larger than K<sub>I</sub>; i.e., when saturated with dUMP, the enzyme dimer shows lower affinity for the inhibitor than the monomer; (iv) using the relationships among the equilibrium constants, we estimate that K<sub>D</sub>’/K<sub>D</sub> = K<sub>I</sub>’/K<sub>I</sub> ≈ 10 and K<sub>D</sub>’’/K<sub>D</sub>’=K<sub>I</sub>’’/K<sub>I</sub> ≈ 10, that is, the kinetic results confirm a progressive dissociation of the enzyme dimer to monomers upon subsequent additions of <bold>C3</bold>. The latter is therefore confirmed to be both a dimer disrupter and a dissociative inhibitor, the two roles being intimately connected with each other.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The dimer destabilizers engage hTS in cancer cells</title><p>To gain evidence that our hTS dimer destabilizers engage this enzyme in cells, we resorted to fluorescence microscopy. For this experiment, we selected compound <bold>E5</bold> to be incorporated in the final conjugated probe because its chemical precursor, <bold>E3</bold>, has a reactive carboxylic group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4D</xref>) and is therefore suitable for probe conjugation chemistry. <bold>E6</bold> and <bold>E7</bold> do not have the same suitable precursors. Using a short ether linker, we conjugated it to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a green-emitting probe that favors cell internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig8">Appendix 2—figures 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig10">10</xref>). Indeed, cells were permeable to the <bold>E5-(O<sub>2</sub>Oc)-CAM-FITC (E5-FITC</bold>) conjugate. It proved slightly less active at inhibiting recombinant hTS than <bold>E5</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub>s=40 and 100 μM, for <bold>E5</bold> and <bold>E5-FITC,</bold> respectively), likely because the probe tail caused some steric hindrance for its binding to the enzyme. For these experiments, we ectopically expressed in HT-29 cells either Wild Type (WT) hTS or a mutant with a tetracysteine motif (CCPGCC, TC) inserted near the N-terminus (TS-TC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ponterini et al., 2016</xref>).

HT-29 cells (transfected with either WT TS or TC-TS) were treated with ReAsH and <bold>E5-FITC</bold>.

Among the classical active-site inhibitors of hTS, <bold>5-FU</bold> forms a stable ternary complex with the MTHF cofactor and the hTS protein and induces high expression of hTS by stabilizing the dimeric assembly, thereby impairing both the protein feed-back regulation and the proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peña et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, <bold>PMX</bold>, another TS active-site inhibitor with a folate-analog structure, binds at the MTHF binding site and forms a reversible non-covalent ternary complex with dUMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>).

The observed decrease in hTS protein levels caused by <bold>E5</bold> and <bold>E7</bold> led us to hypothesize that it might be associated with a post-translational regulation mechanism, including proteasomal degradation. To test this hypothesis, we selected <bold>E7</bold>, our best cellular inhibitor, to determine the hTS half-life after blocking the de novo protein synthesis with the cycloheximide (CHX) inhibitor. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, we found that the half-life of hTS was 3 hr in untreated cancer cells and that the degradation rate of the enzyme increased by 20% in <bold>E7</bold>–treated A2780 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>To check whether the 26 S proteasome was involved in such an accelerated degradation, we added the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 µM, for 5 hrs) to <bold>E7</bold>-treated and untreated A2780 cells. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, MG132 restored the hTS levels in treated cells. These findings are opposite to the known effects on the hTS intracellular life exhibited by the reference inhibitor, <bold>5-FU</bold>. In fact, previous reports on other cell models have shown that <bold>5-FU</bold> causes a remarkable slowdown of the TS degradation rate because most of the protein is engaged in a ternary complex with the folate substrate and the inhibitor, being thus protected from the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peña et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kitchens et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kitchens et al., 1999b</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether engagement of <bold>E5</bold> and <bold>E7</bold> with hTS in cancer cells could affect the protein catalytic activity, their effect on endogenous TS activity was evaluated on cellular extracts from untreated cells of four cell lines, namely, A2780, A2780/CP, 2008 and C13*. These extracts were incubated with the inhibitors at their IC<sub>50</sub> values for 60 min. In these conditions, the catalytic activity of hTS was systematically reduced by 25–30% in the cellular extracts of all cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>This reduction of the hTS activity supports the hTS target engagement by the dimer destabilizers and links the observed effect with the intracellularly observed dimer to monomer equilibrium shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> in the next section). Based on the above data, we conclude that <bold>E7</bold> reduces the hTS levels in cancer cells by enhancing its proteasomal degradation. Because <bold>E7</bold> behaves as a disrupter of the dimeric recombinant protein, we anticipate that the promotion of its proteasomal degradation in cells is due to an increased fraction of more labile monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>E7 disrupts endogenous hTS dimers yielding monomers that are more rapidly degraded by the proteasome</title><p>We then explored how treatment with <bold>E7</bold> perturbed the intracellular hTS dimer/monomer equilibrium using a cross-linking strategy on endogenous hTS from A2780 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).These cells were treated with <bold>E7</bold> or with the vehicle (DMSO) for 3 hr, after which cross-linking was carried out by adding bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>) to the cell lysate. Next, the hTS dimers and monomers were detected via immunoblot after SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions.

While WT, with its 60–80 nM K<sub>d</sub> in buffer, is expected to be essentially dimeric at all physiological concentrations, the F59A variant, with a K<sub>d</sub> of 1.3x10<sup>–4</sup> M in buffer is, instead, expected to be essentially monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salo-Ahen et al., 2015</xref>).

Thus, the monomeric hTSF59A variant is unstable and undergoes much faster turnover than the dimeric WT protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>In vivo anticancer activity</title><p>Based on their in vitro profile, we tested <bold>E5</bold> and <bold>E7</bold> in appropriate animal models.

Initial PK data were obtained using intravenous (i.v.) administration of <bold>E5</bold> and <bold>E7</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6C</xref>). <bold>E7</bold> showed the best PK profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Both after i.v. and oral administration it reached its t<sub>max</sub> value after about 5 min with plasma levels in the micromolar range, i.e. concentrations that had caused a cell-growth inhibition in vitro. With a half-life of 13.6 hr, a prolonged exposure of the target tissue to the drug is expected. <bold>E7</bold> was then selected to be tested for its antitumor effect in vivo. In general, for low molecular weight compounds, intraperitoneal (i.p.) and i.v. administrations result in comparable PK. Furthermore, because of the lipophilicity of the compound, a rapid transfer from the peritoneal cavity to the blood and back is expected. Since we preferred to analyze the antitumor activity of <bold>E7</bold> in a PDAC orthotopic model that recapitulates several human-tumor phenotypic characteristics, we chose an i.p. drug delivery with an intermittent schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Such a relatively frequent schedule would have been too stressful for the mice via the i.v. route because of the damage to veins. The ability of the hTS dimer disrupter <bold>E7</bold> to inhibit tumor growth was evaluated on bioluminescent PDAC models genetically engineered to express Gaussia-luciferase (G-luc), simplifying the monitoring of the tumor volume. Five days after injection, primary pancreatic tumors were detectable in all mice (100% take rate, without surgery-related mortality), and G-luc activity, proportional to the number of cancer cells, increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This mean signal was significantly lower in mice treated with <bold>E7</bold> compared with control mice (46183±2015 vs 67905±6159 RLU/sec at day 25; p=0.001, two-sided t test).

As an enzyme, it provides the sole de-novo pathway to deoxythymidylate (dTMP) synthesis in human cells. Additionally, by interacting with its own and other mRNAs, this protein regulates its own levels and those of several other proteins involved in apoptotic and proliferation processes. Its inhibition has usually been achieved with compounds that bind at the protein active-site, competing with either the dUMP substrate, such as 5-fluorodeoxyuridine 5’-monophosphate (FdUMP), or with the folate cofactor, such as raltitrexed (RTX) and pemetrexed (PMX).</p><p>Despite several advantages, the clinical application of 5-FU is limited by the development of drug resistance after chemotherapy. The major mechanism responsible for 5-FU resistance is controlled by key enzymes such as thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP). Numerous reports have shown that increased TS expression is a result of the common mechanisms of 5-FU resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Longley et al., 2003</xref>; Iijchi K et al, 2014; Vodenkova S et al, 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2015</xref>; Aschele C et al, 2002). Because response to TS-directed chemotherapy critically depends upon the enzyme concentration, such an over-induction has been identified as a barrier to successful therapeutic outcomes. Hence the need to design and develop drugs that, having different mechanisms of action, can prevent or delay the onset of resistance.</p><p>In the present work we developed small molecules able to reduce the concentration of hTS dimers by shifting its dimer-monomer equilibrium toward the inactive monomer. As a consequence, they inhibit the activity of the enzyme and produce, as a crucial consequence, its enhanced proteasomal degradation and down-regulation in cells.</p><p>Unlike 5-FU, these compounds do not inhibit TS by forming the unproductive enzyme dimer-substrate-inhibitor complex. Formation of this stable complex leads to prolonged engagement of the enzyme by the drug and, eventually, to thymineless cell death. However, it also induces translational derepression of TS-mRNA and results in the enzyme up-regulation, accounting for the occurrence of 5-FU resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Allegra, 1996</xref>). Thus, the proposed dimer destabilizers are believed to avoid the onset of drug-resistance based on this mechanism. Additionally, enzyme stabilization has been indicated as an important primary mechanism of TS induction by fluoropyrimidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kitchens et al., 1999a</xref>). TS turnover is carried out in an ubiquitin-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forsthoefel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peña et al., 2006</xref>) and FdUMP binding to the TS protein leads to dramatic conformational changes which account for a stabilization of the enzyme and an increase in its half-life and intracellular levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kitchens et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marverti et al., 2009</xref>). Again, use of the dimer destabilizers characterized by a different mechanism of action with respect to 5-FU, results in a decrease of the TS half-life by accelerating its proteasomal degradation, thus also counteracting this mechanism of TS over-expression and drug resistance.</p><p>Indeed, reduction of the intracellular levels of the TS enzyme and a marked decrease of both in vitro cancer cell growth and in vivo tumor growth, together with a reduced expression of hTS mRNA in lysates from treated frozen tissues and cells, are the most promising results obtained with these dimer destabilizers. Therefore, they represent new, promising tools to fight drug resistance associated with high TS levels in different tumor types such as colorectal, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.</p><p>In conclusion, we have proposed a genuinely new class of inhibitors of a critical anti-cancer drug target, hTS. They act as destabilizers of the active obligate dimer, resulting in the inactive monomers. With their unprecedented mechanism of inhibition, compounds such as <bold>E7</bold> break the long-established link between inhibition and enhanced expression of this essential enzyme, a link that is typical of classical hTS active-site inhibitors, such as 5-FU and PMX. The superior in vivo behavior of <bold>E7</bold> relative to <bold>5-FU</bold>, despite its similar capacity to inhibit cancer cell growth, confirms the high potential of this dimer disrupter for further development. Our experiments suggest that it may overcome drug resistance in cancer cells that directly or indirectly increase the hTS levels. By doing so, these compounds, once combined with classical anti-TS drugs in suitably designed anticancer therapeutic schemes, may help avoiding or delaying the onset of anti-hTS drug resistance associated with over-expression of the enzyme, thus maintaining or restoring cancer-cell drug sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational protein-pocket identification for tethering</title><p>To detect possible pockets for the tethering experiments at the hTS monomer-monomer interface, we examined the crystal structures of both the active (PDB-ID: 1HVY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phan et al., 2001</xref>) and inactive (PDB-ID: 1YPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lovelace et al., 2005</xref>) hTS conformation.

The hydrogen of the sugar hydroxyl group in dUMP was directed toward the neighboring H256. The Antechamber tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) of AMBER 8 was used to create the ligand parameters for the MD simulations. The ligand partial charges were modified manually: for the phosphate ion, the charge of phosphorus (P) atom was set to 1.216e (NPSA) or 1.4e (TIP3P) and the oxygen (O) atoms to –0.55e (NPSA) or –1.1e (TIP3P). The total charge of the phosphate ion in the NPSA model was –1e, and in the explicit water –3e. For dUMP, the charges were partly taken from the all_nucleic02.lib of AMBER 8: the uracil moiety from the RU unit and the sugar moiety from the DT3 unit. The phosphate group was set to have a total charge of –2e. Firstly, the systems were energy minimized, heated and equilibrated. For the implicit water (NPSA) simulations: 30 ps (10 K --&gt;100 K), 20 ps (100 K --&gt;200 K), 20 ps (200 K --&gt;300 K) and then 400 steps of minimization were carried out. For the explicit water simulations, an octahedral box extending 10 Å from the protein was filled with TIP3P water (including the crystallographic water sites) and neutralizing Na +ions. Energy minimization was performed in six steps, decreasing the constraints on the protein stepwise from 5 to 0 kcal/molÅ<sup>2</sup>. Each step was carried out for a maximum of 200 iterations. Equilibration: (i) restrained solute (5 kcal/mol restraint force constant, 10 K --&gt;100 K, 10 ps, constant volume, Langevin dynamics); (ii) free solute (10 K --&gt;100 K, 10 ps, constant volume, Langevin dynamics); (iii) free solute (100 K --&gt;200 K, 10 ps, constant volume, Langevin dynamics); (iv) free solute (200 K --&gt;300 K, 10 ps, constant volume, Langevin dynamics); (v) free solute (300 K, 10 ps, constant volume and temperature, Langevin dynamics); (vi) free solute (300 K, 10 ps, constant pressure and temperature).

The hTS-Y202C crystallized in the space group P3<sub>1</sub> with an enzyme dimer in the inactive conformation in the asymmetric unit (ASU). The structure of hTS-Y202C closely resembles that of the native enzyme in the inactive conformation (r.m.s.d. upon Cα-atom matching of 0.4 Å), explaining the similar biochemical profiles of the two proteins. The hTS C195S-Y202C crystallized in the space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>with four independent subunits in the ASU, all in the active conformation. The hTS-C195S-Y202C structure is the first example of hTS crystallized in the active conformation under high salt conditions. Since both mutants crystallized under the same conditions, the shift of hTS towards the active conformation seems due to the active site C195S mutation. A possible explanation is that the clustering of the four residues C180 and C195 from the two dimer subunits stabilizes the inactive conformation of hTS, thus the C195S mutation prevents this occurrence. In both structures, the Fourier difference map clearly shows the replacement of the native Y202 by cysteine. Moreover, a positive extra electron density is found extending beyond the cysteine sulfur atom strongly indicating its reaction with β-mercaptoethanol (BME) present in the crystallization solution. Thus, C202 is chemically modified to S,S-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiocysteine (CME) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a, b and c</xref>). The other cysteines are modified to either CME or S-methyl-thio-cysteine (SCH), apart for C210 which is in the reduced, unmodified form. The two mutants, Y202C andC195S-Y202C, have essentially the same behavior as regards thiol reactivity. In the A subunit of hTS-Y202C, CME202 entails water-mediated interactions with D173, R175, K47’, T55’, and D254’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). In subunit B, CME202 is H-bonded to K47’ and forms water-mediated interactions with P172, D174, and V203 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Analogous intra- and inter-subunit interactions of CME202 are also observed in the structure of the double mutant. Thus, the structure of hTS C195S-Y202C validates the choice of Y202 as tethering mutation site, showing that this residue is prone to react with thiol compounds independently of the enzyme conformation.C202 is located in a dimer interface pocket considered important for protein-protein interactions. The CME modification, observed in both structures, indicates that C202 is exploitable for tethering with reactive molecules aimed at disrupting the hTS dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>). In both variants, the loop K47-T55 of the facing subunit is displaced with respect to the structure of wt-hTS, increasing the intersubunit distances by 1.0–2.5 Å. As already suggested by the structure of wt-hTS in complex with the LR peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardinale et al., 2011</xref>), small-to-medium-sized molecules, such as BME or the LR octapeptide, can access the dimer interface of the enzyme. Thus, the structural evidence indicates that the hTS dimer undergoes either monomer/dimer interconversion or ‘breathing’ movements that allow the binding at the dimer interface of exogenous molecules, such as disulfide fragments.</p><p>Several attempts were made to obtain the co-crystal structure of the monomeric hTS in complex with C compounds.

The results obtained were validated using an Electron Spray Ionization Quadrupole - Time of Flight (ESI-QTOF) MS (Quadrupole - Time of Flight (ESI-QTOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc)). Analyzing our pools with both platforms allowed us to exclude any ionization-related issue in the ligand selection process. The screening approach was an iterative selection of the best ligands in a competitive environment obtained by arranging the ligands in pools properly chosen to avoid ambiguous assignments. Successive screening steps were performed in which the selected ligands from the previous screening were subjected to further screening using a differently constituted pool. For the disulphide-compound library screening up to 3 ligands were pooled and mixed a hTS-C195S-Y202C solution in a buffer containing 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr and then purified on a C4 ZipTip (Millipore) to remove salts and unbound ligands.

Tagging yielded samples with spectrophotometrically determined F:T:protein-dimer concentration ratios near the expected 1:1:1 values. Absorption spectra were measured on a Varian Cary 100 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Spex-JobinYvon Fluoromax2 spectrofluorometer. Usually, samples with spectrophotometrically determined protein and probe concentrations in the range 50–490 nM in phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 were excited at 450 nm, a wavelength at which the F/T excitation ratio is very high and T emission is almost negligible. All measurements were performed at 20 ± 3 °C. The value of the observed FRET efficiency, Φ<sub>FRET</sub>, was determined from the emission intensities at 580 nm, I<sub>580</sub>, the maximum of sensitized T emission, and at 520 nm, the maximum of residual F emission, I<sub>F</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Genovese et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the unperturbed dimer such an efficiency is near 1 because a distance that is roughly half the critical Förster distance for the F/T pair separates the C43 and C43’ residues of the two subunits (25 Å). On the other hand, it is zero when the protein is fully dissociated. Developed on a spectrofluorometer, the assay has later been adapted to a medium-throughput format. In short, 1 or 2 μL of a 10 mM DMSO solution of each inhibitor was distributed in a 96-well multiplate to a final concentration of 10 or 20 μM together with 300 nM hTS properly derivatized with the two fluorescent probes (at this concentration, in the absence of inhibitors, the more than 95% of the protein is in the dimer form). Control wells contained only hTS, either alone or with 2 µL of DMSO. Each sample was assayed in duplicate. The Tecan GeniusPRO equipment was employed to read the fluorescence emission from each well at both 535 nM (fluorescein signal) and 590 nm (fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine signals) following excitation at 470 nm.

The protein was present at a concentration of 10 μM while each of the disulphide library members was 0.2 mM. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then purified on a C4 ZipTip (Millipore) to remove salts and unbound ligands. A solution of 10 mg/ml of sinapinic acid in acetonitrile/0.1% aqueous TFA in a 1:1 ratio was used to assist the ionization process. 1 μl of the sample was deposited onto a MALDI sample plate and allowed to air-dry at room temperature; 0.5 μL of matrix solution were then deposited on the same spot, resulting in a uniform layer of fine granular protein including matrix crystals. Mass spectra were recorded in positive-ion linear mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a delayed extraction time of 1200 ns. Each spectrum obtained was the mean of 100 laser shots. The ions were generated using the 337 nm laser beam from a nitrogen laser, having a pulse width of 3 ns. Data were obtained using the following parameters: 95% grid voltage, 0.08% guide wire voltage and a low mass gate of 15,000 Da. An external calibration was performed based on the molecular weight of the untreated enzyme mutant previously reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide and diluted 1:10 in TFA 0.1%. The software Data Explorer (Applied Biosystems) was used for mass spectral data processing; raw spectra were smoothed, and the baseline was corrected according to the normally observed peak broadness. Peak m/z values were annotated according to a peak detection algorithm taking into account an average resolution of 3500. The identity of any library member bonded to the protein through a disulphide bond was determined by subtracting the mass of the free protein from the observed higher mass.</p><p>For ESI-QTOF measurement 0.5 µl of ligand (80 mM in DMSO) was added to 12 µl of 17 µM C195S/Y202C hTS mutant solution in a buffer containing 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) to a final volume of 20 µL. The protein was present at a concentration of 10 μM and the disulphide at 2 mM. After equilibration at room temperature for 1 hour, 1 µl of the reaction mixture was diluted 1:10 with a solution of 5% formic acid in water/acetonitrile 95:5 and injected onto an HPLC-chip ESI-QTOF. The mobile phase composition was as follows: (A) 0.1%formic acid in a water/acetonitrile 98:2 solution and (B) 0.1%formic acid in a acetonitrile/water 98:2 solution. Chromatographic separations were performed at a flow rate of 400 nL/min with the following gradient: 15% B for 5 min, 15–85% B in 5 min, 85% B for 5 min, 85–15% B in 3 min. Under these conditions the protein-ligand complex was eluted between 6.5 and 8.0 min. The capillary voltage was set to 1600 V and the desolvating temperature was 350 °C. Nitrogen was used as a drying gas (flow rate = 6 L/min). The mass spectrometer operated in positive mode in the scan range 200–3200 Da. An external calibration was performed based on the molecular weight of a multi-standard solution (ESI-L Low concentration tuning mixture - SUPELCO). During acquisition, some of these masses were constantly monitored and used for a fine calibration of the instrument. The multiply charged ions deriving from the free protein and the protein-ligand complex were deconvoluted with available software (MassHunter – Agilent Technologies Inc).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Analysis of the ligand-protein binding site by MS</title><p>To investigate the cysteine residue involved in the binding with the selected ligands, the protein-ligand complexes underwent enzymatic digestion in a classical bottom-up proteomic analysis using both ionization techniques for result evaluation.</p><p>In a typical experiment, 1 μL of the ligand (80 mM in DMSO) was added to 14 μL of the 29 μM hTS C195S-Y202C hTS mutant solution in a buffer containing 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) to a final volume of 20 μL. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. 6 μL of iodoacetamide (100 mM) was added and the reaction mixture was incubated in the dark, at room temperature, for 20 min in order to alkylate the unmodified cysteine residues. 3 μL of 0.1 μg/μL sequencing grade modified trypsin (SIGMA) was added and the sample was incubated at 37 °C. After 1 hour, a second aliquot of 3 μL of trypsin was added. The digestion was carried out at 37 °C overnight. 1 μL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 0,1% was added and the reaction mixture was purified by a tip chromatography system (ZipTip C18, Millipore). The bound peptides were eluted from the tip stationary phase with 10 μL of acetonitrile 75%/TFA 0,1%. and 1 μL of the mixture was spotted onto a MALDI target for MS analysis. A saturated solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 μL) was used to assist the ionization process. Mass spectra were recorded on a 4800plus MALDI TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer, operating in positive ion reflector mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 KV and delayed extraction time of 300 ns. The MALDI ions were generated using a 355 nm Nd:YAG laser pulsed at 200 Hz with an intensity of 4600 (arbitrary units). Each spectrum was obtained by the accumulation of 1200–2500 laser shots. For MS/MS analysis the mass spectrometer was externally calibrated, and the sample mixture was analyzed in the 750–3500 Da mass range. Fragmentation experiments were performed with and without a collision gas. Signals from 150 laser shots were averaged to increase the S/N ratio of each mass spectrum. Data Explorer (Applied Biosystems) was used for data processing (baseline correction, deisotoping, calibration and peak detection). Peptide mass lists were searched with the MASCOT server in a swiss-prot-based protein database including the mutant version of hTS.</p><p>In parallel, 1 μL of the reaction mixture was diluted 1:30 with a solution of 0.5% formic acid in water/acetonitrile 98:2 and 3 μL were injected onto an HPLC-chip ESI-QTOF. The mobile phase composition was as follows: (A) 0.1% formic acid in a water/acetonitrile 98:2 solution and (B) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile/water 98:2 solution. A chromatographic separation was performed at a flow rate of 400 nL/min with the following gradient: 3% B for 5 min, 3–30% B in 15 min, 30–40% B in 5 min, 40–85% B in 3 min, 85% B for 2 min, 85–3% B in 5 min. The capillary voltage was set at1600 V and the desolvating temperature was 350 °C. Nitrogen was used as a drying gas (flow rate = 6 L/min). The mass spectrometer operated in positive mode in the 200–3200 Da scan range. For MS/MS experiment up to three precursors were selected for each acquisition cycle. The precursor ion was automatically excluded for fragmentation if it was present in two consecutive spectra, or if it persisted for more than 0.12 min. An external calibration was performed based on the molecular weight of a multi-standard solution (ESI-L Low concentration tuning mixture - SUPELCO). During the acquisition, some of these masses were constantly monitored and used for a fine calibration of the instrument. The multiply charged ions deriving from the free protein and the protein-ligand complex were deconvoluted with available software (MassHunter – Agilent Technologies Inc). The results of the trypsin digestion are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> Table S8. To investigate which of the three cysteines of the D186-R215 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the main text) were involved in the binding with the ligand, MS/MS experiments were performed. Unfortunately, the MS/MS spectra did not allow the identification of the corresponding fragment due to (i) the low abundance of the ligand bound-D186-R215 peptide and (ii) ion suppression effects. However, molecular dynamics and x-ray crystallography highlighted that among the three cysteine residues, cysteine 202 was the one exposed to the solvent and thus available for tethering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Mass spectrometric identification of tethered ligands</title><p>Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) - Time of Flight (TOF) Voyager-Pro MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems) was chosen for a medium-throughput screening of the disufide-compound library (<bold>A1-A55</bold>). The results obtained were validated using an Electron Spray Ionization Quadrupole - Time of Flight (ESI-QTOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc). Both platforms allowed us to exclude any ionization-related issue in the ligand selection process. The screening approach was an iterative selection of the best ligands in a competitive environment obtained by arranging the ligands in pools properly chosen in order to avoid ambiguous mass peak assignments. Successive screening steps were performed in which the selected ligands from the previous screening were subjected to further screening using differently constituted pool. For the disulfide-compound library screening up to 3 ligands were pooled and mixed into a hTS-C195S-Y202C solution in a buffer containing 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM K<sup>+</sup> phosphate (pH 7.5). The reaction mixture was incubated at RT for 1 hour and then purified on a C4 ZipTip (Millipore) to remove salts and unbound ligands. To identify the binding site of these molecules, the protein-ligand complexes underwent enzymatic digestion in a classical bottom-up proteomic analysis using both ionization techniques for result evaluation.</p></sec></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Synthetic chemistry for all compounds</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-1"><title>General</title><p>All commercial chemicals and solvents were reagent grade and were used without further purification.

The dead time of the columns (<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>) was determined by injection of 1,3,5-tri-<italic>tert-</italic>butylbenzene. Among the mobile phases used, water:acetonitrile 2:98 (v/v) was chosen for the subsequent semipreparative separation because it gave a good baseline enantiomeric resolution, with k<sub>1</sub>=0.36, k<sub>2</sub>=0.62 and <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> = 4.76. Semipreparative enantioseparation of (±)-<bold>E7</bold> was carried out on Chiralcel OD employing water:acetonitrile 2:98 (v/v) as the mobile phase at 5 mL/min. By injecting 15 mg of the racemic mixture, the single enantiomers were collected with acceptable enantiomeric excess (99.0% and 80.1% e.e. for the first and second eluted enantiomer, respectively, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>)). 8.8 mg of the first enantiomer and 4.4 mg of the second one was obtained and were sufficient for further stability studies. The specific rotation in acetonitrile of first and second eluted enantiomers were acquired on a Perkin-Elmer 241 Polarimeter resulting in [α]<sub>D</sub><sup>20</sup> = +7.95° (c 0.00088 g/ml; acetonitrile) and [α]<sub>D</sub><sup>20</sup> = -9.10° (0.00044 g/mL, acetonitrile), respectively.</p><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-2-1"><title>Racemization</title><p>Racemization is the conversion of an enantiomer into a racemic mixture and is associated with a loss in optical activity of the chiral compound over time.

S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> in the main text). To narrow the amount of fitting parameters, K<sub>D</sub> was kept fixed at the value obtained from FRET measurements without inhibitors (6x10<sup>–8</sup> M) and K’<sub>D</sub> was estimated by assuming that the effect of each inhibitor molecule on the standard free energy for the enzyme dimer dissociation was constant: ΔG°’<sub>D</sub> = (ΔG°<sub>D</sub> + ΔG°’’<sub>D</sub>)/2. From the above value of K<sub>D</sub> and the K’’<sub>D</sub> obtained from the limit values of ϕ<sub>obs</sub> at high [C3], K’’<sub>D</sub> = 3.3 x 10<sup>–7</sup> M (paragraph Mechanistic analysis of dissociative inhibition, main text), we estimated K’<sub>D</sub> = 1.5 x 10<sup>–7</sup> M and used this value in the fitting procedure. K’’<sub>D</sub> values were obtained from the high I<sub>T</sub> behavior of ϕ<sub>obs</sub>, while K<sub>I</sub> and K’’<sub>I</sub> were adjusted to fit the low and intermediate I<sub>T</sub> data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13"><title>Analysis of a dissociative inhibition mechanism and fitting to data</title><p>Here, to test the suitability of the proposed mechanism to fit the

This biophysical data is critical to the central conclusions of this manuscript.</p><p>See below for specific reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a homodimeric enzyme that is a common anti-cancer target. Currently used TS inhibitors bind to the enzymatic active site which leads to an increase protein expression and subsequent resistance that is observed. The present manuscript through a chemical screening and modeling approach identifies novel inhibitors of TS that bind to the homodimerization interface. These compounds are distinct from the commonly used TS inhibitors. The authors show that their novel compounds do indeed bind, lead to destabilization of protein and decreased cell growth. The work is highly significant and very robustly done.</p><p>Only a few concerns revolving around the utility of the inhibitors compared to 5-FU are required to address this reviewer's concern:</p><p>– In the panel of cell lines assessing the efficacy of their novel inhibitors in vitro, comparisons to 5-FU should be shown.</p><p>– The major concern is that the effects of E7 are not dramatically better than 5-FU, and in most cases are the same or even worse. Please assess if E7 can inhibit viability in cells that are resistant to 5-FU in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>– Data on cell death and proliferation are needed for the in vivo tumor studies.</p><p>– The discussion needs to focus on the novel finds and clinical impact, currently it is highly repetitive to the result section. Along these lines it would be good to discuss mechanisms of 5-FU resistance and under what scenarios would the dimerization inhibitors be used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Conventional thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor drugs bind to the active site or to the nearby folate cofactor site. Either mechanism leads to elevated TS expression, along with drug resistance, presumably by stabilizing the inactive TS dimer. The authors come up with an alternative strategy intended to disrupt TS dimerization, which would lead to accelerated degradation of the less stable monomeric protein.</p><p>For the proposed strategy, the study identifies a putative drug binding pocket at the TS protein-protein interface that is predicted to disrupt the homodimer. The authors then introduce a cysteine residue in this pocket which serves as the target of a cysteine tethering approach to implement fragment-based drug design. After a series of fragment-based and virtual docking screens, a series of molecules and derivatives are identified for testing. While the cysteine tethering approach is a good first step to identify putative small molecules, it is not certain that the compounds are binding preferentially to a drug &quot;pocket&quot; or simply forming a covalent bond with the introduced cysteine. This is an important consideration when examining the mechanism of action for subsequent derivatives in the context of the native enzyme.</p><p>The analogs were experimentally tested against TS activity and for an ability to disrupt dimerization. Effects on TS dimer disruption was assayed using a FRET approach and TS expressed with either a red- or green-emitting tag. It is concluded that some of these molecules disrupt TS dimerization. However, a key concern regarding the proposed mechanism of action, is that data supporting drug-protein interactions and TS dimer dissociation are somewhat indirect. Since a primary focus of the investigation centers around the proposed mechanism of action of the new compounds, the study would be enhanced with additional structural and/or biophysical data to support binding of the individual molecules to TS directly, and the subsequent dissociation of TS dimers.</p><p>The comprehensive investigation then examines the stability of TS in treated cells and with proteasome inhibitors. The data reveal that administration of compounds correlates with enhanced degradation of TS and the authors hypothesize that this is due to the TS monomer, disrupted by E7 administration, is less stable than the functional dimer. A comparison of treatments of conventional TS inhibitors, such as 5-FU and Pemetrexed, support a different mechanism of action as TS levels are elevated following administration of these established compounds. Finally, the investigation identifies the effects of the lead compound, E7, in mouse models of pancreatic and ovarian cancer models. Administration of E7 is associated with decreased TS expression and tumor burden.</p><p>In summary, this is a deep and comprehensive investigation that identifies new molecules that target TS inhibition for the treatment of cancer. The mechanism of action is clearly different than more established TS inhibitors. That said, evidence supporting the proposed mechanism of action is incomplete in the present form.</p><p>This manuscript describes a deep and intensive study with an exceptional amount of data and encompasses a range of topics spanning molecular mechanism, drug screening and development, cell biology, and animal model pharmacokinetics. The drug approach is designed to disrupt TS dimers is new and the data generally support the conclusions that are made. However, there are several details surrounding the investigation that should be considered prior to publication.</p><p>The primary concern relates to the degree in which the compounds bind to and physically disrupt TS dimers. The FRET data are reported as changes in signal, but the reported signal indicates that an entirely free monomer population is never achieved even at saturating concentrations (40-100 uM) of compound. As such, the proposed mechanism of action would be supported with additional, direct evidence to show binding of the compounds to, and the disruption of, the TS homodimers. Ideally, this could be done with structures of complex-bound TS. However, structural determination is likely to be outside the scope of the current investigation. Another option would be to include SEC profiles showing the disruption of the recombinant TS dimers, along with proper controls (for example the F59A mutant). Similarly, binding of compounds could be quantitatively determined with recombinant TS dimer using ITC. Qualitative binding could be performed with SEC (superdex 75 should resolve the monomer vs dimer). Another qualitative approach to support binding could be a SEC run showing that the protein, monitored at UV280, coelutes with the fluorinated compound (E5-FITC), which could be tracked with fluorescence.</p><p>It was not entirely clear how the dual labeled TS dimer was generated for the FRET experiments. The manuscript indicates that these experiments are conducted at 50-500 nM protein concentration. Prior work from the group (Genovese, 2010) reports a dimer equilibrium concentration of ~70 nM and this study reports a similar KD for dimer formation (Figure 5E). Therefore, it is not clear from the kinetic scheme or from the methods how purified green-dimer and red-dimers dissociate to form a red-green dimer used in the FRET studies. Are the two proteins co-expressed and the complex purified by dual affinity using different tags? Is the concentration of individually purified dimers decreased to induce dissociation, then then mixed together to form a heterogeneous mix of red-red, green-green, and red-green dimers concentrated for the FRET studies? Although the prior work (2010) is cited, some additional details for how the bi-labeled dimer was generated would be helpful.</p><p>As it is stated in the paper, a fluorescence value of 1 means that the protein is a dimer and a value of 0 correlates to the monomer. It is therefore puzzling that the dimer only partially dissociates when mixed with compounds (with a decrease of no more than ~0.4 units), but does not fully dissociate with increased compound concentration. This observation seems to suggest that the TS dimer is not fully dissociating with addition of compounds and should be addressed in the manuscript.</p><p>Similar to the above data, the BS3 crosslinked results reported in Figure 8F appears to be very minimal in disrupting the dimer to monomer. To help define the full degree that the compounds have on disrupting the TS dimer, a similar set of crosslinking experiments with the F59A TS mutant would be helpful.</p><p>At the end of pg. 30, it is indicated that E7 treatment leads to a 40-50% reduction in expression of TS mRNA in vivo. However, in cells treated with E7, the mRNA levels of TS remain unchanged (middle pg. 27, Figure 8g, figure supplement 3). This difference in mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo should at least be discussed in the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Disrupters of the thymidylate synthase homodimer accelerate its proteasomal degradation and inhibit cancer growth&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Addressing the issue of the utility of these inhibitors compared to 5-FU.</p></disp-quote><p>The TS-dimer disrupters here disclosed promise significant advantages over traditional TS-directed anticancer drugs, such as 5-FU. Such advantages stem from a totally different mechanism of action of these compounds. In fact, FdUMP, the active metabolite of 5-FU, inhibits TS by forming a covalent complex containing the co-substrate, mTHF, and the enzyme (Carreras and Santi, 1995). This inhibitory ternary complex is quite stable and leads to prolonged inhibition of the enzyme, depletion of dTMP pools, and thymineless death. However, this engagement of the enzyme dimer by FdUMP induces translational derepression of TS-mRNA and enzyme up-regulation by about 2–4-fold, thus accounting for the occurrence of resistance to TS-targeted compounds such as 5-FU: the acute induction of TS levels following therapy with inhibitors of this enzyme is one of the critical mechanisms of resistance to 5-FU (Chu et al., 1996).</p><p>Additionally, enzyme stabilization rather than translational derepression has been indicated as the primary mechanism of TS induction by fluoropyrimidines in human colon cancer cell lines (Kitchens et al., 1999a). TS turnover is carried out by the 26S proteasome with an ubiquitin-independent mechanism (Forsthoefel et al., 2004; Pena et al., 2006). Treatment with 5-FU causes a remarkable slowing of the TS degradation rate in both human colon and ovarian tumor cell lines, most of the protein being involved in the ternary complex formation and thereby stabilized versus degradation (Kitchens et al., 1999b; Marverti et al., 2009).</p><p>The TS-dimer disrupters here proposed inhibit TS through a new and different mechanism of action, i.e., by shifting the dimer-monomer equilibrium of the enzyme toward the inactive monomer. Because they do not lead to formation of the inhibitory ternary complex, they are not expected to trigger the mentioned translational derepression and enzyme up-regulation, and are believed to avoid/delay the onset of resistance based on such a mechanism.</p><p>Our experiments show clearly that E7 is acting on cells overexpressing hTS where 5FU cannot, thus showing in perspective a higher capacity to counteract the drug resistance status (see effect on pancreatic cancer cells reported in our manuscript). This suggest that E7 can be active after the therapy failure due to 5FU drug resistance.</p><p>In principle, even if the dimer disrupters act on the same target, but with a different mechanism, we foresee a potential synergy for their combination with 5FU or, possibly, all those drugs that cross the same metabolic pathways.</p><p>In addition, contrary to 5-FU, they induce a decrease in TS half-life due to an enhanced proteasomal degradation, most likely associated with the increase in the fraction of the monomeric protein and its higher vulnerability, with respect to the dimer, to the proteasome. This effect is expected to be crucial in the control of hTS levels in cancer cells and it is maintained in in vivo models of pancreatic cancer in which E7 behaves better than 5FU.</p><p>In short, the important biological consequences of the binding of these compounds to TS are the reduction of the intracellular levels of the TS enzyme, and a marked decrease of both in vitro cancer cell growth and in vivo tumor growth in particular observed on pancreatic cancer models. The latter is however expected in other cancer types as well.</p><p>5FU is a very effective drug that was conceived in the 60ties, therefore nowadays the expected profile for a new drug shows higher safety and efficacy requirements to be approved. We propose here a new candidate showing in the preclinical phase overall better properties than 5FU, in particular in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer, therefore this well predicts for a positive development of this compound as a drug lead.</p><p>We have added or strengthened these comments in the Summary and Conclusion of the manuscript improving, we think, its quality.

In spite of the centennial history of molecular spectroscopy, spectroscopic evidence is sometimes considered ‘indirect’, and more ‘direct’ ways to ‘see’ protein–ligand complexes are searched for. A classical and highly convincing answer comes from crystallography. Unfortunately, despite our many efforts, we could not obtain crystals of complexes of hTS with the allosteric inhibitors discussed here.</p><p>A frequently adopted strategy makes use of chromatography. In general, because of dilution throughout columns, mass-law action acts against detection of surviving protein/ligand complexes, and tailored experimental solutions must be found in order to avoid extensive dissociation of such complexes (for some literature on this problem, see K.F. Blom, B. S. Larsen, C. N. McEwen, Determining Affinity-Selected Ligands and Estimating Binding Affinities by Online Size Exclusion Chromatography/Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, J. Comb. Chem. 1999, 1, 82-90; G. Deng, G. Sanyal, Applications of mass spectrometry in early stages of target-based drug discovery, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 40 (2006) 528–538). In our case the problem was further complicated by the concurrence of the dimer/monomer equilibrium together with the ligand binding equilibria by the protein dimers and monomers. However, after several attempts failed due to complete dimer/monomer re-equilibration in the elution throughout the chromatographic columns, we succeeded in proving the ability of compounds C3 and E5 to bind hTS and favor disruption of its dimer by employing anion-exchange chromatography. We have added a synthetic overview of these new experiments in the final portion of paragraph ‘From low-affinity compounds to TS homodimer disrupters’ and have shown the most significant of these results in some new figures, namely, Figure 3E in the main text and the associated figures Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was not entirely clear how the dual labeled TS dimer was generated for the FRET experiments. The manuscript indicates that these experiments are conducted at 50-500 nM protein concentration. Prior work from the group (Genovese, 2010) reports a dimer equilibrium concentration of ~70 nM and this study reports a similar KD for dimer formation (Figure 5E). Therefore, it is not clear from the kinetic scheme or from the methods how purified green-dimer and red-dimers dissociate to form a red-green dimer used in the FRET studies. Are the two proteins co-expressed and the complex purified by dual affinity using different tags? Is the concentration of individually purified dimers decreased to induce dissociation, then then mixed together to form a heterogeneous mix of red-red, green-green, and red-green dimers concentrated for the FRET studies? Although the prior work (2010) is cited, some additional details for how the bi-labeled dimer was generated would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Neither one. After protecting all cysteines except 43 and 43’, we tagged the protein dimers (the protein concentrations, 30-80 microM, were much larger than the dimer-monomer equilibrium constant, 80 nM) with the maleimides of the two probes together. Hence, we obtained protein dimers carrying two probes, one per monomer. Properly working on fluorescein- (F, green) and tetramethylrhodammine- (T, red) maleimide concentrations, we succeeded in establishing conditions in which the same amounts of each probe were bound to TS: 1 F: 1T : 1 protein monomer. As a result, 25 % of protein dimers were labeled with two Fs, 25 % with two Ts and 50% with one F and one T. Because the F-T Förster’s critical distance is twice as large as the C43-C43’ distance, the Fto-T FRET efficiency is near unity in such hetero-tagged TS dimers. This assumption and the above population of fluorophores were the bases for developing an expression that relates the fractions of protein dimers with the measured intensities of the F and T emission bands. Because the analysis is rather cumbersome and has been fully given in the quoted reference, we avoided reporting it in this already large and complex manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As it is stated in the paper, a fluorescence value of 1 means that the protein is a dimer and a value of 0 correlates to the monomer. It is therefore puzzling that the dimer only partially dissociates when mixed with compounds (with a decrease of no more than ~0.4 units), but does not fully dissociate with increased compound concentration. This observation seems to suggest that the TS dimer is not fully dissociating with addition of compounds and should be addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Even at fully saturating concentrations of the ligands, i.e., at concentrations such that all dimers and all monomers of hTS are bound to an inhibitor molecule, inhibitor-bound dimers and monomers still equilibrate. In no case encountered so far is this equilibrium fully shifted towards the monomers. In all favorable cases (many tested compounds caused no effect), relative to the free protein dimer/monomer equilibrium, binding of these ligands favored the protein monomers. The extent of such shift (measurable either in terms of equilibrium constant ratio or of DDG°), measures the ability of each compound to destabilize the dimeric assembly of the protein. In other words, the effect of a given DDI might be seen as resulting from two features: the ability to bind the protein (dimers and monomers) and the ability to destabilize the dimeric assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar to the above data, the BS3 crosslinked results reported in Figure 8F appears to be very minimal in disrupting the dimer to monomer. To help define the full degree that the compounds have on disrupting the TS dimer, a similar set of crosslinking experiments with the F59A TS mutant would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and suggestions. In Figure 7F the reduction of the dimer/monomer ratio after E7 treatment is 40% after 3 hours at 20 uM. This reduction is the result of a snapshot obtained after 3 hours of treatment, but we should take into account that the E7 efficacy, in living cells, continues for up to 36 hours, as demonstrated by the immunoblot in Figure 7—figure supplement 1c,d-Source data 1. (Effect of dimer disrupters on hTS protein levels in cells_WB).</p><p>The immunoblot in the Figure shows a drastic and time dependent reduction of the TS protein levels. The TS protein reduction observed in living cells in steady state conditions after E7 treatment reflects the continuous and dynamic shift of the TS equilibrium from the dimeric towards the monomeric form. The monomeric form of TS, as described in the main text, turns out to be very unstable and more degradable by the proteasome.</p><p>F59A TS mutant is essentially monomeric at nM, low μm concentrations. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed a set of crosslinking experiments with the F59A TS mutant. Based on the fast degradation of the F59A TS mutant (see Figure 7G) we were forced to use a proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 hours at 20 μm prior to harvesting and lysing the cells for crosslinking (BS3). We ectopically expressed TS-Myc-DDK-WT and TS-Myc-DDK-F59A in HEK293 cells. After 24 hours, MG132 were added, and after 3 hours, the cells were treated with E7 for 3 hours. Next the cells were lysed and crosslinked (BS3). The whole cell lysate was separated by SDS-Page gel in reducing conditions, and western blot performed by using the anti-Flag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>The immunoblot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> highlights a clear reduction of the dimer/monomer ratio of TS-WT after 3 hours of E7 treatment with respect to the control condition. The result is in agreement with the effect we have reported in Figure 7F. Unfortunately, as we expected, the F59A TS mutant did not show any detectable dimeric form, and therefore it was not possible to determine a dimer/monomer ratio and any change of it associated with cell treatment with E7.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(A) Effects on exogenous hTS dimer/monomer equilibrium in HEK293 cells after a 3 hour exposure to E7 (20 μM), in the presence of MG132 (6 hour).</title><p>Next the cells have been lysed and crosslinked (BS3), and western blot performed by using the anti-Flag antibody.

However, in cells treated with E7, the mRNA levels of TS remain unchanged (middle pg. 27, Figure 8g, figure supplement 3). This difference in mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo should at least be discussed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing this. We clarify here that in the main text of the previous version of the manuscript, in the middle of page 27, the TS mRNA levels described refer to an experiment different from that described at the end of page 30 (Figure 8F in the present version). Figure 8F demonstrates a reduction of endogenous TS mRNA levels after E7 treatment in vivo. Figure 7—figure supplement 3 (present version), instead, shows the quantification of either WT or F59A TS mRNA described in the middle of page 27 corresponding to Figure 7G in the main text. The experiment was performed to demonstrate that the protein levels of mutant TS-F59A (Figure 7G) are related to the instability of the protein itself and not to the reduction of its mRNA (Figure 7—figure supplement 3 present version).</p><p>Furthermore, we have performed the quantification of TS mRNA in cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 2 and Figure 8—figure supplement 8-Source data 1) in different cancer cell lines after treatment with E5, E7 and 5FU.

However, there remain a couple of lingering, but important, issues that should be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>It is appreciated that the authors include additional chromatograms analyzing the proposed monomer and dimer peaks (notably in Supporting Figure 3) of the revised manuscript. However, the peak designated as monomer is different in each panel of the figure. In panels A and B the proposed monomer and dimer peaks are barely resolved (~1 rt/min separation), but the same two peaks are drastically separated (~6 rt/min) in panels C-E.</p><p>Similarly, the text indicates that dimer and monomer elute at 22 and 24 min, respectively but, since this elution time for each peak varies in each chromatogram, the text should be edited accordingly for accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>In panels A and B of Figure 3 supplement 1 (the mentioned Supporting Figure 3 corresponds to Figure 3 supplement 1, as it is written in the text, just to avoid misunderstanding), corresponding to AE chromatographic runs with, respectively, hTS alone and in the presence of two active-site ligands, dUMP and RTX, the two bands are separated by 1.5-2 minutes. In panels C-E, reporting chromatograms obtained in the presence of increasing concentrations of C3, the two bands are consistently separated by ca. 5 minutes. We attribute this increased separation to a larger delaying effect of bound C3 on the protein monomer elution than on the dimer elution. Indeed, we have performed another AE chromatographic run, not reported for obvious reasons of brevity, in the same technical chromatographic conditions, with the same volume of hTS at the same concentration and with 40 µM 2-amino benzothiazole, the chemical core of the dimer destabilizers. This compound caused neither inhibition of the enzymatic activity of hTs nor a decrease in FRET efficiency. Consistently, the separation between the dimer and the monomer bands was, again, ca. 2 minutes.</p><p>Our mentioning the elution times for the two bands as ca. 22 and 24 minutes refers specifically to panels A and B in the figure. In the runs shown in panels C-E the retention time of the dimer band is less reproducible. We attribute our limited control on the zero-elution time to the fact that we perform the injection into the column manually. We have corrected the text at p. 16 (paragraph ‘Additional evidence of the ability of compounds…) by replacing the retention times with the separation between the two bands, that is, quite consistently, around 2 minutes in the absence of compound C3 and 5-6 minutes in its presence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the added explanations in the response to reviewers and the cumulative data, the authors should more appropriately refer to the compounds (throughout the text) as dimer destabilizers as opposed to dimer disrupters.</p></disp-quote><p>Once more, we thank this Reviewer for his/her thorough work.
