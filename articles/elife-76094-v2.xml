HSP40 family, in modulating endotoxin-induced sepsis severity is still unclear. During lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock, HLJ1 knockout mice shows reduced organ injury and IFN-Î³ (interferon-Î³)-dependent mortality. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterize mouse liver nonparenchymal cell populations under LPS stimulation, and show that HLJ1 deletion affected IFN-Î³-related gene signatures in distinct immune cell clusters. In CLP models, HLJ1 deletion reduces IFN-Î³ expression and sepsis mortality rate when mice are treated with antibiotics. HLJ1 deficiency also leads to reduced serum levels of IL-12 in LPS-treated mice, contributing to dampened production of IFN-Î³ in natural killer cells but not CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and subsequently to improved survival rate. Adoptive transfer of HLJ1-deleted macrophages into LPS-treated mice results in reduced IL-12 and IFN-Î³ levels and protects the mice from IFN-Î³-dependent mortality. In the context of molecular mechanisms, HLJ1 is an LPS-inducible protein in macrophages and converts misfolded IL-12p35 homodimers to monomers, which maintains bioactive IL-12p70 heterodimerization and secretion. This study suggests HLJ1 causes IFN-Î³-dependent septic lethality by promoting IL-12 heterodimerization, and targeting HLJ1 has therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases involving activated IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HLJ1</kwd><kwd>IL-12</kwd><kwd>IFN-Î³</kwd><kwd>lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>DNAJB4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST110-2314-B-002-269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Kang-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST105-2628-B-002-051-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Kang-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST111-2628-B-002-029-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Kang-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006477</institution-id><institution>National Taiwan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109L7859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Kang-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals HLJ1 as a novel immunomodulator for multicellular pathway of macrophages and NK cells, contributing to organ injury and sepsis death through amplified IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singer et al., 2016</xref>). In intensive care patients, sepsis is the single most encountered cause of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mayr et al., 2014</xref>). Although sepsis is a biphasic disorder characterized by an initial hyperinflammatory phase followed by an immunosuppressive phase, studies have shown both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses occur early and simultaneously where the net effect of the competing process is typically dominated by a hyperinflammatory phase featuring shock and fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hotchkiss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Munford and Pugin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kurosawa et al., 2011</xref>). Investigators have recently proposed that immune response in sepsis features protracted, unabated inflammation driven by the innate immune system, leading to organ dysfunction and even mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). Septic shock contributing to failure of vital organs and hypotension is the common cause of death in ICU and is usually caused by systemic Gram-negative bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiche et al., 2011</xref>). Engagement of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the membrane component of bacteria, to TLR4 in macrophages transduces signals to intracellular proteins, resulting in downstream expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beutler and Rietschel, 2003</xref>). Produced by APCs (antigen-presenting cells), IL-12 activates natural killer (NK) cells and induces the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to become IFN-Î³-producing Th1 effector cells in responses to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schenten and Medzhitov, 2011</xref>). In a positive feedback loop, secreted IFN-Î³ augments IL-12 production by priming IL-12p40 gene promoter in APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grohmann et al., 2001</xref>). The IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis-mediated communication between innate and adaptive immunity plays an important role in the control of infections by mycobacteria and other intracellular bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ramirez-Alejo and Santos-Argumedo, 2014</xref>). In models of sterile sepsis and chronic bacterial infection, the IL-12/18-IFN-Î³ axis is controlled by ARTD1 in myeloid cells, contributing to T<sub>H</sub>1 response and immune control of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kunze et al., 2019</xref>). However, the pathogenic role of IFN-Î³ has been implicated during CLP-induced septic shock where IFN-Î³ knockout mice showed lower levels of IL-6 and MIP-2 in the circulation and are resistant to CLP-induced mortality when treated with systemic antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Romero et al., 2010</xref>). The inhibition of IFN-Î³ activity by neutralizing antibodies improves survival and attenuates CLP-induced sepsis in rat, while it does not reduce CLP-related mortality in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Romero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin et al., 2005</xref>). Despite abundant studies describe IFN-Î³ as immune modulator in sepsis, little is known about the precise pathogenic role of IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis, and the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for IL-12-mediated septic shock remains to be clarified.</p><p>Heat shock proteins (HSPs) can be upregulated under cellular-stress conditions, such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, fever, and inflammation, and they act as chaperones to maintain the functions of cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Georgopoulos and Welch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rosenzweig et al., 2019</xref>). Human liver DnaJ-like protein (HLJ1) is a member of heat shock protein 40 family (HSP40) and is also known as DNAJB4. In humans, HLJ1 is a tumor suppressor in non-small-cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, since its upregulation suppresses tumor invasion and high expression of HLJ1 is associated with prolonged survival of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). However, the actual immunomodulatory role of HLJ1 in sepsis remains unclear. Recently, chaperones have emerged as mediators of IL-12 family protein folding, assembly, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reitberger et al., 2017</xref>). DnaJ HSP40 member C10 (DNAJC10), also known as ERdj5, has been shown to reduce disulfide bonding in non-native homodimeric IL-12p35 to low-molecular-weight (LMW) IL-12p35 monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reitberger et al., 2017</xref>). Despite a growing understanding of chaperone-mediated IL-12 family protein folding and assembly, the precise mechanisms by which HLJ1 regulates IL-12 biosynthesis and the subsequent immune response during sepsis have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>We demonstrated that HLJ1 knockout in mice protects against LPS- and CLP-induced organ injury and mortality through IFN-Î³ downregulation. With single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we uncovered the immune profile affected by HLJ1 under LPS stress and found the alteration of IFN-Î³-related gene signature in NK cells where HLJ1 had been deleted. In macrophages, LPS-inducible HLJ1 reduced the accumulation of misfolded IL-12p35 homodimer and enhanced IL-12p70 dimerization, leading to augmented IFN-Î³ production and sepsis-related mortality. The study reveals the previously unknown role of HLJ1 in promoting IFN-Î³-dependent sepsis death through regulating IL-12 folding and biosynthesis in macrophages. Therefore, targeting HLJ1 provides a strategy for developing therapeutic approaches to inflammatory diseases involving activated IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HLJ1 deficiency protected mice against lethal endotoxic shock</title><p>To address the question of whether HLJ1 participates in regulating LPS-induced systemic inflammatory responses, HLJ1-deficient (<italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic>) mice and wild-type littermates (<italic>Dnajb4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) were intraperitoneally injected with LPS derived from Gram-negative bacteria. <italic>Dnajb4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice showed similar survival rates when LD50 dose of LPS (10 mg/kg) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice were significantly more resistant to LPS-induced sepsis and exhibited longer survival than <italic>Dnajb4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice when subjected to a higher lethal dose of LPS (20 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To confirm that the mitigation of LPS-induced septic death in <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice was not due to a change in their susceptibility to IFN-Î³, we analyzed the correlation between serum levels of IFN-Î³ and survival status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To understand whether HLJ1 functions in macrophages to mediate LPS-induced IL-12 secretion, we performed macrophage transplantation.

Unexpectedly, we observed no difference in the mRNA levels of either IL-12p35 or IL-12p40 (subunits of IL-12p70) between <italic>Dnajb4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> BMDMs upon treatment with either LPS/IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) or LPS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that HLJ1 deletion has no effect on IL-12 transcriptional regulation. However, our previous in vivo result showed the transcriptional levels of IL-12 was reduced after HLJ1 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The reason for the discrepancy might be that <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice did not have enough IFN-Î³ to prime upstream IL-12p40 gene promoter in vivo, while in vitro isolated macrophages from both genotypes were treated with similar dosage of exogenous IFN-Î³ and LPS in the culture medium for priming and activating the cells. Therefore, in vitro macrophages transcribed IL-12 gene without being interfered by endogenous IFN-Î³-producing NK cells. Next, we examined mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-18, which did not differ significantly between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). We wondered if HLJ1 affects the quantity of IL-12 subunits, so we immunoblotted IL-12p40, a scaffold protein to maintain assembly induced folding and secretion of IL-12, from LPS/IFN-Î³-stimulated BMDM cell lysate, but we observed no significant difference between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p><p>Because HSPs are proteins that can be induced upon cellular stress, we analyzed HLJ1 protein expression in response to LPS/IFN-Î³ cotreatment in BMDMs. HLJ1 protein levels increased in a time-dependent manner after LPS/IFN-Î³ stimulation in <italic>Dnajb4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> BMDMs, and decreased gradually from 8 hr after the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). However, hepatic HLJ1 expression remained unchanged in mouse liver, which is composed mainly of hepatocytes, after LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>), indicating HLJ1 is induced in macrophages rather than in hepatocytes. Since serum levels of HSPs are reported to increase during sepsis, and analysis of survival outcomes of sepsis patients has revealed that increased mortality is associated with higher HSP serum levels, we postulated that HLJ1 may be secreted into the blood, and therefore quantified HLJ1 protein in serum from LPS-challenged mice. Indeed, we detected abundant HLJ1 in the serum of <italic>Dnajb4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> but not <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Interestingly, after the mice had received the LPS challenge, their serum levels of IL-12p70 were positively correlated to the amount of HLJ1 in their serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Since chaperones have recently emerged as mediators of IL-12 family protein folding, assembly, and degradation, we performed simultaneous human IL-12p35 overexpression and human HLJ1 knockdown in 293T cells (an established model cell line for studying IL-12 family assembly) to assess the role of HLJ1 in regulating IL-12 biosynthesis. Î²-Mercaptoethanol treatment breaks disulfide bonds and thus high-molecular-weight (HMW) IL-12p35 became completely reduced LMW IL-12p35 monomers, suggesting the HMW IL-12p35 was homodimer with intermolecular disulfide bridges between monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Interestingly, HLJ1 knockdown shifted the HMW to LMW ratio of IL-12p35 to the dimeric species, suggesting that HLJ1 is able to prevent non-native homodimeric IL-12p35 accumulation and helps to reduce the disulfide bonds of homodimeric IL-12p35 to form LMW monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). These results indicated that LPS-inducible HLJ1 plays an important role in the regulation of IL-12p35 folding and the maintenance of IL-12p70 heterodimerization in endotoxin-stimulated primary macrophages. HLJ1-mediated production of IL-12p70 in macrophages has a substantial impact on the production of IFN-Î³ from NK cells and causes a persistent cytokine production contributing to endotoxin-induced mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram delineates how HLJ1 functions and controls IL-12 biosynthesis, IFN-Î³ production, and subsequent sepsis-related mortality.</title><p>HLJ1 protein, which can be induced when macrophages are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), helps the conversion of high-molecular-weight (HMW) misfolded IL-12p35 homodimers to IL-12p35 monomers.

Purified LPS injected into mouse is widely used to resemble the physiology of severe sepsis and recapitulate human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deitch, 2005</xref>). Pathologically, LPS triggers activation of host-derived humoral and cellular inflammatory systems leading to MODS and septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hamesch et al., 2015</xref>). We demonstrated that LPS-induced vital organ injury and mortality was attributable to HLJ1-mediated production of IL-12 and IFN-Î³ cytokines. Because mice are rather insensitive to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cauwels et al., 2013</xref>), we use high-dose LPS (20 mg/kg LPS) which can resemble sepsis-induced SIRS and severe endotoxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silva et al., 2019</xref>) to induce endotoxic shock. Since non-lethal low-dose LPS is sufficient to cause systemic inflammation with rapidly increased serum cytokines such as TNF (tumor necrosis factor), IL-6, IFN-Î³, and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seemann et al., 2017</xref>), we also treated both mice with 4 mg/kg of LPS which induced moderate endotoxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kunze et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Malgorzata-Miller et al., 2016</xref>). It resulted in lower serum levels of organ dysfunction markers and also IFN-Î³ in <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice comparing with wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>), suggesting the effect of HLJ1 deletion on reducing IFN-Î³ levels and alleviating organ injury can be found as well during moderate endotoxemia. Nonetheless, although LPS-induced endotoxemia is a simple model with higher reproducibility and reliability than other sepsis models, it indeed cannot represent actual sepsis as it is the hostâs response to bacteria but not the pathogen itself that leads to mortality and organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deitch, 2005</xref>). We thus used CLP model resembling clinical disease and septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deitch, 2005</xref>) to reassure the importance of HLJ1 to human sepsis. During CLP-induced sepsis, mice deficient in HLJ1 showed reduced IFN-Î³ expression and alleviated organ injury, indicating similar role of HLJ1 in true sepsis. However, despite the fact that HLJ1 deletion alleviated LPS-induced mortality, it did not improve survival until antibiotics were used after CLP surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). It suggested that severe bacteremia contributed to mortality even in <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice before antibiotic administration. It is consistent with a previous study showing that only when IFN-Î³ knockout mice are administrated with systemic antibiotics do they show improved survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Romero et al., 2010</xref>). Given that IFN-Î³ inhibition with neutralizing antibodies alone do not improve survival in CLP mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Romero et al., 2010</xref>), HLJ1 inhibition combined with systemic antibiotics might be a promising strategy to treat sepsis.</p><p>In the model of LPS-induced endotoxemia, the technique of macrophage depletion and reconstitution has been used to investigate the role of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies demonstrated that in vivo tracking of transplanted macrophages reveals specific homing in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartneck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nishiwaki et al., 2020</xref>), while little is known about the location where transplanted macrophages produce IL-12 and mediate IFN-Î³ production during sepsis. We depleted phagocytes with clodronate liposome and found when macrophage-depleted mice received BMDM isolated from same genotype, serum IL-12 and IFN-Î³ bounced back to the levels where endogenous macrophages have not yet been depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This suggested adoptively transferred macrophages isolated from both genotypes were able to activate IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis in response to LPS challenge. To understand whether IL-12-producing macrophages occur in the liver microenvironment during endotoxemia, we analyzed the amount of hepatic F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in BMDM-transplanted mice. Indeed, macrophages went to the liver when they were adoptively transferred back into mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). This indicates that the IL-12-producing macrophages may occur in the liver microenvironment during high-dose endotoxemia. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that part of the transplanted macrophages would go to other organs as Nishiwaki et al. also found that macrophages have strong affinity for not only liver but also spleen and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nishiwaki et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, the number of endogenous macrophages is 60 per field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), while that of transplanted macrophages is about 30 per field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicated that part of the macrophages resided in the liver, while perhaps the rest of them would be at other organs.</p><p>Although we know immune cells such as macrophages in the liver initiate immune response and secrete proinflammatory cytokines when infection occurs, our knowledge about the transcriptional profiles of individual hepatic immune cells during sepsis is limited. Also, liver dysfunction and failure, which are particularly serious complications of sepsis, contribute directly to disease progression and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canabal and Kramer, 2008</xref>). We thus used scRNA-seq to characterize the cellular landscapes of liver nonparenchymal cells in a mouse model of sterile sepsis, and found dramatically changed gene signatures between LPS and control group with t-SNE visualization. However, cell distributions were similar across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We thus analyzed the excluded cells and found that the 1917 excluded cells were uniformly distributed across genotypes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating there were factors except for the exclusion that would make the individual groups appear similar. The reason why it happened might be the strong effect of LPS that had a much greater impact on the distribution shifting than the effect of gene deletion. This would lead to significantly shifted pattern between control and LPS groups, whereas the distribution patterns across genotypes were similar with t-SNE visualization. Nevertheless, we still observed hundreds of differentially expressed genes between genotypes when both mice were treated with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Even if these differentially expressed genes may not contributed directly to the shifting of cell distribution or grouping in the t-SNE plot, it may have significant biological functions and be involved in signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>).</p><p>Enrichment analysis of these genes revealed that HLJ1 mediated the crosstalk between hepatic immune cells through regulating IFN-Î³ signaling in NK cells. In the liver, studies have showed that IL-12 and other monokines such as IL-18 produced by LPS-stimulated macrophages activate liver NK cells to secrete IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bancroft et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takahashi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trinchieri, 1995</xref>). Indeed, we found the transcriptional levels of IFN-Î³ and IL-12 were lower in the liver of <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). However, we observed no difference in IL-12 expression between two genotypes of isolated macrophages ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The reason for discrepancy was that the transcription of IL-12 in vivo can be upregulated by downstream IFN-Î³ which acting on APCs in a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grohmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ma et al., 1996</xref>); therefore, <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice might not have sufficient IFN-Î³ to prime upstream IL-12p40 gene promoter, resulting in lesser transcriptional levels of IL-12 than <italic>Dnajb4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, isolated macrophages from both genotypes were treated with similar dosage of exogenous IFN-Î³ and LPS in the culture medium for priming and activating the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), so macrophages transcribed IL-12 gene without being interfered by endogenous IFN-Î³-producing NK cells. Little NK cells would affect BMDMs in the culture medium since we differentiated almost all bone marrow cells into F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Even though these macrophages from both genotypes produced similar transcription levels of IL-12 in response to LPS/IFN-Î³ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), protein levels of IL-12p70 were still lower in <italic>Dnajb4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> BMDMs than in wild-type ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This finding prompted us to dig into the molecular mechanism. Bioactive IL-12 is a disulfide-bridged heterodimeric glycoprotein that consists of an Î± subunit (IL-12p35) and a Î² subunit (IL-12p40) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoon et al., 2011</xref>). We found HLJ1 deletion altered neither IL-12p35 nor IL-12p40 transcription, indicating that HLJ1 does not regulate IL-12 transcription directly. Nonetheless, we concluded that HLJ1 controlled the heterodimerization and maintained levels of the biologically active IL-12p70 protein, since HLJ1 deletion resulted in both reduced intracellular and extracellular levels of heterodimeric IL-12p70 in LPS/IFN-Î³-stimulated BMDMs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meier et al., 2019</xref> have showed how chaperones regulate and control the assembly of heterodimeric IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family, through sequential checkpoints. ERdj5, another member of the DnaJ protein family, participates in the recognition and removal of non-native disulfides, as well as in the ERAD of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ushioda et al., 2008</xref>). It and have recently been found to reduce the quantity of IL-12p35 with non-native disulfide bonds and may even decelerate IL-12p35 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reitberger et al., 2017</xref>). Because the lack of HLJ1 reduces the amount of intracellular heterodimeric IL-12p70 detected by sandwich ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) without changing the amount of intracellular IL-12p40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) which functions as a scaffold to maintain the assembly induced folding of IL-12p35, we concluded that the HLJ1-mediated conversion of IL-12p35 homodimers to LMW monomers contributes directly to IL-12p70 heterodimerization. Accordingly, more detailed in vitro studies are needed to address questions about whether HLJ1 acts as a reductase to reduce non-native disulfide bonds in IL-12p35 dimers and whether HLJ1-mediated monomer formation contributes to the ERAD of misfolded IL-12p35 proteins.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated the previously unknown role of HLJ1 as a regulator of IL-12 heterodimerization and biosynthesis. Our data suggest that upregulated HLJ1 induced by LPS enhances IL-12 production and secretion in macrophages, which leads to upregulated IFN-Î³ produced by NK cells and contributes to subsequent endotoxin-induced mortality. Given that HLJ1 plays an important role in mediating IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis-dependent sepsis severity, HLJ1 may serve as a molecular target for the development of novel antisepsis or immunomodulatory therapies. To our knowledge, some strategies have been shown to induce HLJ1 expression through transcriptional or epitranscriptomic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miao et al., 2019</xref>). However, so far neither antibodies nor small molecules inhibiting HLJ1 expression has yet been developed. Identification of novel potential drugs for HLJ1 modulation is still under investigation for future applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The Introduction</p><p>1. Please include in the first sentence should contain the correct sepsis definition: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.</p><p>2. The authors characterize sepsis as a biphasic disorder, but this is not entirely correct, as the inflammatory and immunosuppressive phases can coincide. Please amend this.</p><p>3. Sepsis is not really a &quot;complication&quot; of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 is rather a form of sepsis, namely viral sepsis.</p><p>4. The introduction is very long and not to the point, it should be shortened by at least 30%. However, there is also critical information missing, such as the link between IL-12 and IFN-Î³ (i.e. the IL-12-IFN-Î³ axis). Therefore, please rewrite and shorten.</p><p>The study:</p><p>5. 10 mg/kg can hardly be considered &quot;low dose&quot; as it is an LD50 dose for C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>6. Additional experiments are necessary to demonstrate that the authors' findings are not limited only to the highly-reductionist massive endotoxemia model used, which has limited relevance to human sepsis. Ideally, corroborative human studies/data would be used to reassure the importance of HLJ1 to human sepsis. If these human studies are not feasible, then key experiments should be repeated using a live infection model, for example, cecal ligation and puncture, pneumonia, etc. to confirm the generalization of the findings to multiple models of sepsis. Especially, as LPS induced inflammation (endotoxemia) is not actual sepsis. These models should approximate the severity of human sepsis (~30% mortality). Furthermore, indices of organ dysfunction (renal function, etc.) should be provided to confirm HLJ1 is associated with organ injury during sepsis. The studies showing that Hlj1 k/o mice have less interferon Î³ (Figure 3D) after 4 mg/kg LPS is insufficient, as organ dysfunction indices are necessary to determine if these changes in interferon expression are relevant to sepsis.</p><p>7. The tSNE plots in Figure 1B are strikingly similar (nearly identical) across genotypes. That is, there appears to be no difference at all between the distribution of cells sequenced; this is somewhat surprising as one would expect some heterogeneity by chance alone. The authors note that they excluded apoptotic cells (high mtDNA) and doublets. Were these exclusions uniformly distributed across groups? If they were most common in the LPS groups, this would suggest perhaps some bias that would make the individual groups appear similar.</p><p>8. The macrophage transfer experiments (Figure 6) are compelling. When macrophages are adoptively transplanted back into mice, do they go to the liver, or do they go to another organ? This could be explored using staining approaches as illustrated in Figure 6B. This would demonstrate if IL-12 producing macrophages (and responding interferon Î³-producing natural killer T-cells) only occur in the liver microenvironment during high-dose endotoxemia.</p><p>9. In Figure 2B, this analysis should be split according to Hlj1+/+ and Hlj1â/âgenotypes, so either depict the fold-change in induction of IFNÎ³ expression in Hlj1â/â vs. Hlj1+/+ mice (both LPS-treated) or fold-change induction of IFNÎ³ expression in Hlj1â/â LPS-treated vs. Hlj1â/â not LPS treated and Hlj1+/+ LPS-treated vs. Hlj1+/+ not LPS treated mice.</p><p>10. The sentence 'Since LPS has been reported to induce systemic inflammatory responses, we analyzed splenic T, NK, and B cell populations in Hlj1+/+ and Hlj1â/â mice.' Is a bit puzzling. Of course, LPS induces a systemic inflammatory response, this is universally known. But why is that the reason to study splenic T, NK, and B cell populations?</p><p>11. Results, why was IFNÎ³ not included in the analyses presented in Figure 5A-B?</p><p>12. Results, how can the results in Figure 5B (reduced expression of IL-12 in Hlj1â/â cells) be reconciled with those presented in Figure 7A (no difference in IL-12 expression between the genotypes)?</p><p>The Discussion</p><p>13. The discussion is far too long and not focused, this needs to be rewritten and reduced.</p><p>General Questions</p><p>14. Can HLJ1 be targeted by antibodies or small molecule inhibitors?</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;HLJ1 amplifies endotoxin-induced sepsis severity by promoting IL-12 heterodimerization in macrophages&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jos van der Meer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. In the text, the authors refer to their knockout mouse as Dnajb4-/-; in the figures, they refer to it as Hlj1-/-. Please keep it consistent to minimize confusion for the reader.</p><p>2. The prose is clumsy in places, with some grammatical errors. While this does not interfere with the reader understanding the paper, it is a distraction. The discussion is mostly a series of disjointed paragraphs each addressing a separate concern with the paper, without much narrative flow. The paper would read much better if some additional editing/formatting were to occur.</p><p>3. The authors make some overconfident statements that aren't really necessary to get their point across. For example, line 149: &quot;Cytokine storm caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection is the major cause of septic shock and multiple organ failureâ¦&quot;. &quot;Cytokine storm&quot; is somewhat of a dated and overly simplistic concept that has failed to explain septic organ failure; thus, making that declarative statement invites the educated reader's ire. Better to say it is &quot;a cause of septic shockâ¦&quot;, as opposed to <italic>the major</italic> cause. One other slight irritant is the statement (line 525) that their data show &quot;unequivocally that upregulated HLJ1&quot;. It's up to the reader to decide if the data are &quot;unequivocal&quot;, not the authors!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76094.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The Introduction</p><p>1.

In a positive feedback loop, secreted IFN-Î³ augments IL-12 production by priming IL-12p40 gene promoter in APCs (Grohmann et al., 2001; Ma et al., 1996). The IL-12/IFN-Î³ axis-mediated communication between innate and adaptive immunity plays an important role in the control of infections by mycobacteria and other intracellular bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Ramirez-Alejo and Santos-Argumedo, 2014). In models of sterile sepsis and chronic bacterial infection, the IL-12/18-IFN-Î³ axis is controlled by ARTD1 in myeloid cells, which contributes to T<sub>H</sub>1 response and immune control of the bacteria (Kunze et al., 2019). However, the pathogenic role of IFN-Î³ has been implicated during CLP-induced septic shock where IFN-Î³-knockout mice showed lower levels of IL-6 and MIP-2 in the circulation and are resistant to CLP-induced mortality when treated with systemic antibiotics (Romero et al., 2010). The inhibition of IFN-Î³ activity by neutralizing antibodies improves survival and attenuates CLP-induced sepsis in rat, while it did not reduce CLP-related mortality in mice (Romero et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2005).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study:</p><p>5. 10 mg/kg can hardly be considered &quot;low dose&quot; as it is an LD50 dose for C57BL/6 mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank reviewer for the comment.

Although the LPS-induced endotoxemia is a simple model with higher reproducibility and reliability comparing to other sepsis models, it indeed cannot represent actual sepsis and is based on the notion that it is the hostâs response to bacteria but not the pathogen itself, that leads to mortality and organ failure (Deitch, 2005). Therefore, according to the reviewerâs suggestion, we performed additional model including cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) which resembles clinical disease and septic shock (Deitch, 2005) to reassure the importance of HLJ1 to human sepsis. In addition, we examined the organ dysfunction indices of mice treated with lower dose of LPS. Detail results were listed step by step in below:</p><p>i. After mice received CLP surgery, we found the transcriptional levels of IFN-Î³ were lower in <italic>Hlj1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice than <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice livers and spleens. These new results were added as Figure 6A and 6B of the revised manuscript. Also, please check our revised Figure 6 (Figure 6). With this new result, we have also added descriptions in the Material and Method (Page 26, line 549-563) as well as Result (Page 11-12, line 271-275) section of our revised manuscript.</p><p>ii. With CLP models, we found <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice exhibited significantly more severe kidney and liver damage than <italic>Hlj1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice, which is indicated by serum levels of BUN, creatinine, ALT and AST. This new result was added as Figure 6C of the revised manuscript. Also, please check our revised Figure 6 (Figure 6). With this new result, we had also added descriptions in the Material and Method (Page 26, line 549-563) as well as Result (Page 12, line 275-278) section of our revised manuscript.</p><p>iii. H&amp;E staining showed kidney injury at the histology level after CLP surgery, while <italic>Hlj1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice showed less severe kidney injury than <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>. This new result was added as Figure 6D of the revised manuscript. Also, please check our revised Figure 6 (Figure 6). With this new result, we had also added descriptions in the Result (Page 12, line 278-279) section of our revised manuscript.</p><p>iv. We observed the survival rate of CLP mice and found similar survival rate between <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hlj1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice. We further found <italic>Hlj1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice showed significantly improved survival compared to <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice when mice were treated with systemic antibiotics. These results implied the agent responsible for bacteria clearance can be combined with immune modulation such as HLJ1 targeting to improve the outcome of sepsis. This new result was added as Figure 6E of the revised manuscript. Also, please check our revised Figure 6 (Figure 6).

Finally, to understand if the changes of IFN-Î³ expression after HLJ1 deletion under low dose of LPS are relevant to sepsis, we treated both genotypes with 4 mg/kg LPS and analyzed serum levels of BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST. Consequently, <italic>Hlj1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice showed less severe organ damage than <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice. This new result was added to Figure 1C and D of the revised manuscript. Also, please check our revised Figure 1 (Figure 1).

Furthermore, we also mentioned the reviewerâs comment in the Discussion section (Page 18-19, line 431-453). These comments and suggestions inspire us and let us more familiar with the role of HLJ1 in sepsis. Thank you very much.</p><p>Page 26, line 549-563</p><p>Cecal ligation and puncture</p><p>âCLP and sham surgery were performed according the protocol published in previous study (Au â Toscano et al., 2011). In brief, 6-8-week-old mice were anesthetized and practiced a 1 cm midline laparotomy and cecum was exposed with adjoining intestine. The cecum was tightly ligated with a 6.0 silk suture at &gt;1 cm distance from the distal end and was perforated twice with 19-G needle. The cecum was gently squeezed to extrude a small amount of feces to produce sepsis outcome and was returned to the peritoneal cavity. Afterwards, mice were resuscitated with 1 mL of normal saline subcutaneously. 18 hours after CLP, mRNA levels of IFN-Î³ in liver and spleen were analyzed with qRT-PCR. Serum levels of BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST were analyzed by AU680 (Beckman Coulter). For histological analysis, mouse kidney was fixed with 10% formalin for 48 hours, followed by dehydration, parafilm-embedding and section for HandE staining. For survival rate analysis, 25 mg/kg Primaxin (Merck) was used immediately after CLP and treatment were continued twice per day throughout the observation period.â</p><p>Page 11-12, line 271-275</p><p>âCLP significantly induced transcriptional levels of IFN-Î³ in the liver of <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice comparing to mice receiving sham surgery while <italic>Hlj1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice showed significantly lower IFN-Î³ mRNA than <italic>Hlj1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (Figure 6A).

Therefore, we performed additional model including CLP which resembles clinical disease and septic shock (Deitch, 2005) to reassure the importance of HLJ1 to human sepsis. We found HLJ1 deletion led to reduced IFN-Î³ expression and can alleviate renal and liver injury. Even though we found HLJ1 deletion could reduce LPS-induced mortality, in CLP model it did not improve survival rate until antibiotics were used (Figure 6E). In CLP model, it is possible that severe bacteremia contributed to mortality in mice that did not receive antibiotics in an IFN-Î³-independent manner. It is consistent with previous findings showing that only when they were treated with systemic antibiotics do IFN-Î³ knockout mice showed improved survival rate (Romero et al., 2010).

The tSNE plots in Figure 1B are strikingly similar (nearly identical) across genotypes. That is, there appears to be no difference at all between the distribution of cells sequenced; this is somewhat surprising as one would expect some heterogeneity by chance alone. The authors note that they excluded apoptotic cells (high mtDNA) and doublets. Were these exclusions uniformly distributed across groups? If they were most common in the LPS groups, this would suggest perhaps some bias that would make the individual groups appear similar.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologized for our unclear illustration and explanation leading to misunderstanding. Indeed, exclusions may differently or uniformly distributions across genotypes as LPS treatment may cause fragile cell death. We therefore re-analyzed the excluded cells in which UMI count of greater than 30,000, fewer than 500 or greater than 6,000 genes, and &gt;10% of total expression from mitochondrial genes. Shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B. As a result, the 1917 excluded cells seems to uniformly distributed across genotypes, which means perhaps there were little bias that make the individual groups appear similar. The reason why the tSNE plot in Figure 1B (now Figure 3A) are similar across genotypes might be the strong effect of LPS that impose a much greater impact on the distribution shift than the effect of gene deletion did. This would lead to significant shifted pattern across control and LPS groups, whereas the distribution patterns across genotypes are similar. Nevertheless, we observed hundreds of differentially expressed genes between genotypes treated with LPS (Figure 1E, now Figure 3D). Even if these differentially expressed genes may not contributed directly to cell distribution shift or grouping in the tSNE plot, these genes have significant biological functions and be involved in signaling pathways (Figure 1F and 1G, now Figure 3E and 3F). This additional analysis will generate new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B of Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 (Revised Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).

The macrophage transfer experiments (Figure 6) are compelling. When macrophages are adoptively transplanted back into mice, do they go to the liver, or do they go to another organ? This could be explored using staining approaches as illustrated in Figure 6B. This would demonstrate if IL-12 producing macrophages (and responding interferon Î³-producing natural killer T-cells) only occur in the liver microenvironment during high-dose endotoxemia.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewerâs affirmation. We also appreciate this interesting issue raised by the reviewer. Based on the suggestion, we thus performed immunofluorescence staining to clarify whether transplanted macrophages go to the liver.
