comes in two forms: the normal surface-dwelling and the blind depigmented cave-adapted morphs. Comparing the development of their basal forebrain, we found quantitative differences in numbers of cells in specific clusters for six out of nine studied neuropeptidergic cell types. Investigating the origins of these differences, we showed that early Shh and Fgf signaling impact on the development of NPY and Hypocretin clusters, via effect on Lhx7 and Lhx9 transcription factors, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that such neurodevelopmental evolution underlies behavioral evolution, linking a higher number of Hypocretin cells with hyperactivity in cavefish. Early embryonic modifications in signaling/patterning at neural plate stage therefore impact neuronal development and later larval behavior, bridging developmental evolution of a neuronal system and the adaptive behavior it governs. This work uncovers novel variations underlying the evolution and adaptation of cavefish to their extreme environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cavefish</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Blindtest</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Retaux</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20150331745 RETAUX</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Retaux</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comparative approach shows that developmental evolution of neuropeptidergic neuronal groups in the hypothalamus of blind cavefish drives adaptive behavioral evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The secondary prosencephalon of the vertebrate forebrain, comprising the telencephalon, the optic/preoptic region and the hypothalamus, develops from the anterior neural plate. By the end of gastrulation, the neural plate is already patterned and the regional fate of its antero-posterior and medio-lateral domains is specified, as a result of the concerted action of diffusible morphogen molecules that emanate from secondary organizers (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavodeassi and Houart, 2012</xref>]). Endo-mesodermal tissues (prechordal plate and notochord) located ventral to the neural plate secrete Nodal/TGFβ and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) molecules necessary for induction of ventral forebrain and maintenance of hypothalamic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kiecker and Niehrs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mathieu et al., 2002</xref>). The anterior-most neural plate border, named ANB then ANR (anterior neural border and ridge) secrete Wnt inhibitors and Fibroblast Growth Factors that are required for the establishment of telencephalic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Houart et al., 1998</xref>) and its patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shanmugalingam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shimogori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walshe and Mason, 2003</xref>), respectively. Thus, the elaboration of the vertebrate forebrain depends on the tight spatial and temporal regulation of relatively few morphogenetic signals. Changes in these early events have the potential to modulate brain organization, notably the relative size of different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinaux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sylvester et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sylvester et al., 2013</xref>) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rétaux et al., 2013</xref>]).</p><p>The evolution of brain development and its behavioral consequences is a major topic to understand how vertebrates colonize novel environments. <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> is a model of choice to tackle this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jeffery, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeffery, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rétaux et al., 2016</xref>). This teleost fish exhibits two morphotypes: a surface-dwelling form (thereafter designated as SF) that inhabits South and Central America rivers, and a cave-dwelling form (CF) that consists in multiple populations living in the total and permanent darkness of Mexican caves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mitchell et al., 1977</xref>). These two forms have split from a surface fish-like ancestor less than 30,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fumey et al., 2017</xref>). During this time, cavefish have evolved regressive traits - the most spectacular being the loss of eyes and pigmentation - but they also evolved several constructive traits such as a larger jaw, more taste buds and neuromasts, or larger olfactory epithelia (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rétaux et al., 2016</xref>]).</p><p>Inside the cavefish brain, patterning modifications have been described as well and are the consequences of subtle modifications in the early expression of morphogens during evolution. Enlarged ventral midline Shh expression during gastrulation and neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>) results in a larger hypothalamic region, presumably via extension of <italic>Nkx2.1a</italic>, <italic>Lhx6</italic> and <italic>Lhx7</italic> transcription factor expression domains and increased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menuet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rétaux et al., 2008</xref>). Early expansion of Shh is also responsible for a heterochrony in the onset of <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression in the ANR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>). Fgf8 is turned on at 10hpf in CF ANR, while its expression starts 2 hrs later in SF. In turn, Fgf8 maintains <italic>Shh</italic> expansion in the CF developing forebrain basal plate, with consequences on neural plate patterning at the onset of neurulation: the expression domains of transcription factors (TFs) such as <italic>Lhx2</italic>, <italic>Lhx9</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>, or <italic>Zic1</italic> are different in SF and CF at neural plate stage and related differences in fate maps have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinaux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strickler et al., 2001</xref>). In particular, cell populations that give rise to the ventral quadrant of the retina in SF seem to be allocated to the dorsal retina or to the hypothalamus in CF. Accordingly, early manipulation of Fgf signaling in CF (thus mimicking the SF situation) is able to restore the ventral quadrant of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these studies highlight the morphogenetic consequences of small spatio-temporal changes in early Shh and Fgf signaling in cavefish. Similar variations in early Wnt signaling in distinct ecotypes of cichlid fish result in the development of brains with large or small telencephalon, thalamus and tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sylvester et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sylvester et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, natural variations of forebrain patterning by signaling modulations may be a widespread mechanism for forebrain evolution.</p><p>The hypothalamus is a hub that integrates central and peripheral signals and elicits multiple neuroendocrine and homeostatic responses. Hypothalamic circuits control behaviors such as locomotor activity, sleep/wake cycles and food intake, but also responds to metabolic state of the body (level of adiposity and blood glucose) by directly acting on peripheral organs to control energy expenditure ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myers and Olson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsujino and Sakurai, 2013</xref>] for recent reviews). <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish has evolved multiple behaviors of putative adaptive value to live in cave environment where survival challenges reside in finding food and interacting with congeners in permanent darkness. Several of these behaviors are typically controlled by the hypothalamus: CF show enhanced foraging traits and increased locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elipot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshizawa et al., 2015</xref>), sleep loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duboué et al., 2011</xref>) and, for some populations, enhanced food intake and high fat content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>) when compared to their surface conspecifics.</p><p>The behaviors described above are under the control of different, but neighboring neuronal populations in the hypothalamus of vertebrates, including fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herget et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Löhr and Hammerschmidt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machluf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuda et al., 2012a2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsuda et al., 2012b</xref>). Here, we have first compared and interpreted in details the developmental neuroanatomy of nine neuropeptidergic cell types in the hypothalamus and preoptic region of SF and CF embryos and larvae, highlighting specific differences in neuron numbers between the two morphs. We then established causal relationships between early signaling modifications, regional patterning and cell specification processes in cavefish. We further showed that Lhx9 and Lhx7 transcription factors serve as ‘relays’ and are involved in the observed changes in Hypocretin and NPY neurons in cavefish, respectively. Finally we provide evidence that such developmental evolution in hypothalamic neuronal networks affects the behavior of cavefish larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anatomical interpretation</title><p>The morphogenetic movements of the early neural plate and tube are complex. Recently several novel interpretations of the developmental neuroanatomy of the vertebrate secondary prosencephalon have been put forward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In tetrapods, the updated prosomeric model aims at proposing causal explanations of the hypothalamic and preoptic area structures, by the effects of antero-posterior and dorso-ventral signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Puelles and Rubenstein, 2015</xref>). Two transverse hypothalamo-telencephalic prosomeres, hp1 and hp2, encompassing the four dorso-ventral domains of the neuroepithelium (roof, alar, basal, and floor plates) have been proposed, supported by genoarchitecture and embryological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In zebrafish, a morphogenetic interpretation of the development of the optic/pre-optic region suggests the existence of three morphogenetic units based on centrifugal neurogenesis patterns rather than on gene expression boundaries –the telencephalon, the optic recess region (ORR) and the hypothalamus-, which helps to resolve some inconsistencies between tetrapod and teleost basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affaticati et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally in zebrafish also, a homology relationship was proposed between the teleost ‘neurosecretory pre-optic area’ or NPO (located in the ORR as defined by Affaticati and colleagues, or in the preoptic region/PO according to the classical nomenclature) and the mammalian paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which belongs to the mammalian alar hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herget et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herget and Ryu, 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Here, our analyses take into account both the crucial interpretation along the neural axis and according to the alar or basal plate nature of the neuroepithelium, and the peculiarities of the teleost forebrain.</p><p>With the aim to precisely document cavefish basal forebrain developmental evolution, we have first compared the ontogenesis of neuropeptidergic cell groups, their organization and their size, between SF and CF embryos and larvae originating from the Pachón cave, at three critical stages of forebrain development (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32808.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparative development of NPY, Hypocretin and AgRP neurons in SF and CF.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>S’</bold>) Photographs of embryonic brains after in situ hybridization for NPY, Hypocretin and AgRP at 24, 36, and 84 hpf.

This group of NPY neurons is significantly more numerous in CF than in SF at all investigated stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and U</xref>). From 36 hpf, then 84 hpf, NPY is expressed in many additional brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F'</xref>). This includes two symmetrical and large cell groups located in the hypothalamus (basal plate) extending dorsally to the region around the post-optic commissure (poc) at the border of the ORR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F'</xref>). In this region as well, CF possess about twice more NPY neurons than SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and U</xref>). In contrast to these basal regions, the NPY population located in the telencephalon (alar plate) from 36 hpf onwards was similar in the two morphs and a cluster located in the medial part of the dorsal ORR, around the anterior commissure, contained more cells in SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F' and U</xref>).

The POMCa pattern then takes the shape of two elongated stripes in the tuberal part of the terminal (or anterior) hypothalamus at 84 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D’</xref>), similar to the above-described AgRP neurons. At both 36 hpf and 84 hpf, POMCa is also expressed in the pituitary gland, which is apposed onto to the hypothalamus midline and clearly recognizable at 84 hpf as a single structure with closely condensed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D’</xref>). At 36 hpf, we count significantly more POMCa neurons in SF than in CF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; of note at this stage hypothalamic and pituitary neurons were very difficult to distinguish and were therefore pooled). At 84 hpf, SF display more POMCa neurons than CF in the pituitary (now well identifiable; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) but not in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and V</xref>).</p><p>POMCb is first expressed at 18 hpf at the rostral tip of the developing hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). At 24 hpf, a cluster of POMCb neurons is located at the dorsal limit of the hypothalamus basal plate, bordering the ORR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H’</xref>). At 36 hpf, POMCb and POMCa are partially co-expressed in the anterior hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J’ and W</xref>), with POMCb extending more dorsally close to the ORR, and POMCa more ventrally. At 84 hpf, POMCb neurons form two elongated stripes in the tuberal hypothalamus, but unlike POMCa, many POMCb neurons lie along the poc close to the hypothalamus/ORR border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–L’</xref>). Some of these POMCb neurons extend posteriorly, so that Hcrt and POMCb cells are very close to each other (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>’-N’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>’-L’), but the two peptides are never co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2W</xref>). POMCb is also detected in the pituitary from 36 hpf onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–L'</xref>). From 36 hpf, POMCb neurons become more abundant in both the pituitary and the hypothalamus of SF, reaching about twice more cells at 84 hpf than in CF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–N</xref>).</p><p>Another neuropeptide expressed in this same region is AVT. It is expressed from 24 hpf in a very similar pattern to POMCb, and the two peptides indeed partially co-localize in some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O–T’, W</xref>). Between 36 hpf and 84 hpf, the number of AVT neurons in the hypothalamus keeps increasing in SF but not in CF so that AVT neurons are more abundant in SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2U</xref>). In addition, two symmetrical clusters appear in the lateral and posterior ORR at 84 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S–T’</xref>), which we propose to belong to the teleost-specific NPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herget et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). By contrast to the hypothalamus, the number of AVT cells in the NPO of SF and CF was not different (SF: 30.3 ± 2.7, n = 14; CF: 31 ± 3, n = 16).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Similar numbers of IT, CART3 and MCH neurons in developing cavefish and surface fish</title><p>The three other neuropeptides we studied are CART3, IT, and MCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results are summarized in panel T and the raw cell counts are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. IT is expressed in two symmetrical groups in the lateral and posterior ORR, corresponding to the NPO as demonstrated by <italic>Otpb</italic> co-expression, and starting between 24 hpf and 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A–E',U</xref>). IT neurons counts were remarkably identical in the NPO of the two morphs at all stages examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G,T</xref>). CART3 is transiently expressed by more neurons in the SF telencephalon at 24 hpf and in the CF NPO at 36 hpf but none of these differences are maintained at 84 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H–M’,N,T</xref>). Finally, MCH onset of expression is around 36 hpf, a stage where more MCH neurons are observed in a very discrete cell cluster of the posterior tuberal hypothalamus in CF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1O–R’,S</xref>). At 84 hpf, the difference is not maintained, and a few MCH cells also appear in the mammillary region of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Q–R’,S,T</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the comparative developmental maps of neuropeptidergic cell clusters presented above demonstrate region-specific, neuropeptide-specific, and time-specific differences in peptidergic neuron development in the two <italic>Astyanax</italic> morphs. There is a general trend for cavefish to possess more NPY, Hcrt, AgRP and less POMCa, POMCb, AVT neurons, even though these different types of neurons develop from the same or very close neuroepithelial zones in the hypothalamus basal plate, at the border of the ORR/PO region (examples: Hcrt/POMCb or AgRP/AVT). In line with this observation, these two categories of neuropeptides are never co-expressed. Interestingly, all peptidergic cell types showing quantitative variations in numbers between SF and CF were located in the basal plate of the hypothalamus. By contrast, neuropeptidergic cells located in the alar plate, in the NPO, displayed no difference between the two morphs. Finally, the data also show that in <italic>Astyanax,</italic> neuropeptidergic neurons show terminal differentiation signs (expression of their peptide transmitter) very early in embryogenesis, and therefore must be born equally early. The earliest expressed neuropeptides are Hcrt and POMCb (18hpf), followed by NPY, AVT, IT, CART3 (24hpf) and finally AgRP, POMCa, MCH (36hpf). The earliest differentiated neuropeptidergic cells are located in the dorsal hypothalamus at the frontier with the ORR, in a zone around the poc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1U</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2V</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Lhx7 and Lhx9 delineate NPY and Hcrt neuron territories and specify their peptidergic phenotypes</title><p>We next sought to define some of the causal molecular determinism for the above-described differences, taking advantage of the cavefish ‘natural mutant’ to pinpoint developmental mechanisms that can participate in the evolution of the hypothalamic networks in natural populations.</p><p>Previous analyses in zebrafish have defined the posterior half of the <italic>otpa</italic> (<italic>orthopedia a</italic>) domain as the larval NPO and as the homologous region to the mammalian PVN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herget et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herget and Ryu, 2015</xref>).

Accordingly, the same cyclopamine treatment did not affect the number of NPY cells in the acroterminal region at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As NPY hypothalamic cells arise later, around 84 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and cyclopamine treatments affect later larval survival, we did not assess cyclopamine effect on 84 hpf larvae. We used instead a treatment with the FgfR signaling inhibitor SU5402 (5 μM; between 8 hpf and 12 hpf), which results in a decrease of <italic>Shh</italic> expression in CF, therefore also indirectly mimicking the SF phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinaux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>), but with less deleterious effects on larval development. In line with the effect of cyclopamine on the hypothalamic <italic>Lhx7</italic> domain at 24 hpf, and with the role of <italic>Lhx7</italic> in NPY specification shown above, SU5402 treatment on CF caused a reduction of hypothalamic NPY cell numbers at 84 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Behavioral recordings were then performed on 24 hr cycles. Seven dpf CF larvae are about 30–50% more active than SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6CD</xref>), hence the difference in locomotor activity in the 7 dpf larvae of the two morphs is similar to that observed in older fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshizawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duboué et al., 2011</xref>) or younger fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pottin et al., 2010</xref>).

In particular, reasoning in terms of brain axes in the frame of the updated prosomeric model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Puelles and Rubenstein, 2015</xref>), and taking into account the particularities of the teleost brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herget et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affaticati et al., 2015</xref>) was instrumental to understand that the most affected peptidergic populations in cavefish were located in the hypothalamic basal plate, while alar plate populations including those of the NPO were unchanged. In fact, the developmental origin of the neuropeptides we have studied is very similar in <italic>Astyanax</italic> fish and in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Díaz et al., 2014</xref>) in terms of D/V and A/P coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). For example, NPY, Hcrt, POMC and AgRP have basal progenitor sources while IT comes from alar sources and CART have alar +basal sources in both species. The only difference we observed in this regard is a double alar +basal origin of AVT cells in fish. The A/P organization seems also conserved with for example the fish Hcrt cluster in a posterior position that corresponds well to its origin in the peduncular hypothalamo-telencephalic prosomere (Hp1, tuberal part) in the mouse, or the AgRP fish cluster located in an anterior position that fits well with its acroterminal origin (tuberal part, arcuate nucleus) in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Díaz et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that early born fish NPY cells also belong to the acroterminal domain. In mouse, a population of NPY cells born in the tuberal (dorsal) part of the acroterminal domain migrates tangentially and ventrally inside the acroterminal domain to populate the arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Díaz et al., 2014</xref>). In fish, acroterminal NPY cells also seem to migrate ventrally to end up in the position of the fish-specific <italic>saccus vasculosus</italic>, a circumventricular organ with poorly studied neurosecretory functions and that may serve as a sensor of seasonal changes in day length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castro et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsuneki, 1986</xref>). These acroterminal NPY cells of fishes and mammals thus have a shared developmental origin but distinct final fates and functions. Finally and interestingly, early-born acroterminal and later-born hypothalamic NPY cells behaved strikingly differently with regards to their response to signaling influences emanating from the borders of the neural plate and tube, further emphasizing the importance of interpreting anatomical data according to models of brain development.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32808.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary schemes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparative developmental maps of neuropeptidergic cell types between <italic>Astyanax</italic> and mouse.

Conversely, NPO clusters do not vary between the two morphs. Even more so, in the case of AVT which displays alar and basal clusters in <italic>Astyanax</italic>, the alar NPO cluster is identical in SF and CF but the basal hypothalamic cluster is larger in SF. This strongly suggests that the neuroepithelial region giving rise to the ‘tuberal’ hypothalamus in CF is specifically subjected to patterning variations. Interestingly, in their new interpretation of prosencephalic development, Puelles et al. ascribe the induction of the hypothalamic basal plate in its ventrodorsal axis to the action of the migrating prechordal plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Puelles and Rubenstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Calero et al., 2008</xref>), rather than to the notochord. In cavefish, there is evidence for stronger Shh and dynamically modified Bmp4 signaling from the prechordal plate at the end of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinaux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, Fgf8 secreted from the ANR potentially influences neuroepithelial regions topographically related to the anterior commissure, the rostral-most point of the neural tube, and also interacts with the Shh-secreting prechordal plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinaux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>). There, Fgf8 is expressed earlier in CF than in SF. Moreover, Fgf8/10/18 are also expressed at later stages in the acroterminal domain itself from embryonic day 11.5 in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferran et al., 2015</xref>) and from 15 hpf in zebrafish ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sbrogna et al., 2003</xref>] and ZFIN), representing another potential source of signaling molecules.</p><p>Focusing on NPY, Hcrt and POMCb neurons, and using early (8-12 hpf) or later (16-20 hpf) pharmacological manipulations, we found that early Shh and FgfR signaling at neural plate stage positively regulate the size of a Lhx7/NPY cluster which differentiates in the hypothalamus at 84 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Conversely, the Lhx7/NPY cells of the acroterminal <italic>saccus vasculosus</italic> are insensitive to these signaling systems, and more investigations are needed to understand why they are more numerous in CF. Concerning the Lhx9/Hcrt cells, while an unknown mechanism must be responsible for the initial enlargement of the <italic>Lhx9</italic> expression domain at early stage, we uncovered a positive role of Shh/FgfR signaling during their differentiation but not their initial specification at neural plate stage, together with a putative ‘priming’ role of FgfR signaling for future Hcrt development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Taken together, these data show that signaling variations at the end of gastrulation (i.e. unexpectedly very early) and during neurulation influence later hypothalamic progenitor dynamics and/or neuronal differentiation, and thus are, at least in part, responsible for the developmental variation in neuropeptidergic patterning in the cavefish brain. These data also add to the emerging knowledge on the role of signaling molecules on the successive steps of development of hypothalamic cell types (examples: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muthu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Russek-Blum et al., 2008</xref>]).</p><p>In addition, we provide evidence for a novel role of Lhx7, necessary and sufficient for the specification of NPY neurons. In the past years, several factors controlling specification and differentiation within specific nuclei or regions of the developing hypothalamus have been found (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedont et al., 2015</xref>]), among which LIM-homeodomain TFs are well represented. Indeed, Lhx9 is necessary and sufficient for Hcrt neuron specification in zebrafish and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), a role that we also find conserved in <italic>Astyanax</italic>. Islet1 controls hypothalamic (but not pituitary) POMC/POMCa development in mouse and zebrafish, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nasif et al., 2015</xref>), and Lhx1 controls differentiation of several peptidergic types including VIP or Enk in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedont et al., 2014</xref>). The present finding of the Lhx7/NPY link suggests the possibility of an emerging ‘LIM code’ for hypothalamic cell type development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>From developmental evolution of neuronal clusters to behavior</title><p>The developing hypothalamus is larger in <italic>Astyanax</italic> CF than SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menuet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rétaux et al., 2008</xref>). We reasoned that if all the hypothalamic neuronal populations of <italic>Astyanax</italic> CF were homothetically changed, then the net resulting behavioral and metabolic consequences should not be modified. But it is not the case. Some peptidergic clusters are larger, some are smaller, and some are unchanged. This prompted us to investigate potential functional behavioral consequences of these variations.</p><p>Within the arcuate nucleus of the mouse hypothalamus, neurons directly act on food intake and energy balance, with sometimes antagonist effects. Neurons that co-express NPY and AgRP, together with Orexin/Hcrt neurons, act to increase appetite (orexigenic). On the contrary, neurons that co-express CART and POMC decrease appetite (anorexigenic) (for reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larsen and Hunter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Millington, 2007</xref>]). These systems are functionally conserved in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerdá-Reverter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Volkoff and Peter, 2006</xref>), including <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Penney and Volkoff, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wall and Volkoff, 2013</xref>). Here, we found that increased numbers of orexinergic neurons (NPY, Hcrt, AgRP) and decreased numbers of anorexigenic neurons (POMCa/b, AVT) do not have a direct effect on food intake in Pachón CF larvae and juveniles. This is in contrast to adults and juveniles of other CF populations such as Tinaja or Molino, who carry a mutation in the coding sequence of the melanocortin four receptor (mc4r) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>), a constitutively-activated receptor on which AgRP acts as an antagonist, including in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerdá-Reverter et al., 2011</xref>). In the Pachón CF, who do not carry this mutation, compensatory mechanisms to the disequilibrium in orexigenic/anorexigenic neurons might exist. This may include modulations by other neurotransmitter systems which are also modified in CF, such as the serotonergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elipot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elipot et al., 2014a</xref>), well known as a negative appetite-regulating system through its action on the melanocortin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lam et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Hcrt in the hypothalamus has a conserved role in the regulation of locomotion and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we have developmentally manipulated the number of Hcrt neurons in CF through <italic>Lhx9</italic> MO knock-down. We found that 7dpf CF with reduced numbers of Hcrt neurons show decreased locomotion and increased hypoactivity state at larval stage, and are indistinguishable from the SF behavior. Therefore we propose that high locomotor activity in CF is due to developmental evolution of their Hcrt system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Mice with reduced numbers of orexin neurons are narcoleptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hara et al., 2001</xref>) and zebrafish overexpressing Hcrt are hyperactive and display an insomnia-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prober et al., 2006</xref>) (in fish, sleep-like states can be identified behaviorally as periods of inactivity associated with increased arousal thresholds). Moreover, in zebrafish, Hcrt seems to control the transitions from states of no or low activity into a high activity state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>, high locomotor activity and reduction of sleep are described in 3 weeks old and adult CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshizawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duboué et al., 2011</xref>), and genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Hcrt signaling increases sleep duration in adult CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaggard et al., 2017a</xref>). Although we have not directly measured sleep in the present study, it is tempting to speculate that developmental evolution of the Hcrt cluster in CF plays a role in sleep loss. Other neurotransmitters might play a role as well: noradrenalin, whose brain levels are higher in Pachón CF than in SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elipot et al., 2014a</xref>), also regulates sleep in CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duboué et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we provide a developmental origin to the evolution of behavior in cavefish. Juveniles and adults of Pachón CF show vibration-attraction behavior mediated by their more sensitive lateral line neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yoshizawa et al., 2010</xref>), and ablation of the lateral line enhances sleep in the Pachón cavefish population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaggard et al., 2017b</xref>), suggesting that heightened sensory input participates to evolutionarily derived sleep loss in adults. QTL studies have recently demonstrated that increased locomotion/sleep loss and enhanced sensory responsiveness have a different genetic determinism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshizawa et al., 2015</xref>). No loci linked to the CF locomotor activity phenotype have been identified so far, but they may well correspond to early embryonic signaling pathways which determine the numbers of neurons in the Hcrt hypothalamic cluster.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish samples</title><p>Laboratory stocks of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> surface fish and cavefish (Pachón population) were obtained in 2004 from the Jeffery laboratory at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers find the manuscript interesting and that it has potential. However, they also raised a number of concerns about essential missing controls and better characterization of the sleep phenotype. It is the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> to reject papers that need revisions that would require more than two months to complete. However, if you feel you can address the comments of the reviewers in the future, we would be happy to receive a new submission and every effort would be made to return the paper to the previous reviewers. Please see the full reviews below, which I hope you find useful, for details that would need to be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;developmental evolution of the forebrain in cavefish: from natural variations in neuropeptides to behavior&quot; by Alié, Devos, Torres-Paz et al. studies whether differences in the neurodevelopment of the cave and surface fish populations of <italic>Astyanax</italic> underlie known behavioral adaptations of these fish. Using a tour de force whole mount in situ approach, the authors are able to show that certain neuropeptidergic cell groups (NPY, Hypocretin, AgRP neurons) are over-represented in cavefish larvae while others (POMC and AVT) were more abundant in surface fish. Importantly, the authors move beyond a pure descriptive work and start to dissect the regulatory network underlying the morphological changes in the brain. Using morpholino and chemical inhibitors the authors provide evidence that an expansion of SHH and Fgf8 in the forebrain of cavefish leads to increased lhx7/9 expression which in turn leads to higher numbers of NPY and Hcrt neurons. Most importantly and excitingly the authors are able to link these neuronal changes to the sleep behavior changes in cavefish which makes the study stand out and I recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the major comments listed below are addressed.</p><p>1) While I compliment the authors on the use of functional studies in an emerging model organism and the use of morpholino is acceptable in the absence of fully established gene editing methods, the morpholino experiments lack appropriate and necessary controls. First, it is unclear to me why the authors do not use a splice morpholino (do they assume a maternal contribution to be important in the phenotypes?). A splice morpholino has the big advantage of the simple ability to show that the morpholino is reducing the available amount of functional protein via PCR. If a splice morpholino cannot be used then a dose response curve to the morpholino on the protein level is necessary (which arguably is more complicated but needed). Furthermore, it is common practice to show specificity of the morpholino by rescuing the phenotype with RNA-co-injection.</p><p>2) The result that morpholino treated cavefish sleep more and this phenotype correlates with the number of Hcrt neurons is extremely exciting. I am just a little bit concerned about the methods of sleep recording. In previous studies that have recorded sleep in <italic>Astyanax</italic> larvae the methods were as follows: &quot;Following an 18 hr acclimation period, fry were recorded for a period of 24 or 48 hr&quot; (copied from Duboue, Keene and Borowsky, 2011). In this study the authors used only 1 hour acclimation and 1 hour recording which compared to the original study seems a bit short. In addition, Duboue, Keene and Borowsky, 2011 uses: &quot;fry […] between 21 and 24 days old&quot;, while the authors used 7dpf old fish. A comparison between the two different ages (in surface and cavefish) is needed to show that such sleep behavior experiments can also be performed at these earlier time points as larval behavior is very different between 7dpf and 21 dpf.</p><p>3) Statistics for the neuron quantification. The authors depict the data as &quot;the mean +/- SEM of at least two independent replicates&quot;. I have two general problems with this: First, two replicates are not enough to account for potential variation in whole mount in situ experiments (which can be very variable). Second the use of mean +/- SEM is the weakest way of displaying data and generally should be avoided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In &quot;Developmental evolution of the forebrain in cavefish: from natural variations in neuropeptides to behavior&quot; the authors seek to quantify cell number differences in different neuropeptidergic cell types between cave and surface fish. They then attempt to link early signaling to these differences in cell number to changes in behavior that have evolved in cavefish. Establishing these links would be an important step in understanding the evolution of behavior in this species, and more generally, as little is known about the genetic, developmental and neural bases of behavioral evolution in vertebrate species. However, there are a number of substantive concerns about this work that need to be addressed prior to coming to conclusions about these links.</p><p>First, the paper relies heavily on quantifying neuron populations using colormetric in situ hybridization. I find this potentially problematic. How do the authors know that they are comparing the same plane in cavefish and surface fish for accurate quantification? As most of the conclusions of the paper rest on there being differences in numbers between certain cell types, it is critical that these cell numbers are quantified accurately. Quantifications would be more convincing if they were performed on three dimensional images that did not rely on identifying precisely the same field of view and depth in each embryo. This could be done by confocal imaging of fluorescent in situs.</p><p>Second, linking gene expression during development to different numbers of cells of a certain type and to behavior relies on morpholino experiments. However, aside from a morpholino with mismatches relative to a single other morpholino they inject, they have not provided controls that convincingly demonstrate the specificity of their knock downs. At a minimum, rescue experiments by expressing an mRNA not targeted by the morpholino should be performed. Additional controls that would make these experiments more convincing would include morpholinos that are splice blocking, and assessing activity by RT-PCR and/or designing morpholinos that would target these genes in <italic>Astyanax</italic> but not in zebrafish, and demonstrating that they do not have the same effects when injected into zebrafish, indicating specificity of the morpholino. The ideal experiment would be to compare the effects of these morpholinos to a fish mutant for these genes. This is now possible in <italic>Astyanax</italic>, as genome editing technologies have been used in <italic>Astyanax</italic>, but is likely beyond the scope of this publication.</p><p>Third, the sleep analysis included in the paper needs to be greatly expanded to be convincing. Sleep assays were performed for one hour, and it was not specified what time of day or night, or if they were all performed at the same time of day, all of which is critical to assessing sleep. Furthermore, it is not standard, to my knowledge, to assess sleep for only an hour, and assessing sleep over at least a 24 hour period including one light and one dark cycle would be more in line with previous publications, and more convincing. Additionally, sleep assays were performed on 7 dpf embryos, presumably because the effects of morpholinos are transient. However, the authors use periods of over 60s to define sleep. This time period was defined as sleep in previous studies. However, these studies used fish that were 21-24 dpf. Is there evidence that length of sleep bouts are the same at these different stages of development? If not, determining what period of inactivity counts as sleep at 7dpf, using methods as in Duboue et al. 2011, is critical prior to assessing sleep at this stage.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors find an increase in sleep in morphant fish compared to controls. However, as they have not measured the overall activity of the fish, it is impossible to know whether their morphants have a change in sleep, or a change in overall activity, which is affecting the amount of time they are being still in the hour assessed.</p><p>Finally, they have not demonstrated that sleep is in fact different between cave and surface fish at this stage. Including surface fish in this analysis is key. As identifying changes in behavior is part of the novelty of this work, robustly assessing sleep behavior is critical to this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Alie et al. reports an interesting difference in the number of several neuropeptidergic cells in the hypothalamus between surface-dwelling (SF) vs. cave-dwelling form (CF)of <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>. More specifically cave-dwelling fish possess more NPY, Hcrt, AgRP neurons and fewer POMCa, POMCb and VP neurons. To determine the developmental pathway responsible for the difference, the authors next examined the effect of manipulating Lhx7 or Lhx9 on the development of NPY or Hcrt neurons. Since all peptidergic cell types that show differences are located in the basal plate of the hypothalamus, the authors also examined the effect of Shh or Fgf8 pathway manipulation on the development of NPY or Hcrt neurons. Lastly, they examined feeding and sleeping behavior of the Lhx9 morphants.</p><p><italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> is a powerful model organism to examine mechanisms underlying adaptation to extreme environment. I like this study for its developmental evolutionary approach and the authors attempt to place molecular evolution in a larger adaptive behavioral context. However while seeing the merit of the interesting observation they have made in the difference in the number of neuropeptidergic cells between the two forms, I fail to see how this work contributes significantly beyond this observation to provide advances in understanding either the mechanistic basis for this difference or behavioral significance of this difference.</p><p>1) The behavioral differences between SF and CF forms are striking and it would have been very interesting to learn about what mediates these behavioral differences. Locomotion, feeding and sleep are behaviors that are controlled and regulated by a large network of neurons that express different neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. I do not understand the author's logic of choosing a particular set of 9 neuropeptides, which have pleiotropic effects on many physiological process and diverse behavior. They also do not explain in the manuscript justification of their choice. To make any conclusion about &quot;evolution of a neuronal system and the adaptive behavior,&quot; their strategy of choosing a few neurons with pleiotropic effects without considering a large network involved in a particular behavior is inadequate. The author's claim concerning behavior is solely based on the phenotype of Lhx9 mutant, which shows alteration in Hcrt neuron number as well as &quot;sleep&quot; phenotype. While involvement of Hcrt neuron in sleep control is well established, is the difference in Hcrt neuron number really the cause of the sleep pattern difference in these two forms when sleep can be also affected by NPY neurons, by change in circadian rhythm, other modulatory systems, hormones that affect arousal and stress, etc.?</p><p>2) I am not convinced that the study provides significant novel insight about the mechanism behind the development of these neurons. The role of Lhx9 on the Hcrt neurons is well known and observed in both mouse and zebrafish. It is not surprising that Lhx9 plays a role in Hcrt neuron development in cave fish. The fact that Shh and Fgf8 signaling variation early in development affects neuropeptidergic patterning in the cavefish brain adds to the large amount of existing data on the role of these two molecules on the development of hypothalamic cell types, yet do not represent a major advance in our understanding of the development of hypothalamic neuropeptidergic neurons.</p><p>3) The fact that Lhx9 morphants show sleep phenotype is consistent with the literature and is completely expected.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Developmental evolution of the forebrain in cavefish, from natural variations in neuropeptides to behavior&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors still haven't addressed a main original concern – quantifying colorimetric in situ. They need to show that their method is accurate using at least a few controls in situ that are stained with both methods to show that the data is comparable and valid.</p><p>2) The authors should explain why the control morpholino (Lhx9 mm MO) fish have a higher activity level compared to control uninjected cavefish? No statistics are shown between uninjected cavefish and Lhx9 mm MO injected cavefish. Why do none of the fish have reduced activity in the dark?</p><p>3) Is the hyperactivity measure a standard measure? If so, citations should be included. What is the relationship to this number and amount of time spent sleeping and why isn't sleeping time quantified?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32808.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: […] 1) While I compliment the authors on the use of functional studies in an emerging model organism and the use of morpholino is acceptable in the absence of fully established gene editing methods, the morpholino experiments lack appropriate and necessary controls.

However, in the present case we did not measure staining intensities; we counted positively-labelled cells, which do not depend on the intensity or dynamics of HIS revelation. Therefore we believe that two replicates of the experiments are sufficient. This notion is also supported by the small inter-individual variations observed in the results of cell counts.</p><p>About the use of mean +/- SEM: we agree. We have modified the presentation of the results and now provide box plots throughout the manuscript. This novel presentation confirms reproducible results from one experiment to another (see previous point). Moreover, it also shows, as known in the <italic>Astyanax</italic> community, that cavefish show more inter-individual variability than surface fish. Despite this, clear differences between the two morphs are observable and are statistically significant (Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] However, there are a number of substantive concerns about this work that need to be addressed prior to coming to conclusions about these links.</p><p>First, the paper relies heavily on quantifying neuron populations using colormetric in situ hybridization.

This is the reason why neurons counts have been performed under the microscope (not on still pictures) while progressively changing the plane of focus and ticking each counted cell on the camera software. Moreover, neurons counts have been performed after exhaustive anatomical analyses to characterize, at each studied stage, the exact localization of each neuronal cluster, by comparing lateral and ventral views, and by localizing each cluster with respect to anatomical landmarks such as ventricles or commissures or neuroepithelial shapes. Finally it should be noted that in several simple cases where only one cluster was present, there was absolutely no ambiguity on the counts. This way, we are certain that neuronal clusters have been accurately quantified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Quantifications would be more convincing if they were performed on three dimensional images that did not rely on identifying precisely the same field of view and depth in each embryo.

The amount of work and time analysis using fluorescent in situs would have been even greater, therefore we choose colorimetric in situs. However, as now shown in Supplemental material in one specific example for Hcrt cells at 24hpf, the cell counts using the two types of revelation are exactly the same, and the variability is even lower with colorimetric in situ. Moreover, it should be noted that we did use fluorescent in situ in other parts of the manuscript, when needed and when appropriate, for example for interpreting the respective positions of different peptidergic clusters after double fluorescent staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, linking gene expression during development to different numbers of cells of a certain type and to behavior relies on morpholino experiments.

Additional controls that would make these experiments more convincing would include morpholinos that are splice blocking, and assessing activity by RT-PCR and/or designing morpholinos that would target these genes in Astyanax but not in zebrafish, and demonstrating that they do not have the same effects when injected into zebrafish, indicating specificity of the morpholino. The ideal experiment would be to compare the effects of these morpholinos to a fish mutant for these genes. This is now possible in Astyanax, as genome editing technologies have been used in Astyanax, but is likely beyond the scope of this publication.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We have now performed the additional requested splice morpholino experiments, for both Lhx7 and Lhx9 knock-downs. In both cases, the PCR controls were conclusive. And for both genes, effects on numbers of neuropeptidergic neurons were found, confirming the effects previously found with ATG and 5’UTR morpholinos, and reinforcing the demonstration of the function of Lhx7 and Lhx9 in NPY and Hcrt neuron specification, respectively.</p><p>Moreover and conversely, novel Lhx7 and Lhx9 overexpression experiments by mRNA injection produce the opposite effects, i.e., an increase in the number of NPY and Hcrt cells, respectively. Finally, mRNA co-injection rescued the morpholino phenotypes, confirming the specificity of observed effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the sleep analysis included in the paper needs to be greatly expanded to be convincing. Sleep assays were performed for one hour, and it was not specified what time of day or night, or if they were all performed at the same time of day, all of which is critical to assessing sleep. Furthermore, it is not standard, to my knowledge, to assess sleep for only an hour, and assessing sleep over at least a 24 hour period including one light and one dark cycle would be more in line with previous publications, and more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Done, we have now performed assays on 24 hour cycles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, sleep assays were performed on 7 dpf embryos, presumably because the effects of morpholinos are transient. However, the authors use periods of over 60s to define sleep. This time period was defined as sleep in previous studies. However, these studies used fish that were 21-24 dpf. Is there evidence that length of sleep bouts are the same at these different stages of development? If not, determining what period of inactivity counts as sleep at 7dpf, using methods as in Duboue et al. 2011, is critical prior to assessing sleep at this stage. Furthermore, the authors find an increase in sleep in morphant fish compared to controls. However, as they have not measured the overall activity of the fish, it is impossible to know whether their morphants have a change in sleep, or a change in overall activity, which is affecting the amount of time they are being still in the hour assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We have now performed completely new series of experiments. We now provide locomotion/activity assays and analyses on 24 hours cycles. In addition, we now provide comparisons including surface fish, cavefish, Lhx9 morphant cavefish, and control cavefish. The results show that the difference between surface fish and cavefish in very similar in 7dpf larvae and in 21dpf larvae, allowing us to use the same criteria as in previously published papers. Please see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and corresponding text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, they have not demonstrated that sleep is in fact different between cave and surface fish at this stage. Including surface fish in this analysis is key. As identifying changes in behavior is part of the novelty of this work, robustly assessing sleep behavior is critical to this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Done, we have now included surface fish in the additional experiments, which are compared to Lhx9 morphant cavefish, control mismatch MO cavefish, and un-injected cavefish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] However while seeing the merit of the interesting observation they have made in the difference in the number of neuropeptidergic cells between the two forms, I fail to see how this work contributes significantly beyond this observation to provide advances in understanding either the mechanistic basis for this difference or behavioral significance of this difference.</p><p>1) The behavioral differences between SF and CF forms are striking and it would have been very interesting to learn about what mediates these behavioral differences. Locomotion, feeding and sleep are behaviors that are controlled and regulated by a large network of neurons that express different neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. I do not understand the author's logic of choosing a particular set of 9 neuropeptides, which have pleiotropic effects on many physiological process and diverse behavior. They also do not explain in the manuscript justification of their choice. To make any conclusion about &quot;evolution of a neuronal system and the adaptive behavior,&quot; their strategy of choosing a few neurons with pleiotropic effects without considering a large network involved in a particular behavior is inadequate. The author's claim concerning behavior is solely based on the phenotype of Lhx9 mutant, which shows alteration in Hcrt neuron number as well as &quot;sleep&quot; phenotype. While involvement of Hcrt neuron in sleep control is well established, is the difference in Hcrt neuron number really the cause of the sleep pattern difference in these two forms when sleep can be also affected by NPY neurons, by change in circadian rhythm, other modulatory systems, hormones that affect arousal and stress, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>I am sorry but I don’t really follow the reviewer’s reasoning or what he/she would prefer as an approach for our study. On one hand he/she says that feeding or sleep behaviors are regulated by large networks of neurons expressing multiple neurotransmitters; and on the other hand, he/she says that involvement of Hcrt neurons (i.e. on cell group, one neurotransmitter) in sleep control is well established.</p><p>Our approach was through the window of the developmental evolution of the basal forebrain and its fine neuronal anatomy. We have first studied a large set of 9 neuropeptidergic cell types, and then, according to the results of the comparative developmental neuroanatomy, we have focused on 2 specific neurotransmission systems that we thought were relevant to the known behavioral phenotypes of cavefish. And indeed, through manipulation of the development of this neuronal cluster, we also affect the “candidate” sleep behavior. The originality of this work is that it is performed in an evolutionary context. Of course we do not claim that we have discovered a role for Hcrt in sleep regulation. We propose a developmental mechanism at work in a “natural mutant”, to explain the evolution of its anatomy and related behavior. Our results on the role of Lhx9/Hcrt hold true without having to rule out an influence of other factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am not convinced that the study provides significant novel insight about the mechanism behind the development of these neurons. The role of Lhx9 on the Hcrt neurons is well known and observed in both mouse and zebrafish. It is not surprising that Lhx9 plays a role in Hcrt neuron development in cave fish. The fact that Shh and Fgf8 signaling variation early in development affects neuropeptidergic patterning in the cavefish brain adds to the large amount of existing data on the role of these two molecules on the development of hypothalamic cell types, yet do not represent a major advance in our understanding of the development of hypothalamic neuropeptidergic neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree that Lhx9/Hcrt is not novel, we want to emphasize that Lhx7/NPY link is completely novel and an original finding of our study. In the cover letter, we wrote: We are aware that our study does not cover the exact detailed mechanisms by which developmental variations in hypothalamic networks are achieved (receptors involved, signaling pathways, transcriptional mechanisms…), but we believe that these issues should rather be studied in model organisms like zebrafish for which powerful genetic tools are available.</p><p>Finally and again, the novelty of our findings comes from the implication of the studied developmental pathways and genes in the <italic>evolution</italic> of the brain, not from their functional role in the development of this or that neuronal type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The fact that Lhx9 morphants show sleep phenotype is consistent with the literature and is completely expected.</p></disp-quote><p>Cavefish morphants for Lhx9 do not exactly show a “sleep phenotype”, they rather have a rescued sleep phenotype: they sleep more than normal cavefish, in a comparable manner to what surface fish do.</p><p>Yes, knocking-down Lhx9 was expected from the literature to modify sleep. The originality of the work is that by manipulating this developmental pathway, we rescue an evolutionary phenotype, which is the best we can achieve from the evo-devo perspective. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first or one of the first to accomplish this goal and to fill the gap in a functional evo-devo perspective.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors still haven't addressed a main original concern – quantifying colorimetric in situ. They need to show that their method is accurate using at least a few controls in situ that are stained with both methods to show that the data is comparable and valid.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry but we believe we have provided such controls, which are indeed important, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. This figure shows comparison of colorimetric versus fluorescent in situ labeling for Hcrt at 24hpf, in SF and CF (chosen because Hcrt/24hpf is probably one of the most important neuropeptide and stage in our story). It clearly demonstrates that cell counts are identical for a given morph with the two methods, and that the difference between the two morphs is also detectable and identical with the two methods. To further convince the reviewer on the quantification method, we now provide additional “videos” to travel through stacks of photographs that were used to count the cells in the depth of the brain. This shows that the quantification was accurate, as the reproducibility of the results from one experiment to another also attests.</p><p>If the reviewer is asking for double labeling (colorimetric + fluorescent) on the same sample, then it is simply not possible to provide this: the purple precipitate of the colorimetric in situ would mask the fluorescent signal of the fluorescent in situ, and thus prevent any correct counting of the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should explain why the control morpholino (Lhx9 mm MO) fish have a higher activity level compared to control uninjected cavefish? No statistics are shown between uninjected cavefish and Lhx9 mm MO injected cavefish.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the Lhx9 mm MO curves and values are slightly higher than the control un-injected CF, but the differences are statistically non-significant (ANOVA and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests, performed exactly in the same way as for comparisons between other conditions). That is the reason why “no statistics” were shown. All tests have been redone to write this response, and confirmed the absence of significance between the two conditions. To clarify this on the graphs, we have now added “ns” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why do none of the fish have reduced activity in the dark?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an intriguing question, but we have no answer to this. However, it should be noted that the activity curves provided in our manuscript are representative and consistent with previous publications on locomotor activity in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>. For example, please check Figure 1AB of Yoshizawa et al. BMC Biology (2015), showing locomotor activity in SF and CF adults. The 24h curves are “identical” to our curves on larvae. The curves look so flat that the authors did not even bother to quantify locomotion during day versus night, and they pooled activity over 24 hours periods.</p><p>Moreover, we have unpublished data in the lab, on other projects, confirming the representativeness of the curves provided in the present manuscript at larval and juvenile stages.</p><p>Because this is an intriguing aspect, we have now added a sentence: “Of note and as reported also for adults [Yoshizawa et al., 2015], the locomotion did not vary significantly according to the day /night periods”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is the hyperactivity measure a standard measure? If so, citations should be included. What is the relationship to this number and amount of time spent sleeping and why isn't sleeping time quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>(We assume there is a typo in the question and the reviewer wanted to write “hypoactivity” instead of hyperactivity).</p><p>Sleeping time was not quantified because this would have implied a real study on sleep in <italic>Astyanax</italic> 7dpf larvae, which we believe is out of the scope of this paper, and for which we do not have the equipment and facility to perform the necessary experiments. This is the reason why we have focused exclusively on locomotor activity in the Results section. In the Discussion as well, we have now re-written the paragraph discussing this aspect, to avoid any over interpretation of the data:</p><p>“Hcrt in the hypothalamus has a conserved role in the regulation of locomotion and sleep [Elipot et al., 2014]. […] Other neurotransmitters might play a role as well: noradrenalin, whose brain levels are higher in Pachón CF than in SF [66], also regulates sleep in CF [Prober et al., 2006].”</p><p>Concerning “hypoactivity”, as explained in Materials and methods, low activity was defined as follows: “Average and minimum speed (mm/sec) were calculated on 10 minutes bouts in CF to set a threshold speed (2 times the minimum speed). Values under this threshold were considered as states of low-activity.” Hypoactivity is defined in the zebrafish catalog of behaviors (Towards a Comprehensive Catalog of Zebrafish Behavior 1.0 and Beyond; Kalueff et al. 2013, Zebrafish). As an example, Mathuru et al., studying behavioral responses to odorant molecules (Current Biology, 2012) used this parameter, defined and calculated similarly to the present paper (“…episodes were defined as episodes greater than one second in duration during which the swim speed never exceeded half the mean baseline speed”). Citations are now included.</p><p>Because we did not analyze sleep per se, we had used this parameter as a proxy of the fish “resting time”. It appears to be inversely correlated to locomotion in the different experimental conditions (SF, CF, Lhx9 MO and mmMO), and the important point is that for this parameter also, the Lhx9 CF morphants behave the same way as the SF, implying a role for the Hcrt neurons.</p><p>We hope the reviewer will be satisfied by these changes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
