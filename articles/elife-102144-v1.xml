optical sectioning with increased image contrast. However, 3D-SIM has not been widely applied to imaging deep in thick tissues due to its sensitivity to sample-induced aberrations, making the method difficult to apply beyond 10 µm in depth. Furthermore, 3D-SIM has not been available in an upright configuration, limiting its use for live imaging while manipulating the specimen, for example, with electrophysiology. Here, we have overcome these barriers by developing a novel upright 3D-SIM system (termed Deep3DSIM) that incorporates adaptive optics for aberration correction and remote focusing, reducing artefacts, improving contrast, restoring resolution, and eliminating the need to move the specimen or the objective lens in volume imaging. These advantages are equally applicable to inverted 3D-SIM systems. We demonstrate high-quality 3D-SIM imaging in various samples, including imaging more than 130 µm into the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group

One of these approaches is 3D-SIM, which features twofold increased resolution in each spatial direction and enables fast imaging with optical sectioning for enhanced contrast. 3D-SIM recovers missing high spatial frequency information by illuminating the specimen with a fine sinusoidal pattern and computationally reconstructing an image with twice the resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gustafsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schermelleh et al., 2008</xref>). 3D-SIM has gained increasing popularity, not least due to its compatibility with standard fluorophores and labelling protocols commonly used in widefield or confocal microscopy.</p><p> Over the past decade, several off-the-shelf 3D-SIM instruments have become commercially available and successfully used for various biological applications. For example, the OMX, based on the original design by John Sedat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobbie et al., 2011</xref>), as well as a bespoke implementation for correlative 3D soft X-ray cryo-imaging on a synchrotron beamline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kounatidis et al., 2020</xref>). However, they all share similar limitations that restrict their usage to thin specimens on inverted setups. Optical aberrations are one of the main contributors to reconstruction artefacts in 3D-SIM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demmerle et al., 2017</xref>). These include spherical aberrations induced by refractive index (RI) mismatches between the immersion media, mounting media, and sample, as well as sample-induced aberrations caused by RI inhomogeneities within the sample itself. The effect of these optical aberrations increases with imaging depth, making it difficult to obtain good 3D-SIM images at a depth greater than around 10 µm. It is also difficult to capture good images over larger z-ranges in most specimens when using oil-immersion objective lenses with high numerical aperture (NA) and limited working distance. Silicone oil and water immersion, or water-dipping, objective lenses, with lower NA, have longer working distances and reduced spherical aberration because of the better match to the RI of biological tissues. Currently, there are no upright off-the-shelf 3D-SIM systems that use water-dipping objective lenses, because such lenses are intended for imaging at depths far greater than 10 µm and because building 3D-SIM optics in an upright configuration presents complex engineering challenges. However, upright microscopy is essential for certain biological experiments, so 3D-SIM has not been applied to a variety of biological questions. For example, live imaging without a cover slip and with access to the sample for manipulations, such as microinjection and electrophysiology, has not been done with 3D-SIM.</p><p> One way to overcome the limitations described above is to incorporate adaptive optics (AO), using a deformable mirror (DM) in the optical path of a 3D-SIM system. AO works by changing the shape of the light’s wavefronts, which are surfaces formed by points of equal phase, as the light wave propagates through space. AO can enable the correction of spherical and sample-induced aberrations and allow the rapid movement of the focus axially for volume imaging in a purely optical way (remote focusing), without the need to move the specimen or the objective lens. These functionalities have been described as prototype methods for widefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kam et al., 2007</xref>), 3D-SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Žurauskas et al., 2019</xref>), and multiphoton imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Žurauskas et al., 2017</xref>). However, no off-the-shelf 3D-SIM instruments are designed to allow the inclusion of AO. Moreover, AO hardware and software controls are currently not available as simple modules that can be added to the optical path of commercial systems. While some exciting bespoke-built AO-SIM systems have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Turcotte et al., 2019</xref>), these proof-of-principle prototypes use AO for aberration correction only, and they are not suitable for applications requiring an upright optical configuration with multiple channels. To our knowledge, although DM-driven remote focusing has been used in simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kner et al., 2011</xref>) and confocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poland et al., 2008</xref>) or multiphoton imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Žurauskas et al., 2017</xref>), it has not been implemented in any 3D-SIM systems. Image scanning methods have been developed to enhance the spatial resolution in imaging of thick samples using multi-point scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">York et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">York et al., 2012</xref>), multiphoton excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingaramo et al., 2014</xref>), or AO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). These methods use physical or digital pinholes together with photon reassignment to improve the resolution by a factor of <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$\sqrt{2}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> or greater when applying deconvolution. 3D-SIM achieves higher resolution, but manages out-of-focus background less efficiently than image scanning methods. The main reasons for this are the retention of the shot noise of the background light after reconstruction, and the reduced modulation contrast of the structured illumination (SI), potentially leading to reconstruction artefacts. These problems are compounded by depth and fluorescence density.</p><p> Here, we describe our bespoke upright Deep3DSIM prototype system with integrated AO, enabling deep imaging in live wholemount biological specimens with direct access for their manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The system is based around a 60×/1.1 NA water-immersion objective lens, with a correction collar that allows its use in a water-dipping configuration without a cover slip. We demonstrate high-quality 3D-SIM with nearly twofold spatial resolution extension in three dimensions at wide depths from a few micrometres to 130 µm. We use AO not only for sample-induced aberration correction in deep tissue imaging but also for remote focusing. The latter enables fast transitions of the imaging plane and prevents pressure waves caused by the motion, along the optical axis, of the specimen or the objective lens. Our novel approach and instrument design enable simultaneous multichannel imaging in conventional and super-resolution modes. The control of Deep3DSIM is based on our previously published user-friendly open-source Python software named Cockpit (see Methods and materials), controlling the high-performance hardware devices required for 3D-SIM, while achieving highly accurate and precise timing at fast rates. We first test the system’s performance using beads and cells in culture. We then apply the full range of novel imaging modalities available on Deep3DSIM to a wide range of specimen types, from mammalian tissue culture cells to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains and embryos. Finally, although our use of AO for aberration correction and remote focusing is demonstrated on an upright microscope, the principles we have established could be applied equally to an inverted 3D-SIM system. Use of AO on an inverted system, like on an upright one, would provide considerably extended depth of imaging and rapid acquisition of 3D volumes without moving the specimen or the objective lens.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simplified overview of the Deep3DSIM setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Optical arrangement of Deep3DSIM and the conceptual use of micromanipulators for applications such as microinjection and electrophysiology. The excitation light hits the spatial light modulator (SLM), which is conjugated to the object/image plane, and then reflects off a deformable mirror (DM) before being focused on the sample with an objective lens. In the imaging path, the reflected fluorescence is coupled off via a dichroic beam splitter and then collected by separate cameras for each channel. (<bold>B</bold>) Different imaging modes are enabled in parallel on Deep3DSIM. Deep imaging without adaptive optics (AO) usually leads to an aberrated point spread function (PSF) due to refractive index (RI) mismatch and sample inhomogeneity.

Combination of AO and remote focusing produces aberration-corrected imaging at different depths, without mechanical movement. (<bold>C</bold>) Deep3DSIM is controlled by Cockpit, which consists of three packages: python-microscope is responsible for the control of all hardware devices; microscope-cockpit provides a user-friendly GUI; microscope-aotools provides the AO functionality.

We used the objective lens in a water-immersion configuration, imaging through the cover slip, to make the assessment comparable to common experimental routines. We found the resolution of Deep3DSIM to be a little lower than double that of widefield. 3D images of the beads were used to estimate the point spread function (PSF) of the system in widefield (WF) and 3D-SIM modalities. The PSF provides a complete characterisation of the optical system. We fitted the intensities of these images to Gaussian curves, both laterally and axially, and then used the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian curves to estimate the lateral and the axial resolution. We repeated these calculations for multiple beads for each modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The mean lateral resolution was 185 nm (standard deviation (SD) of 13 nm) for 3D-SIM and 333 nm (SD = 9 nm) for widefield, whereas the mean axial resolution was 547 nm (SD = 34 nm) and 893 nm (SD = 41 nm), respectively. We found that Deep3DSIM produced a resolution improvement that approaches but does not quite reach the theoretically possible doubling of the widefield resolution. This limitation is partly due to our choice of conservative line widths for the SI patterns (see Appendix 1 for details).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Resolution estimations of the Deep3DSIM system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full width at half-maximum (FWHM) measurements of 100 nm green fluorescent beads, deposited on a glass cover slip and imaged in water-immersion configuration.

Such minor aberrations are often overlooked in conventional microscopy modalities such as widefield and confocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang and Zhang, 2021</xref>). Therefore, in addition to the FWHM measurements of beads, we also estimated the resolution enhancement by 3D-SIM in mammalian tissue culture COS-7 cells in two channels. We used immunofluorescence to label microtubules with an antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor (AF) 488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left) and, in another example, endoplasmic reticulum labelled with antibodies against Rtn4 and conjugated to AF 555 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right). Both structures consist of tubules that are below the diffraction limit and the resolving power of the objective lens, which makes them highly suitable for testing the performance of super-resolution microscopy. We compared the 3D-SIM images to their pseudo-widefield (PWF) equivalents, which were obtained using SIMcheck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ball et al., 2015</xref>) by averaging the raw SI images. Compared to the corresponding PWF images, the optical sectioning capability of 3D-SIM was easily noticeable by the large difference in out-of-focus signal, especially in the cross-section views. We estimated the resolution with analysis in frequency space by finding the support of the optical transfer function (OTF). The OTF is the Fourier transform of the PSF, and, just like it, it provides a model of the optical system. We used the contours of the OTF support (dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as estimations of the resolution. In the green channel, the resolutions were 356 nm and 190 nm laterally, and 1009 nm and 568 nm axially, respectively for PWF and 3D-SIM. These resolution values were close to, and agreed with, the FWHM values measured from beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The performance of the system in the red channel was similar, but the spatial frequency response was attenuated because of the longer wavelength. Here, the resolution values estimated from the power plots in PWF and SIM modes were 386 nm and 213 nm laterally, and 1276 nm and 644 nm axially, respectively. We performed a similar analysis for most of the subsequent experiments (supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Adaptive optics (AO) correction removes artefacts and improves the contrast and resolution of 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) in tissue imaging.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) 3D-SIM images of neuromuscular junction in a fixed L3 <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva expressing Nrx-IV::GFP (green) and membrane labelled with anti-HRP antibodies (magenta) acquired without (<bold>A</bold>) and with AO (<bold>B</bold>), respectively.

Deep3DSIM is particularly suitable for tissue-based imaging while manipulating the specimen with methods such as electrophysiology. We evaluated these unique features of the instrument by imaging the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a sample well suited for electrophysiological experiments. For convenience, we prepared fixed NMJ preparations by dissecting open the larvae, removing the guts, and pinning out the muscle layer with its associated motor neuron system to produce a so-called NMJ fillet preparation. These kinds of samples typically exhibit a substantial amount of RI inhomogeneity and mismatch, and they often require imaging deep into the specimen to examine specific sites of muscle innervation. These conditions led to a significant amount of optical aberrations, further emphasised by our use of a glycerol-based mounting medium (Vectashield). We used 3D-SIM with AO to image the dissected larva fillet preparation from a transgenic line expressing a bright GFP protein trap of the cell-cell ‘septate’ junction protein Neurexin IV (Nrx-IV), at a depth of 5–15 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our implementation of the AO did not use a dedicated wavefront sensor, instead relying on an indirect sensorless approach. We used a bypass (BP) mode as control, to compare between imaging with or without AO, where we switched the DM for a flat mirror. The images of the AO-corrected volume showed significant improvements in both intensity and contrast, compared to the images of the uncorrected volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The improvement was especially noticeable between the XZ views, as the major effect of aberrations is to distort the PSF along the optical axis. This was most notable for spherical aberrations, which elongate the focus along the optical axis.</p><p> To further test the microscope’s performance at greater depth, we imaged, dissected, and subsequently formaldehyde-fixed whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains. We imaged both the top and bottom layers of the thickest part of the brain lobes, mounted between a standard microscope cover slip (#1.5) and a slide, providing a total imaging depth of ~130 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To help visualise the effects of aberrations and to evaluate the ability of AO to correct them at depth, we placed 100 nm diameter red fluorescent beads (580/605 nm) on the glass slide underneath the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We acquired two image stacks centred on two sites – one proximal site ~3 μm away from the cover slip and another distal site ~130 μm away from it, which required focusing through the entire volume of the mounted brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The larvae used to prepare the samples came from a fly line with a YFP protein trap for <italic>canoe</italic> (<italic>cno</italic>), which encodes a protein that is expressed in the adherens junctions of the monolayer of neuroepithelial stem cells in the outer proliferation centres in the optic lobes. The protein expression marked the outlines of the cells and showed the characteristic geometrical mosaic pattern that emerges from the packing of epithelial cells, covering large parts of each brain lobe and thus providing a well-defined structure that could be imaged at various depths. We found that AO aberration correction made a small but distinct improvement to the contrast in the images of the proximal side of the brain lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). On the distal side, control images bypassing the AO suffered from severe aberration-induced reconstruction artefacts, with the cell outlines not observed as continuous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left). In contrast, imaging at the same depth with AO correction enabled 3D-SIM reconstructions to produce clearer 3D images with reduced artefacts and enhanced contrast. Large areas of the cell outlines could be visualised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right). The effect of aberrations and their correction is most evident in the red channel, where the images of the individual beads closely mimic the shape of the system’s PSF, while the equivalent images without AO result in large unrecognizable fuzzy patches, instead of sharp spots. While the AO corrected images from the distal site showed minor residual aberrations (see Discussion for details) and reconstruction artefacts (see Methods and materials for further information), the overall PSF shapes were still dramatically improved with AO compared to the equivalent without AO. Moreover, the peak intensity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with AO are also significantly higher than the results without AO, and the lateral FWHM resolution is preserved even at this depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>A key feature of Deep3DSIM is the ability to perform remote focusing. On the other hand, the reconstruction process of 3D-SIM is very stringent about the image quality and the image acquisition parameters, such as the accuracy and precision of Z steps in the acquisition of Z-stacks. Therefore, we wanted to show that remote focusing can meet the strict requirements of 3D-SIM reconstruction, and that the remote focusing can be used as a direct replacement of a mechanical Z stage over a moderate range. We demonstrate this with two examples, starting first with live imaging. Living specimens already present several challenges for 3D-SIM imaging on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Particularly important are the acquisition speed, which can lead to motion artefacts if not sufficiently high, and photobleaching and phototoxicity, which occur when the rate of exposure and the intensity of the excitation light are too high. The Deep3DSIM approach has the potential to resolve both these challenges by using remote focusing for fast image acquisition while preserving the high image quality of the system. To show this, we imaged <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos undergoing rapid mitosis, where each division cycle lasts just a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We collected eggs from transgenic animals expressing the microtubule-binding protein Jupiter fused to GFP and the histone H2A proteins fused to RFP. The Jupiter::GFP H2A::RFP eggs were dechorionated and mounted in aqueous solution in order to image chromosomes and microtubules simultaneously, during mitotic division in the early syncytial blastoderm stages. Using the objective lens in a water-dipping configuration, we applied our remote focusing to repeatedly acquire two-colour image volumes at a depth of approximately 5 μm under the surface of the egg. We performed this imaging at a rate of 20 fps, equivalent to about 10 s per 3D volume, at room temperature for several minutes. The image stack of each volume required 210 raw images (5 phases × 3 angles × 2 channels × 7 sections) for the 3D-SIM reconstruction. We selected four time points within the first two minutes of the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), showing the synchronous transition from metaphase to telophase. Despite minor reconstruction artefacts (see Methods and materials for details), these results demonstrate that the remote focusing functionality of the system can be successfully applied for live 3D-SIM experiments, allowing four-dimensional acquisition while keeping the specimen stationary, thus avoiding the usual agitation and perturbations associated with mechanical actuation.</p><p>In the second example, where we applied remote focusing, we combined it with an advanced form of aberration correction. Thick biological samples, even adherent cells in culture, can induce optical aberrations of variable type and magnitude throughout the volume of the sample, owing to RI inhomogeneities. Aberration correction methods can be used to correct the aberrations in every imaging plane in the volume. However, this is a time-consuming process which can lead to unnecessary photobleaching and phototoxicity. A faster method is to perform the correction routine at fewer planes and then to estimate the correction modes for all other planes, an approach that we called ‘multi-position aberration correction (MPAC).’ We demonstrate MPAC in its simplest form, a linear estimation of two planes, which we found to work well, partially because some of the dominant aberrations, like spherical, are proportional to the imaging depth. By combining MPAC with remote focusing, we were able to demonstrate the full capability of Deep3DSIM’s AO, as well as a large Z range of more than 16 μm (129 sections, 125 nm apart). We imaged fixed COS-7 cells in culture, stained for microtubules, to visualise the spindles during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). We measured the aberrations at two distinct positions, marked with arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, and then we estimated the corrections at different Z positions within the volume. Our results show conclusively that remote focusing with MPAC produced images with improved resolution compared to those without AO. Our method improved both the lateral and axial resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and intensity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We conclude that the use of MPAC-based estimation, to correct aberrations for an entire imaging volume, and the use of remote focusing offer significant advantages to 3D-SIM imaging with an upright configuration.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated that the design of Deep3DSIM, a prototype upright super-resolution microscope with integrated AO, enables effective 3D super-resolution imaging within thick complex tissues to a depth of at least 130 µm. Its modular design and Python-based open-source software for both system control and GUI (see details in Methods and materials), make it comparatively user-friendly and versatile. These design concepts allow the adaptation of the instrument to suit specific research applications and enable protocols for experiments at scale. The upright optical design combined with aberration correction and remote focusing makes the instrument particularly suited for applications that require super-resolution volumetric imaging of live (or fixed) thick tissue, organs, or whole organisms. Deep3DSIM is also uniquely positioned for the imaging of the whole sample in expansion microscopy, without the need for mechanical sectioning, which is a challenge because of the softness and fragility of commonly used hydrogel techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahoon et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the design is compatible with specimen manipulation, such as microinjection, carrying out electrophysiology measurements, or liquid handling and exchange, while imaging experiments are in progress. In this study, we have established a new paradigm for 3D-SIM to be applied at depth while acquiring volumes without moving the specimen or the objective lens, and while varying the aberration corrections across the acquired volume, in a depth-specific manner. This general principle can now be applied to any SIM configuration, including an inverted one, which can make use of the highest possible NA objective lenses to obtain volumetric SIM datasets at depth with minimal artefacts and maximum possible spatial resolution.</p><p> Current commercially available 3D-SIM instruments are mostly based around inverted setups and high NA oil immersion objectives that are susceptible to aberrations when focusing into any specimens with RI mismatch. Such systems frequently only produce good images up to depths of a few µm. Silicone immersion objectives can improve the situation by allowing high-quality SIM up to a depth of 20 µm, despite having a slightly lower NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ogushi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richter et al., 2019</xref>). In all cases, objective correction collars can only effectively minimise spherical aberrations for SIM imaging at a single depth in a single channel. For multi-colour imaging, the RI of the mounting medium and the immersion medium, and the objective lens’ correction collar setting, must be carefully tuned together to match the optimal wavelength-specific OTFs. Frequently, a compromise is made across different channels and imaging depths to accommodate multiple colours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demmerle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, for most practical purposes, these microscopes can only effectively be applied to thin single layers of tissue culture cells on microscope slides or only to the superficial surface of complex tissues. Furthermore, they are not readily adapted to imaging regimes which require the specimen and the objective to remain motionless while imaging. Hence, Deep3DSIM fills an important application gap for deep imaging in live multi-cellular tissue, as well as fixed material. The method creates new possibilities for fast live super-resolution imaging while carrying out specimen manipulations. Such manipulations include micro-injection into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and electrophysiology measurements on living mouse brain sections or <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ preparations.</p><p> An important consideration in 3D-SIM reconstruction is the precise settings of the algorithms, such as filtering. We chose to use a well-established reconstruction method based on Wiener filtering, as implemented in the softWoRx software suite, without advanced pre-processing of the image data for reduction of artefacts. This design decision enabled us to demonstrate the operating principles of Deep3DSIM and to adopt existing tools, such as SIMcheck for quality control of the raw and reconstructed data, and the overall characterisation of the imaging system. However, recently, several novel methods for 3D-SIM reconstruction have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2023</xref>). Such open-source software implementations should be compatible with Deep3DSIM, potentially achieving higher fidelity reconstructed data with reduced artefacts.</p><p>The resolution achieved with Deep3DSIM was 186 nm FWHM in the green channel using a water-based objective lens with an NA of 1.1. In comparison, inverted commercial 3D-SIM instruments routinely achieve ~120 nm FWHM resolution at the same wavelength using a high-NA oil immersion objective. While the Deep3DSIM resolution is, therefore, lower in absolute terms, this was a design trade-off chosen to make the microscope compatible with live imaging in an upright configuration and with a large working distance. Hence, it is more pertinent to compare the super-resolution of Deep3DSIM to that achievable for live cell imaging in widefield mode, at the same wavelength and with the same 1.1 NA water-based objective lens, which was 333 nm FWHM. Nevertheless, the fundamental design of Deep3DSIM could be readily adapted, if necessary, to work in upright or inverted mode with other high NA objective lenses. For example, oil or silicone immersion objective lenses, which would still fully benefit from the use of AO for aberration correction and motionless deep imaging. In these cases, the working distance would be compromised, making it much more difficult to manipulate the sample, for example, by microinjection or with electrophysiology tools. Although the design of Deep3DSIM was mostly optimised for upright microscopy with tissue specimens, it can also benefit other types of microscopy and applications. Notably, CryoSIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kounatidis et al., 2020</xref>) would hugely benefit from the inclusion of AO to correct for spherical aberrations induced by increased RI mismatch and instabilities at cryogenic temperatures, together with sample-induced aberration, particularly with non-flat overlying ice at the specimen-air interface.</p><p>Our AO methods provide only one average correction for the entire field of view (FoV). However, aberrations can differ across the FoV, and areas of higher image metric may bias the correction to better correct the aberrations contained within those areas. In practice, we found that field-dependent aberrations are usually not a problem for modest FoVs, such as the one in Deep3DSIM with a maximum diameter of about 96 μm. Nevertheless, we did experience residual aberrations when we imaged through the complex tissue of an entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain, approximately 130 μm deep, as measured with beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Zonal aberration correction can help with the compensation of field-dependent aberrations by splitting the FoV into multiple zones and then correcting for aberrations zone by zone, but it requires another level of instrumentation and control methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rajaeipour et al., 2020</xref>). Although the current Deep3DSIM design is not intended for this type of correction, it could be added to the instrument if required. Furthermore, the spatial light modulator (SLM), used for the generation of the SI, could also be used to compensate for field-dependent aberrations of the SI in the imaging plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gong and Scherer, 2023</xref>), in addition to the correction already provided by the DM.</p><p>The range of remote focusing shown in this work was limited to about ±8 µm, which is smaller than some previous demonstrations. There are two reasons why we did not use wider ranges in our results. First, the DM can only reliably produce PSFs with minimal aberration repeatedly up to a range of about ±10 µm (see Appendix 2). Second, for 3D-SIM acquisition, ±5 µm is already a wide and commonly used Z range. Especially in multi-colour imaging, a rather large number of images, about 1200 frames (3 angles × 5 phases × 80 Z steps) per channel, would be required. While larger volume acquisition is possible, it would lead to considerable photobleaching and phototoxicity, as well as longer acquisition and reconstruction times. Nevertheless, a similar DM device has been used to achieve an impressive range of remote focusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2021</xref>). Although their approach is different from the high-NA super-resolution imaging presented here, a stable DM should increase the practical range of our remote focusing approach twofold or even greater. In terms of speed, refocusing with the DM instead of using the piezo stage reduced the duration of the image acquisition significantly, because the settling time of the surface of the DM was around an order of magnitude faster than the settling time of the piezo stage, which highlights the potential of AO-based refocusing for fast imaging (see Appendix 3 for further details).</p><p> There are various routes through which the system performance could be enhanced in future versions of Deep3DSIM. First, the speed of acquisition in the reported demonstration was limited by a few key system components, which could be improved in future developments. A key limiting factor in widefield mode was the EM-CCD camera. The best overall performance in terms of SI modulation was achieved when using conventional CCD modes. However, due to the data transfer time (3 MHz pixel readout rate), the frame rate was limited to about 100 fps for a reasonably sized FoV. This acquisition speed could be increased by using modern sCMOS cameras. In addition, in SIM experiments, the imaging speed was also limited by the update rate of the SLM, determined by the settling time of the nematic liquid crystal technology (&gt;20 ms), giving a maximum frame rate of 50 fps raw data. Fast SLMs using ferroelectric liquid crystal materials have been demonstrated in SIM for high-speed SIM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2021</xref>), though it is more challenging to use such SLMs for multi-colour imaging, as the phase modulation is binary and hence can only be optimised for discrete wavelengths. Third, future improvements could also include the incorporation of denoising algorithms into the reconstruction process to allow lower light dosage, which would enable faster imaging, reduced photobleaching, and reduced specimen photodamage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, the Deep3DSIM prototype was custom-built on a large optical table, instead of basing the design around a commercial upright microscope stand, because the latter would have imposed unnecessary restrictions at this prototyping stage. In future, the optical path of Deep3DSIM could be simplified and reduced in size. Such a future design would make it easier to adopt or commercialise and to modify Deep3DSIM for bespoke applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microscope</title><p>We based the Deep3DSIM system on our previous system, Cryo-SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Phillips et al., 2020</xref>), which was developed from earlier work in John Sedat’s group at UCSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobbie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gustafsson et al., 2008</xref>). The microscope body was built in an upright configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) around a bespoke-engineered scaffolding arch, which we designed to ensure sufficient mechanical stability for super-resolution microscopy while accommodating a pair of micromanipulators for electrophysiological experiments. We used a water-immersion objective lens (Olympus LUMFLN60XW), capable of working in a water-dipping configuration by adjusting a correction collar, because its combination of high NA and long working distance made it most suitable for deep imaging of tissues, particularly <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain and NMJ, and for electrophysiological experiments. More details about the optical setup can be found in Appendix 4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Structured illumination</title><p>We used a nematic liquid-crystal SLM (Boulder Nonlinear Systems HSP512-488-800) to create SI with optimal contrast on the sample (modulation contrast). The SLM was positioned in the sample-conjugated plane and linear sinusoidal patterns were generated for three orientation angles. The ±1<sup>st</sup> order and zero-order beams were used to interfere at the sample plane to generate the 3D SI. To achieve optimal interference contrast, the linear polarisation of the excitation beam from the SLM was rotated using a liquid crystal device (Meadowlarks Optics LPR-100-λ) to maintain S polarisation at the incident plane at the back focal plane (BFP) of the objective lens for each SI orientation. For widefield acquisitions, the SLM was switched off and used as a single reflector so that only the zero-order beam provided epi-illumination, while for SIM acquisition, the SLM was switched on and it was preloaded with the patterns for the specific wavelength and line width. During image acquisition, the SI phase and angle were rotated in a fixed sequence, synchronised with the polarisation rotators, the light sources, and the cameras.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Deformable mirror</title><p>We used a DM (Alpao DM69-15) which was positioned between the main dichroic filter and the microscope body, conjugated to the BFP of the objective lens. The DM was used for the correction of aberrations in both the excitation and the emission paths. The DM aperture was matched to the BFP by an optical relay system. We included a pair of flip mirrors to create an optical path that bypassed the DM (dotted path in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>), allowing easy comparison between imaging without and with AO.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Software</title><p>The system control software package was composed of three parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): <italic>python-microscope</italic> for low-level hardware control of the microscope system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Susano Pinto et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>microscope-cockpit</italic> for a user interface and additional functionality such as experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Phillips et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>microscope-aotools</italic> for performing DM calibration and AO aberration correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hall et al., 2020</xref>).

We calibrated the DM with an integrated interferometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>, dashed path) to obtain an accurate Zernike mode control matrix, which we used for both aberration correction and remote focusing. The duration of the calibration routine was around 30–60 min, mostly spent on phase unwrapping and other intensive computations. The resulting control matrix could be reused for weeks at a time, before recalibration was necessary, and potentially much longer on devices which are not subject to creep effect.</p><p>Our base set of correction modes included 8 Zernike modes: #5 (primary oblique astigmatism) to #11 (primary spherical) and #22 (secondary spherical), following Noll indexing. Example correction modes and their amplitudes for each sample are given in the figure supplements of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Our aberration correction method used a standard optimisation algorithm where each mode was scanned individually by applying several different mode biases to the DM, e.g., <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$\left \{-1,\ -0.5,\ 0,\ 0.5,\ 1\right \}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> rad, and acquiring widefield images each time. For our base set of correction modes, this scanning arrangement resulted in 40 images in total. Metric values were calculated for each image and a Gaussian curve was fitted to the amplitude-metric points. The mean of the Gaussian was used as the optimal correction for the Zernike mode. We used a Fourier-based metric which is described in Appendix 5. We observed that ISOsense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Žurauskas et al., 2019</xref>) achieved the most robust correction (data not shown) when the images did not have prominent high spatial frequency content, i.e., few or no sub-diffraction features.</p><p>In our approach to aberration correction, we always corrected the system-induced aberrations first, by using a sparse bead sample and by tuning the objective lens collar. Any subsequent correction of sample-induced aberrations was done on top of this ‘system flat’ correction. When imaging, we always carried out the aberration correction routine first and then held the DM in the corrective shape during the actual image acquisition. For relatively thin volumes, e.g., 1–2 µm thickness, we mostly corrected just a single plane (usually the middle of the stack), but for thicker volumes, we developed our MPAC approach. The duration of the correction routine for a single plane was proportional to the number of modes involved, the number of scanning points for each mode, and the camera exposure configuration, but usually in the order of seconds. The earlier example of 40 images for our base set of corrections would normally take around 10 s (less than 4 s of actual light exposure). The correction was independent of the subsequent image acquisition. This independence between the two processes let us configure separately the exposure settings for the correction routine, allowing us to tune parameters, such as exposure time and laser power, in a way that minimises issues such as low contrast and noise. We further accounted for noise in our Fourier-based image metric, as described in Appendix 5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Multi-position aberration correction</title><p>We used MPAC to compensate for the optical distortions in thick volumes. We applied our standard sensorless AO correction routine at fixed positions, e.g., at the top and the bottom of the volume, and then we did a linear fitting of the resulting correction Zernike modes. This simple approach allowed us to calculate in advance the corrections for every section of the volume. All corrections required for an imaging session were stored in the DM driver beforehand and then rapidly iterated via electrical (TTL) signals in real-time during the session, same as the remote focusing function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Remote focusing</title><p>We controlled the remote focusing and the aberration correction independently, each one with its own set of corrections, which were then summed together if both functionalities were to be used simultaneously. To calculate the required remote focusing DM patterns, we first performed a calibration procedure, which was based on our aberration correction method and hence used the same type of optimisation algorithm. Our approach achieved a linear response with high precision, within a range of ±5 µm. Because of instability problem with the DM, we then had to perform a second calibration step to achieve high accuracy as well. We describe all this tuning in Appendix 2, and we elaborate on the instability problem in Appendix 6. Similarly to the MPAC, all remote focusing patterns were computed in advance before the image acquisition and then they were iterated by TTL triggers. When remote focusing was combined with 3D-SIM imaging, the focal plane and the SI pattern were synchronously moved together during axial scanning, keeping constant the phase relationship between the two. The change in effective NA due to focus shift was negligible with our choice of focusing range (up to ~16 µm) and objective lens.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>SIM reconstruction artefacts</title><p>Super-resolved images in 3D-SIM are obtained with a reconstruction process which can sometimes lead to artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demmerle et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we intentionally chose difficult-to-image samples, to demonstrate the full capability of the Deep3DSIM prototype and to show realistic examples.</p><p> Optical aberrations are a major source of reconstruction artefacts, and this is very well illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Without AO, the weak signal in the green channel resulted in high spatial frequency noise (hammerstroke) and stripe (hatching) artefacts. Furthermore, the enhanced RI mismatch led to increased spherical aberrations, and subsequently to ghosting artefacts, manifesting as faint ripples in some places in the red channel (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, all these artefacts were removed in the AO corrected images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p> However, in some situations, AO correction cannot completely remove all artefacts. We demonstrate this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, where the corrected volumes still have visible artefacts. There are two main reasons for this. First, high levels of optical scattering are experienced at such extreme imaging depth without optical clearing of the tissue. The scattering is a problem not only on the excitation side, leading to poor modulation contrast of the SI, but also on the emission side where it leads to weak fluorescence signal with poor contrast. These problems resulted in hatching artefacts, most noticeable in the green channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right). On the other hand, an extreme imaging depth also leads to large and complex aberrations which may not be entirely corrected. For example, some of the aberrations may have a magnitude that cannot be adequately compensated by the wavefront corrector, such as a DM, or likewise, they may contain high-order components which cannot be faithfully reproduced. In our case, such residual spherical aberrations resulted in ghosting artefacts in both channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right).</p><p> Finally, we also observed pronounced hatching artefacts in the green channel of our live imaging of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which was caused by poor modulation contrast at one of the SI angles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell culture</title><p>COS-7 (ATCC, CRL-1651) cells were grown on #1.5 glass cover slips in DMEM containing 10% foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), washed twice with 2 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate and fixed for 2 h in 2 ml PLP (2% [wt/vol] paraformaldehyde in 87.5 mM lysine, 87.5 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.4, and 10 mM sodium periodate).

generation</title><p>The stripe width of the sinusoidal SI was 317 nm for the green channel and 367 for the red channel. We used a SLM to diffract the incoming excitation beam into three paths, consisting of the zero-order beam and the ±1 order diffraction beams. The three beams interfered at the sample plane to create an axially varying stripe pattern. An example of the pattern is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>.</p><p> The width of the stripe pattern was chosen to be larger than the theoretical possible, e.g., 271 nm in the green channel by using the Rayleigh criterion for resolution. There were three reasons for this choice. First, in the frequency domain, we observed that the highest spatial frequency amplitudes decreased as the resolution approached this theoretical limit. Using a slightly larger stripe width drastically improved the intensity of these amplitudes, resulting in improved SNR of the high-resolution features in the reconstructed images. Second, the radial distance of the first-order beams in the BFP, and hence on the DM aperture, increases as the resolution decreases. However, the actuation of the reflective membrane of the DM was less effective at the periphery because of boundary conditions. Third, higher spatial frequency stripes meant a higher incidence angle of the outer beams on the sample and the effect of spatially varying aberrations was further enhanced at these higher angles. The change in angle could be corrected in principle, because the beams were focused on the DM, but the field-dependent aberrations that affected each individual beam differently could not be fully corrected in this way.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) pattern generation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of the structured illumination (SI) pattern at one of the angle orientations and phase shifts, visualised by imaging a monolayer of 100 nm diameter fluorescent beads in the green (left) and in the red (middle) channels.

Effectively, it was a mapping between Zernike mode coefficients and Z positions. We created this mapping with a sample of a single layer of sparse 100 nm fluorescent beads; we first introduced an axial displacement with the piezo stage and then we used the DM to bring the beads back into focus with our sensorless aberration correction by also including the defocus mode.</p><p>We validated the remote focusing by displacing the beads sample by four offsets, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>2.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft3">\begin{document}$\left \{-5,\, -2.5,\, 2.5,\, 5\right \}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> µm, and acquiring a Z-stack for each offset. We then checked if the displacements of the beads within the Z-stack matched the displacement of the stage. We repeated the same procedure with just the piezo stage, using the data as a ground truth. Each volume was acquired 10 times for statistical analysis, and likewise, we analysed the same 10 beads from each volume. We used Gaussian fitting to find the centre Z position of each bead. In terms of precision, we calculated the exact pooled variance of each of the offsets to be <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6.45</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>4.15</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>20.58</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>11.83</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft4">\begin{document}$\left \{6.45,\, 4.15,\, 20.58,\, 11.83\right \}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> nm, respectively. This demonstrated the good repeatability of the DM refocusing. However, the images showed mismatches in the position measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1A</xref>) and the image of a single bead was elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1B</xref>). We interpreted this to be caused by the creep effect of the DM. The findings from Appendix 6 demonstrated two important observations: (1) most of the initial change in wavefront phase due to the creep effect was within the first minute; (2) the exponential rate of change meant that the creep effect was effectively linear during this initial period. The rate and the way in which the shape of the DM was changed during the calibration of the remote focusing was different from those used during subsequent image acquisitions. Therefore, the calibration compensated for more creep than was typically encountered during actual imaging experiments. However, the rates of both the calibration and the imaging were well below the 1 min threshold, typically in the order of milliseconds, and therefore the contribution of the creep effect was only different up to a scale, because of the linearity in this region. We calculated this scaling factor as the ratio of the slopes of the lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1A</xref>, in this case yielding a value of around 0.7. This scaling approach allowed us to get accurate remote Z displacements that matched the ground truth displacements obtained with the piezo stage, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1C</xref>.</p><p>We usually performed remote focusing with a range of ±5 µm or less, because this is already a large volume, requiring thousands of images to be acquired for multi-colour 3D-SIM, and because the image quality was optimal in this range. We sometimes extended this range, e.g., to the ±8 µm range shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, but we noticed that the quality of the PSF decreased beyond the ±10 µm range. We attribute this to the larger actuator control voltages, applied over longer periods of time, which meant that the impact of the creep effect on the DM was even stronger.</p><fig id="app2fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of rescaling on remote focusing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of remote focusing to conventional refocusing with piezo stage.

In our case, this was already indicated from the manufacturers’ datasheets, which listed the settling times of the DM and the Piezo as 0.4 ms and 7 ms (10% step width), respectively. The settling time is the time it takes for the device to reach a new position and maintain it without oscillation. In the case of the piezo stage, this happens every time the device moves up or down, whereas for the DM, it is a change in the shape of the reflective surface. Clever execution of imaging experiments can negate a lot of this ‘dead time’ by, for example, reading out image data from the detectors in the meantime (Cockpit already does this). However, fast image acquisition with low readout times can lead to a situation where the settling time needs to be waited out. We measured the step responses of the DM and the piezo stage, which allowed us to estimate the settling times. The values we obtained were substantially higher than the reported values from the respective datasheets. The response of the DM was measured by checking the fringe patterns of the integrated interferometer. Limited by the interferometer camera readout speed, we estimated the settling time to be between 1 and 2 ms. The response of the piezo stage was measured both with digital (using the manufacturer’s software PIMikroMove) and with analogue (using an oscilloscope) methods, with different step sizes. Using default PID parameters, we found the 10% step width setting time to be around 25 ms. However, for experiments, we used a step of size 125 nm, for which the settling time was around 10ms. In conclusion, the settling time of DM was close to an order of magnitude faster than the piezo stage.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-4"><title>Appendix 4</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Optical design</title><p>An optical diagram of Deep3DSIM is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>. The laser module was composed of four commonly used laser lines: 405, 488, 561, and 642 nm. The 405 nm laser was incompatible with the SLM and thus was only used in widefield mode. We ended up doing all experiments with the 488 nm and 561 nm channels, so there are only two detectors in the diagram, but two more can be added for 4-channel simultaneous imaging. The system could easily be scaled to use more than four channels. By using a half-wave plate in each path, all laser beams had their polarisation rotated to be parallel to the slow axis of the SLM (Boulder Nonlinear Systems HSP512-488-800). The four beams were then combined by mirrors and dichroic filters into the same path before being guided to the SLM. The flip mirrors FM5 and FM6, together with the FBS beamsplitter, were used to bypass the SLM and create an integrated interferometer (dashed path) for the calibration of the DM. The excitation beam was deflected by the SLM towards the DM. By applying a sinusoidal stripe pattern to the SLM at a sample conjugated plane, the excitation path was diffracted into three beams consisting of ±1<sup>st</sup> order and zero-order beams. The three beams interfered at the sample plane below the objective lens to form the 3D SI. The foci of the three beams were filtered by a 7-point spatial filter (A2). A polarisation rotator (Meadowlarks Optics LPR-100) was used to change the linear polarisation angle of the structured illumination pattern during experiments. The excitation light and the emission light were separated by a dichroic filter (D4, Chroma Technology ZT405/488/561/640rpc) that was aligned at 22.5° from the optical axis to achieve the optimal sharpness of the transitions between the transmission (excitation) and reflection (emission) for all wavelengths. The combined excitation beam was deflected by a DM (Alpao DM69-15) which was conjugated to the BFP of the 60× objective lens (Olympus LUMFLN60XW). A 10× air objective lens (Olympus LMPLFLN10X) was used for widefield imaging with a large FoV (dash-dotted path). Flip mirror FM2 was used to switch between the two objective lenses, whereas flip mirror FM1 was used to direct the white LED light LL to one of the objective lenses. Note that only the 60× objective lens was optimised and intended for SIM and AO. The pair of flip mirrors FM3 and FM4 was used to bypass the DM (dotted path) for comparison between AO and no AO. The sample was moved in 3D with an assembly of two motorised piezo stages, PI M-687 (XY) and PI P-736 (Z). This entire assembly was further mounted on a heavy-duty Z-stage (Aerotech PRO115), which was used for coarse large-range Z control. The emission light was collected simultaneously from multiple channels by EMCCD cameras (Andor iXon Ultra 897). The separation of green and red fluorescence was done with a dichroic filter (D5, Chroma ZT561rdc-xr), and each channel was further filtered by individual band-pass filters: ET525/50 m (Chroma) for the green channel and ET600/50 m (Chroma) for the red channel.</p><fig id="app4fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 4—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optical arrangement.</title><p>405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm: laser sources.

We note that this particular DM was a model manufactured in 2014; we note also that, to our knowledge, later revisions of the same model have been improved to remove such effects. Unlike the well-known hysteresis, this temporal behaviour known as ‘creep’ has been reported in the literature, e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bitenc, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitenc et al., 2014</xref>), and it has been attributed to a combination of drift and temperature effects. To better understand the dynamic behaviour of the device, we performed a series of experiments.</p><p>The first experiment aimed to test the long-term stability of the device. The total duration of the experiment was 16 hr, and it was divided into 1 min cycles. For the first 50 s of each cycle, random offsets were added to the shape, with a frequency of several hundred hertz. The idea was to simulate normal operation of the device. The offsets were uniformly distributed in the range ±5% of the total range, so on average, the shape remained the same. In the final 10 s of each cycle, the original shape was re-applied and kept for the remainder of the cycle. Interferograms were captured at the end of each cycle, and root mean square (RMS) wavefront phase error from the original shape was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app6fig1">Appendix 6—figure 1A</xref>). This experiment confirmed our observation about the change in shape and it showed significant changes within the first hour, as well as a steady increase in error even after 16 hr.</p><p>To further distinguish between the effects of drift and temperature, we performed a second set of experiments. The device was warmed up and initialised by holding defocus for 4 hr. Six different shapes were then applied and monitored for 20 min each. Then a final shape was held for 60 min. In all these experiments, the DM was undisturbed until the next change in shape. All the shapes were individual Zernike modes with a coefficient of 1 radian; the shapes applied are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app6table1">Appendix 6—table 1</xref>. The RMS wavefront phase errors were calculated in the same way as before, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app6fig1">Appendix 6—figure 1B</xref>. They show that the device had already reached its steady state by the first data point at the 1 min mark. This indicated that the creep effect had a long-term component, as observed in the previous experiments, but there was also a significant short-term component which worked on the scale of seconds or even shorter. The nature of the creep effect depended on the current and the previously applied shapes, and as such, it acted as a memory effect where the final shape was a time-variant combination of the current and the previous shapes.</p><table-wrap id="app6table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 6—table 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental conditions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides"

mitigate the creep effects, we adopted a set of exercise routines which helped with warming up of the device and with bringing its shape closer to its neutral stable position. We used a combination of three main exercises to diversify the way the reflective membrane was agitated. The first exercise consisted of alternating checkerboard patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app6fig2">Appendix 6—figure 2A</xref>), each held for 3 s, for a total of 50 repeats. The two inverted patterns typically covered 80% of the total actuator range, such that the two values were set at 10% and 90% of the full range. This exercise routine was especially helpful for removing any large errors in Zernike modes from the DM, which had arisen because large control voltages were applied to actuators for extended periods. The second exercise was cycling through varying levels of defocus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app6fig2">Appendix 6—figure 2B</xref>), with coefficients linearly distributed in the range <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mfenced open="[" close="]" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math><tex-math id="inft23">\begin{document}$\left [-5;5\right ]$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> rad, typically in 11 steps, each held for 100ms, for a total duration of about 10 min. This exercise helped to maintain the optimal PSF when using remote focusing. It could also restore the optimal PSF if an extremely large amplitude of remote focusing was applied and affected the PSF quality. The third exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app6fig2">Appendix 6—figure 2C</xref>) consisted of the same type of actuator poking as in the calibration procedure.

We typically used 11–21 steps, with one or two repeats. Because this exercise routine is identical to that used for Zernike mode calibration, it was best used for restoring optimal Zernike modes that are required for AO correction.</p><fig id="app6fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 6—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deformable mirror (DM) drift and temperature characterisation.</title><p>Wavefront phase root mean square (RMS) error (RMS error, RMSE) measurements for (<bold>A</bold>) long-term drift without warm-up and for (<bold>B</bold>) short-term drift with warm-up (4 hr of 1 rad defocus), following the sequences listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app6table1">Appendix 6—table 1</xref>.

Their detailed, thoughtful and constructive comments have certainly improved the manuscript considerably. We have gone through each and every comment in detail and addressed it individually, often by new data and its analysis, leading to a revision of all the figures and supplementary figures of the paper. Below, we explain our responses and revisions in detail, outlining our response to each and every comment, closely following our revision plan, previously accepted by <italic>eLife</italic>. The revision of the figures now also follows more closely the guidelines of the journal. For example, single channel images are now presented in greyscale, while two-channel images use green and magenta. We also adhered to the principles of Colour Universal Design (by Okabe and Ito), whenever possible. In a similar vein, the “Supplementary Materials” have been correctly reorganised into appendices, now placed in the main manuscript document, and Figures 3-5 now include one supplementary figure each. The author contributions have been removed from the main manuscript, as well as the figure images, which are submitted as individual files. The figure legends remain in the main manuscript document.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of revisions</p><p>Major reviewer comments</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Major comment #1</p></disp-quote><p>Given the emphasis on super-resolution imaging deep inside a sample, we were surprised to see no mention of other forms of structured illumination that allow super-resolution imaging in samples thicker than a single cell. These include the 'spot-scanning' implementations of SIM that offer better imaging at depth by virtue of pinholes, and include MSIM, iSIM, and rescan confocal technologies. The two-photon / AO implementation of iSIM seems particularly germane, e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28628128/ Please consider citing these works, as they help place the existing work into context.</p><p>We want to thank Reviewer #1 for making this good point. To address this comment, we added a few sentences in the introduction to describe and cite image scanning methods, referring to the work mentioned by the reviewer as well as additional studies:</p><p>“Image scanning methods have been used to enhance the spatial resolution in imaging of thick samples, in widefield (York et al., 2013; York et al., 2012), multiphoton (Ingaramo et al., 2014) and with AO (Zheng et al., 2017). These methods use physical or digital pinholes together with photon reassignment and deconvolution to improve the resolution by a factor of √2 or greater.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #2</p><p>As we're sure the authors appreciate, besides aberrations, a major additional obstacle to 3D SIM in thick tissues is the presence of out-of-focus background. Indeed, this point was mentioned by Gustafsson in his classic 2008 paper on 3D SIM (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18326650/):</p><p>'The application area of three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy overlaps with that of confocal microscopy, but the two techniques have different and complementary strengths. Structured illumination microscopy offers higher effective lateral resolution, because it concentrates much of the excitation light at the very highest illumination angles, which are most effective for encoding high-resolution information into the observed data, whereas confocal microscopy spreads out its illumination light more or-less uniformly over all available angles to form a focused beam. For very thick and compactly fluorescent samples, however, confocal microscopy has an advantage in that its pinhole removes out-of focus light physically. Structured illumination microscopy is quite effective at removing out-of-focus light computationally, because it is not subject to the missing-cone problem, but computational removal leaves behind the associated shot noise. Therefore confocal microscopy may be preferable on very thick and dense samples, for which the in-focus information in a conventional microscope image would be overwhelmed by out-of-focus light, whereas structured illumination microscopy may be superior in a regime of thinner or sparser samples.'</p><p>This point is not mentioned at all in the manuscript, yet we are certain it is at least partially responsible for the residual image artifacts the authors mention. Please discuss the problem of out of focus light on 3D samples, particularly with an eye to the 'spot-scanning' papers mentioned above.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for emphasising the importance of out-of-focus light in thick specimens and the difficulties it poses to good 3D-SIM imaging. To address the comment, we now describe this issue in the introduction, in the context of both 3D-SIM and image scanning methods:</p><p>“3D-SIM methods achieve higher resolution, but they manage background light less efficiently than image scanning methods. Two major reasons for this are the retention, after reconstruction, of the shot noise of the background light and the reduced contrast of the structured illumination (SI), potentially leading to reconstruction artefacts. These problems are compounded by depth and fluorescence density.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #3</p><p>The authors use a water dipping lens, yet they image into samples that are mounted on coverslips, i.e. they use a dipping lens to image through a coverslip:</p><p>This almost certainly introduces spherical aberration, which the authors seem to observe: see attached pdf for reference.</p><p>We find this troubling, as it seems that in the process of building their setup, the authors have made a choice of objective lens that introduces aberrations – that they later correct. At the very least, this point needs to be acknowledged in the manuscript (or please correct us if we're wrong) – as it renders the data in Figures 3-4 somewhat less compelling than if the authors used an objective lens that allowed correction through a coverglass, e.g. a water dipping lens with a correction collar. In other words, in the process of building their AO setup, the authors have introduced system aberrations that render the comparison with 3D SIM somewhat unfair. Ideally the authors would show a comparison with an objective lens that can image through a glass coverslip.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for pointing out the confusion caused by our lack of clarity regarding the use of a water-dipping/immersion objective lens in our system. To address this comment, we have added descriptions in the introduction and the methods and materials sections that explain how the objective lens can be used in both water-immersion and water-dipping configurations:</p><p>“The system is based around a 60×/1.1 NA water-immersion objective lens, with a correction collar that allows its use in a water-dipping configuration without a cover slip.</p><p>We used a water-immersion objective lens (Olympus LUMFLN60XW), capable of working in a water-dipping configuration by adjusting a correction collar […]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #4</p><p>The authors tend to include numbers for resolution without statistics. This renders the comparisons meaningless in my opinion; ideally every number would have a mean and error bar associated with it. We have included specific examples in the minor comments below.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, which we address below, in minor comments #8, #9, and #11. In summary, we revised Figure 2 to show the distributions of the FWHM samples, including common statistical measures such as median and mean, and other features like density, dispersion, and skewness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #5</p><p>In Figure 5, after the 'multipoint AO SIM', the SNR in some regions seems to decrease after AO: see attached pdf for reference</p><p>Please comment on this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank Reviewer #1 for the insightful comment. We redesigned Figure 5, making sure that the two sets of images have the same intensity ranges. By doing this, the signal is now consistently higher in the AO images, so the issue of decreasing SNR is no longer present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #6</p><p>Please provide timing costs for the indirect AO methods used in the paper, so the reader understands how this time compares to the time required for taking a 3D SIM stack. In a similar vein, the authors in Lines 213-215, mention a 'disproportionate measurement time' when referring to the time required for AO correction at each plane – providing numbers here would be very useful to a reader, so they can judge for themselves what this means. What is the measurement time, why is it so long, and how does it compare to the time for 3D SIM? It would also be useful to provide a comparison between the time needed for AO correction at each (or two) planes without remote focusing (RF) vs. with RF, so the reader understands the relative temporal contributions of each part of the method. We would suggest, for the data shown in Figure 5, to report a) the time to acquire the whole stack without AO (3D SIM only); b) the time to acquire the data as shown; c) the time to acquire the AO stack without RF. This would help bolster the case for remote focusing in general; as is we are not sure we buy that this is a capability worth having, at least for the data shown in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the timing (and other) costs can be an important consideration, and we want to thank Reviewer #1 for bringing up this good point. To address this point, we have expanded the description of the AO in the methods and materials section to include more information about the time it takes to perform the different parts of the AO:</p><p>“The duration of the calibration routine was around 30 to 60 minutes, mostly spent on phase unwrapping and other intensive computations.</p><p>The duration of the correction routine for a single plane was proportional to the number of modes involved, the number of scanning points for each mode, and the camera exposure configuration, but usually in the order of seconds. The earlier example of 40 images for our base set of corrections would normally take around 10 seconds (&lt;3.5 second of light exposure).</p><p>“</p><p>We also added a discussion of how the remote focusing could speed up the image acquisition, further elaborated in Appendix 3:</p><p>“In terms of speed, refocusing with the DM instead of using the piezo stage reduced the duration of the image acquisition significantly, because the settling time of the surface of the DM was around an order of magnitude faster than the settling time of the piezo stage, which highlights the potential of AO-based refocusing for fast imaging. A more detailed discussion of this point, together with a comparison between the DM and the piezo stage, is presented in Appendix 3.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #7</p><p>Some further discussion on possibly extending the remote focusing range would be helpful. We gather that limitations arose from an older model of the DM being used, due to creep effects. We also gather from the SI that edge effects at the periphery of the DM was also problematic. Are these limitations likely non-issues with modern DMs, and how much range could one reasonably expect to achieve as a result? We are wondering if the 10 μm range is a fundamental practical limitation or if in principle it could be extended with commercial DMs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer #1 for the suggestions. During the revision of the manuscript, we noticed that there was an error in the reported range of the remote focusing in Figure 5. The actual range is ~16 µm, instead of 10 µm. In addition to this correction, we added discussion of the remote focusing range, the limitations of our approach, and whether other commercial DMs could improve the range (with more technical detail given in Appendix 2):</p><p>“The range of remote focusing shown in this work was limited to about ±8 µm, which is smaller than some previous demonstrations. There are two reasons why we did not use wider ranges in our results. First, the DM can only reliably produce PSFs with minimal aberration repeatedly up to a range of about ±10 µm (see Appendix 2). Second, for 3D-SIM acquisition, ±5 µm is already a wide and commonly used Z range. Especially in multi-colour imaging, a rather large number of images, about 1200 frames (3 angles × 5 phases × 80 Z steps) per channel, would be required. While larger volume acquisition is possible, it would lead to considerable photobleaching and phototoxicity, as well as longer acquisition and reconstruction times. Nevertheless, a similar DM device has been used to achieve an impressive range of remote focusing (Cui et al., 2021). Although their approach is different from the high-NA super-resolution imaging presented here, a stable DM should increase the practical range of our remote focusing approach twofold or even greater.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Major comment #1</p><p>The authors have provided an incomplete description of the structured illumination microscopy (SIM) reconstruction process. It is unclear whether the approach is based on 2D interference SIM configurations or 3D interference patterns. Furthermore, the specific algorithm utilized for image reconstruction has not been elucidated. Elaborating on these aspects is crucial as they significantly influence the interpretation of the resulting data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for highlighting the need to describe the reconstruction process in more detail. To address this point, we added further information about the reconstruction process in the Discussion section:</p><p>“We chose to use a well-established reconstruction method based on Wiener filtering, as implemented in the softWoRx software suite, without advanced pre-processing of the image data for reduction of artefacts.”</p><p>And in the methods and materials section:</p><p>“For SIM data reconstruction, we used the commercial software softWoRx (GE Healthcare), which uses Wiener deconvolution, based on the approach by (Gustafsson et al., 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #2</p><p>The authors have stated that sample-induced aberrations caused by RI inhomogeneities within the specimen is another major reason for causing artifacts generation. Literature has demonstrated that RI inhomogeneities can lead to non-local distortions in the grid pattern, which suggests that applying uniform reconstruction parameters across the entire image may not be viable. Traditional artifact remediation using the classical Wiener method is likely insufficient under these conditions (PMID: 33896197). The existing adaptive optics (AO) approach, which employs a deformable mirror (DM) alongside an sCMOS camera, is inadequate for tackling the issue at hand. Actually the assertion made in the paper that &quot;aberrations change approximately linearly with depth&quot; is seemingly contradicted by simulations referenced in the cited literature (PMID: 33896197). Consequently, it appears that the current methodology might only achieve a partial mitigation of the problems associated with spherical aberration resulting from RI mismatches. It is advisable, therefore, that the authors explicitly acknowledge this limitation in their manuscript to prevent any potential misinterpretation by readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for this thoughtful comment by Reviewer #2. The focus of our work was not the use of advanced 3D-SIM reconstruction and aberration correction methods; instead, we used standard ones that do not deal perfectly with field-dependent aberrations. As such, our approach provides average reconstruction and average correction across the entire field of view. To address the comment, we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Our AO methods provide only one average correction […]”</p><p>We also highlighted specific examples of residual aberrations in Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #3</p><p>In Figure 2, the use of COS-7 cells, which are known for their relatively thin axial dimension, for the experiments raises an eyebrow. Notably, there are ample instances in existing research where both 2D-SIM and 3D-SIM, without the integration of adaptive optics, have yielded high-quality super-resolution images of structures such as tubulin and the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, the authors did not present a direct comparison between BP-SIM and AO-SIM here. Without this comparative analysis, it remains ambiguous whether the enhancements in resolution and contrast and the reduction in artifacts can genuinely be attributed to the mitigation of spherical aberration. To clarify this, it would be beneficial for the authors to include side-by-side comparisons of these modalities to demonstrate the specific improvements attributed to AO-SIM.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer #2 for this helpful comment. We revised Figure 2 entirely, which includes the bottom part of it (Figure 2B), to emphasise better the comparison that we wanted to make: widefield against 3D-SIM, demonstrating the improvement in resolution. Naturally, we also revised the second paragraph of the Results section accordingly, to be in line with the updated figure and to make our arguments clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #4</p><p>In Figures 3 and 4, the authors have illustrated the enhancements achieved through the application of AO. However, there is a discernible presence of hammer-stroke and honeycomb artifacts in pre-AO imaged data, which seem to originate from the amplification of the incorrectly moved out-of-focal background in the frequency domain. Various strategies have been previously suggested to address these specific artifacts, encompassing methods like subtracting background noise in the raw images or employing selective frequency spectrum attenuation techniques, such as Notch filtering and High-Fidelity SIM. To facilitate a more comprehensive understanding, I would recommend that the authors incorporate into their study a comparison that includes BP-SIM data that has undergone either background subtraction or frequency spectrum attenuation. This added data would enable a more complete evaluation and comparison regarding the merits and impact of their AO approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We agree that a pre-processing step, such as background subtraction or frequency spectrum attenuation, can help with the reduction of artefacts. However, when we tried frequency spectrum attenuation, as we said in the revision plan, the results did not improve the image quality. We note that the methods suggested by the reviewer, e.g. HiFi-SIM, were designed for 2D-SIM and they are not suitable for our 3D-SIM methodology. We feel that the effective removal of 3D-SIM reconstruction artefacts is a complex and difficult task, which deserves its own treatment and therefore it is well beyond the scope of this manuscript. Nevertheless, to address this comment, we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion section, which clarifies our reconstruction strategy and choice of algorithms:</p><p>“An important consideration in 3D-SIM reconstruction is the precise settings […]”</p><p>The paragraph also includes references to novel 3D-SIM reconstruction methods which could produce higher fidelity reconstructed data, with less artefacts, and which can be applied to Deep3DSIM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Major comment #1</p><p>There is an overall reference in the manuscript of the novelty possible range of applications of using an upright microscope configuration. Examples mentioned are tissue-based imaging, access to whole-mount specimens for manipulation and electrophysiology. However, authors fail to present any such applications. There is not a single example presented which could not have been obtained with an inverted microscope. Could the authors provide an example where a water-dipping is used. Expanded samples could be one case, since the thickness of the gel makes it difficult to image with an inverted microscope. Another possible example would be to label the extracellular space and do shadow imaging of the tissue (SUSHI PMID: 29474910). ExM might be simpler to do as part of revising the manuscript than SUSHI.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful to Reviewer #3 for the constructive comment. The data in Figure 5A is an example where water-dipping is used, which we now explicitly state in the revised figure legend. The reviewer’s notes on expansion microscopy and SUSHI are interesting, but the primary purpose of our microscope system is to facilitate live super-resolution cell imaging experiments. Nevertheless, to address this comment, we have added a discussion of the application of Deep3DSIM to expansion microscopy:</p><p>“Deep3DSIM is also uniquely positioned for the imaging of the whole sample in expansion microscopy, without the need for mechanical sectioning, which is a challenge because of the softness and fragility of commonly used hydrogel techniques (Cahoon et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #2</p><p>On the main text it is described a 5-fold volumetric resolution, which is confusing since authors only mention lateral and axial resolutions. Their measurements correspond to a ~1.6-fold lateral improvement and ~1.7-fold axial improvement. These are however not the 95% of the achievable resolution theoretical maximum, as stated in p7 SI (2 fold increase of 282nm), but only the 80-85%. This point should be rephrased in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #3 for bringing up this important point.

The commercial DeepSIM module from CREST Optics can be mounted on an inverted microscope as well as image deep into tissue (seehttps://crestoptics.com/deepsim/ and application notes therein) and be used with essentially any objective. This point should be rephrased in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #3 for pointing out this mistake. Of course, we meant commercial 3D-SIM systems, such as GE Healthcare DeltaVision OMX and Nikon N-SIM.

How is the AO optimization implemented? Is it implemented via a genetic algorithm (progressive optimization of parameters) or using more clever strategies? Not clear if the optimization is implemented using images obtained with flat illumination or after SIM imaging/processing of a given dataset. How long does the AO optimization take? How sensitive to noise is the process? What metric do they use to estimate the sensorless AO correction? On pag12, they say &quot;Fourier domain image metric&quot; for measurements with fine details; otherwise, ISOsense when not high frequencies are present. Could the authors report the formula used to calculate the first metric? What do they consider to be low and high frequencies in this case? Is there a reason why ISOsense is not always used, or is there an automatic way to choose between the two? How many images were acquired for AO correction? Which samples were corrected with ISOsense and which ones with Fourier domain image metric? (see for example the detailed experimental reporting in the Supp Mat from Lin et al. Nat Commun 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer #3 for the extensive list of questions. We greatly expanded our description of the AO methods in the methods and materials section, which now answers all these questions.

Data presented for larval brain tissue is a very clear example of adding AO to image deep into tissue as the effect at ~130 cannot be understated. Here too, it would be also good to report the Fourier amplitudes as done in Figure 2C as a quantitative measure of improvement and possibly the SNR of reconstructed images. Having a way to quantitatively describe how much better are those images would be great. Also, what are the aberrations corrected? Can the wavefront or Zernike amplitude of the modes be reported? Same as for Figure 3, details about AO correction are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very helpful comment – thanks. We added Figure 4—figure supplement 1, which shows the power spectra and the Zernike correction modes.</p><p>Major comment #9</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[OPTIONAL] &quot;It is worth noting that aberrations can differ across larger fields, and therefore, after applying an average correction, residual aberrations can still be observed in some regions of the AO-corrected bead images.

Unfortunately, it is not reported in detail. Not only for SIM but for imaging with WF or confocal, such linear change for aberrations with depth is not well known. Again, here the details of AO correction and image metrics are missing. To establish that for most thick biological structures 'aberrations change approximately linearly in depth' would be foundational to the widespread use of AO within standard imaging. Would it be possible for the authors to elaborate on this point and present detailed results? What is the error from measuring and correcting more than 2 planes? What is the error from just measuring and AO correcting at the deeper plane, i.e. from a single measurement? Authors could also show a case in which a linear assumption works nicely (or how well it works). For example, comparing an intermediate plane (or a plane beyond) imaged after AO optimization or after coefficient interpolation of the Zernike modes and compare it against correcting directly that plane.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting our poorly phrased sentence. We meant to say proportional instead of linear. We have rephrased our argument, which is now in the last paragraph of the Results section. In general, our description of the AO methods has been greatly expanded and includes details about the AO correction and the image metrics. Performing estimation from just a single measurement is not possible, but we show the simplest possible example – line fitted to two measurements (planes) – in Figure 5B, which also shows planes beyond the deep measurement point (bottom arrow).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #11</p><p>The image of the cos-7 cell in metaphase, for Figure 5 is, however, very disappointing.

Are those artifacts due to lower SNR (maybe due to sample bleaching) or due to some change in the aberrations of the specimen?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this valuable comment. Our revised description of the AO methodology now explicitly states that the AO correction characterisation was performed before the actual data acquisition:</p><p>“When imaging, we always carried out the aberration correction routine first and then held the DM in the corrective shape during the actual image acquisition.

A lot of considerations, calculations, and modelling were done in the prototyping of Deep3DSIM. Of course, the use of a commercial upright microscope stand was considered. One of the obvious limitations was the difficult access to the pupil-conjugated plane. In addition, a commercial microscope stand was not compatible with many of the core parts of the system, which were chosen for specific biological applications, such as dual camera system for fast live simultaneous imaging and the heavy-duty Z stage intended to support two heavy micromanipulators. To address this point, we added a brief discussion of the commercialisation of Deep3DSIM to the last paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“Finally, Deep3DSIM was custom prototyped on a large optical table, instead of basing the design around a commercial upright microscope, because the latter would have imposed unnecessary restrictions at this prototyping stage.

Therefore, we wanted to show that remote focusing can meet the strict requirements of 3D-SIM reconstruction, and that the remote focusing can be used as a direct replacement of a mechanical Z stage over a moderate range. We demonstrate this with two examples, starting first with live imaging. Living specimen already present several challenges for 3D-SIM imaging on their own (Gao et al., 2012). Particularly important are the acquisition speed, which can lead to motion artefacts if not sufficiently high, and photobleaching and phototoxicity, which occur when the rate of exposure and the intensity of the excitation light are too high. The Deep3DSIM approach has the potential to resolve both these challenges by using remote focusing for fast image acquisition while preserving the high image quality of the system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #24</p><p>What is the evidence for 'reduced residual aberrations', was a comparative stack taken without AO?

As is – it looks like a photograph of some generic optical setup.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure S1 is now Appendix 4 Figure 1. Despite our intention to provide more photographs of the instrument, we discovered that its footprint is too large and complex to adequately capture in a single photograph, especially within the dimensions that the figure would allow. We decided against the addition of multiple photographs and therefore removed the second part of the figure entirely, to avoid confusing the readers with photographs that are difficult to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #30</p><p>SI pattern generation – 'the maximum achievable reconstruction resolution was only slightly reduced to about 95% of the theoretical maximum'. We don't understand this sentence, as the resolution obtained on the 100 nm beads is considerably worse than 95% of the theoretical maximum. Or do the authors mean 95% of the theoretical maximum given their pitch size of 317 nm for green and 367 nm for red?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, so we have removed the confusing phrase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #31</p><p>SI Deformable mirror calibration 'spanning the range [0.1, 0.9]' – what are the units here?</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is related to part of what used to be the supplementary material, describing one of the calibration procedures of the AO. To avoid confusion, we decided to remove the details about calibration procedure, as they were already well documented in the cited literature, e.g. (Antonello et al., 2020; Hall, 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #32</p><p>What are the units in Figure S5C, S5D?</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to minor comment #31, this figure was removed to avoid possible confusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #33</p><p>It would be useful to define 'warmup' also in the caption of SI Figure S6A.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. We added a description of the warm-up routine to the figure legend: “warm-up (4 hours of 1 rad defocus)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #34</p><p>SI Remote Focusing, 'four offsets, {-5 mm, -2.5 mm, 2.5 mm, 5 mm}…' are the units mm or um?</p></disp-quote><p>The units were supposed to be micrometres. We corrected this error: “four offsets, {-5, -2.5, 2.5, 5} µm”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #35</p><p>'…whereas that of the 10 beads was…' here, do the authors mean the position of the beads derived from the movement of the piezo stage, as opposed to the remote focusing?</p><p>We agree with this comment. To address this confusion, we have re-analysed the data using exact pooled variance for each of the four offset steps, providing a standard well-defined measure of dispersion:</p></disp-quote><p>“In terms of precision, we calculated the exact pooled variance of each of the offsets to be {6.45, 4.15, 20.58, 11.83} nm, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #36</p><p>The authors refer to the 'results from Chapter 3.2'. What are they talking about? Do they mean a supplementary figure, or earlier supplementary results? In general, we found the discussion in this paragraph difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a remnant from an earlier version of the supplementary material, which used numbered sectioning. We rephrased this part from “results from Chapter 3.2” to “findings from Appendix 6”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #37</p><p>Supplementary Figure 9 seems to be not referred to anywhere in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>To correct this, we changed Supplementary Figure S9 to be Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and we refer to in the methods and materials section:</p><p>“Example correction modes and their amplitudes for each sample are given in the figure supplements of Figure 3 to Figure 5.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #38</p><p>Since the paper emphasizes 3D SIM, OTFs along the axial direction would also be useful to show, in addition to the lateral OTFs shown in Figure 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have added axial power spectra, showing the axial OTF supports, to Figure 2. We also provide similar data in the figure supplements for Figure 3 to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #39</p><p>When the sample is moved by the piezo, the axial phase of the 3D-SIM illumination pattern is stable as the sample is scanned through the illumination pattern. When remote focusing is performed, the sample is always stable so the axial phase of the 3D-SIM illumination pattern is presumably changing with remote focusing. Can the authors clarify if the 3D SIM illumination pattern is scanned when remote focusing is applied, or is the intensity pattern stable in z?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now clarified in the methods and materials section that the structured illumination pattern was scanned:</p><p>“When remote focusing was combined with 3D-SIM imaging, the focal plane and the SI pattern were synchronously moved together during axial scanning, keeping constant the phase relationship between the two.”</p><p>Minor comment #40</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Supplementary Figure 9, primary spherical is referred to twice, both at index 11 and 22. The latter is presumably secondary spherical?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We revised Supplementary Figure S9, which is now Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and we removed the removed the arrows to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #41</p><p>We do not understand the x axis label, in Figure S4D, is it really [0, 50, 50, 50] as written?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for pointing this out, as the x axis was mislabelled. It is supposed to show three 0 to 50 μm ranges. Supplementary Figure S4 is now Appendix 1—figure 1, and we modified the x-axis labels in panel B to correctly show the full range of 150 µm. We also expanded our description of the plot in the figure legend:</p><p>“The plot shows three 50 μm scans through the bead, one for each of the SI angles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>None</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Minor comment #1</p><p>Figure 2 lacks a color bar for D panels, which is in log scale. Authors should also show the Fourier transform along the z direction.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid confusion, the colour in the power spectra of Figure 2 has been removed, so the need for a colour bar is no longer necessary. However, we did specify in the figure legend that the images are in logarithmic scale. We also added the axial power spectra.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #2</p><p>p4, &quot;Such minor aberrations tend to be insignificant in conventional microscopy modalities such as widefield and confocal (Wang and Zhang, 2021). Therefore…&quot; If optical aberrations are insignificant for single cells in widefield and confocal why do experiments here? These sentences should be rephrased to motivate better the experiments performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and we rephrased the sentence:</p><p>“Such minor aberrations are often overlooked in conventional microscopy modalities such as widefield and confocal (Wang &amp; Zhang, 2021).

See https://sim.hms.harvard.edu/portfolio/microtubules/ or Figure 1 of Wegel, et al. Dobbie Sci Rep 2016, for better examples of continuous microtubule structures as imaged with SIM.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have added a new paragraph to the “Cell culture” part of the methods and materials section, where we address the fragmentation of microtubules:</p><p>“The microtubules stained in this way, occasionally appeared fragmented, more noticeable in the SIM images in Figure 2B. This fragmentation is normal for a sample preparation protocol, such as ours, based on 2% paraformaldehyde fixation. More advanced protocols, specifically designed for the preservation of structures such as microtubules, can result in more continuous filaments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #4</p><p>Is also the remote focusing performed via optimization of metrics similar to the one used for compensating aberrations?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the remote focusing is based on our regular aberration correction method. To improve clarity, we rephrased our description of the remote focusing in the methods and materials section, explicitly stating that its calibration uses the same type of optimisation algorithm as the aberration correction:</p><p>“To calculate the required remote focusing DM patterns, we first performed a calibration procedure, which was based on our aberration correction method and hence used the same type of optimisation algorithm.”</p><p>We further elaborate on this procedure in Appendix 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #5</p><p>Figure 2, the order of names on the top right of the panel should match the order of curves presented.</p></disp-quote><p>The plot legends were removed during the revision of Figure 2, thus making this comment no longer applicable to the new figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #6</p><p>I value the efforts to improve open-source tools for system and AO control and GUI. And those tools seemed to have been modified for this work, although those modifications are not described. Would it be possible for the authors to describe those modifications?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a brief description of the major changes, as well as references to the software repositories where all those changes were tracked and documented:</p><p>“All three were further developed and improved, to match the requirements of Deep3DSIM.
