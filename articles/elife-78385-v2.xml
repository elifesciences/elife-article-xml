In all eukaryotes, NPCs assemble into an intact nuclear envelope (NE) during interphase, but the process of NPC biogenesis remains poorly characterized. Furthermore, little is known about how NPC assembly leads to the fusion of the outer and inner NE, and no factors have been identified that could trigger this event. Here, we characterize the transmembrane protein Brl1 as an NPC assembly factor required for NE fusion in budding yeast. Brl1 preferentially associates with NPC assembly intermediates and its depletion halts NPC biogenesis, leading to NE herniations that contain inner and outer ring nucleoporins but lack the cytoplasmic export platform. Furthermore, we identify an essential amphipathic helix in the luminal domain of Brl1 that mediates interactions with lipid bilayers. Mutations in this amphipathic helix lead to NPC assembly defects, and cryo-electron tomography analyses reveal multilayered herniations of the inner nuclear membrane with NPC-like structures at the neck, indicating a failure in NE fusion. Taken together, our results identify a role for Brl1 in NPC assembly and suggest a function of its amphipathic helix in mediating the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_179275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_179418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medalia</surname><given-names>Ohad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NFR 315615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name><name><surname>Noor</surname><given-names>Elad</given-names></name><name><surname>Onischenko</surname><given-names>Evgeny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG AN377/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonin</surname><given-names>Wolfram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Heim-Voegtlin Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PMPDP3_171317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kralt</surname><given-names>Annemarie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/50110000304</institution-id><institution>EMBO postdoctoral fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 910-2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agote-Aran</surname><given-names>Arantxa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic, proteomic, and structural analyses provide insight into the role of Brl1 during nuclear pore complex biogenesis, suggesting a function in the fusion of outer and inner nuclear membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Virtually all biological processes are carried out by multiprotein complexes, and their faithful assembly is therefore crucial for cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartwell et al., 1999</xref>). The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is one of the largest cellular protein complexes, with a total mass of 60–120 MDa. In all eukaryotes, NPCs perforate the double lipid bilayer of the nuclear envelope (NE) and mediate macromolecular exchange between nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wente and Rout, 2010</xref>). NPCs are assembled from multiple copies of ~30 different proteins known as nucleoporins (NUPs), which amount to hundreds of proteins in the mature complex due to the NPC’s eightfold rotational symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Martinez and Rout, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Hoelz, 2019</xref>). NUPs are organized in well-defined subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), where the membrane ring (MR), central channel (CC), and inner ring (IR) in the plane of the NE are sandwiched by two outer rings composed of Y-complexes. Asymmetrically attached to this scaffold are the cytoplasmic export platform (CP) and the nuclear basket (NB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Martinez and Rout, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Hoelz, 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Brl1 preferentially binds young nuclear pore complexes (NPCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the NPC architecture.

Yet far less is known about how this gigantic complex assembles and gets embedded into the NE. In metazoan cells, which undergo an open mitosis, two types of NPC assembly mechanisms have been described: mitotic reassembly of NPCs at the end of cell division and de novo formation of NPCs during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otsuka and Ellenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schooley et al., 2012</xref>). Organisms that undergo closed mitosis, such as the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, exclusively rely on interphase NPC assembly to create new NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Winey et al., 1997</xref>). Here, NUP complexes punch a hole into the intact NE in order to create the protein-lined membrane tunnel that spans the NE. This requires a poorly understood fusion event between the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and outer nuclear membrane (ONM) during which the integrity of the NE diffusion barrier is not compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doucet and Hetzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rothballer and Kutay, 2013</xref>).</p><p>NPC assembly events are rare (e.g., in yeast ~1 NPC forms every 2 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Winey et al., 1997</xref>) and capturing them in situ has been challenging. Therefore, NPC biogenesis has mainly been studied using genetic perturbations that inhibit its maturation. A shared phenotype of many NPC assembly mutants is the appearance of NE herniations, which likely correspond to halted NPC assembly intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thaller and Patrick Lusk, 2018</xref>). The orientation of these herniations – always bulging out towards the cytoplasm – suggests an inside-out mechanism of NPC assembly, which is also supported by observations of interphase assembly states in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>). To characterize the precise maturation order and assembly kinetics of native NPC biogenesis in budding yeast, we recently developed a mass spectrometry-based approach that we termed KARMA (<italic>K</italic>inetic Analysis of Incorporation <italic>R</italic>ates in <italic>M</italic>acromolecular <italic>A</italic>ssemblies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). This revealed that NPCs form by sequential assembly of NUPs starting with the central scaffold, followed by the outer cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic parts and concluded by the late binding of Mlp1, consistent with an inside-out assembly mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To date, very few non-NPC proteins have been shown to participate in NPC assembly. This is in contrast to, for example, ribosome biogenesis, where ~180 <italic>trans</italic>-acting assembly factors are known to interact during the maturation process.

We show that Brl1 transiently binds to immature NPCs and that depletion of Brl1 impairs NPC assembly, resulting in NE herniations that contain the central scaffold NUPs but lack the cytoplasmic export platform (Nup82, Nup159). We further identify an essential luminal amphipathic helix (AH) in Brl1 that interacts with membranes and, when mutated, leads to the formation of large, multilayered NE herniations containing immature NPCs that we structurally characterize by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our results identify Brl1 as an essential NPC assembly factor and suggest that Brl1 mediates the fusion step between the INM and ONM during interphase NPC biogenesis via its AH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brl1 binds to assembling nuclear pore complexes</title><p>Relying on a large KARMA dataset that contains kinetic interaction profiles for 10 different NUP baits, we recently demonstrated that yeast NPCs assemble sequentially, starting with the symmetrical core NUPs (early tier), followed by the majority of asymmetric NUPs (intermediate tier), and concluded by the assembly of two NB NUPs Mlp1 and Mlp2 (late tier) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). This analysis also identified a large number of non-NUP proteins that interact with the baits. We sought to exploit our dataset to uncover potential NPC assembly factors. Since such factors are expected to selectively bind to the NPC during its biogenesis but are not part of the mature structure, they should be enriched in early tier NUP pulldowns versus late tier ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, out of ~1500 co-purified non-NUP proteins, Brl1 – a factor previously implicated in NPC biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) – displayed the second highest enrichment score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), decreasing in abundance approximately fivefold from early to late tier baits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Only Her1, a protein with unknown biological function, had a higher early-to-late enrichment ratio. To confirm Brl1’s binding preference for early assembling NUPs, we performed the reciprocal affinity pulldowns (APs) with endogenously tagged Brl1. In full agreement, early tier NUPs were enriched over the ones from intermediate and late assembly tiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Brl1’s preference for ‘young’ NPCs was validated by live-cell imaging using the recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verzijlbergen et al., 2010</xref>). We genetically tagged Nup170, which binds early during NPC biogenesis, with a RITE construct. This allowed us to specifically mark either old or newly synthesized Nup170 by removing or introducing a yEGFP-tag through inducible genetic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since Nup170 binds early during NPC biogenesis, it can be assumed that some of the foci formed by newly synthesized Nup170-yEGFP represent NPC assembly intermediates. As a measure of Brl1 association with young and old NPCs, we monitored co-localization between Brl1-mCherry and either new or old Nup170-yEGFP using cross-correlation of the NE fluorescence signals. As evidenced by a higher cross-correlation score and in agreement with our proteomic data, Brl1 co-localized better with young than with old NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Brl1 preferentially binds to young or immature NPCs, which is consistent with a function of Brl1 during NPC biogenesis.</p><p>Taking advantage of our KARMA workflow, we next set out to determine the stage during which Brl1 acts in NPC biogenesis more precisely. In KARMA, newly synthesized proteins are pulse labeled by heavy-isotope amino acids followed by the pulldown of the NPC via an endogenously tagged affinity bait at several post-labeling time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). The extent of metabolic labeling of any co-isolated protein is indicative of its average age in the AP fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, the ‘young’ structural intermediates that are bound by a bona fide assembly factor during biogenesis should display a higher metabolic labeling rate in APs compared to the labeling of bulk cellular proteins. By contrast, structural components that join after the assembly factor has left the NPC assembly site are not expected to show this effect, even if the assembly factor does not dissociate completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) that bind the NPC highly transiently serve as a reference for bulk cellular protein labeling to discriminate between young and old proteins.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mapping Brl1 association with nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly intermediates using KARMA (<italic>K</italic>inetic Analysis of Incorporation <italic>R</italic>ates in <italic>M</italic>acromolecular <italic>A</italic>ssemblies).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principles of KARMA: newly synthesized proteins are pulse-labeled followed by the affinity purification of the nucleoporin (NUP) complexes through a tagged NPC-binding protein. The extent of metabolic labeling is then quantified by mass spectrometry and corresponds to the average protein age in the affinity-purified fraction. An assembly factor selectively binds young NPCs, thus leading to high metabolic labeling rates for NUPs present in the intermediates (1). This is not the case for proteins that join after the assembly factor completely or partially dissociates or when the process is probed with an NUP bait (2).

Strikingly, the NUP labeling rates observed with Brl1 as bait were overall significantly higher compared to the ones in KARMA assays with NUP baits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). On top, we observed that in Brl1 pulldowns, early tier NUPs were labeled outstandingly fast, exceeding NUPs from the intermediate or late tiers and even the NTRs – our reference of the bulk cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In line with this, our quantitative analysis of NUP metabolic labeling rates using a previously developed kinetic state model (KSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>), revealed that early tier NUPs become partly inaccessible to the Brl1 bait in mature NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; see section ‘Kinetic state modeling’ in Appendix 1), suggesting that Brl1 dissociates at later stages of NPC assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Altogether, these results show that Brl1 preferentially binds NPC assembly intermediates that are composed of the central scaffold (early tier) but lack the peripheral nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic structures (intermediate and late tier) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Of note, the labeling differences we observed cannot be explained by variations in NUP turnover as evidenced by the analysis of NUP labeling rates in the source cell lysates (see section ‘Analysis of protein labeling in source cell lysates’ in Appendix 1). Despite the different labeling rates in KARMA assays, the analysis of Brl1 APs from mixtures of labeled and unlabeled yeast lysates showed almost complete intermixing of Brl1-bound NUP complexes during the AP procedure, pointing to a highly dynamic binding of Brl1 to NPC assembly intermediates (for details, see section <italic>‘</italic>Lysate intermixing assays’ in Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Depletion of Brl1 interferes with NPC maturation</title><p>Having established that Brl1 interacts with immature NPCs, we wanted to elucidate how the absence of Brl1 affects NPC assembly.

New Mlp1, Nup133, and Nup188 mainly still localized to the NE homogeneously, with occasional single foci observed for new Nup133 and Nup188. At the same time, newly synthesized Nup82 formed multiple and bright foci either in the cytoplasm or NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). By contrast, the localization of old proteins was not affected for any tested NUP. Together, our results reveal that removal of Brl1 triggers the formation of NE herniations as a consequence of halted NPC assembly, whereas previously assembled NPCs are not affected by the lack of Brl1.</p><p>To systematically explore the composition of the NPC assembly intermediates that accumulate in the absence of Brl1, we once more employed metabolic labeling coupled to affinity purification mass spectrometry. We used Nup170 as an affinity bait since it binds early during NPC maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>), enabling us to purify both mature NPCs and intermediate structures upon Brl1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To this end, we pulse-labeled newly synthesized proteins in parallel with the induction of Brl1 degradation, and subsequently quantified the metabolic labeling for all co-purified proteins. For NUPs that are able to assemble into intermediates in the absence of Brl1, we expect to find a mixture of unlabeled (old) and labeled (new) proteins in Nup170 APs. However, for NUPs dependent on Brl1 for their assembly, only pre-assembled, old proteins will be captured. Thus, proteins dependent on Brl1 for their incorporation are expected to have slower labeling rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>In Brl1-depleted cells, the metabolic labeling of NUPs was generally slower than for the bulk of co-purified proteins. Such a delay was not observed in control cells, implying that the NPC maturation process is affected when Brl1 is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, the labeling delay was not identical for all NUPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While most MR, NB, and IR complex NUPs were labeled comparable to the dynamic NTRs, the cytoplasmic export platform NUPs and Mlp1 incorporated labeling substantially slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left). This is in agreement with the densities observed by cryo-ET and corroborates that the observed herniations are indeed incomplete NPC assembly intermediates that have not yet acquired the cytoplasmic structure and that Mlp1 is recruited very late to the NPC. Of note, the differences in NUP labeling observed upon Brl1 depletion with Nup170 correlate well with the labeling rates in KARMA assays with Brl1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This indicates that most NUPs that assemble after the Brl1-dependent assembly step (slow labeling in KARMA assays with the Brl1 bait) can no longer incorporate into the NPC once Brl1 is degraded (slow labeling in KARMA assays when Brl1 is depleted).</p><p>Of note, the metabolic labeling of the bulk of co-purified proteins was also overall delayed upon Brl1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is consistent with the decreased growth rate that can be observed in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, the lysate intermixing assays showed a significantly higher degree of NUP exchange during the AP procedure in the Nup170 APs when Brl1 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>, section ‘Lysate intermixing assays’ in Appendix 1).

We therefore wanted to mechanistically understand how Brl1 promotes NPC biogenesis.

Brl1Δah and Brl1(I395D) initially localized to the NE-ER network, occasionally forming bright foci at the NE. However, after 6 hr of expression most of the protein was localized in large NE accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of Brl1 with an unperturbed AH uniformly localized to the NE and ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), as also shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saitoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The accumulation of overexpressed Brl1(I395D) was not dependent on endogenous Brl1, as there was no difference in the fraction of cells with NE foci of Brl1(I395D), irrespectively of whether endogenous Brl1 was inducibly degraded or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Since wildtype Brl1 is unable to fulfill its function upon overexpression of the ahBrl1 mutants, we also wanted to analyze the localization of the endogenous copy of Brl1 in these conditions.

This suggests that a sequestration of endogenous Brl1 to these accumulations could potentially lead to the dominant negative effect of the ahBrl1 mutants and that a critical concentration of Brl1 with a functional AH is needed for successful membrane fusion at NPC assembly sites. The dominant negative growth defect of overexpressed ahBrl1 mutants could thus be caused by the formation of toxic assemblies, which also trap the endogenous Brl1 protein.</p><p>To test whether Brl1(I395D) can dynamically exchange between NE accumulations or is trapped there, we probed the dynamics of Brl1(I395D)-mCherry at the herniations with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We co-expressed either Brl1-mCherry or Brl1(I395D)-mCherry with Sec61-yEGFP, a transmembrane protein, that can freely diffuse between the ER/ONM and the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng and Hochstrasser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Popken et al., 2015</xref>). We compared the fluorescence recovery of Brl1-mCherry with Sec61-yEGFP in an arbitrary NE region and saw that both proteins fully recover with a comparable half-life (τ<sub>1/2</sub>) of ~2 s, indicating that they freely diffuse in the membrane of the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This is in line with the results of our lysate intermixing experiments pointing to a highly dynamic binding of Brl1 to NPC assembly intermediates (see section ‘Lysis intermixing assays’ in Appendix 1” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B–D</xref>). Next, we photobleached the fluorescent signal of Brl1(I395D)-mCherry and Sec61-yEGFP in the NE-attached foci and observed that Brl1(I395D)-mCherry has a high immobile fraction that is not replaced over the time scale of 25 s, while Sec61-yEGFP almost fully recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The τ<sub>1/2</sub> of recovery of the mobile fraction of Brl1(I395D)-mCherry is comparable to Brl1-mCherry. These data suggest that Brl(I395D)-mCherry accumulates in foci at the NE in which it is irreversibly trapped.</p><p>This observation motivated us to further characterize the foci at the NE, and we wanted to test whether these NE accumulations of Brl1(I395D)-mCherry also trap NPC components. To this end, we analyzed the co-localization of Brl1(I395D)-mCherry with several yEGFP-tagged Nups: Nup116, Nup133, and Nup170 display regular NE localization and importantly could be detected in the NE regions adjacent to the Brl1(I395D)-mCherry foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, Nup82 intensity at NE areas with Brl1(I395D)-mCherry puncta was strongly reduced.

To our surprise upon Brl1(I395D) overexpression, we also found large multilayered herniations with diameters up to ~600 nm, so far not reported in any other NPC assembly mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Aiv–vi</xref> , <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1 fig7video2">Figure 7—videos 1; 2</xref>). These onion-like structures are composed of elongated INM herniations curling over each other with up to four stacked double bilayers. Of note, intermembrane distances were remarkably constant with two discrete widths of the innermost sheets, suggesting two different maturation modes for the onion-like herniations (see section ‘Model for the development of “onion-like” herniations’ in Appendix 1). Unlike the herniations in Brl1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), these structures were not filled with electron-dense material and only occasionally enclosed small patches of aggregate-like densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Av–vi</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1 fig7video2">Figure 7—videos 1; 2</xref>).

The observation that the essential luminal ahBrl1 has a propensity to bind highly curved membranes and that Brl1 acts prior to INM-ONM fusion raises the possibility that Brl1 acts as a fusogen with membrane deforming properties. By deforming the INM, Brl1 could assist in the last NPC maturation step: the formation of a nucleo-cytoplasmic transport channel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The NPC is one of the largest cellular protein complexes, yet only a few non-NPC proteins have been implicated in its biogenesis. One such factor is the integral membrane protein Brl1. However, at which stage Brl1 acts in the NPC assembly process or the mechanistic details have remained elusive. In this study, we show that Brl1 specifically associates with early NPC assembly intermediates, and we provide evidence for its role in membrane fusion.</p><p>Based on its binding capacity to structural NUPs, it was previously proposed that Brl1 associates with NPC maturation intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Using our recently developed KARMA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>), we now demonstrate that Brl1 indeed preferentially interacts with newly synthesized NUPs and primarily co-localizes with newly produced NUP assemblies in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Furthermore, functional inactivation of Brl1 stalls NPC assembly without affecting previously assembled NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). This leads to the accumulation of NE herniations that have a continuous ONM and contain incompletely assembled NPCs lacking the cytoplasmic export platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, our results clearly identify Brl1 as an NPC assembly factor.</p><p>Depletion of Brl1 leads to the formation of incomplete NPC structures that contain the IR, MR, Y-complex, and NB NUPs. The cytoplasmic Nup159 and Nup82 are absent from the intermediates but are instead mislocalized in cytoplasmic foci, as previously seen in other NPC assembly mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onischenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Onischenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In light of the observed NE herniations in Brl1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), the fusion of the INM and ONM appears to be a prerequisite for the recruitment of the cytoplasmic Nup159-Nup82-Nsp1 complex. Thus, our data support an inside-out mode of interphase NPC assembly, similar to previous observations in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wente and Blobel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murphy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zabel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, in Brl1-depleted cells the Y-complex NUPs display a reduced NE fluorescence signal and slow fractional labeling in our proteomic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C and D</xref>). This suggests that only the nucleoplasmic Y-complex ring is present in the intermediates. This is also in line with our cryo-ET data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and with previous results in <italic>nup116∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allegretti et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that INM-ONM fusion is needed before the cytoplasmic Y-ring can be recruited to the assembling NPC.</p><p>Curiously, intermixing rates of the NUP complexes when affinity isolated with early recruited NUP Nup170 significantly increased upon Brl1 depletion and were overall much higher than previously reported for APs with Mlp1 that preferentially associates with otherwise matured NPC structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). This may indicate that NPC assembly intermediates are inherently unstable prior to pore membrane fusion.</p><p>Interestingly, Mlp1 and other NB components such as NUP1, which join very late during the normal course of NPC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>), were still readily recruited to the NE upon Brl1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates that the NB constituents including Mlp1 might assemble in a kinetically slow process that does not strictly depend on membrane fusion. Consistent with this, complexes between NB NUPs Nup60, Nup2, and Mlp1 could be reconstituted in the absence of other NUPs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cibulka et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The fusion of INM and ONM is a crucial step during de novo NPC assembly in interphase. Membrane fusion does not occur spontaneously, and based on previously characterized membrane fusion events, it is likely that two NE lipid bilayers must be brought into proximity to initiate the fusion of the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peeters et al., 2022</xref>). While the fusion event itself is expected to be fast and thus difficult to investigate, potential assembly intermediate states in which INM and ONM approach each other but are not yet fused can be observed in cells with NPC assembly defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thaller and Patrick Lusk, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makio et al., 2009</xref>) and rarely also in normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>) and our cryo-ET data (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). It has been suggested that NUPs and other proteins containing amphipathic helices are important players in the formation and stabilization of these early NPC-intermediates since they can bind to and deform membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schooley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cibulka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identified a membrane-binding AH within the luminal domain of Brl1 that is essential for its function in NPC assembly as genetic perturbations that abolish membrane binding lead to severely impaired NPC biogenesis. Interestingly, this AH preferentially binds to highly curved lipid membranes, is highly conserved in organisms with closed mitosis, and is a shared feature of proteins associated with NPC assembly such as Brr6, Apq12, and ER-bending reticulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, these results emphasize the emerging role of AH motifs in NPC assembly.</p><p>Brr6 is a paralogue of Brl1 with the same topology and orientation in the NE. Interestingly, Brr6 also contains a predicted luminal AH, indicating that both proteins might function similarly. Furthermore, it has been shown that Brr6 co-localizes at Brl1 foci at the NE and physically interacts with Brl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saitoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Although thermosensitive <italic>brr6</italic> and <italic>brl1</italic> mutants can be rescued by <italic>BRL1</italic> and <italic>BRR6</italic> expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saitoh et al., 2005</xref>), deletion of BRL1 or BRR6 cannot be rescued by overexpression of the respective paralogue. Furthermore, several NPC assembly mutants such as <italic>gle2Δ</italic>, <italic>nup116Δ,</italic> and <italic>nup116ΔGLFG PMET3-NUP188</italic> can only be rescued by Brl1 overexpression. This demonstrates that despite similar sequence (44% sequence similarity of the structured parts) and structure, Brl1 and Brr6 do not act redundantly in NPC assembly. This is also in agreement with the differential localization of these two proteins: Brl1 mainly localizes to the INM, whereas Brr6 can be found in both NE leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that Brl1 and Brr6 act in concert during NPC assembly and membrane fusion; however, the detailed function of Brr6 and the role of additional NUPs and potential assembly factors like Apq12 remains unclear and awaits further characterization.</p><p>How does Brl1 promote interphase NPC assembly? Our observations that NPC assembly intermediates that form in the absence of Brl1 already contain membrane-binding NUPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) suggest that they play a key role in deforming the INM, leading to INM evaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>, left). We propose that Brl1 is recruited to and concentrated at these NPC assembly sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This view is supported by the punctate localization pattern of endogenously tagged Brl1-yEGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lone et al., 2015</xref>), co-localization of Brl1-puncta with newly synthesized NUPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and accumulation of dysfunctional Brl1 mutants at stalled NPC assembly sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The mechanisms by which Brl1 is recruited and concentrated at assembly sites are not clear but the unstructured N-terminus of Brl1 might contribute. This is supported by the non-punctate localization of Brr6 that contains only a short N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lone et al., 2015</xref>). A localization preference of Brl1 to highly curved membranes of INM evaginations could be an alternative explanation, which is supported by the binding preference of ahBrl1 to highly curved lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Irrespectively, it seems likely that a high local concentration of Brl1 is critical for membrane fusion as overexpression of Brl1 can rescue assembly defects in multiple NUP mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The role of Brl1 during nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Brl1 (red) enriches on the inside of NPC maturation intermediates and promotes inner nuclear membrane–outer nuclear membrane (INM-ONM) fusion through the membrane-binding amphipathic helix (AH) motif and likely in cooperation with Brr6 (yellow). (<bold>B</bold>) If Brl1 cannot reach the critical concentration required to promote membrane fusion, unresolved nuclear envelope (NE) herniations, filled with electron-dense material, appear. (<bold>C</bold>) Overexpressed Brl1(I395D) with a perturbed AH (blue) concentrates at the NPC assembly site. It remodels the NE membranes and leads to expanded multilayered herniations but ultimately fails to induce membrane fusion. (<bold>D</bold>) Brl1 at the INM can only physically interact with Brr6 or Brl1 at the ONM when the NE leaflets approach as it is the case at NPC assembly sites. Dimensions based on our cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and measurements of the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78385-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our results show that ahBrl1 is required for the INM-ONM fusion event since cells that express Brl1 with an impaired AH are not viable and overexpression of Brl1(I395D) inhibits NPC biogenesis, leading to the formation of incomplete NPC assemblies with multilayered INM herniations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Brl1(I395D) accumulates irreversibly in these structures as shown by the high concentration and slow mobility in herniations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Interestingly, the surface of the highly curved liposomes to which ahBrl1 preferentially binds topologically resembles the luminal side of INM evaginations. Both structures have a similar high positive curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, and model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This raises the possibility that Brl1 can bind, and potentially induce and/or stabilize highly curved, energetically unfavorable pre-fusion intermediates.</p><p>Since overexpressed Brl1(I395D) strongly accumulates at NPC assembly sites and induces the formation of highly curved onion-like membrane sheets, we speculate that in the absence of a functional AH Brl1 can still mediate membrane remodeling but not INM and ONM fusion. This points to an important role of ahBrl1 in the membrane fusion event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). But how could Brl1 and its AH mediate the fusion of the INM and ONM? Interestingly, the AlphaFold structure of Brl1 not only predicted an AH but also revealed the presence of a luminal, ~8-nm-long continuous alpha-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) that is stabilized by disulfide bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Whereas this helix is too short to span the entire ~20 nm of the NE lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>), it is conceivable that at INM herniations, where the two leaflets approach each other, this helix could interact with proteins in the ONM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Intriguingly, a helix of similar length is also predicted in Brr6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that Brl1 at the INM interacts with Brr6 at the ONM at early NPC assembly sites and that this interaction leads to INM-ONM fusion mediated by the conserved AHs present in both proteins. This possibility is supported by the physical interaction of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), functional requirement of both paralogues for NPC biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and differential localization patterns of Brl1 and Brr6 in immunogold labeling assays wherein Brl1 predominantly localizes at the INM while Brr6 is equally distributed between INM and ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Aside from the direct role in membrane fusion, Brl1 might also affect the lipid composition of the NE. Indeed, it has been proposed that Brl1 forms a sensory complex with Brr6 and Apq12 that controls membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lone et al., 2015</xref>). During NE fusion and other NPC assembly steps, the membrane curvature of the NE is extensively modulated and changes in lipid composition, either globally or locally at NPC assembly sites, could facilitate this process. In fact, in Apq12-overexpressing cells, phosphatidic acid (PA) accumulates at sites of ONM overproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Romanauska and Köhler, 2018</xref>). A similar PA accumulation was reported at <italic>nup116Δ</italic> herniations, indicating that PA might be a relevant effector during NPC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thaller et al., 2021</xref>). However, the effects of Brl1, Brr6, and Apq12 on lipid composition are somewhat controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), requiring better tools to understand the role of lipid environment in NPC biogenesis. Of note, membrane proliferation or remodeling can also be induced by an overexpression of membrane proteins without necessarily altering the overall lipid composition. For example, overexpression of transmembrane proteins induces the formation of karmellae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wright et al., 1988</xref>), expansions of the NE/ER membranes. Similarly, overexpression of AH-containing NUPs was shown to induce NE overproliferation, resulting in multiple, stacked membrane cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mészáros et al., 2015</xref>) that were also observed upon overexpression of Brl1 or Brr6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that NE overproliferation also plays a role in the generation of the onion-like herniations that we observe in cells overexpressing the dominant-negative Brl1 variant, Brl(I395D). In the future, it will be important to manipulate NE lipids and characterize the effects of membrane composition in NPC assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Protomers outside the lamella were excluded by manual inspection. For mature NPCs, we used 179 protomers (53 excluded from 232 protomers) for the final average.

We also believe that the electron-dense center of herniations in Brl1-depleted cells limited the resolution of our average. Several trials with different masks, bandpass filters, and classification based on membrane curvature did not improve resolution.

The label-free assay library contained b and y transition ions (for a total of 3918 protein groups, 75,780 precursors, and 105,089 transitions). The SILAC assay library comprised y transitions only, with the heavy-channel (K+8.014199) generated in silico using the ‘inverted spike in’ workflow (for a total of 3825 protein groups, 97,069 precursors). Only tryptic peptides with a maximum of two missed cleavages were considered. Carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation was set as variable modification. Spectra were searched against the SGD protein database (downloaded on 13/10/2015, 6713 entries) concatenated with entries for contaminants and iRT peptides using a 1% FDR control at peptide and protein level.</p><p>The label-free and SILAC DIA datasets were extracted with the respective spectral libraries using Spectronaut v.15 (Biognosys AG). Default settings were used for the chromatogram extraction, except the machine learning option was set to ‘across experiment’ and ‘cross-run normalization’ was excluded. The ion intensities at the fragment level were exported for further analysis in R. Raw MS data, the spectral libraries, and the DIA data extractions generated with Spectronaut are uploaded in the PRIDE repository.</p></sec><sec id="s4-32"><title>Labeling quantification in affinity pulldowns</title><p>Analysis of protein labeling in KARMA assays with Brl1 bait was implemented in R (‘<italic>Labeling_BRL1AP.R’</italic>). Initially, low-quality fragment ions were excluded from further analysis based on the Spectronaut ‘F.ExcludedFromQuantification’ flag. Additionally, only proteotypic y-type fragment ions with a single lysine residue that were found in both heavy and light channels were retained. The remaining fragment ion intensities were summed for each precursor in heavy and light channels as the respective precursor intensity. Unreliable precursor ions that were detected in fewer than two out of three biological replicates in any of the three post-labeling time points (30, 60, and 90 min) were also excluded. The fractional labeling of the remaining precursor ions was then calculated as H/(H + L), where H and L are the precursor intensities in heavy and light channels. The median protein labeling within each sample was computed as the median fractional labeling of all precursors. As an additional quality criterion, we also computed the root mean square error (RMSE) of the labeling values for every precursor from the respective protein median across all nine samples. For any protein, the precursors with the 50% highest RMSEs were discarded, and the final protein labeling was computed as the median fractional labeling of the remaining high-quality precursors. As a last filtration step, proteins with visually noisy labeling trajectories across the biological replicates and time points were excluded in a blinded manner. For the comparison of NUP labeling rates with Brl1 bait and 10 NUP baits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), only NUPs reproducibly found with all 11 baits were considered. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, the median from three biological replicates was taken and labeling values were normalized to the bait labeling.</p><p>Protein labeling in the Nup170 APs of Brl1-AID strains (‘<italic>Labeling_NUP170AP_BRL1AID.R’</italic>) was analyzed the same way as for Brl1 APs, except that precursor ions found in at least one out of three replicates in all post-labeling time points were also considered for quantification. The fractional labeling ratio between the auxin-treated cells and the ethanol solvent control was calculated for each biological replicate and post-labeling time point (4 hr, 4.5 hr, and 5 hr) and the average ± SEM is plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).</p><p>For the lysate intermixing assays (‘<italic>LysisIntermixingTest.R’</italic>), the protein fractional labeling was quantified essentially as described above except that low-intensity precursor ions (&lt;100) were filtered out and only proteins characterized by more than three precursor ions were considered (due to the low extent of intermixing, Brl1 bait is only characterized by two precursor ions that were found in both heavy and light). To get the intermixing extent, NUP fractional labeling was normalized to the mean fractional labeling of all co-purified proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-33"><title>Label-free quantification in affinity pulldowns</title><p>The exact specification of the quantitative analysis pipeline of protein abundances is given by the respective code in R (‘<italic>Label-Free_BRL1AP.R’</italic>). In brief, NUP abundances in the AP with Brl1 bait, low-quality fragment ions were excluded based on Spectronaut ‘F.ExcludedFromQuantification’ flag. For each proteotypic precursor ion, all the remaining fragment ions were summed and the resulting intensities were median normalized across samples. Precursor ions that were not found in all three biological replicates were omitted. Protein intensities were calculated based on the average of the top 3 most intense precursor ions, only considering NUPs and NTRs characterized by a minimum of three ions and also reproducibly found in the KARMA assay with Brl1 bait. The intensity of proteins in APs with NUP baits was essentially quantified the same, except that the only precursors found in three replicates with all 10 handles were considered for quantification. To assess the enrichment differences between the early and late tier baits for all 1523 co-purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), for each bait the median protein intensity of three biological replicates was taken. Then, the fold difference between the median of all baits from a respective assembly tier was calculated. To focus on non-NPC proteins, NUPs and NTRs were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-34"><title>Statistics and data visualization</title><p>No statistical method was used to estimate sample sizes.

sec-type="appendix" id="s8"><title>Analysis of protein labeling in source cell lysates</title><p>To ensure that the observed differences in labeling kinetics in the Brl1 KARMA assay do not simply stem from the protein turnover, we assessed the labeling of several proteins in the source cell lysates of the APs by PRM MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peterson et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, both NTRs and two randomly picked abundant co-purified proteins showed essentially the same metabolic labeling in the source cell lysates and the corresponding APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). NUPs from different assembly tiers did not show a systematic labeling difference in the source cell lysate, as was the case for the AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). This shows that the labeling differences are specific to the Brl1 AP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Lysate intermixing assays</title><p>To test for the extent dynamic exchange of NUPs during the Brl1 AP procedure, we took advantage of the lysate intermixing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tackett et al., 2005</xref>) and quantified the metabolic labeling in AP fractions of equal mixes of wildtype culture grown in heavy lysine medium and a Brl1 affinity-tagged strain grown in light lysine medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, we found that all NUPs co-isolated with Brl1 readily intermixed to more than 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). The high extent of intermixing suggests that Brl1 likely associates with NUPs very dynamic. Interestingly, we also observed a pronounced negative correlation between NUP metabolic labeling in KARMA assays and the intermixing tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which may point to a tighter biding of Brl1 to young NUP assemblies.</p><p>The high intermixing rates could also be contributed by a lower stability of early NPC assembly intermediates bound by Brl1 compared to the mature NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This view is supported (i) by considerably higher intermixing rates for NUPs co-isolated with the early tier Nup170 bait upon Brl1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and (ii) the much higher NUP dynamic exchange rates observed in the early tier Nup170 APs (~60%) compared to previously reported for the outstandingly late recruited Mlp1 bait (~20%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>), which likely isolates a population of otherwise completely assembled NPCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Kinetic state modeling</title><p>The high labeling rates in KARMA assays with the Brl1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the in vivo fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>) both indicate that Brl1 preferentially binds to young NPC assemblies. In the lysis intermixing tests, we found that Brl1 interacts with the NPCs highly dynamically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B–D</xref>) and likely also loosely binds to mature structures. Consistent with this, we still detect intermediate and late NUPs in Brl1 AP fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To assess the binding preference of Brl1 in a more quantitative manner, we made use of the three-step KSM that we have previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). Note that the KSM that was originally designed to account for completely inaccessible fraction of mature NPCs (e.g., ones that are sequestered and cannot be isolated), but in the context of Brl1, these fractions have a new meaning reflecting the lower affinity of Brl1 to late complexes. Our KSM analysis revealed that a considerable fraction of primarily early tier NUPs become inaccessible to Brl1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The smaller inaccessible fractions of late and intermediate NUPs indicate Brl1 partly dissociates from early intermediates prior to their assembly. By contrast, NUP baits almost never led to inaccessible pools, consistent with them being constitutively bound and not leaving the mature NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>For the quantitative interpretation of KARMA readouts, it is important to consider the effects of dynamic exchange. In KARMA assays, the intermixing between assembly intermediates bound by the bait and those that are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1E</xref>, red arrows) would diminish deviations of labeling rates from the source cell lysates. It is therefore conceivable that our labeling values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>) are underestimated due to post-lysis intermixing. Although our lysate intermixing assays indeed show high exchange rates of Brl1-bound NUPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>), dynamic exchange within the bait-bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1E</xref>, green arrows), which does not have an influence on the labeling in KARMA assays, contributes to the labeling in the intermixing assay. In the future, for more accurate evaluation of labeling kinetics it might be advantageous to minimize post-lysis intermixing by a mild fixation step similar to what has been done before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakhverdyan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Subbotin and Chait, 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Control of protein labeling in KARMA (<italic>K</italic>inetic Analysis of Incorporation <italic>R</italic>ates in <italic>M</italic>acromolecular <italic>A</italic>ssemblies) assays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fractional labeling of nucleoporins (NUPs) and nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) in KARMA assays with Brl1 bait and the respective source lysate, 90 min after labeling onset.

Interestingly, we noticed a remarkably constant spacing between the two bilayers and the enclosed nuclear space. Morphometric analysis of the different lipid layers reveals that the middle sheets consisting of two INMs have a very regular spacing of ~13 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A and B</xref>). The intermembrane spacing in the outer layer consisting of INM and ONM is significantly wider (~19 nm), which is very similar to the spacing of regular NE in our control condition (~21 nm). Interestingly, the innermost layers show a bimodal distribution with two peaks at heights of the INM-INM middle layers and the INM-ONM outer layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A and B</xref>). This could be explained by two distinct maturation mechanisms of the onion-like structures. In maturation mode 1, an elongated herniation curls around a part of the cytoplasm and further grows until membrane fusion leads to the enclosure of cytoplasm in the very center of the herniation. Growth and fusion events of subsequent herniations then result in the multilayered herniations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with this mechanism, we sometimes see ribosome-like densities in the center of the herniations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>, rightmost panel). In maturation mode 2, a herniation curls over another one, leading to an INM-INM inner bilayer.

For example, a clear implication of the model is that the AH might have a positive-membrane curvature sensing ability that could contribute to its sorting to an NPC biogenesis site and/or a putative direct role in membrane remodeling. This could be tested by AH floatation on liposomes of different curvatures. Such experiments could also incorporate testing the binding of the AH to liposomes of different lipid compositions.

It remains possible, for example, that the AH is required for the formation of the herniations even in this compromised state. Thus, a suggestion is to perform the overexpression of the I395D mutant in the context of the Auxin-induced degradation of Brl1. As additional cryo-FIB/ET might be too much to ask, even examining how the I395D mutant localizes at the level of fluorescence microscopy may be informative. i.e. is the AH required to recruit the Brl1I395D mutant to an NPC assembly site where further multimerization contributes to the elaborate hernia? Another alternative for in vivo experiments would be to replace the AH with other established curvature sensitive (or not) AHs and test their functionality in complementing viability and nup localization in the Brl1 knockout or ostir backgrounds.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors have previously established the KARMA methodology to characterize the NPC assembly process (Onischenko et al., 2020). Here, by similarly performing affinity purifications (APs) using distinct baits (Brl1, Nup170), they report a significant degree of post-lysis intermixing, i.e. NPC subunits exchanging between the lysate and the immunopurified complexes during the experimental procedure. Although they suggest that intermixing likely leads to an under-estimation of the labeling differences they observe for different NPC sub-complexes, this observation raises additional questions. Could the authors comment on the fact that APs performed using the scaffold subunit Nup170 as a bait show intermixing in control conditions (ethanol treatment, Figure S3D), while Mlp1 APs showed very low levels of exchanges in their previous study? In the case of Brl1 APs (Figure 2), intermixing could arise from the dynamic nature of Brl1 association with NPC intermediates. Is it observed for Brl1 when identified as a prey in Nups APs? While this observation does not challenge the authors' conclusions, which are validated by orthogonal approaches, the text should clearly warn about the necessity to systematically control for intermixing in such experiments.</p><p>2. Although Brl1 preferentially associates with early NPC intermediates (Figures 1-2), it is remarkable that Brl1 APs do not identify the transmembrane nucleoporins (Pom34 and Ndc1). Since detergent is added after lysis and removal of insoluble material by centrifugation (Methods section), it is possible that only a fraction of these transmembrane proteins are actually accessible during the pull-down. Detergent has been shown to be critical to solubilize Brl1 from cell lysates (see Figure 5 in Saitoh et al., 2005). Could the authors comment on this issue, which could potentially introduce biases in Brl1 APs?</p><p>3. The authors' data convincingly demonstrate that overexpression of the AH-deficient Brl1 mutant halts NPC biogenesis at a stage preceding membrane fusion, but do not prove that Brl1 directly acts as a fusogen. The title should thereby be modified accordingly (for example, an amphipathic helix in Brl1 is required for nuclear pore complex biogenesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). Additional characterization of AH features is expected to provide mechanistic clues to Brl1 function in the fusion process:</p><p>– The AH motif could interact with the luminal side of the INM, stabilizing membrane curvature at NPC assembly sites, and/or bind to the luminal side of the ONM, favoring the fusion. Addressing these questions is challenging, yet the authors should test whether Brl1 AH interacts preferentially with small diameter, highly-curved liposomes in floatation assays (Figure 5E).</p><p>– Does Brl1 AH contribute to the interaction with Brr6, which was previously scored in immunoprecipitation experiments (Lone et al., 2015)? It should also be stated whether Brl1 partners (Brr6, Apq12) are identified among the factors enriched with early NPC intermediates (Figure S1A) or in Brl1 APs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a few instances where corrections or improved data would improve the manuscript. These include the analysis of the in vivo interactions of the AH with membranes and interpretation of the Nup82 localization data in Figure 6D. These are detailed in specific comments to the authors.</p><p>1) As pointed out in the public review, a significant addition to the manuscript would be to examine the interactions of an ahBrl1 point mutant (e.g. Brl1(I395D)) with Nups using the KARMA approach. This could provide important insights into the nature of the Brl1(I395D) interactions with the observed NPC intermediates. I don't see these data as absolutely necessary for the manuscript, but they would provide important insight into the functional consequences of AH mutations.</p><p>2) In the Brl1(I395D)-mCherry expressing cells (Figure 6D), Nup82 appears reduced but not absent or excluded from areas where Brl1(I395D)-mCherry accumulates as suggested by the authors. This can be seen in the upper half of the Nup82-yeGFP image panel of Brl1(I395D)-mCherry expressing cells. Moreover, the maximum intensity plot of Nup82 shows a small but visible intensity increase at the NE. I suggest the authors address this point in their discussion of these data.</p><p>3) The authors' assessment of the in vivo interactions of the Brl1 AH with membranes is not strong. Localization of the ahBrl1-yEGFP fusion protein to the NE in cells (Figure 5F) does not show that the construct binds membranes in vivo. Curiously, the ahBrl1-yEGFP seems to bind the NE but not other membranes (e.g. the vacuolar membranes). This is especially surprising since the ahBrl1-yEGFP fusion protein is presumably positioned on the cytoplasmic side of the NE membrane. The significance of the membrane association of the ahBrl1-yEGFP construct would be more convincing if the I395D or F391D mutant were to not bind the membranes when expressed in cells.</p><p>4) It appears the 3h and 6h time point images in Figure 6B are reversed.</p><p>5) In the Discussion (pg. 22), the authors reference several manuscripts for their proposed models of &quot;inside out&quot; NPC assembly. It should be noted that these citations are preceded by studies in yeast where a similar model was proposed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78385.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is considerable enthusiasm for the quality of the data presented in the manuscript and the conclusions, which are well justified.

We performed the requested experiment by testing the binding propensity of ahBrl1 to liposomes of different diameters in an in vitro flotation assay (new Figure 5F). Interestingly, ahBrl1 preferentially binds to highly curved lipid membranes. As reviewer 1 points out, this preference could contribute to the proper localization of Brl1 to early NPC assembly sites. Further, binding to highly curved lipid membranes also indicates that ahBrl1 potentially induces and/or stabilizes the high membrane curvature that is required for INM-ONM fusion.</p><p>We agree that testing different lipid compositions could be interesting. However, such experiments might be difficult to interpret since, aside from evidence that PA might be enriched at NPC assembly sites [7,8], the lipid composition at the inner NE and at NPC assembly sites remains uncertain.</p><p>We have added the experiment to Figure 5 (Figure 5F) and changed the text in the Results and Discussion section accordingly:</p><p>“Fusion of lipid membranes is typically accompanied by the formation of highly curved fusion intermediates. We therefore tested the affinity of ahBrl1 to membranes with different curvature in a liposome flotation assay with liposomes of various sizes (Figure 5F). Indeed, we observed that MBP-ahBrl1-yEGFP preferentially binds to highly curved liposomes with a diameter of 30 nm. Enrichment with 100 nm liposomes was less pronounced and binding to 400 nm liposomes did not exceed the level of the non-lipid binding control construct (MBP-yEGFP). Together, these results demonstrate that ahBrl1 binds to highly curved lipid membranes in vitro and is essential for cell viability.”</p><p>“The mechanisms by which Brl1 is recruited and concentrated at assembly sites is not clear but the unstructured N-terminus of Brl1 might contribute. This is supported by the non-punctate localization of Brr6 which contains only a short N-terminus [4]. A localization preference of Brl1 to highly curved membranes of INM evaginations could be an alternative explanation, which is supported by the binding preference of ahBrl1 to highly curved lipid-membranes (Figure 5F).”</p><p>“Interestingly, the surface of the highly curved liposomes to which ahBrl1 preferentially binds, topologically resemble the luminal side of INM evaginations. Both structures have a similar high positive curvature (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, 5F and model in figure 8A). This raises the possibility that Brl1 can bind, and potentially induce and/or stabilize, highly curved, energetically unfavorable pre-fusion intermediates.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, in vivo experiments might also be helpful to provide insight into the function of the AH.

We performed the suggested experiment and monitored the localization of overexpressed Brl1(I395D) in cells inducibly depleted of the endogenous Brl1 by fluorescence microscopy. The respective figure panel has been added in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C. We did not observe any significant difference in the number of nuclear envelope foci containing Brl1(I395D), irrespective of whether endogenous Brl1 was degraded or not. Furthermore, the mislocalization of Nup82 is the same in the two conditions (Figure 5C). These results suggest that the NPC assembly defects, including the recruitment of Brl1(I395D) to NPC assembly sites and the formation of the multi-layered herniations, are not dependent on the presence of functional Brl1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

First, we would like to note that when comparing the lysate intermixing results for the Mlp1 bait in [6] and the Nup170 bait in this study (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), one has to consider the different scaling used in the plots. While in Onischenko et al. [6] the labeling in the intermixing experiment is plotted directly (ranging from 0 – 0.5), the current study expresses the intermixing as the extent of labeling compared to the average labeling for non-specifically isolated proteins (0% – 100%). Nevertheless, we fully agree with the reviewer that the intermixing rates with the Nup170 bait are significantly higher than what was observed in the Mlp1 AP. We believe that these differences arise from the extremely late recruitment of Mlp1 to the NPC [6] effectively only probing the pool of mature and stable complexes. This is in stark contrast to the Nup170 APs that probe a significant pool of early assembly intermediates that contain Nup170 [6], which are likely more dynamic. This is further supported by our comparative analysis of intermixing rates in Nup170 APs in NPC assembly intermediates halted upon Brl1 depletion, where we observe a more dynamic behavior (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). Of note, the prime reason why the NPC assembly model was tested for resilience to the Mlp1 AP post-lysis intermixing in [6] was the outstandingly large maturation pools for Mlp1, where the effect of post-lysis intermixing in absolute terms is much bigger compared to all other baits.</p><p>To acknowledge the differences in lysate intermixing rates, we added the following note to the <italic>“Lysate intermixing assays</italic>” appendix detailing the purpose and interpretation of the lysate intermixing assays:</p><p>“The high intermixing rates could also be contributed by a lower stability of early NPC assembly intermediates bound by Brl1 compared to the mature NPCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). This view is supported (i) by considerably higher intermixing rates for NUPs co-isolated with the early tier Nup170 bait upon Brl1 depletion (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D) and (ii) the much higher NUP dynamic exchange rates observed in the early tier Nup170 APs (~60%) compared to previously reported for the outstandingly late recruited Mlp1 bait (~20%, [6]), which likely isolates a population of otherwise completely assembled NPCs.”</p><p>In KARMA assays proteins can dynamically exchange between bait-bound fractions of NPC assembly intermediates and fractions not normally bound by the bait, or just within bait-bound fractions (Appendix 1—Figure 1E). The labeling in the KARMA assays is only sensitive to intermixing happening between unbound and bait-bound fractions, where any dynamic exchange diminishes the observed labeling deviations from the source cell lysate. At the same time, our lysate intermixing assays test the total extent of intermixing, including that within the bait-bound fractions (to which KARMA readouts are immune). Therefore, there is no contradiction between the high in vitro intermixing rates that are observed for NUPs in the Brl1 APs (Appendix 1—Figure 1C) and the over-labelling of the first tier NUPs that was observed in the KARMA assays with Brl1 (Figure 2B and 2D). The only reasonable explanation for these observations is that Brl1 dynamically interacts with immature NUP complexes. To further support this conclusion, we followed the reviewer's suggestion and re-analysed the KARMA data [6] for Brl1 as a prey. We observe that Brl1 indeed shows the signature of a dynamic protein, with labeling patterns similar to dynamic NUPs and NTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>).</p><p>We added following lines to the results chapter “<italic>Brl1 binds to assembling nuclear pore complexes</italic>” that addresses the likely origin of high lysate intermixing in Brl1 APs:</p><p>“Despite the different labeling rates in KARMA assays, the analysis of Brl1 APs from mixtures of labeled and unlabeled yeast lysates showed almost complete intermixing of Brl1-bound NUP complexes during the AP procedure, pointing to a highly dynamic binding of Brl1 to NPC assembly intermediates (for details see Appendix 1 section: “Lysate intermixing assays”).”</p><p>Lastly, we have commented on the impact that post-lysis intermixing has on the evaluation of KSM parameters in Appendix 1 – “Kinetic state modeling”, and added a figure panel (Appendix 1—figure 1E) to highlight the different forms of dynamic exchange and to illustrate the effect of post-lysis intermixing on the KARMA readouts:</p><p>“For the quantitative interpretation of KARMA readouts, it is important to consider the effects of dynamic exchange. In KARMA assays, the intermixing between assembly intermediates bound by the bait and those that are not (Appendix 1—figure 1E, red arrows) would diminish deviations of labeling rates from the source cell lysates. It is therefore conceivable that our labeling values (Figure 2D and 4C) are underestimated due to post-lysis intermixing. Although our lysate intermixing assays indeed show high exchange rates of Brl1 bound NUPs (Appendix 1—figure 1C), dynamic exchange within the bait-bound fraction (Appendix 1—figure 1E, green arrows), which does not have an influence on the labeling in KARMA assays, contributes to labeling in the intermixing assay. In the future, for more accurate evaluation of labeling kinetics it might be advantageous to minimize post-lysis intermixing by a mild fixation step similar to what has been done before [9,10].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although Brl1 preferentially associates with early NPC intermediates (Figures 1-2), it is remarkable that Brl1 APs do not identify the transmembrane nucleoporins (Pom34 and Ndc1). Since detergent is added after lysis and removal of insoluble material by centrifugation (Methods section), it is possible that only a fraction of these transmembrane proteins are actually accessible during the pull-down. Detergent has been shown to be critical to solubilize Brl1 from cell lysates (see Figure 5 in Saitoh et al., 2005). Could the authors comment on this issue, which could potentially introduce biases in Brl1 APs?</p></disp-quote><p>It is unlikely that membranes are removed in the centrifugation step that we perform after the mechanical bead-beater lysis, as this is a very mild centrifugation (30 s at 15’000 g). Common membrane pelletting protocols in yeast lysates employ an ultracentrifugation step for 30 min with higher (~32,000 g) forces than the one we use [11]. Furthermore, detergents are added during the affinity purification procedure , likely solubilizing Brl1-bound complexes.</p><p>In support of the above, the transmembrane NUP Pom152, which tightly interacts with Pom34 and Ndc1 [12], is among the proteins with the most detected precursors in all our MS assays, and Ndc1 and Pom34 precursors are also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that both Ndc1 and Pom34 are present in our AP eluates, but, unfortunately, they do not produce high-quality precursors, precluding a reliable quantification of their labeling kinetics. These proteins are likely inaccessible to our MS analysis due to a combination of factors: first, both of them are transmembrane proteins with a considerable portion of their sequence made up from helical transmembrane segments. Peptides resulting from these hydrophobic stretches are notoriously difficult to assay by MS [13]. In addition, Pom34 is a very small protein (34 kDa), further reducing the number of potentially good quality precursors. Finally, Ndc1 dynamically associates with the NPC [6,10] and probably has a lower binding affinity than stably incorporated NUPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors' data convincingly demonstrate that overexpression of the AH-deficient Brl1 mutant halts NPC biogenesis at a stage preceding membrane fusion, but do not prove that Brl1 directly acts as a fusogen. The title should thereby be modified accordingly (for example, an amphipathic helix in Brl1 is required for nuclear pore complex biogenesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). Additional characterization of AH features is expected to provide mechanistic clues to Brl1 function in the fusion process:</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and modified the title according to the reviewers suggestion to:</p><p>“An Amphipathic Helix in Brl1 is Required for Nuclear Pore Complex Biogenesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The AH motif could interact with the luminal side of the INM, stabilizing membrane curvature at NPC assembly sites, and/or bind to the luminal side of the ONM, favoring the fusion. Addressing these questions is challenging, yet the authors should test whether Brl1 AH interacts preferentially with small diameter, highly-curved liposomes in floatation assays (Figure 5E).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now performed these experiments. Please see our response to reviewer 1 point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does Brl1 AH contribute to the interaction with Brr6, which was previously scored in immunoprecipitation experiments (Lone et al., 2015)? It should also be stated whether Brl1 partners (Brr6, Apq12) are identified among the factors enriched with early NPC intermediates (Figure S1A) or in Brl1 APs.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, an interaction between Brr6 and Brl1 was previously shown by immunoprecipitation [4,5]. It is plausible that Brl1 AH contributes to the interaction with Brr6, yet, we don’t have any data to either support or reject this hypothesis. Brr6 and Apq12 are not detected in any of our MS assays, neither with the Brl1 bait nor with any of the NUP baits that were used in our previous study. This might be because they are very small proteins (Brr6: 22 kDa, Apq12: 16 kDa) largely composed of transmembrane segments, which are -as discussed above- difficult to assay with MS (see Reviewer 2, point 2). Of note, most of the precursors that we identified for Brl1 stem from its long N-terminus that is entirely missing from Brr6 or Apq12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78385-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are a few instances where corrections or improved data would improve the manuscript. These include the analysis of the in vivo interactions of the AH with membranes and interpretation of the Nup82 localization data in Figure 6D. These are detailed in specific comments to the authors.</p><p>1) As pointed out in the public review, a significant addition to the manuscript would be to examine the interactions of an ahBrl1 point mutant (e.g. Brl1(I395D)) with Nups using the KARMA approach. This could provide important insights into the nature of the Brl1(I395D) interactions with the observed NPC intermediates. I don't see these data as absolutely necessary for the manuscript, but they would provide important insight into the functional consequences of AH mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be a very interesting experiment. However, we have seen that overexpressed Brl1(I395D) strongly accumulates in large multi-layered herniations and is thus spatially separated from the NPC structure (Figure 6). Therefore, we expect only a minor enrichment of NPC components in APs with Brl1(I395D). Furthermore, performing KARMA assays with the Brl1(I395D) bait only provides information until the stage where NPC assembly is blocked. To get interpretable labeling kinetics for NUP incorporation rates we would need data for the whole population of NPCs. This would be obtainable by performing KARMA assays with a NUP bait, similar to what we did in the Brl1-depleted conditions, upon overexpression of Brl1(I395D). However, our fluorescence microscopy analysis suggests that the NPC assembly intermediates at the base of the NE herniations in Brl1-depleted conditions and upon overexpression of Brl1(I395D) are similar, with the central scaffold NUPs being present and the cytoplasmic face of the NPC being absent (Figure 4D and Figure 6D). Thus, it is likely that our KARMA assays in Brl1(I395D)-overexpressing cells would look very similar to the Brl1 depletion condition that we already investigated (Figure 4). Because of this and the time-consuming nature of this experiment, we decided to not perform the KARMA analysis in Brl1(I395D)-expressing cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Brl1(I395D)-mCherry expressing cells (Figure 6D), Nup82 appears reduced but not absent or excluded from areas where Brl1(I395D)-mCherry accumulates as suggested by the authors. This can be seen in the upper half of the Nup82-yeGFP image panel of Brl1(I395D)-mCherry expressing cells. Moreover, the maximum intensity plot of Nup82 shows a small but visible intensity increase at the NE. I suggest the authors address this point in their discussion of these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Nup82 is not <italic>entirely</italic> absent from NE areas with Brl1(I395D)-mCherry puncta, as originally stated. However, the overall intensity at the NE (including NE areas with Brl1(I395D)-mCherry puncta) is strongly reduced. The increase in intensity at the NE can be explained by the higher intensity in the nucleus (compared to the lineplots of the other Nups which also show an increased intensity level in the nucleus). We changed the text from:</p><p>“In contrast, Nup82 is entirely absent from NE-areas with Brl1(I395D)-mCherry puncta.”</p><p>to</p><p>“In contrast, Nup82 intensity at NE-areas with Brl1(I395D)-mCherry puncta was strongly reduced.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors' assessment of the in vivo interactions of the Brl1 AH with membranes is not strong. Localization of the ahBrl1-yEGFP fusion protein to the NE in cells (Figure 5F) does not show that the construct binds membranes in vivo. Curiously, the ahBrl1-yEGFP seems to bind the NE but not other membranes (e.g. the vacuolar membranes). This is especially surprising since the ahBrl1-yEGFP fusion protein is presumably positioned on the cytoplasmic side of the NE membrane. The significance of the membrane association of the ahBrl1-yEGFP construct would be more convincing if the I395D or F391D mutant were to not bind the membranes when expressed in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this experiment is not very conclusive, and we have therefore removed the panel entirely (see also response to reviewer 1 points 1 and 4). Instead, we now include additional in vitro data demonstrating that ahBrl1 preferentially binds to highly curved membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It appears the 3h and 6h time point images in Figure 6B are reversed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.
