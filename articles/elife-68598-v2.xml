coordinated movement and interaction between alveolar epithelial cells, mesenchymal myofibroblasts, and endothelial cells/pericytes to produce secondary septa. These processes rely on the acquisition of distinct cellular properties to enable ligand secretion for cell-cell signaling and initiate morphogenesis through cellular contraction, cell migration, and cell shape change. In this study, we showed that mitochondrial activity and distribution play a key role in bestowing cellular functions on both alveolar epithelial cells and mesenchymal myofibroblasts for generating secondary septa to form alveoli in mice. These results suggest that mitochondrial function is tightly regulated to empower cellular machineries in a spatially specific manner. Indeed, such regulation via mitochondria is required for secretion of ligands, such as platelet-derived growth factor, from alveolar epithelial cells to influence myofibroblast proliferation and contraction/migration. Moreover, mitochondrial function enables myofibroblast contraction/migration during alveolar formation. Together, these findings yield novel mechanistic insights into how mitochondria regulate pivotal steps of alveologenesis. They highlight selective utilization of energy in cells and diverse energy demands in different cellular processes during development. Our work serves as a paradigm for studying how mitochondria control tissue patterning.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The lungs display an intricate, tree-shaped structure which enables the complex gas exchanges required for life. The end of each tiny ‘branch’ hosts delicate air sacs, or alveoli, which are further divided by internal walls called septa. In mammals, this final structure is acquired during the last stage of lung development. Then, many different types of cells in the immature alveoli multiply and reach the right location to start constructing additional septa.</p><p>While the structural changes underlining alveoli maturation are well-studied, the energy requirements for that process remain poorly understood. In particular, the exact role of the mitochondria, the cellular compartments that power most life processes, is still unclear.</p><p>Zhang et al. therefore set out to map, in detail, the role of mitochondria in alveolar development. Microscope imaging revealed how mitochondria were unevenly distributed within the lung cells of newborn mice.

In the future, this insight could lay the groundwork to determine how energy requirements in various tissues shape other biological processes in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>alveolus</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>activity</kwd><kwd>distribution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL142876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Pao-Tien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial activity and distribution control alveolar formation by conferring distinct cellular properties.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Production of alveoli during development and following lung injury is essential for lung function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitsett and Weaver, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rippa et al., 2021</xref>). Defective alveologenesis underlies bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silva et al., 2015</xref>), and ongoing destruction of alveoli is characteristic of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodríguez-Castillo et al., 2018</xref>). During alveolar formation, alveolar epithelial cells (type I [AT1] and type II [AT2] cells), myofibroblasts, and endothelial cells/pericytes undergo coordinated morphogenetic movement to generate secondary septa within saccules. As a result, secondary septa are comprised of a layer of alveolar epithelial cells that ensheathes a core of myofibroblasts and endothelial cells/pericytes. Secondary septa formation (or secondary septation) is the most important step during alveolar formation. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) produced by alveolar epithelial cells is a key player in controlling myofibroblast proliferation and contraction/migration during alveologenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boström et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lindahl et al., 1997</xref>). In response to PDGF signaling, the traditional model posits that myofibroblasts proliferate and migrate to the prospective site of secondary septation and secrete elastin. Myofibroblasts and endothelial cells/pericytes are subsequently incorporated with alveolar epithelial cells to form secondary septa. All of these principal components play a key role in driving secondary septa formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chao et al., 2016</xref>). Generation of alveoli increases the surface area and efficiency of gas exchange, enabling high activity in terrestrial environments. Despite the progress that has been made, our mechanistic understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete.</p><p>Mitochondrial activity is essential for every biological process, and mitochondria provide a major source of ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labbé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan, 2020</xref>). Unexpectedly, we have limited mechanistic insight into how mitochondria control cellular processes in vivo. In particular, little is known about whether certain cellular processes have a higher energy demand during alveolar formation. Many genetic and molecular tools have been developed in mice to study mitochondrial function. They offer a unique opportunity to address the central question of how mitochondria control alveologenesis at the molecular level.</p><p>Mitochondria exhibit dynamic distribution within individual cells. This process is mediated by the cytoskeletal elements that include microtubules, F-actin and intermediate filaments. For instance, <italic>Rhot1</italic> (<italic>ras homolog family member 1</italic>), which is also called <italic>Miro1</italic> (<italic>Mitochondrial Rho GTPase 1</italic>), encodes an atypical Ras GTPase and plays an essential role in mitochondrial transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devine et al., 2016</xref>). RHOT1 associates with the Milton adaptor (TRAK1/2) and motor proteins (kinesin and dynein), and tethers the adaptor/motor complex to mitochondria. This machinery facilitates transport of mitochondria via microtubules within mammalian cells. Whether regulated mitochondrial distribution is essential for lung cell function during alveologenesis is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated a central role of mitochondrial activity and distribution in conferring cellular properties to alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts during alveolar formation. In particular, PDGF ligand secretion from alveolar epithelial cells and motility of myofibroblasts depend on regulated activity and distribution of mitochondria. Moreover, loss of mitochondrial function does not have a uniform effect on cellular processes, indicating diverse energy demands in vivo. We also reveal regulation of mitochondrial function by mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Land et al., 2014</xref>) during alveolar formation and establish a connection between mitochondria and COPD/emphysema. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into how different cell types channel unique energy demands for cellular machinery into distinct cellular properties during alveolar formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondria display dynamic subcellular distribution in alveolar epithelial cells and mesenchymal myofibroblasts during alveolar formation</title><p>To uncover the functional role of mitochondria during alveologenesis, we first examined the distribution of mitochondria in murine lung cells involved in alveolar formation. We used antibodies against mitochondrial components to visualize the distribution of mitochondria in lung epithelial cells and myofibroblasts. For instance, we performed immunostaining on lung sections derived from <italic>Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup>; ROSA26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice with anti-mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) and anti-mitochondrially encoded cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase I (MTCO1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varuzhanyan et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, anti-MPC1 serves as a general marker for mitochondria. Lung epithelial cells were labeled by GFP produced from the <italic>ROSA26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>) due to selective Cre expression in SOX9<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2005</xref>). We found that mitochondria were widely distributed in alveolar epithelial cells (distinguished by T1α and SPC for AT1 and AT2 cells, respectively) and myofibroblasts (marked by PDGF receptor A [PDGFRA] and smooth muscle actin [SMA]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gouveia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is consistent with an essential role of mitochondrial activity in proper functioning of lung cells. In addition, we observed an uneven subcellular distribution of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). For instance, mitochondria were concentrated in areas adjacent to the trans-Golgi network (TGN38<sup>+</sup>) in alveolar epithelial cells (especially AT1 cells) where proteins were sorted to reach their destinations through vesicles and in areas that surrounded SMA in myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This finding suggests that localized mitochondrial distribution is required for cellular function in mammalian lungs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mitochondria display subcellular concentration in alveolar epithelial cells and mesenchymal myofibroblasts of mouse lungs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining of lung sections collected from <italic>Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup>; ROSA26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice at 18.5 <italic>days post coitus</italic> (<italic>dpc</italic>) and different postnatal (P) stages as indicated.

We discovered a major role of mitochondria in conferring requisite cellular properties to both alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts during alveologenesis. These findings define the molecular basis of the functional requirement of mitochondria in distinct compartments and reveal the energy demand in a given process. They also add a new layer of complexity to the interactions between the major players of secondary septa. Moreover, our work establishes the foundation for investigating the interplay between mitochondria and signaling pathways in endowing cellular properties in alveologenesis during development and following injury. We expect that this framework will be applicable to other developmental systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model of regulating alveolar formation through mitochondrial activity and distribution.</title><p>The main players during alveolar formation are shown in the schematic diagram. Mitochondria display dynamic subcellular distribution in alveolar epithelial cells and mesenchymal fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. <italic>Tfam</italic> controls mitochondrial activity while <italic>Rhot1</italic> regulates mitochondrial distribution. Mitochondrial activity and distribution in alveolar epithelial cells (type I [AT1] and type II [AT2]) contribute to secretion of the PDGF-A ligand. Reception of PDGF-A by mesenchymal fibroblasts/myofibroblasts is critical to fibroblast/myofibroblast proliferation and migration, a key step in secondary septation. Similarly, mitochondrial activity and distribution in fibroblasts/myofibroblasts are also required for fibroblast/myofibroblast contraction and migration, likely through powering the cytoskeleton. The mTORC1 pathway plays a central role in controlling mitochondrial function during alveolar formation. Specification of alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts was unaffected in mutant mouse lungs in which mitochondrial activity and distribution were perturbed. We propose that essential cellular processes have differential requirements of mitochondrial activity and distribution. Investigating how mitochondria control signaling pathways and cellular processes in vivo provide a new way to functionally define signaling pathways and cellular processes. We surmise that the regulatory circuitry mediated by mitochondria activity and distribution is also deployed during alveolar repair following lung injury and could contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD)/emphysema.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68598-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>A reduction in mitochondrial function either globally or in distinct compartments in the lung results in alveolar defects. We found that not all cellular processes are perturbed to the same extent when mitochondrial activity or distribution is perturbed. For instance, while alveolar development is disrupted, saccule formation and cell-type specification are unaffected. These observations highlight the differential requirement of mitochondrial function in a given cellular process. Events that necessitate a higher demand for energy will be the first to exhibit phenotypes once mitochondrial function is compromised. It implies that the severity of phenotypes resulting from a reduction in mitochondrial function could be used to characterize the energy demand for a particular cellular process in development. This information cannot be obtained from cell-based studies. It is unclear why alveolar formation has a higher energy demand than saccule formation. Perhaps, construction of a more complex structure such as the alveolus requires additional energy consumption.</p><p>A limitation of our approach lies in the broad expression of Cre lines in multiple cell types over an extended developmental time. We propose that distinct cellular processes exhibit differential dependence on mitochondrial activity. While there is no evidence that a new epithelial cell type emerges from saccular to alveolar stages, the transcriptome of any cell type changes as development proceeds. The simplest model is that the same cell types with an altered transcriptome (dubbed cell subtypes) display different sensitivity to mitochondrial perturbation (and energy expenditure) as lung development proceeds from saccular to alveolar stages. This is based on the assumption that the subcellular events (e.g., ligand secretion and cellular contraction) that drive a cellular process (e.g., sacculation and secondary septation) are the main consumer of energy for a given cell subtype. However, it is also possible that the subcellular events that execute a given cellular process may not be the main consumer of energy. In this scenario, one would conclude that the phenotypic defects of a given cellular process due to compromised mitochondrial activity are indicative of the sensitivity of the subcellular events to mitochondrial activity. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that functions mediated by mitochondria other than energy production play an important role in a given cellular process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schumacker et al., 2014</xref>). However, lack of apoptosis in the mutant lungs in our study suggests that mitochondria-controlled cell death does not contribute to the lung phenotypes.</p><p>Our work has focused on PDGF ligand secretion. Alveolar epithelial cells, especially AT1 cells, are the reservoirs for multiple ligands, including PDGFA, VEGFA, and SHH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vila Ellis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellusci et al., 1997</xref>). While other pathways have not been interrogated, different pathways may exhibit a varying degree of dependence on mitochondrial function. Similarly, this could provide a new way to functionally categorize signaling pathways on the basis of their energy demand in vivo. Such insight will provide a new blueprint of how cells dispense their energy source in tissues.</p><p>Secretion of the PDGF ligand from alveolar epithelial cells is impaired due to mitochondrial dysfunction in either activity or distribution. We surmise that the actomyosin cytoskeleton likely underlies this defect. However, it is also possible that the energy produced by mitochondria is required in many key steps of vesicular transport and membrane fusion. Additional insight would come from a careful assessment of the dependence of each process on mitochondrial function. Similarly, failure to power the actomyosin cytoskeleton in myofibroblasts due to disruption of mitochondrial activity or distribution could cause the contraction and/or migratory defect. ATP produced by mitochondria is known for the assembly of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. By contrast, how regulation of mitochondrial distribution is superimposed upon the formation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is less understood at the molecular level. This scenario is further complicated by the observation that F-actin and intermediate filaments also play a key role in mitochondrial dynamics and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shah et al., 2021</xref>). Technical advances that enable live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Looney and Bhattacharya, 2014</xref>) of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gökerküçük et al., 2020</xref>) and the cytoskeleton would provide new tools to address this important issue.</p><p>We have uncovered the role of mitochondria in alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts during alveolar formation. Whether the function of endothelial cells/pericytes or other cell types not yet tested also relies on mitochondrial activity and/or distribution in this process is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Swonger et al., 2016</xref>). This would require future studies using an approach similar to that employed in this work. Again, the dependence of cell types, cellular processes, and signaling pathways on mitochondrial function can only be revealed through studies in vivo.</p><p>We envision that a complex regulatory network must be in place to regulate mitochondrial number and distribution in distinct cellular processes. Our work shows that mTOR complex 1 is a key player in controlling mitochondrial function during alveolar formation. This is consistent with the role of mTORC1 in regulating mitochondrial function in cell-based assays. Identifying additional components in the signaling network would reveal the key hubs in the signaling network that control mitochondrial function during alveologenesis.</p><p>Mitochondrial copy number and TFAM expression levels are reduced in the lungs of COPD/emphysema patients. Moreover, knockdown of <italic>TFAM</italic> or <italic>RHOT1</italic> in human lung epithelial cells or fibroblasts impairs their cellular properties, including PDGF secretion and myofibroblast migration. We speculate that changes in cellular properties due to disturbed mitochondrial activity and distribution contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD/emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caldeira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cloonan and Choi, 2016</xref>). Disturbance of mitochondrial function and cellular properties could be related to inflammatory responses in COPD/emphysema. To further test this idea would rely on the analysis of lungs at different stages of disease progression with a focus on identifying cellular changes that are directly related to mitochondrial dysfunction. It also necessitates new approaches that enable a mechanistic correlation between mitochondrial function and disease pathogenesis and progression. For instance, analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of various lung cell types at single-cell levels could reveal alterations in a subset of cells that herald the process of emphysematous changes. Such analysis could also uncover changes in the signaling network that connects mitochondria to cellular processes.</p><p>Taken together, our work has yielded new molecular insight into the old question of energy utilization in vivo. In particular, energy production by mitochondria is channeled in a spatially specific manner to power cellular machinery and drive cellular processes in distinct cell types. Diverse cell types and cellular processes have a unique energy demand, which is likely executed by a signaling network. These investigations form the basis of additional studies to explore this new concept in alveolar formation and repair and in other physiological and pathological processes in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Mouse strains used in this study are listed in the Key resources table.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David N Cornfield (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript explores the under-investigated role of mitochondrial activity and subcellular distribution for alveolar formation by using a variety of transgenic mouse models to delete two specific mitochondrial proteins. While largely descriptive, the data support a role for mitochondria distribution and function postnatal lung development in the mice. However, the experimental design and analysis as well as conclusions drawn within the manuscript raises several concerns, which are outlined below. The following points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) It remains unclear whether the effects of deleting the two mitochondrial molecules of interest may represent a general phenomenon as opposed to a specific effect in lung alveolarization. Please provide evidence of cell specific effect as well as evidence that the cells remain healthy in the face of the genetic manipulations. In detail, additional data/experiments to further characterize potential cell-specific effects/impairments upon genetic modulation including apoptosis/ viability and expression of cell-specific functional marker/transcriptional activity are required to significantly improve the manuscript. Further in vivo experiments using a non-structural (immune) cell driver could be helpful to understand whether this is a generalizable phenomenon or not.</p><p>2) Similarly, cell-specific effects can be further explored using vitro studies that need to be strengthened by gain- and loss-of-function experiments (potentially in human primary cells).</p><p>3) Additional parameters of lung histology, including radial alveolar count and septal thickness are required to evaluate the lung structure and function.</p><p>4) Currently insufficient data showing mitochondrial dysfunction upon knockdown, additional experiments to show that mitochondria are dysfunctional are needed.</p><p>5) Human disease link is currently vague and further clarification is needed on how these reported mitochondrial changes are unique to COPD/emphysema in comparison to other chronic lung diseases,</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would significantly enhance the manuscript if the mechanisms suggested based on the in vivo mouse data would have been expanded on, in particular with respect to a potential human disease. For example, using primary fibroblasts and performing additional gain and loss of function studies on Miro1 and <italic>Tfam</italic> and investigation of the cellular (mitochondrial) signaling as well as functional consequence, would be helpful.</p><p>With respect to COPD/emphysema, further clarification is needed on how these reported mitochondrial changes are unique to COPD/emphysema in comparison to other chronic lung diseases, for which mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported. Given the reported relevance for postnatal development, diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia are important to discuss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides a novel insight that mitochondria bring impact on alveolar formation. However, there are following questions and concerns to be addressed:</p><p>1. The current conclusion on defective alveologenesis as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction is questionable due to insufficient data showing mitochondrial dysfunction. Confirmation studies on mitochondrial function (eg. Oroboros assay, ATP assay) are required. Furthermore, mitochondrial network analysis is essential for confirming the alteration of mitochondrial activity and dynamic distribution.</p><p>2. Since mouse line of <italic>Tfam<sup>f/f</sup>; Pdgfa<sup>ex4COIN/+</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> cannot properly indicates Pdgfa expression, please use both mouse line of <italic>Pdgfa<sup>ex4COIN/+</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and mouse line of <italic>Tfam<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> as control groups or measure the PDGF expression via other techniques.</p><p>3. It is interesting that COPD/emphysema patients show decreased mitochondrial copy number and <italic>TFAM</italic> protein levels. However, it would be better if authors further analyze these alterations upon cell types. Moreover, please discuss how mitochondrial alterations and disrupted secondary septa formation link to COPD/emphysema pathogenesis.</p><p>4. Lentiviral transduction efficiency is critical for the data quality of PDGF levels. Please provide it.</p><p>5. Please provide Western blotting images used for quantification in Figure 7E, Figure 8C and Figure 8E.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, there is a great deal of merit to the study. Demonstration that the effects are cell specific, and not the result of a generalized phenomena would be helpful. To this end, demonstration that the cell with altered mitochondria are otherwise robust would benefit the manuscript. In addition, demonstration that some cellular constituent of the alveolar still carries out its biological role in the face of compromised mitochondrial function or number, and that alveolarization is unperturbed would be important. In the current form, it is difficult to distinguish a cell-specific effect. Given these limitations, a more focused Discussion, clearly addressing these limitations would be helpful.</p><p>Further, the histologic analysis of the lung should be more comprehensive and include radial alveolar counts as well as septal thickness. Mean linear intercept addresses the size of the alveolus, but not number, even though these parameters often track one another. More well curated markers of different cell types to highlight the specificity of the drivers used would be helpful.</p><p>1. In the Results section, Figure 1, <italic>Sox9</italic> was used as a specific marker for lung epithelial cells. Is it specific? If so, which of the epithelial are <italic>Sox9</italic> expressors, alveolar type 1, type 2, both?</p><p>2. In the same section, the authors comment that myofibroblasts are marked by PDGFRA, PDGF receptor and smooth muscle actin. What is the distinction between each of the first two markers?</p><p>3. Relative to the mitochondria, cells require energy to function, so the need to mitochondria is anticipated. Are the authors suggesting a cell-specific effect? Further, is the inhomogeneous distribution of mitochondria within the cells of interest in contrast with homogeneous distribution in cells less dependent upon the mitochondria?</p><p>4. What were the alveolar defects aside an increase in mean linear intercept? For example, was septal thickness affected? Alternatively, was radial alveolar count affected?</p><p>5. On page7, the authors state &quot;Moreover, histological analysis revealed no difference between control and mutant lungs prior to P5…&quot; there certainly appears to be histologic differences in terms of septal thickness. Given the differences in histologic appearance it seems that lung histology, perhaps mesenchymal histology, was affected by inactivating <italic>Tfam</italic> in <italic>SOX9</italic><sup>+</sup> cells</p><p>6. While <italic>Miro1<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9Cre/+</italic> mice had alterations in the distribution of mitochondria, were absolute numbers of mitochondria decreased as well? Again, lung histology does appear different at P5, even though not in terms of mean linear intercept. Overall, the manuscript would benefit from additional parameters of lung histology, including radial alveolar count and septal thickness.</p><p>7. Relative to the mesenchymal studies using the Pdgfra driver, which cell or cellular constituents in the mesenchyme are being affected? The mesenchyme includes multiple, distinct cell types including transcriptomically distinct fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and airway smooth muscle cells.</p><p>8. In the myofibroblast migration assays, was there a rescue component to the experiment? Alternatively, was loss of migratory capacity interrogated other than through decreases in mitochondrial number, function? IN general, the in vitro studies could be strengthened by gain- and loss-of-function components.</p><p>9. Relative to the lung histology, it is important to standardize tissue acquisition, especially inflation of the lung. Detail surrounding how this was done would be helpful.</p><p>10. In Figure 8, the results are normalized to the controls. If the absolute data are presented, as opposed to % of control, are the differences significant?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Acquisition of cellular properties during alveolar formation requires differential activity and distribution of mitochondria&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Edward Morrisey (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below. Specifically, the concerns related to cell specificity has not been addressed and the fact that no direct evidence is provided to show that modulation of mitochondrial function in other cells will not affect on lung structure/alveolarization. This is a critical point. Additional concerns about the clarity and interpretation will further need to be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have answered most of the questions raised in the previous reviews and revised the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The rebuttal response addresses components of the concerns of the reviewers. However, the most fundamental concern remains unaddressed. Specifically, is there a cell intrinsic to lung structure wherein mitochondrial function is diminished that has no effect on secondary septation. In the reply, the authors point out that the saccular stage might be unaffected (Figure 3), but not evidence that alveolarization is preserved despite genetic deletion. It seems that the lines of evidence presented are each indirect. The concern about cell specificity was the central concern expressed by 2 of 3 reviewers. It seems that such data is critical in order to defend the claims of cell specificity.</p><p>The addition of data demonstrating mitochondrial dysfunction is helpful</p><p>The additional lung histology is helpful. Do the differences in septal thicknesses merit comment?</p><p>Why is the observation that saccular formation is unperturbed while alveolarization is compromised a reflection of differential energy requirements as opposed to involvement of different cells at specific stages of lung development?</p><p>The authors comment about BPD in the abstract. Might the cell specific compromise in mitochondrial function have implications for BPD?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Acquisition of cellular properties during alveolar formation requires differential activity and distribution of mitochondria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It explores the under-investigated role of mitochondrial activity and subcellular distribution for alveolar formation, by using a variety of transgenic mouse models to delete two specific mitochondrial proteins. While largely descriptive, the data support a role for mitochondria distribution and function in postnatal lung development in the mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present revision includes a number of well performed and carefully considered experiments. The authors have responded to the concerns raised in each of the prior reviews. However, the primary concern persists. Specifically, the authors argue that in <italic>Sox9</italic> expressing epithelial cells mitochondrial distribution and activity have specific effects on secondary septation of the lung. Doubtless, the manuscript includes a rich set of experiments. The authors definitively demonstrate that compromising mitochondrial activity and distribution in <italic>Sox9</italic> expressing epithelial cells decreases secondary septation. However, it does not seem to this Reviewer that the authors can make the claims of specificity outlined in the manuscript. To make such a claim, it would be important, as stated in the prior reviews, by more than one Reviewer, to demonstrate that loss of mitochondrial activity and altered distribution in another cell type in the lung has no effect on alveolarization. The demonstration that loss of mitochondrial activity non-structural immune cells is helpful, these T-cells compromise a very small percentage of the overall immune population and remain naive through ~ P21. Moreover, there are no reports of a lung phenotype in mice wherein T-cells are deleted; if deleting cells has no effect on alveolarization, then certainly decreasing mitochondrial activity would have no effect. A non-structural immune cell, such as macrophages would be far more meaningful proof of concept.</p><p>Relative to claims of specificity regarding use of a Pdgra promoter to effect myofibroblasts problematic. As the authors point out, fibroblasts, adventitial fibroblasts, and adventitial fibroblasts (transcriptionally distinct subpopulations) all express Pdgfra and thus the knockout is certainly effecting cells other than the myofibroblasts.</p><p>What is the basis for the contention that septal thickness is a more sensitive indicator of secondary septation? Thinning of the septae is a component of lung maturation, but not specifically secondary septation.</p><p>Transcriptomically distinct cell subtypes emerge during the transition from saccular to alveolar stages. This has been shown in multiple papers. Thus, it remains unclear just why the authors insist that the absence of effects during the saccular stage proves differential energy requirements in the same cells as opposed to involvement of alternative cells.</p><p>Though not appreciated by the authors, radial alveolar count is distinct from mean linear intercept and represents a more direct method to secondary septae, the outcome measure of primary concern in the present manuscript.</p><p>In Figure 6, line 940, how do the authors know the cells were myofibroblasts?</p><p>Finally, in Figure 8, it appears that panels b,c, and e are normalized so that the controls = 1. Are findings still significant if the absolute values are compared?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68598.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript explores the under-investigated role of mitochondrial activity and subcellular distribution for alveolar formation by using a variety of transgenic mouse models to delete two specific mitochondrial proteins.

The current conclusion on defective alveologenesis as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction is questionable due to insufficient data showing mitochondrial dysfunction. Confirmation studies on mitochondrial function (eg. Oroboros assay, ATP assay) are required. Furthermore, mitochondrial network analysis is essential for confirming the alteration of mitochondrial activity and dynamic distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, in the revision, we have provided additional data on mitochondrial dysfunction in control and <italic>Tfam</italic>- and <italic>Miro1</italic> (<italic>Rhot1</italic>)-deficient lungs using select mouse Cre lines.

Demonstration that the effects are cell specific, and not the result of a generalized phenomena would be helpful. To this end, demonstration that the cell with altered mitochondria are otherwise robust would benefit the manuscript. In addition, demonstration that some cellular constituent of the alveolar still carries out its biological role in the face of compromised mitochondrial function or number, and that alveolarization is unperturbed would be important. In the current form, it is difficult to distinguish a cell-specific effect. Given these limitations, a more focused Discussion, clearly addressing these limitations would be helpful.</p><p>Further, the histologic analysis of the lung should be more comprehensive and include radial alveolar counts as well as septal thickness. Mean linear intercept addresses the size of the alveolus, but not number, even though these parameters often track one another. More well curated markers of different cell types to highlight the specificity of the drivers used would be helpful.</p><p>1.

In the same section, the authors comment that myofibroblasts are marked by PDGFRA, PDGF receptor and smooth muscle actin. What is the distinction between each of the first two markers?</p></disp-quote><p>In alveolar myofibroblasts, smooth muscle actin (SMA or ACTA2) can only be detected by immunostaining from P3 to P12.

Unlike SMA, PDGFRA expression persists in alveolar myofibroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Relative to the mitochondria, cells require energy to function, so the need to mitochondria is anticipated. Are the authors suggesting a cell-specific effect? Further, is the inhomogeneous distribution of mitochondria within the cells of interest in contrast with homogeneous distribution in cells less dependent upon the mitochondria?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Tfam</italic> removal reduces but does not completely obliterate ATP production. ~30–50% reduction in ATP levels in the whole lungs was observed (Figure 3F, 3L and Figure 5F, 5L). This is expected since all cells require ATP for proper functioning. We anticipate that a partial reduction in ATP levels will preferentially affect cellular processes with a higher energy demand. We showed that loss of epithelial or mesenchymal <italic>Tfam</italic> resulted in alveolar defects but not branching morphogenesis or saccule formation. This implies that secondary septation requires higher ATP levels compared to other cellular processes. We speculate that ligand secretion from the lung epithelium and myofibroblast contraction and migration have a greater demand for ATP. Consistent with this notion, mitochondria in alveolar epithelial cells accumulate in regions close to the trans Golgi network, while mitochondria in alveolar myofibroblasts concentrate in areas near the smooth muscle actin. Inhomogeneous distribution of mitochondria in a given cell type may be an indicator of higher energy demand for that cell type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The authors have responded to the concerns raised in each of the prior reviews. However, the primary concern persists. Specifically, the authors argue that in Sox9 expressing epithelial cells mitochondrial distribution and activity have specific effects on secondary septation of the lung. Doubtless, the manuscript includes a rich set of experiments. The authors definitively demonstrate that compromising mitochondrial activity and distribution in Sox9 expressing epithelial cells decreases secondary septation. However, it does not seem to this Reviewer that the authors can make the claims of specificity outlined in the manuscript. To make such a claim, it would be important, as stated in the prior reviews, by more than one Reviewer, to demonstrate that loss of mitochondrial activity and altered distribution in another cell type in the lung has no effect on alveolarization. The demonstration that loss of mitochondrial activity non-structural immune cells is helpful, these T-cells compromise a very small percentage of the overall immune population and remain naive through ~ P21. Moreover, there are no reports of a lung phenotype in mice wherein T-cells are deleted; if deleting cells has no effect on alveolarization, then certainly decreasing mitochondrial activity would have no effect. A non-structural immune cell, such as macrophages would be far more meaningful proof of concept.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous revision, we showed that mouse lungs with <italic>Tfam</italic> inactivated in T cells using <italic>Foxp3-Cre</italic> or <italic>CD4-Cre</italic> do not show alveolar defects (Figure 3—figure supplement 5). Loss of <italic>Tfam</italic> by <italic>Foxp3-Cre</italic> has been previously reported (Fu et al., <italic>Cell Rep</italic> 2019 PMID 31269437). These animals displayed severe inflammation but no alveolar defects.</p><p>Of note, ample evidence suggests that neonatal T cells are not immature or defective versions of adult cells (Rudd <italic>Annu Rev Immunol</italic> 2020 PMID 31926469).

This study has been published in which <italic>Tfam</italic> removal in alveolar macrophages by <italic>Cd11c-Cre</italic> does not lead to alveolar defects (Gao et al., <italic>J Immunol</italic> 2022 PMID: 35165165). To further substantiate this finding, we have conditionally inactivated <italic>Tfam</italic> using <italic>Cx3cr1-CreER</italic>. We generated <italic>Tfam<sup>f/f</sup>; Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic> mice and administered tamoxifen to neonatal mice.

Thus, it remains unclear just why the authors insist that the absence of effects during the saccular stage proves differential energy requirements in the same cells as opposed to involvement of alternative cells.</p></disp-quote><p>While there is no evidence that a new epithelial cell type emerges from saccular to alveolar stages, the transcriptome of any cell type changes as development proceeds. The simplest model is that the same cell types with an altered transcriptome (cell subtypes by the reviewer) display different sensitivity to mitochondrial perturbation (and energy expenditure) as lung development proceeds from saccular to alveolar stages. This is based on the assumption that the subcellular events (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ligand secretion and cellular contraction) that drive a cellular process (<italic>e.g.</italic>, sacculation and secondary septation) are the main consumer of energy for a given cell subtype. However, it is also possible that the subcellular events that execute a given cellular process may not be the main consumer of energy. In this scenario, one would conclude that the phenotypic defects of a given cellular process due to compromised mitochondrial activity are indicative of the sensitivity of the subcellular events to mitochondrial activity. We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Though not appreciated by the authors, radial alveolar count is distinct from mean linear intercept and represents a more direct method to secondary septae, the outcome measure of primary concern in the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>A large fraction of the lungs analyzed for alveolar defects in this study were from postnatal day 3 –5.
