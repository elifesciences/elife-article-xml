However, whether mitotic spindle in cells can be aligned by magnetic field has not been experimentally proved. In particular, the biological effects of SMF of above 20 T (Tesla) have never been reported. Here we found that in both CNE-2Z and RPE1 human cells spindle orients in 27 T SMF. The direction of spindle alignment depended on the extent to which chromosomes were aligned to form a planar metaphase plate. Our results show that the magnetic torque acts on both microtubules and chromosomes, and the preferred direction of spindle alignment relative to the field depends more on chromosome alignment than microtubules. In addition, spindle morphology was also perturbed by 27 T SMF. This is the first reported study that investigated the cellular responses to ultra-high magnetic field of above 20 T. Our study not only found that ultra-high magnetic field can change the orientation and morphology of mitotic spindles, but also provided a tool to probe the role of spindle orientation and perturbation in developmental and cancer biology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22911.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22911.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22911.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nowadays, a number of methods can be used to ‘look’ inside the body to investigate potential health problems. One of these is a technique called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that uses magnetic fields that are several hundred times stronger than a fridge magnet (or over 10,000 times stronger than the Earth’s natural magnetic field) to generate images of the inside of the body. In general, stronger magnetic fields enable higher quality images to be obtained. However, the effects of exposing the body’s cells to these magnetic fields have not been fully determined.</p><p>Like most other biological materials, protein polymers called microtubules can respond to high magnetic fields – for example, by aligning with the field. Microtubules play a number of roles inside cells. This includes forming the mitotic spindle that separates copies of chromosomes – the structures in which the majority of a cell’s genetic material is stored – equally between dividing cells.</p><p>The orientation of the mitotic spindle determines the direction in which a cell will divide. This direction is important for generating different types of cells and tissues. Furthermore, many cancerous cells have incorrectly oriented spindles.</p><p>Zhang, Hou et al. have now exposed cancerous and normal human cells to magnetic fields of varying strengths. The maximum magnetic field strength tested (27 Tesla – or around 10 times the highest field strengths produced by standard hospital MRI scanners) did not kill the cells after four hours of exposure, but the orientation of the spindles inside the cells did change. In addition, the 27 Tesla magnetic field caused spindles that were perpendicular to the direction of the field to widen. At an intermediate field strength (9 Tesla – a magnetic field strength that has been used in some experimental MRI scanners), the orientation of the spindle only changed after three days of continuous exposure to the magnetic field. Lower field strengths (such as those currently used in hospital MRI scanners) did not alter the orientation of the spindle even after seven days of exposure.</p><p>Zhang, Hou et al. also observed that the magnetic field acts on both the microtubules and chromosomes. However, the alignment of the chromosomes in the cell was the greatest determinant of the direction in which the spindle would align itself in response to the magnetic field.</p><p>The next step is to analyze the consequences of magnetic field-induced spindle orientation changes – can these lead to cancer or reduce cancer growth, or change how animal tissues develop? Understanding how to control the position of the spindle could also ultimately make it possible to use ultra-high magnetic fields to engineer tissues or stimulate their regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22911.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22911.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>magnetic field</kwd><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#2016YFA0400900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U1532151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hefei Science Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016HSC-IU007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An ultra-high static magnetic field changes mitotic spindle orientation in cells by exerting magnetic torques on both microtubules and chromosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitotic spindle is a highly dynamic microtubule assembly responsible for chromosome segregation and cleavage furrow positioning during cell division. Spindle orientation is central to cell fate determination and tissue architecture, and mounting evidences show that astral microtubules, multiple cortical proteins and their interactions with plasma membrane are all critical to achieve correct orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Toyoshima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lu and Johnston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergstralh and St Johnston, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2014</xref>). Tissues may have additional control mechanisms to minimize spindle orientation errors, such as apoptosis in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergstralh and St Johnston, 2014</xref>). The connection between spindle orientation and tumorigenesis has also been an active field in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gonzalez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pease and Tirnauer, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Most biological materials are diamagnetic, such as proteins, DNA and lipids. SMFs can align large biological objects that have diamagnetic anisotropy, such as microtubule polymers and nucleic acid chains, as well as some types of cells and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Maret and Dransfeld, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Torbet and Ronzière, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Higashi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takeuchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Teodori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stern-Straeter et al., 2011</xref>). The degree of alignment with the externally applied magnetic field is proportional to the product of the molecular magnetic susceptibility and the magnetic field strength. For proteins, the diamagnetic anisotropy is mainly due to the alpha helix, beta sheet and aromatic rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chabre, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Worcester, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pauling, 1979</xref>). Even individual peptide bonds, which have weak diamagnetic anisotropy can contribute when linked together in a fixed and organized orientation in alpha helix or beta sheet. Most proteins have very weak diamagnetic anisotropy, but their response to a magnetic field can be amplified by ordered polymerization, as in microtubules, where the additive diamagnetic anisotropy can be significant. The DNA chain is another example of a biopolymer with relatively large diamagnetic anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maret et al., 1975</xref>), mainly due to its stacked aromatic bases. Theoretical predictions suggested that mitotic chromosome arms, where DNA is highly compacted, might generate electromagnetic fields along the chromosome arm direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao and Zhan, 2012</xref>) and, less speculatively, that chromosomes should be fully aligned by SMFs of around 1.4 T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maret, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Mitotic spindles comprise both microtubules and chromosomes, but most studies of their potential response to magnetic fields have focused on microtubules. Multiple studies have shown that purified microtubules can be aligned by moderate and high SMFs and the alignment effect increases significantly with magnetic field strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vassilev et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bras et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Glade and Tabony, 2005</xref>). This is due to the diamagnetic anisotropy of tubulin and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bras et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, tubulin assembly in vitro was disordered by a 10–100 nT hypogeomagnetic field (natural geomagnetic field is usually around 50000 nT/0.5 Gauss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). However, whether SMF can change the mitotic spindle orientation in a cell has never been reported. Denegre et al found that 16.7 T large gradient SMFs can affect the division orientation of Xenopus eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denegre et al., 1998</xref>). They proposed that SMF may affect the orientation of astral microtubules and/or spindles, which was theoretically proved later by Valles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Valles, 2002</xref>), but no experimental evidence has been provided so far to prove this hypothesis. Although the importance of aster microtubules in spindle orientation determination in some types of cells is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Palmer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shaw et al., 1997</xref>), the metaphase spindles still can orient themselves parallel to the substrate in the absence of aster microtubules in both Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and human cervical cancer HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lazaro-Dieguez et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the spindle orientation is controlled by multiple signaling proteins, microtubules and associated proteins, as well as actin and associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Toyoshima and Nishida, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woolner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thaiparambil et al., 2012</xref>). Although a few reports in recent years showed that the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton in interphase cells could be affected by 7–17 T ultra-high SMFs in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Valiron et al., 2005</xref>), information about the mitotic spindle was not provided. Therefore, the theoretical prediction of the SMF effect on spindle orientation in cells has not been experimentally tested.</p><p>In our previous study, we found that prolonged treatment of 1 T moderate intensity SMF can cause multipolar spindles in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Luo et al., 2016</xref>) and we predict that stronger SMFs are likely to produce more obvious effects on spindles. To accommodate cells in the ultra-high field magnet we constructed a custom cell incubation system using two sample holders that could fit inside the new 32 mm bore ultra-high field magnets in the Chinese High Magnetic Field Laboratory (CHMFL, China). This platform provides accurate temperature and gas control for animal and human cells as well as some small model animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells survive in 27 T SMF</title><p>The WM4 magnet we use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) provides vertical ultra-high homogenous SMF at the center of the magnet.

However, the spindle orientation after strong SMF exposure had never been experimentally investigated. Using immunofluorescence analysis of cells fixed immediately after they were taken out of the magnet, we found that mitotic spindle orientation was perturbed by 27 T SMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In sham incubated or control cells, the mitotic spindle axis is usually parallel to the tissue culture plate or coverslip (‘lateral’) while the 27 T magnetic field increased the percentage of spindles that were not parallel to the coverslip (‘non-lateral’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We separately measured metaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) as well as prometaphase and metaphase spindles together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and both results showed that non-lateral spindles were increased by 27 T SMF. We also examined lower magnetic field intensities for their effect on spindle orientation. The 0.05 T and 1 T SMFs were provided by permanent magnets placed in regular incubators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that 4 hr of exposure does not increase the non-lateral spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) as 27 T SMF. We also tested 9 T SMF provided by a superconducting magnet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and found that 4 hr of 9 T exposure does not increase the non-lateral spindles either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). However, although exposure for a prolonged time of 3 days to 0.05 T or 1 T SMFs still had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>), 9 T SMF treatment for 3 days could perturb spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). In contrast, 0.05 T and 1 T SMFs had no effect on spindle orientation even after 7 days of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 4—source data 5</xref>). Therefore the effect of SMF on spindle orientation was field intensity-dependent and time-dependent. Ultra-high SMF of 27 T could change spindle orientation in 4 hr but 9 T SMF need 3 days to show effects.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22911.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>27 T SMF changed spindle orientation.</title><p>CNE-2Z cells were plated on coverslips in the 18 mm tissue culture plate one night ahead to allow the cells to attach.

As a start to distinguish these effects, we aligned coverslips in the same axis as the magnetic field direction, so the field should only change orientation in the plane of the coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). We also added another non-transformed human retinal pigment epithelial cell line RPE1 to the experiment to see whether the effects we observed are cell specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Synchronization was also used to enrich mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We grouped the spindles into three different groups based on their orientation relative to the field direction: parallel to the magnetic field, normal to the magnetic field and other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, spindle orientation was different in prometaphase cells vs. metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In the 27 T SMF treated group, prometaphase cells tended to orient with their spindle long axis in parallel with the field direction, while metaphase cells tended to orient with the spindle long axis normal to the field direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Synchronized and unsynchronized cells responded similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) so we combined data from both synchronized and unsynchronized cells for statistical analysis.

The main difference between cells in prometaphase and metaphase is the organization of chromosomes, which are distributed in prometaphase and tightly aligned in metaphase.

In this drug, many mitotic cells exhibited highly disorganized chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Then we measured the spindle length, chromosome distribution, metaphase plate width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) as well as the angle between spindle long axis and the magnetic field/gravity direction in Adobe Photoshop. After quantifying four independent coverslips for both CNE-2Z and RPE1 cells, we found that the chromosome distribution in spindles seemed to affect the angle between spindle long axis and the magnetic field/gravity direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The preferred spindle orientation relative to the field differed between cells that have well aligned chromosomes and misaligned chromosomes, and that this difference was significant (p&lt;0.01 in RPE1 cells and p&lt;0.05 in CNE-2Z cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>). This indicates that chromosomes play a major role in spindle orientation in response to SMFs. Spindles with misaligned chromosomes tend to align with the spindle long axis in parallel with the field direction while spindles with well aligned chromosomes tend to align their metaphase plate in parallel with the field direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

It is interesting that the chromosome alignment or misalignment did actually affect the spindle ellipticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15-data">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). Our results show that spindles with well aligned chromosomes became obviously wider in 27 T (p&lt;0.005), but the morphology of spindles with misaligned chromosomes was not much affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We also noticed that spindles with well aligned chromosomes themselves are slightly wider in the sham control group compared to spindles with misaligned chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), which may have their microtubules relative easier to be aligned by a vertical magnetic field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We propose that the SMF-induced spindle orientation and morphology changes are due to the combined alignment effects of both microtubules and chromosomes in the magnetic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). When the field is oriented normal to the substrate, magnetic torques on both microtubules and chromatin may combine to re-orient spindles away from the surface plane, opposing torques on astral microtubules that promote the normal orientation. Application of the magnetic field parallel to the coverslip allowed us to discriminate torques on chromatin vs. microtubules, and in this case it appears that torques on well aligned chromatin dominated, aligning spindles preferentially with their microtubules normal to the field, and their metaphase plate parallel to the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Our result is opposite to that proposed by Denegre et al, who studied Xenopus egg cleavage in 16.7 T high magnetic fields and theoretically proposed that the orientation of spindle in magnetic field is a result of the balance between aster microtubules and spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denegre et al., 1998</xref>). They did not directly image spindles, but we note opposite results in the two systems might depend on huge size-scaling differences between the two systems we used. The cleavage plane in Xenopus eggs is oriented by huge microtubule asters with almost mm dimensions, while the amount of chromatin is the same as a mitotic cell. In contrast, the ratio of chromatin to microtubules is much larger in human somatic cells. Theoretical calculation predicted that the highly compacted mitotic chromosomes could be fully aligned by magnetic fields at around 1.4 T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maret, 1990</xref>). Therefore the metaphase plate composed of chromosomes likely dominated the SMF-induced orientation in normal-sized somatic cells.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22911.035</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Models show that ultra-high SMFs align microtubules and chromosomes to change spindle orientation and morphology.</title><p>Blue upward arrows show magnetic field direction.

The torque of a substance is equal to the product of magnetic field intensity and the magnetic susceptibility of the object, in which the susceptibility could also be field-dependent and can be Taylor expanded. This means that the torque could be parabolically proportional to the magnetic field strength. Thus, a high field has much more severe impact than a low field as far as field-induced alignment is concerned, and the relationship is not linear. Although there are various potential concerns for the safety issue of the high magnetic fields, the known biological effects of high fields of above 10 T are limited. There are only a few studies that have investigated the animal or human cells at ≥10 T. Nakahara et al and Zhao et al showed that 10 T or 13 T SMFs did not have obvious effects on the human-hamster hybrid (<italic>A</italic>L) cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or human primary skin fibroblasts (AG1522) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nakahara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>); Denegre et al found that 16.7 T large gradient SMFs can affect the division of Xenopus eggs, which is presumed to act through astral microtubules and spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denegre et al., 1998</xref>); the Shang group found that 12-16-12T large gradient SMFs can affect microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) expression and its association with cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qian et al., 2009</xref>) as well as osteoblast ultrastructure and cell viability by disrupting collagen I or Febronectin/αβ1 integrin in human osteoblast-like cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Qian et al., 2013</xref>); Valiron et al used 17 T, the highest SMF strength applied on cells so far and they did not observe strong cell killing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Valiron et al., 2005</xref>). Instead, they found that the cytoskeleton of interphase mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3 cells and human cervical cancer HeLa cells can be affected by 17 T SMF. Here we found that 27 T SMF does not have an immediate cell killing effects on human CNE-2Z and RPE1 cells but it changes the mitotic spindle orientation and morphology.</p><p>The spindle orientation change induced by ultra-high SMF is likely conserved between different cell types, although there may be variations among them. The spindles align with their long axis vertical to the field direction and their metaphase plate parallel to the field direction are different from our prediction. We thought the microtubules within the spindle would align with the magnetic field direction so that the spindle would also align with the field. However, it has been shown that the mitotic chromosomes have electromagnetic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao and Zhan, 2012</xref>). Although the chromosomes alignment in the magnetic field has not been experimentally shown, calculation predicted that the chromosomes could be fully aligned with the magnetic field as long as the field is above 1.4 T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maret, 1990</xref>). Based on theoretical calculation, Valles also proposed that the direction of mitotic spindle alignment in the magnetic field depends on how the diamagnetic anisotropies of its individual components, including microtubules and chromosomes, align within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Valles, 2002</xref>). Denegre et al’s results about Xenopus egg division shows that the cleavage plane, which is perpendicular to the spindle long axis, tend to parallel with the magnetic field direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denegre et al., 1998</xref>). Xenopus eggs have very different long astral microtubules, which composed a large portion of the whole cell. In contrast, the cells used in our study as well as most human somatic cells have much less astral microtubules and much bigger spindle microtubules compared to Xenopus eggs. Since both astral and spindle microtubules, as well as chromosomes respond to magnetic field, their relative contribution will be critical to determine the final outcome in a given cell type.</p><p>In conclusion, although it is well accepted that microtubules can be affected by magnetic fields, the effect of high magnetic field on mitotic spindles in a cell has never been investigated. Here we examined the mitotic spindles in 27 T ultra-high SMF treated human CNE-2Z and RPE1 cells and found that the spindle orientation is indeed affected and the direction is dependent on the chromosome alignment. This provides a powerful tool to study spindle orientation related questions in developmental biology, such as cell fate, tissue architecture, and cancer biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>The 18 mm cell culture plates were custom made by Guangzhou Jet Bio-Filtration Company, China.

The device consists of two coaxial non-magnetic stainless steel tubes. The outer diameter of the outer tube (OT) is 30 mm and the inner diameter of the inner tube (IT) is 22.4 mm. To investigate the biological effect of the magnetic field provided by The WM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and constructed a set of biological sample incubation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with accurate temperature, gas and humidity control. A non-magnetic stainless steel tube with 10 mm outer diameter was used as a shaft and was inserted into the inner space of the IT. We have used a rubber O-ring to hold the shaft and sealed the inner space of the IT. A sample house and a Teflon concentricity spacer were fixed on the shaft. The concentricity spacer was used to make sure that the shaft and the sample house are coaxial with the IT. Because the shaft was held by the rubber O-ring, it can be moved on axial easily to adjust the position of the sample house in the WM. A PT100 near the samples was used as a temperature sensor and connected to a temperature display to monitor the temperature of the samples. The temperature of the samples can be controlled by thermal conduction from the temperature controlled water, which flow through the space between the IT and OT. By adjusting the temperature of the water, the temperature of the samples can be controlled precisely. To adjust the atmosphere of the sample house, the air with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with temperature and humidity control was introduced by the shaft.</p><p>To control for possible effect of the incubation system we made two identical sets, one for ‘sham’ and the other for the experimental 27 T SMF exposure group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The experimental group was placed in the tube and inserted into the WM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while the sham group was placed in the other identical tube and left outside of the magnet. The control group was kept in the regular full-size CO<sub>2</sub> cell incubator in the lab.

We custom made small plates to fit in this biological sample incubation system. Most experiments in this study were carried out in these custom made 18 mm plates, including full size incubator control, sham control and the 27 T experimental groups.

Coverslips were stained with anti-β-tubulin antibody at room temperature for 2 hr, followed by fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hr. Then the cells were directly stained with fluorescently labeled Phalloidin for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing with TBS-Tx, coverslips were mounted in anti-fade ProLong Gold mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen). The antibodies and reagents used in immunofluorescence experiments include β-tubulin (used at 1:1000 dilution), the secondary fluorescently conjugated antibodies (used at 1:250 dilution), as well as Alexa 488 or 594 Phalloidin (used at 1:40 dilution).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell counting and cell cycle analysis</title><p>All attached and floating cells were collected for cell counting, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis.

Cells were plated on round or pre-cut coverslips one night before to allow the cells to attach. They were then exposed to different magnetic fields for indicated time points and then removed for analysis. Bright field microscopic and annexin V/PI double stain in flow cytometry assays were used to analyze apoptosis and necrosis</p><p>For 0.05 T and 1 T magnetic field exposure perpendicular to coverslips, CNE-2Z cells on coverslips were exposed to magnetic fields for 4 hr, 3 days or 7 days in regular full-sized CO<sub>2 </sub>cell incubator (Shanghai Boxun, BC-J160S) that has accurate control of temperature (37°C), humidity and CO<sub>2</sub> (5%). The cell plates were placed right on the top center of the magnets (Neodymium magnet N38, dimension: 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm) and the magnetic field intensity measured by a Gauss meter (LakeShore 475 DSP Gaussmeter) showed the magnetic field intensity of 1.07 T (10700 Gs) for the 1 T magnet. The sham control group was in the same incubator, around 30–40 cm away from the magnets, where the magnetic field is 0.925 Gs (background magnetic field in the lab was measured to be 0.875 ± 0.171 Gs and in a separate CO<sub>2 </sub>cell incubator with no magnets was 0.875 ± 0.096 Gs).</p><p>For 9 T magnetic field (upward direction) exposure perpendicular to coverslips, 2 ml of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells /ml CNE-2Z cells for 4 hr assays, or 2 ml of 1.25 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells /ml CNE-2Z cells for 3 days assays were placed on coverslips in each 35 mm cell culture plates one night ahead to allow the cells to attach. On the second day, they were placed in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C under 9 T SMF for 4 hr (3 hr stable maintenance at 9 T with half hour increase and half hour decrease) or 3 days before they were fixed and stained for analysis.</p><p>For 27 T magnetic field exposure perpendicular to coverslips, 400 μl 6.25 × 10<sup>5</sup>/ml CNE-2Z cells were placed on coverslips in each 18 mm cell culture plates one night ahead to allow the cells to attach. On the second day, they were placed in regular full-sized cell incubator (control group) or in two high magnetic field biological sample incubation systems. One was used as sham group and the other was 27 T group. Then the 27 T group was placed in the center of the 27 T water-cooled magnet (WM4) and the whole cell culture plate was exposed homogeneously to the 27 T magnetic field for 4 hr in total (increasing field for 30 min, constant 27 T field for 3 hr and reducing field for 30 min). For the 3 days post-exposure experiments, cells taken out of the magnet were then maintained in regular full-sized cell incubator for another 3 days before they were taken out and subjected to further analyses. The sham group was processed identically.</p><p>For 1 T, 9 T or 27 T magnetic field exposure parallel to coverslips, coverslips were cut in half using a glass cutter and 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CNE-2Z or RPE1 cells were plated in 100 mm plate one night ahead to allow the cells to attach. On the second day, the half coverslips were inserted vertically into the agarose gel pre-plated and solidified on the bottom of 35 mm (1 T and 9 T groups) or 18 mm (27 T group) plates. 1 ml (1 T and 9 T groups) or 400 μl (27 T group) of 1.5% agarose was used for each plate. They were placed in regular full-sized cell incubator (control group), in 1 T, 9 T or in two high magnetic field biological sample incubation systems. One was sham group and the other was 27 T group.

The authors make use of a sophisticated magnetic field incubation system, in which they place adherent human cells and assay the orientation of the spindle axis with the SMF.</p><p>The data are totally out of the beaten path, and provide in my opinion, very novel insights on the basic interactions between external signals and internal cellular structures. Beyond medical relevance, for instance to MRI, this study documents how molecular diamagnetic properties of different cellular components may cause large-scale effect at the cellular level. Overall, the paper is well written, and the significance of the data presented is trustworthy, although some effects appear to be small.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper, Zhang et al. use a 27 T static magnetic field to explore its effects to spindle orientation in vivo. Microtubules have been shown to align in vitro under magnetic fields, but this is the first time that spindle orientation under magnetic fields is studied. The authors mainly find that spindles orient perpendicular to the applied magnetic field, which is attributed to the chromosomes aligning parallel to the magnetic field, although the evidence for that is a bit unclear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (which is difficult to interpret and seems to suggest there is no change between wham and 27 T conditions). This evidence is consistent with the fact that perpendicularly aligned spindles have a slightly increased width as compared to parallel aligned spindles (obtained when chromosomes are misaligned). In summary, the aligning torque acting on chromosomes is larger than in spindles, resulting in the perpendicular alignment of spindles with respect to the magnetic field orientation. This also suggests that the chromosome-spindle interactions are strong enough to rotate the whole spindle. It would be interesting to know how these results change in larger spindles where the chromosome-spindle microtubule connections may be indirect. The ability of turning spindles is potentially interesting when used to investigate cleavage positioning during development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22911.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>As you can see, all three reviewers were intrigued by your work, and therefore we would like to publish your work in eLife, assuming you can address the two major concerns and some minor comments below.</italic> </p><p><italic>Although the effects are convincing, it is not clear why smaller SMF has no effect, or in another word, why such a strong SMF must be applied to orient the spindle.

Since the magnetic torque depends on the magnetic field intensity and the magnetic susceptibility of the object so that it was not surprising to see multiple studies showing that the magnetic field strength is the key factor that determines the bioeffects of SMFs. For example, in 1993, Higashi et al. showed that 1 T SMF had only detectable alignment effect on erythrocytes while 4 T high SMF induced almost 100% alignment (Higashi et al. 1993). In 2011, Zhao et al. found that 8.5 T SMF could decrease the ATP level in AL cells but 1 T or 4 T SMFs could not (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/bem.20617/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/bem.20617/abstract</ext-link>. DOI: 10.1002/bem.20617). The torque of a substance is equal to the product of magnetic field intensity and the magnetic susceptibility of the object, in which the susceptibility could also be field-dependent and can be Taylor expanded. This means that the torque could be parabolically proportional to the magnetic field strength. Thus, a high field has much more severe impact than a lower field and this relationship is not linear. We have added this information to the discussion part of the revised manuscript.</p><p>For microtubules, it was proposed that the size of their diamagnetic anisotropy is such that 5 μm long microtubules could be completely aligned in a field of around 10 T (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349502754829">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349502754829</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349598778634">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349598778634</ext-link>). Valles et al. predicted that “it seems reasonable to presume that fields in excess of 10 T can align the MS”, which contains mainly microtubule and chromosomes. However, in their calculation, the contribution of chromosomes was not included, which is vertical to the spindle long axis so that they add an “antagonizing” effect. This alone indicates that it would require more than 10 T to rotate the spindle structure. Furthermore, based on the calculation in Maret G’s paper, 1.4 T SMF could align the mitotic chromosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0921452690900778">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0921452690900778</ext-link>). When the chromosomes are combined with spindle microtubules, the final orientation of the whole spindle in the SMF will be determined by the balance between microtubules and the chromosomes. In addition, the whole spindle is also restricted inside the cell by aster microtubules as well as other surrounding factors, which make it even harder to rotate the spindle. Therefore it is not too surprising that the spindle orientation in cells need such a high SMF.</p><p>For the dosage test of SMF strength, we added a new set of experiment to test the effect of 1T and 9T on coverslips parallel to the magnetic field (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>)</p><p><italic>The experiments as well as the manuscript were often not as well organised as could be.

We added a new set of experiment to test the effect of 1 T and 9 T exposure for 4 hours, which is the same to the 27 T experiments, on coverslips parallel to the magnetic field (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have also added a set of 9 T SMF exposure for 4 hours on coverslips vertical to the magnetic field (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For 9 T SMF, we did not do the 7-day treatment because 3-day is the maximum running time for that superconducting magnet. For the 27 T water-cooled magnet, the maximum running time is 4-5 hours. In contrast, for magnets below 1 T, since they are permanent magnets, there is no time limitation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this paper, Zhang et al. use a 27 T static magnetic field to explore its effects to spindle orientation</italic> in vivo<italic>.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, the reviewer is right that the difference is not dramatic. Since bigger “a/b” value means better chromosome alignment, the up tilted red lines in the 27 T groups indicate that the spindles tend to orient perpendicular to the magnetic field direction (90<sup>o</sup>) when the chromosomes are well aligned at the metaphase plate.</p><p>Thanks a lot for these very informative suggestions. We are also interested in examining different types of spindles. We are currently collaborating with another group to study the development of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in high magnetic fields and got very promising results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
