constitute a single anatomical entity early in development but later separate into two distinct structures by the secondary ossification center (SOC). The reason for such separation remains unknown. We found that evolutionarily SOC appears in animals conquering the land - amniotes. Analysis of the ossification pattern in mammals with specialized extremities (whales, bats, jerboa) revealed that SOC development correlates with the extent of mechanical loads. Mathematical modeling revealed that SOC reduces mechanical stress within the growth plate. Functional experiments revealed the high vulnerability of hypertrophic chondrocytes to mechanical stress and showed that SOC protects these cells from apoptosis caused by extensive loading. Atomic force microscopy showed that hypertrophic chondrocytes are the least mechanically stiff cells within the growth plate. Altogether, these findings suggest that SOC has evolved to protect the hypertrophic chondrocytes from the high mechanical stress encountered in the terrestrial environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>growth plate</kwd><kwd>chondrocytes</kwd><kwd>whale</kwd><kwd>bat</kwd><kwd>jerboa</kwd><kwd>secondary ossification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Adameyko</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name><name><surname>Adameyko</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name><name><surname>Chagin</surname><given-names>Andrei S</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>András</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Timashev</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Chagin</surname><given-names>Andrei S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006741</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen Frimurare Barnhuset i Stockholm</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Newton</surname><given-names>Phillip T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>NIDDK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bastepe</surname><given-names>Murat</given-names></name><name><surname>Kronenberg</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The principle underlying the appearance of the growth plate, an organ responsible for longitudinal growth, has implications for various cartilage pathologies including growth abnormalities in children, trauma and osteoarthritis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian skeleton articulates via articular cartilage, covering the ends of long bones, and grows in length via epiphyseal cartilage, presented as tiny discs of chondrocytes referred to as growth plates and located near the ends of long bones. The growth plate chondrocytes proliferate, align in the longitudinal direction, and then undergo several-fold enlargement (hypertrophy). Thereafter, the hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis or trans-differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), leaving their calcified extracellular matrix as a scaffold on which invading blood vessels and osteoblasts form new bone tissue, a process known as endochondral bone formation. The process of endochondral bone formation predominantly depends on chondrocyte hypertrophy, and is very conserved throughout the evolution of vertebrates, being described for fin-rayed fish, lobe-finned fish, stem tetrapods, and modern humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In humans and most experimental models commonly employed to study bone growth (i.e., mice, rats, and rabbits), the growth plate is separated from the articular cartilage by a bony fragment, called a bony epiphysis, generated developmentally from a secondary ossification center (SOC). In rodents and humans, this skeletal element forms during early postnatal development and splits the initially contiguous cartilaginous element (the cartilaginous epiphysis) into distinct articular and growth plate cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hall, 2015</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref> for orientation). Interestingly, this spatial separation of articular and growth plate structures is not always required for articulation or bone growth, since it is absent in several vertebrate taxa, such as stem tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>), Chelonians, Crocodilians, and Urodeles (salamanders) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fröbisch and Shubin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Haines, 1938</xref>) (see examples of salamander cartilage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).</p><p>These observations raise the intriguing question as to why in many taxa including humans the cartilaginous epiphysis evolved into two functionally and spatially separated structures, one responsible for skeletal articulation and the other one required for skeletal growth.

In sauropsids, which can be subdivided into two large clades, Lepidosauria (lizards and <italic>Sphenodon</italic>) and Archosauria (crocodilians, chelonians, birds, and non-avian dinosaurs), diversification of bone ossification is greater. Lepidosauria generally develops a SOC (lizards) or calcified secondary center (SC, sphenodontids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Instead, this clade develops bone marrow protrusions with calcified or ossified walls that protrude into the epiphyseal cartilage and sequester the hypertrophic chondrocytes in between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Haines, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Haines, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barreto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Horner et al., 2001</xref>).

Such habitat change may pose additional mechanical demands on the growing skeleton, which must be sufficiently rigid to bear the body weight during a wide range of movements, yet flexible enough to allow bone elongation. Accordingly, we next hypothesized that the development of the SOC or ossified protrusions might be viewed as skeletal adaptations to the weight-bearing demands of the terrestrial environment and associated mechanical stresses posed on the epiphyseal cartilage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mathematical modeling</title><p>To explore the potential effects of the SOC and ossified protrusions on stress distribution within the epiphyseal cartilage, we first employed mathematical modeling (i.e., finite element analysis, FEA) based on a modified model developed by Carter and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carter and Wong, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, see the Materials and methods section for details). For description of the local force effects in an equilibrium state, we evaluated the distributions within the model of maximum compressive principal stress, octahedral stress, and hydrostatic stress. These scalar point-wise stress state measures can, in essence, be seen as representing the local stress state by the dominant pressure in any direction (maximum compressive principal stress), the deforming stress tending to deform a spherical region into an ellipsoidal one (octahedral stress), and the uniform shape-preserving pressure tending to change just the size of a sphere (hydrostatic stress). In this evaluation, the shape-changing octahedral shear stress was provisionally assumed to be the most significant one for chondrocytes according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carter and Wong, 1988</xref>.</p><p>First, the FEA showed that the SOC significantly enhances the stiffness of the entire epiphyseal structure (note the level of deflection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), thereby preventing severe distortion and consequent instability during locomotion. This provides experimental support to the idea proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Haines, 1942</xref>. Furthermore, FEA revealed that the presence of either a SOC or ossified protrusions reduces the extent of octahedral shear stress distribution (associated with either a vertical or an angled load, the latter mimicking locomotion) within the region of the epiphyseal plate, particularly where the hypertrophic chondrocytes are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, see other stresses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, despite being similarly protective for epiphyseal chondrocytes, the ossified protrusions do not improve the stiffness of the joint structure. Thus, our mathematical modeling indicates that both of these skeletal adaptations reduce octahedral stress within the epiphyseal cartilage, plausibly representing alternative evolutionary strategies for achieving the same goal.</p><p>Thus, in our subsequent analysis, we focused only on the SOC since it is most relevant to human physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparative analysis of animals with specialized extremities</title><p>Thus, evolutionary analysis suggests that the appearance of the SOC can be a skeletal adaptation to the terrestrial environment, whereas mathematical modeling suggests that this adaptation may evolve to protect the growth plate structure from mechanical stresses.

We found that hypertrophic chondrocytes are characterized by very low mechanical stiffness and high vulnerability to loading. It is likely that their low mechanical stiffness in combination with the large size makes them vulnerable to various mechanical stresses, including the octahedral and principle compressive stresses. These mechanical vulnerabilities may be intrinsic to the process of chondrocyte hypertrophy per se, which is characterized by an enormous and rapid increase in the cellular volume, that is, twentyfold within 12 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>). At the same time, chondrocyte hypertrophy is a key part of the process of endochondral bone formation, not only contributing 59% of longitudinal growth (73% if the corresponding extracellular matrix is taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Breur et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilsman et al., 1996</xref>]), but also coupling cartilage resorption to the formation of the underlying bone tissue (e.g., via secretion of Ihh and VEGF, as well as matrix calcification) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>). The growth of long bones via hypertrophic intermediates (i.e. endochondral bone formation) has been evolutionarily conserved for at least 400 ± 20 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>) and it seems plausible that early in evolution when growth occurred in the aquatic environment, no specific mechanical demands were posed on the hypertrophic chondrocytes due to compensation of body mass/ground reaction force by buoyant force. However, the transition to a fully terrestrial environment, unequivocally coupled with the loss of the buoyant force, places new mechanical demands on the growing skeleton, such as a need to withstand the body mass, and required additional adaptations of the skeleton.</p><p>The observation that longitudinal growth is sensitive to mechanical loads was documented almost two centuries ago and formulated during the period of 1862–1897 as the Hueter-Volkmann law, which states that ‘<italic>increased mechanical compression reduces longitudinal bone growth while reduced mechanical loading increases it</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mehlman et al., 1997</xref>). This law was confirmed by numerous subsequent studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Matsuda et al., 1986</xref> revealed that the growth of the tarsometatarsus of roosters was delayed when exposed to a strenuous exercise. This observation was further extended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reich et al., 2005</xref>, who showed that chicks freely running with backpacks loaded with 10% of their body mass experience growth retardation associated with increased resorption of the epiphyseal cartilage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kiiskinen, 1977</xref> showed that the longitudinal growth of the femur of young mice was retarded after several weeks of intensive training. Our data suggest that such a sensitivity of the growing bones to excessive load is due to the mechanical properties of hypertrophic chondrocytes and their vulnerability to mechanical stresses. It is likely that the cell death observed in our ex vivo and in vivo experiments is rather a far extreme manifestation of the cellular stress experienced by hypertrophic chondrocytes. The lower levels of cellular stress might have lesserbut yet negative impact on the hypertrophy process, such as decreased production of extracellular matrix and signaling proteins, including the observed reduction in Ihh, PTHrP, and ColX expression. Supporting, decreased expression of ColX was observed in the chicks with backpacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reich et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Locomotion is thought to impose the most frequent and severe loads on limb bones in terrestrial tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biewener, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butcher et al., 2008</xref>). In children, normal gait pattern generates peak loads of four to six fold of the body weight on the femur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burdett, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>). Such loads would be expected to be even higher during intensive physical activity, like sprinting or jumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burdett, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ozgüven and Berme, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Perttunen et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the load of 0.2N used in the present study is within the physiological range for animals with 20-gram body weight and would impair hypertrophic chondrocytes if they are not protected. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that if mice would not develop the SOC, hypertrophy of their chondrocytes would be negatively impacted during locomotion, which is in line with our pharmacological and genetic manipulations where mice with under-developed SOC display increased death of hypertrophic chondrocytes. At the same time, our data show that the SOC provides very effective protection, increasing withstanding loads up to twenty-five-fold and likely allowing hypertrophic chondrocytes to bear the corresponding body weight under various locomotion modalities, including sprinting and jumping.</p><p>However, in absolute numbers, the loads in elephants and mice look far beyond any compensation achievable by the SOC. How does it work? Considering species with various body masses along the phylogenetic tree, it was first noted by Galileo Galilei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Galile, 1974</xref>) that the skeletal elements become more robust relative to the body mass (BM) as the latter increases. The relation of the skeletal elements to BM is allometric (i.e. adaptive) and is generally described by the power law equation <italic>y = kx<sup>a</sup></italic>, where <italic>k</italic> represents coefficient and <italic>a</italic> represents scaling factor. The highest correlation has been shown between stylopodial (femur or humerus) diameter (D) and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campione and Evans, 2012</xref>). However, the exact scaling factor varies among studies, depending on the type of species and taxa utilized, weight-range selection, number of outliers, statistical strategy, sample size, etc. For example, for ungulates, this relationship is calculated as D=BM<sup>0.366</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>), whereas for insectivores+rodents it is D=BM<sup>0.3944</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bou et al., 1987</xref>). The most comprehensive analysis of quadrupedal terrestrial tetrapods (including both mammals and reptiles) resulted in the equation D = 1.26*(BM)<sup>0.364</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campione and Evans, 2012</xref>). This allometric increase in bone diameter substantially reduces the pressure (load per area) on the growth plate with increased bone mass. For example, due to this allometry, the increase in body size by thousandfold elevates the pressure on the growth plate by 4.3–6.6 fold (depending on which scaling factor from above is employed). Thus, allometric scaling of the skeleton compensates for most of the mechanical stress associated with increased body mass in terrestrial tetrapods. However, this compensation is not complete and pressure on the growth plate gradually increases for heavier animals. Why this compensation is not complete is currently unclear but may be coupled to high energy demands or unbearable skeletal mass required for compensation exclusively via skeletal allometry. Indeed, simple calculations show that complete pressure compensation on the skeleton can be achieved with the scaling factor 0.5 (i.e., D=BM<sup>0.5</sup>), which would result in 3.4-fold increase in diameter of every weight-bearing skeletal structure of a 10 kg animal, such as a dog. Various alternative adaptations are employed by nature to allow the skeleton to withstand the increasing body mass and preserve the bone safety factor (the ratio of failure load to functional load), which is surprisingly stable from a mouse to an elephant and ranging from two to four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biewener, 1990</xref>). The most significant adaptations include musculoskeletal composition, postures, and gait patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biewener, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biewener, 1989</xref>). These adaptations, thought to evolve for the preservation of the skeletal safety factor, may unequivocally provide additional protection to the growth plate structure.</p><p>These various adaptations need to be considered from the evolutionary perspective, where various traits can evolve independently, develop in parallel or converge. With few sub-specialized exceptions, the entire Mammalia class can be characterized by the development of the SOC. In contrast, within Sauropsida clade, which is subdivided into two clades, Lepidosauria and Archosauria, limbed lepidosaurs (lizards and <italic>Sphenodon</italic>) exhibit a SOC, whereas Archosauria (crocodilians, chelonians, birds, and dinosaurs) exhibits ossified protrusions of bone marrow into epiphyseal cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Haines, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Haines, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barreto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Horner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These protrusions are well-developed with calcified or ossified walls and penetrating deep into the epiphyseal cartilage, sequestering hypertrophic chondrocytes in between them in non-avian dinosaurs and birds, but very rudimental in chelonians and crocodilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Haines, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Haines, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barreto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Horner et al., 2001</xref>). According to our mathematical modeling, these extended protrusions are more efficient in protecting the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes, whereas the SOC also reduces the deflection of the joint during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which would facilitate more efficient transmission of the ground reaction force vector toward the body movement. Whether this difference has an evolutionary advantage remains to be explored, but the observation that extant birds develop SOCs only in their weight-bearing long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Watanabe, 2018</xref>) might suggest that improving the mechanical properties of the cartilaginous joint has an additional evolutionary advantage. Thus, it is plausible that the appearance of the SOC in weight-bearing long bones of birds represents an evolutionary convergence. At the same time, the appearance of the SOC in Mammalia and Lepidosauria and ossified protrusions in Archosauria can be considered as alternative parallel traits. Interestingly, recent genome sequencing of tuatara, the most ancient extant creature of Lepidosauria, revealed remarkable similarities in genome architecture with mammalian lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gemmell et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Of course, the evolution of skeletal traits should not be considered alone, but in a connection with other related traits, such as postures and gaits. In this context, Mammalia can be characterized by an erect posture with (nearly) parasagittal limb kinematics in which the limbs support the entire weight of the trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biewener et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biewener et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blob and Biewener, 1999</xref>). Same as mammals, birds, and dinosaurs are characterized by an erect posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carrano and Biewener, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander, 1985</xref>) whereas limbed lepidosaurs, crocodilians, and chelonians have a sprawling posture with laterally projected limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gans and Webb, 1997</xref>). In such a configuration, the weight of the body is essentially distributed as shear stress in the midshaft of the stylopod, thereby loading the bone in torsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blob and Biewener, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashley-Ross, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanchez et al., 2010</xref>). The hypertrophic chondrocytes are therefore not highly stressed in compression. Contrary to chelonians, some limbed lepidosaurs and crocodilians are capable of semi-erect posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Clemente et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schuett et al., 2009</xref>). This is an intermediate configuration between the sprawling and erect posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gans and Webb, 1997</xref>). In that position, during the phases of fast locomotion, the limb-bone strain can significantly increase in axial compression and bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blob and Biewener, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biewener, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Clemente et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jd, 2002</xref>). Crocodilians partition their habitat (to maximize feeding and/or minimize interference and predation), the juveniles are often restricted to shallow aquatic margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jc, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McNease, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>). They barely go out of the water and only occasionally use a semi-erect posture. For these reasons, very little compressive stress is applied to their limb-bone growth plates at the juvenile stage. This may be the reason why crocodilians develop no SOC at their limb-bone extremities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Haines, 1938</xref>). On the contrary, all lizard limb-bones have SOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Haines, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Haines, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ml, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sanchez et al., 2008</xref>) or calcified secondary center (SC) (in sphenodontids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Haines, 1939</xref>). Lizards are terrestrial at the juvenile stage. In this exposed environment, they need to sprint fast and jump to avoid predation and hunt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marsh, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huey, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gj, 1985</xref>). Many of them use a semi-erect or bipedal posture for this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gans and Webb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Clemente et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schuett et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the evolvement of the SOC may provide an advantage in terms of protection of the hypertrophic chondrocytes, simultaneously with improved firmness of the joint structure during the juvenile stage. Tortoises also develop exclusively on land. However, they only display this lateral limb projection typical of sprawling posture, which induces shear stress on the femoral midshaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Butcher and Blob, 2008</xref>). No compression has been reported so far in the limb bones of tortoises. In addition, they move in such a slow manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Butcher and Blob, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Walker, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zani et al., 2005</xref>) that the threshold of strain-related stimuli is too low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butcher et al., 2008</xref>) to constrain the microanatomy of limb bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nakajima et al., 2014</xref>) and stress their growth plates. This probably explains why SOCs are not present in terrestrial tortoise limb bones.</p><p>These evolutionary considerations lead us to propose that the development of SOCs (in mammals and Lepidosauria) or extended ossified protrusions (Archosauria) can be considered as parallel evolutionary traits evolved together with various postures for adaptation to the weight-bearing demands of terrestrial environments, including the mechanical stress placed on the epiphyseal cartilage in juveniles. At the same time, the evolutionary transition from water to land was associated with numerous other changes in the endocrine, respiratory, secretory, and other systems, most of which exert or may exert various effects on the skeleton. For example, the physiological functions of calcium influence the regulation of numerous types of bone cells. Similarly, the translocation of hematopoiesis from the kidney in fish to the bone marrow in terrestrial animals also affects bone physiology. Thus, mechanical adaptation may not be the only explanation for the development of the SOC.</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, adaptive development of the SOC suggests an underlying genetic mechanism(s), as opposed to the widely held view that mechanical stress causes this development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carter and Wong, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Klein-Nulend et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stevens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sundaramurthy and Mao, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wong and Carter, 1990</xref>). Indeed, in many instances, the SOC is formed during development before the application of mechanical forces. One well-known example of this is provided by newborn marsupials (e.g., the kangaroo), which are quite immature when born and need to use their forelimbs (which are much more ossified at this point than their hindlimbs) to climb into the pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">de Oliveira et al., 1998</xref>). Another example involves ungulates, who must be able to walk and run within a few hours after birth. Accordingly, in calves, the SOC develops well before birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Winters et al., 1942</xref>). The heterochrony in the development of the SOC in different bones of jerboa and Chiroptera observed here is in line with these observations. Furthermore, such temporal variation even before birth and within the same limb of Chiroptera prepares adequately for future mechanical demands (see further above). Furthermore, early mechanical unloading of the hindlimbs of rats had no effect on the development of the SOC and raising <italic>Notophthalmus viridescens</italic>, which do not naturally develop a SOC, under terrestrial weight-bearing environment did not promote the formation of this structure (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Libbin et al., 1989</xref>). All these findings indicate strongly that the development of the SOC is genetically programmed.</p><p>The nature of this genetic programming remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, it was reported recently that a single nucleotide neomorphic mutation in miRNA140 delays the appearance of the SOC substantially, without dramatically influencing chondrocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Grigelioniene et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that the underlying genetic program can be fine-tuned relatively easy. Among potential endocrine factors, thyroid hormone (TH), which regulates skeletal development in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassett and Williams, 2016</xref>), promotes the development of the SOC. In TSHR-deficient mice formation of the SOC is delayed substantially and this effect can be reversed by T3/T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, inactivation of thyroid hormone receptor - alpha (THR1a) in chondrocytes impairs their hypertrophy, formation of the SOC, and overall bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Desjardin et al., 2014</xref>). At the same time, the SOC develops at different time-points in different bones suggesting the involvement of local mechanism(s). Indeed, sophisticated pre-receptor control of the activity/availability of TH (e.g., through the tissue-specific expression of deiodinase enzymes and transporters) and of their receptors (e.g., through the tissue-specific expression of these receptors and their co-activators and co-repressors) allows tight regulation of the timing and location of responsiveness to this hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Williams, 2013</xref>). Since TH influences the expression of approximately 400 early-response genes in the growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Desjardin et al., 2014</xref>) and roughly the same number of genes during metamorphosis in amphibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Das et al., 2009</xref>), it is difficult at present to even speculate about which specific genetic program triggered by TH might be involved in regulating the development of the SOC.</p><p>In conclusion, various independent approaches employed in this study (i.e., evolutionary analysis, mathematical modeling, biophysical tests, comparative zoology, biological experiments) all suggest that one evolutionary reason for the appearance of a spatially separated growth plate is to shield the hypertrophic chondrocytes from the mechanical stress associated with weight-bearing and, accordingly, preserve the mechanism of endochondral bone formation in terrestrial animals. Conceptual understanding of the underlying evolutionary, mechanical, and biological reasons behind the spatial separation of articular cartilage and the growth plate will provide a deeper understanding of skeletal biology and evolution. This, for example, can improve the design of sporting activities for children or influence surgical interventions related to epiphyseal fractures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6 (mouse strain)</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>Sprague Dawley (rat strain)</td><td>Janvier Labs</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Col2a1-Cre:Sik3<sup>F/F</sup></italic> (mouse strain)</td><td>Dr. Henry Kronenberg, Massachusetts General Hospital</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Sik3<sup>F/F</sup></italic> (mouse strain)</td><td>EUCOMM</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Col2a1-Cre</italic> (mouse strain)</td><td>Richard R.

When applying the load, the medial tibia plateau flanked by the tibia bone grooves is always facing one direction and the angled pressure was applied always to one side of the plateau (on top of one of the grooves). When embedding in OCT for sectioning, the bone is always placed into the grid with the medial tibia plateau facing upward and sectioned frontally to ensure the pressure direction during imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calculation of mechanical and material properties</title><p>The determination of the position of the bone relative to the position of its fixture yielded the deformation value. Stiffness was defined as the slope of the initial linear portion of the load-deformation curve. Stress was calculated by distributing the load equally over the top (vertical load) or side surface (angular load) of the epiphysis, assuming that both of these surfaces were oval. The strain was calculated by distributing the bone deformation equally along the height of the epiphysis. The initial linear portion of the stress-strain curve up to 0.2% offset was plotted together with the stress-strain curve itself in the same graph and the intersection of the line and curve defined as the 0.2% offset yield strength.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Axitinib injection</title><p>Axitinib (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.25 mg per animal per day for the C57BL/6 mice for 8 (P21 to P27) or 10 days (P18 to P27 or P21 to P30). The control group of the C57BL/6 mice received the same volume of DMSO injection each day.

The force spectroscopy measurements were performed using a MultiMode eight atomic force microscope with a Nanoscope V controller and E scanner (Bruker). The regions of cells of interest for the acquisition of force-distance curves were selected under the optical microscope in combination with the AFM instrument.</p><p>The force-distance curves were acquired employing CP-PNP-BSG colloidal probes (NanoandMore GmbH, Germany) with a 5 µm borosilicate glass microsphere attached to the 200 µm cantilever. The spring constants of the cantilevers (measured by the thermal tune procedure) were 0.06–0.09 N/m.</p><p>All measurements were conducted at 25°C and all tissue was handled in DMEM/F12 HEPES-containing medium on ice. At least 70 individual force-distance curves were acquired for each type of cell by ramping over the surface and a total of 30 cells were measured from three different animals. These force-distance curves were processed with the NanoScope Analysis v.1.10 software (Bruker).

Measurements were performed on 220–250 µm sections of live tissues (without fixation and freezing) obtained by vibratome (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 2-4°C. After the measurement, the sections were stained with PI (Sigma) and CalceinAM (Sigma) to confirm cell viability.</p><p>Nanoindenter includes a controller, an optical fiber, and a spherical tip for the force-displacement curves acquisition. The tip is attached to a flexible cantilever, the displacement of which after the contact with a surface is measured using an interferometer via an optical fiber.</p><p>To measure the Young’s modulus, the probe was immersed for 5 μm into the sample at each point of measurement. The Young’s modulus for each point was computed according to the Hertzian contact mechanics model for a spherical body indenting a flat surface, using the built-in Piuma software.</p><p>For the study of 10-day-old rat and 30-day-old mice cartilage mechanical characteristics, we used a cantilever with the spring constant of 4.14 N/m and a tip with the 45.5 μm radius of curvature. The measurements were conducted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) cooled to 2–4°С to maintain cell viability. The samples were immobilized with a specially designed holder immersed in cold PBS. During the measurements, the probe was always located inside the fluid medium at a sufficient depth, in order to avoid measurement errors due to adhesion forces at the air-water boundary. The area of the Young’s modulus mapping for rat samples was 1350 × 400 μm with the step of 45 μm by the X-axis and 100 μm by the Y-axis. For mice, the area of mapping was 585 × 360 μm with the step of 45 μm by the X- and Y-axes. Based on the results of the measurements, the effective Young’s modulus was computed, its distribution over the surface was plotted and mean ± standard deviation (SD) Young’s modulus value calculated.</p><p>For the experiment assessing the effect of axitinib on the mechanical properties of epiphyseal cartilage, between 14 and 96 measurements of cartilage stiffness with nano-indenter were performed for each animal and the median (due to not normal distribution of the measurements) was chosen as the closest ‘true’ value representing cartilage stiffness for each mouse (six controls and seven treated mice). These values were employed to assess the effect of the treatment, their normal distribution verified by the Shapiro–Wilk test (passed; p=0.4051 and p=0.3921 for control and axitinib groups, respectively) and equality of distributions compared by unpaired t-test with n = 6 for control and n = 7 for treated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Finite element analysis</title><p>The effects of a SOC on the distribution of stress in the zones of bone growth were explored by numerical simulations. Following the reasoning of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carter et al., 1998</xref>, a plane-strain 2D domain was considered, to simplify the complex geometry of the bone end, and thereby clarify fundamental aspects of the response. The model thus considered five sub-domains. The geometry of this simulation domain was a slight modification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carter et al., 1998</xref>, with a total height of 66 mm, the radius at the top of 17 mm, and bottom width of 25 mm. The cortical bone was given a width of 2.5 mm (measured horizontally). The thickness normal to the 2D plane was by definition 1 mm. Only the top part of the model is shown in the results figures.</p><p>The main parameter in these simulations was the presence or absence of a SOC or other stiffer tissues, introduced by providing this domain with stiffness at least equal to that of the cartilage domain. Non-linear strains were taken into consideration, but the materials in all subdomains were considered to be linearly elastic, as described by a Young’s modulus E<sub>i</sub> and a Poisson ratio ν<sub>i</sub>. We used the same material properties as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carter et al., 1998</xref>), and in particular for cartilage E<sub>C</sub> = 6 MPa, ν<sub>C </sub>= 0.47. When included, the SOC was defined in a subdomain with E<sub>D</sub> = 500 MPa, ν<sub>D </sub>= 0.20. Thus, the stiff tissue had the material properties of dense cancellous bone, that is, approximately eighty-fold stiffness compared to cartilage.</p><p>In all cases, the bottom edge of the complete model had zero displacements vertically, and the outside edges of the cortical bone zero displacements horizontally. Applied to different 45<sup>o</sup> sectors of the semi-circular top, the pressure was modeled as maximal on the center of the given sector (300 kPa for physiological level, 3 MPa for supra-physiological), falling quadratically and symmetrically to zero on the two neighboring sector borders. In light of the symmetry of the domain, only the top- or right-hand side was loaded (except for a verification case to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carter et al., 1998</xref>, not shown). The direction and integrated total force of loading were affected slightly by the finite deformation of the domain.</p><p>Different components or comparison values of stress (measured as the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress relative to the unstressed reference volume) were evaluated. The primary focus was on hydrostatic stress, the lowest principal stress (always compressive), and the octahedral shear stress, providing different perspectives on the response to external loading. Since the situations considered were dominated by compressive stresses, the signs for the two first have been changed in figures. Stress values are plotted on the deformed shape of the domain, without magnification of the deformation.</p><p>Numerical simulations of the response to loading were based on parameterized finite element approximations and performed in the Comsol Multiphysics software (version 5.2, Comsol AB, Stockholm, Sweden).</p><p>With similar loads, this model resulted in stress distribution in and deformation of the cartilaginous epiphysis closely similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carter et al., 1998</xref>.</p><p>Model design for stem tetrapods and archosaurs were based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chinsamy and Abdala, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ray and Chinsamy, 2004</xref>), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Proximal end growth plate of mouse and rat tibia was dissected and homogenized in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction by Trizol and RNA purification by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).

It is important to understand the secondary ossification center is formed during development. Pathological changes in subchondral bone drives progression of joint arthritis. Your findings in this study provide useful information in understanding the pathogenesis of joint arthritis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Secondary ossification center induces and protects growth plate structure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper analyses the role of the secondary ossification center (SOC) for the mechanical properties of long bones in support of growth plates by combining evolutionary developmental comparisons, mathematical modeling and functional analysis. The mechanical impact of SOC on the proliferation, and apoptosis of chondrocytes in the growth plate was investigated. The manuscript is well written and is educational to both evolutionary and bone development field.</p><p>Evolutionary comparison of long bone development and the analysis of load bearing bones at early postnatal stages strongly indicates that SOC development is related to life on land and to the mechanical loads the bones are exposed to. Mathematical modelling demonstrates that a SOC reduces the mechanical stress on the growth plate upon mechanical loading. Functionally, the authors investigate the mechanical stress upon loading in long bones with and without SOC and in mouse mutants with a delayed formation of the SOC. The loading leads to increases YAP-p73 induced apoptosis and that a SOC reduces the response significantly.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written, interesting and will help to understand the role SOC during development and the interplay between articular cartilage and subchondral bone, and particularly in osteoarthritis. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript. We also realized that difficulties with the single mouse experiments, like the different developmental age of mice and rats in an evolutionary approach, which could be strengthened with the combination of the different mouse(rat) models (circumstantial evidence) and the evolutionary and mathematical analyses. Therefore, we would like to consider your revised manuscript within 4 months.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lack of molecular mechanism that determines the presence or absence of the secondary ossification center. The authors' conclusions naturally lead to further questions such as:</p><p>a) Whether mechanical unloading prevents formation of secondary ossification.</p><p>b) How chondrocytes from animals with the secondary ossification respond differently to mechanical stimulation from those without it.</p><p>c) What inhibits/induces formation of the secondary ossification in animals that do/not have it during the development, etc.?</p><p>2) It is impressive that the investigators provide microanotomical characterization of SOC formation in different species of animals from 380-million-year-old lobe-finned fish to present mammals. However, when animals left the aquatic environment and began to live on land, the changes of mechanical loading only partially contribute to adaption of the skeletal system. For example, the changes in the endocrine system and the development of parathyroid gland (PTH becomes a hormone to regulate skeletal modeling and remodeling) may all play a role in the SOC formation. This question also applies to the comparative analysis of the cetaceans with the other two terrestrial animals.</p><p>3) The gait pattern of jerboa that showed in the video clip doesn't support that the jerboa only uses its front limbs for crawling during the first 2 weeks of age. Instead, they seem to use their hind limbs for crawling more.</p><p>4) There is a concern regarding the comparison between 10-day old rats and 30-day-old mice. The rodents are under fast growing during the first postnatal month. Although the indentation of cartilage of these two animal models is similar, the development of skeletal tissue such as muscle, ligaments may be different. Importantly, the intrinsic biological and/or mechanical properties, such as the proliferation rate or matrix protein synthesize capabilities of the chondrocytes in rat at P10 is likely distinctive to mouse at P30. In the Figure 5, it clearly shows that the cell number of the growth plate in the rat model in much more than the mouse model. Whether this characteristic affect the outcome?</p><p>5) The FEA simulation model is relatively simplified. For example, they assume both of the surfaces were oval and materials in all subdomains were considered to be linearly elastic, which brings concerns on the FEA to reflect the real mechanical situation.</p><p>6) The influence of genetic modulation or axitinib treatment on changes of phenotype cannot be excluded if no evidence shows that the biological properties of the chondrocytes do not change in the axitinib or Prx-Cre: Gsa model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55212.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lack of molecular mechanism that determines the presence or absence of the secondary ossification center.

Experimental animals that develop a SOC and are available to us (i.e., mice and rats) develop the SOC early in postnatal life, when pups are still dependent on their mother’s milk. This precludes us from performing classical unloading experiments such as tail suspension.</p><p>To overcome this issue, we have established and explored two models of hindlimb unloading in breastfeeding pups. One is sciatic nerve resection and another is a foot fixation by a kinesiology tape (resembling a cast fixation, but lighter in weight and exchangeable daily). The tape has a bitter taste and the mother does not remove it. Both experimental models were applied to rats at 10 days of age (prior SOC appearance) and analyzed at 23 days of age, when SOC is developed.</p><p>Unloading caused no differences in SOC size as compared with either sham-operated animals (separate animals were used for this control) or contralateral leg of the manipulated animals. At the same time clear decrease in bone mass was observed in the unloaded limb. Unloading models were verified as following: Inability to use the nerve-resected leg was confirmed by footprint behavior test, lack of innervation throughout the study period (one represented video is uploaded for review purposes). Tape-restricted unloading was confirmed by video-recording every 4 days (one represented video is uploaded for review purposes).</p><p>These new experiments are presented in new Figure 10 and Figure 10—figure supplement 1 (footprints) and reflected in the text (subsection “Mechanical properties of hypertrophic chondrocytes make them vulnerable to the mechanical stress”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) How chondrocytes from animals with the secondary ossification respond differently to mechanical stimulation from those without it.</p></disp-quote><p>Animals that develop and those which do not develop the SOC belong to different classes, e.g. Amphibia and Mammalia. We think direct comparison of such distinct animals as, for example, salamander and mice will be difficult to interpret in relation to mechanical stimulation specifically.</p><p>However, we have got an access to a salamander of <italic>Notophthalmus</italic> species, which can spend part of their juvenile life on land. Comparison of the epiphyseal cartilage from these animals raised in aquatic and terrestrial environment revealed no formation of the SOC while growing in land. However, we noticed partial calcification of epiphyseal cartilage during terrestrial period of growth. No differences were observed in the number of proliferative or hypertrophic chondrocytes.</p><p>These new data are presented in a new Figure 10—figure supplement 2 and reflected in the text (subsection “Mechanical properties of hypertrophic chondrocytes make them vulnerable to the mechanical stress”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) What inhibits/induces formation of the secondary ossification in animals that do/not have it during the development, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very conceptual question since at present it is not even clear if genetic or mechanical mechanisms are the primary cause of SOC development. The view that mechanical stimulation drives SOC development is quite common in literature (Carter and Wong, 1988; Chagin et al., 2010; Kleinnulend et al., 1986; Stevens, Beaupre and Carter, 1999; Sundaramurthy and Mao, 2006; Wong and Carter, 1990) albeit our new data generated during revision (#1a and b above) strongly argue for genetic mechanism(s) underlying SOC development.</p><p>The general view is that the SOC develops similarly to the primary ossification center (POC), where chondrocyte hypertrophy and associated VEGF secretion attract invasion of blood vessels followed by osteo-progenitors (Maes et al., Developmental Cell 2010, 19:324-344). However, a recent study suggests that there might be some differences between POC and SOC formation. In the latter, mesenchymal cells of perichondrium migrate inside the epiphysis forming canals and secreting VEGF and thereby attracting vascular cells (Tong et al., Stem Cells 2019, 37:677-689). Still, what triggers the migration of perichondrial cells into the epiphysis is as yet unknown.</p><p>There are numerous genes, shown to be implicated in SOC development. These include:</p><p>– EGFR activity (Zhang X et al., J Biol Chem 2013, 8:3229-32240; ablation of EGFR in chondrocytes; slight delay in SOC development and also expanded hypertrophic zone, both are likely via downregulation of MMPs, no data on body size),</p><p>– Canonical Wnt signaling (Dao et al., JBMR 2012, 27:1680-1694; after activation of b-catenin in chondrocytes, analysis is done on E18.5, demonstrating accelerated hypertrophy in the epiphysis and metaphysis; notice that normally SOC starts to form in a mouse femur and tibia around P5),</p><p>– IGF-1 is claimed to be involved (Wang et al., ablation of IGF1R in osx-expressing cells slightly delays SOC formation and strongly decreases body size)</p><p>– Thyroid hormone promotes SOC development (Xing et al., 2014; the effect is vivid and reversible by addition of T3/T4 to TSHR deficient mice, hypertrophy is impaired in the absence of thyroid hormones). Generally, it is well known that thyroid hormone regulates ossification, predominantly via promoting chondrocyte hypertrophy. Inactivation of THR1a in chondrocytes impairs their hypertrophy, formation of the SOC and overall bone growth (Desjardin et al., 2014). Thyroid hormone changes around 400 early-response genes in the growth plate (Desjardin et al., 2014) and roughly the same number in amphibia when it induces metamorphosis (Das et al., 2009), making it difficult to do a qualified guess on the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>– Hypoxia pathway, where ablation of Vhlh in chondrocytes delays formation of the SOC (Pfander et al., Development 2004, 131:2497-2508) and ablation of Hif1a in chondrocytes causes cell loss in the area where SOC is supposed to be developed (Shipani et al., Genes and Development 2001, 15:2865-2876).</p><p>These and other sporadic observations suggest a close connection between SOC formation and chondrocyte hypertrophy within the epiphysis, and the majority of observations reflecting regulation of the SOC involve, in fact, either acceleration or inhibition of chondrocyte hypertrophy, cartilage resorption (i.e., metalloproteinases) or vascularization. In our manuscript we utilized this fact and to adjust SOC size via modulation of chondrocyte hypertrophy, employing mice with either SIK3 conditional ablation or Gsa conditional activation, or via modulation of vascularization.</p><p>However, the mechanism that triggers hypertrophy in a specific region of the epiphysis is not known. Furthermore, it is not known why it does happen in some epiphyses, but not others, like distal and proximal epiphyses of metatarsal bones. Interestingly, a recent study showed that neomorphic mutation in MIR140 (coding microRNA 140) causes a striking delay in SOC development without affecting hypertrophy (Grigelioniene et al., 2019). This point mutation changes a transcription regulation of numerous genes within epiphyseal cartilage as compared either with MIR140-deficient or wild-type mice and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEO) revealed impairment of the hypoxia pathway among others (Grigelioniene et al., 2019). Our brief evolutionary analysis revealed that species with and without SOC development do not differ in the MIR140 sequence, precluding us to consider this point mutation as a potential mechanism in evolutionary appearance of the SOC.</p><p>Summarizing all the above, the question raised by reviewers requires a deep and comprehensive study on its own, which, from our point of view, seems to be beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We have added two new paragraphs to the Discussion reflecting the most likely molecular mechanisms from the above and stressing that our data (particularly new data generated in response to the comments above) provide a general understanding that the process of SOC development is primarily regulated genetically but not mechanically, as it commonly seen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is impressive that the investigators provide microanotomical characterization of SOC formation in different species of animals from 380-million-year-old lobe-finned fish to present mammals. However, when animals left the aquatic environment and began to live on land, the changes of mechanical loading only partially contribute to adaption of the skeletal system. For example, the changes in the endocrine system and the development of parathyroid gland (PTH becomes a hormone to regulate skeletal modeling and remodeling) may all play a role in the SOC formation. This question also applies to the comparative analysis of the cetaceans with the other two terrestrial animals.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct and transition from water to land was associated with numerous changes in the endocrine system and various other systems, such as respiratory, secretory, etc. Most of them have or may have systemic effects on the skeleton. For example, calcium physiology had wide consequences in the behavior and regulation of all bone cells. Similarly, the movement of hematopoiesis from the kidney in fish to the bone marrow in land animals also changed bone dramatically.</p><p>Below we have summarized what is known about parathyroid gland in evolution of vertebrates and aquatic mammals.</p><p>Parathyroid glands are indeed not observed in bony fish (Osteichthyes). Osteichthyes poses calcium-sensing PTH-secreting cells at their gills, but tetrapods have them evolved into parathyroid glands. However, no changes were reported between ultrastructural organization of parathyroid glands between amphibians and fully terrestrial tetrapods, such as reptiles, avian species and mammals (reviewed by Isono H et al., Histol Histopath 1990, 5:95-112). In relation to cetaceans, their transition back to water definitely associated not only with structural adaptation of the skeleton, but also global change in the bone-resistance to mechanical unloading. At the same time parathyroid glands in cetaceans are largely similar to those in terrestrial mammals, with exception that oxyphil cells have not been reported in cetaceans to our knowledge (Kwiecinski GG et al., The American Journal of Anatomy, 1987, 178:421427; Tsuchiya T et al., Tohoku Journal of Agricultural Research, 1983, 33:146-151; Kamiya T et al., Sci Rep Whales Res Inst 1978, 30:281-284; Hayakawa D et al., General and Comparative Endocrinology, 1998, 110:58-66). These cells have unknown function, but theoretically might be a source of PTHrP, as PTHrP is detected in oxyphil cells at high amount (Ritter CS, et al., The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2012, 97:E1499-E1505). At the same time, it has to be admitted that various terrestrial species do not have oxyphil cells, such as rats or chicken (Altenähr E. Curr Top Pathol 1972; 56: 1-54).</p><p>Thus, parathyroid hormone is not likely participating in SOC development and we decided not to include this information into the Discussion. However, there are data suggesting that thyroid hormone is involved in SOC development and we have incorporated those into the Discussion (ninth paragraph).</p><p>We have also softened our conclusions discussing that other factors and systems can also contribute to evolution of the SOC (Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The gait pattern of jerboa that showed in the video clip doesn't support that the jerboa only uses its front limbs for crawling during the first 2 weeks of age. Instead, they seem to use their hind limbs for crawling more.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for doubtful videos presented. Due to ongoing pandemic and lockdown of UCSD (where jerboa colony is housed) we are not able to collect more videos and quantify the use of different limbs during jerboa early postnatal life. However, we have got in contact with Prof. David Eilam (Tel-Aviv University), who studied jerboa intensively in 90<sup>th</sup>. He also does not have ongoing colony of these animals but supplied us with the video showing that jerboas are using only forelimbs in their early life (now added as Figure 3—video 2). We have also referred to his previous work where such a gait acquisition pattern was documented in more details (Eilam and Shefer, 1997, the text is slightly adjusted accordingly, subsection “Comparative analysis of animals with specialized extremities”). We hope this new information would convince the reviewers that jerboas are utilizing their forelimbs much early than their hindlimbs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is a concern regarding the comparison between 10-day old rats and 30-day-old mice. The rodents are under fast growing during the first postnatal month. Although the indentation of cartilage of these two animal models is similar, the development of skeletal tissue such as muscle, ligaments may be different. Importantly, the intrinsic biological and/or mechanical properties, such as the proliferation rate or matrix protein synthesize capabilities of the chondrocytes in rat at P10 is likely distinctive to mouse at P30. In the Figure 5, it clearly shows that the cell number of the growth plate in the rat model in much more than the mouse model. Whether this characteristic affect the outcome?</p></disp-quote><p>In this test system we compare mouse and rat bones stripped off the muscles and ligaments. For intrinsic mechanical properties we compared the entire cartilage, which includes extracellular matrix, and found no differences by nanoindentation (cantilever probe is 45 micrometers in diameter). Proliferation rate is likely different but since the mechanical stress primarily affects hypertrophic chondrocytes, but not proliferative chondrocytes (Figure 6A-I and Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-F), this should not influence the conclusions drawn.</p><p>The number of cells in rat and mouse growth plate is indeed different. To take this into account the data are presented as the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis.</p><p>We further supported this test model by a variety of in vivo experiments (Figure 8 and Figure 9B) and mathematical modeling, which predictions are in line with the observations made on this test model (i.e., stiffness of the epiphysis in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-J and mathematical predictions of deflection Figure 1F).</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concern experimentally, we took a different approach and applied the same pressure (load normalized on cross-section area) on rat tibia at different developmental stages, i.e., postnatal day 5 (P5), P8, P12, P15 and P22, and analyzed correlation between load-induced cell death of hypertrophic chondrocytes and SOC development. This experiment revealed a clear protection of chondrocytes executed by the SOC (new Figure 7).</p><p>Thus, this new model leads to the same outcome as the early (mouse/rat SOC±) ex vivo model and together with in vivo models and mathematical predictions all pointing toward the same conclusion may provide an additional cross-validation. We have also clarified in the manuscript that SOC± models cannot be considered solely without potential cofounding variables (subsection “Functional experiments with two model systems: the SOC protects epiphyseal chondrocytes”).</p><p>We hope that this new experiment and considerations above address the reviewers concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The FEA simulation model is relatively simplified. For example, they assume both of the surfaces were oval and materials in all subdomains were considered to be linearly elastic, which brings concerns on the FEA to reflect the real mechanical situation.</p></disp-quote><p>The shapes in our FEA simulation model are simplified purposely to reveal the greatest conceptual differences between SOC+ and SOC- structures. We based our modelling on the previous key works in this field, i.e., focused on epiphyseal structures (Carter and Wong, 1988 and Carter, MikiĆ, and Padian, 1998).</p><p>The variety of SOC shapes found in nature is virtually endless and if there are specific forms, which reviewers are interested in, we are happy to model those forms as well. Otherwise we prefer to keep the most simplified forms to highlight the conceptual differences made by the SOC in its simplest form, which in fact is common for humans’ and rodents’ bones.</p><p>In relation to linear elasticity, it is originally developed by Hayes and co-authors (J of Biomechanics 1972, 5:541-551) and since then widely used in numerous publications (i.e., 956 citations) including aforementioned works by Carter. So, we employed this model to be able to align our data with the previous research on the epiphysis biomechanics (Carter and Wong, 1988 and Carter, MikiĆ and Padian, 1998). However, the reviewers are right, and over the recent years a biphasic model for cartilage (developed by Mow et al., J of Biomechanical Engineering, 1980, 102:73-84) has become more widely accepted. This biphasic model is particularly used for analysis of articular cartilage and various cartilage implants developed in connection to tissue engineering efforts for repair of articular cartilage.</p><p>Thus, we originally selected the linear elasticity model, reasoning that aligning our data with previous works focused on the SOC is more important than following more precise modeling focused on engineered tissue implants. We hope the reviewers will kindly agree with these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The influence of genetic modulation or axitinib treatment on changes of phenotype cannot be excluded if no evidence shows that the biological properties of the chondrocytes do not change in the axitinib or Prx-Cre: Gsa model.</p></disp-quote><p>We are slightly puzzled what biological properties are in question. We have extensively characterized the effect of axitinib on chondrocytes recently (Newton et al., 2019, Supplementary Table 1) and found that it does not affect chondrocyte proliferation.</p><p>In the context of this manuscript we have assumed that the effect on mechanical properties might be in question here. To address this, we have treated mice with axitinib exactly as before and have measured mechanical properties of cartilage by nanoindentation (cantilever head diameter 45 micrometers). We did not find significant differences in the stiffness of cartilage comparing vehicle and axitinib treated mice. Data are presented in text (subsection “Functional experiments with physiological systems: the SOC protects epiphyseal chondrocytes”).</p><p>Unfortunately we cannot do similar experiment with Prx1-Cre:Gsa mice since the strain is in Boston and the nanoindenter is in Moscow, and it is currently non-feasible to transfer the strain to Moscow.</p><p>We hope that the new data presented as well as previously-published analysis (Newton et al., 2019, Supplementary Table 1) satisfy the reviewers’ concern.</p></body></sub-article></article>
