Here, we present a fast, cost-effective, and robust multicolor whole-organ 3D imaging method assisted with ultraviolet (UV) surface excitation and vibratomy-assisted sectioning, termed translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography (TRUST). With an inexpensive UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED) and a color camera, TRUST achieves widefield exogenous molecular-specific fluorescence and endogenous content-rich autofluorescence imaging simultaneously while preserving low system complexity and system cost. Formalin-fixed specimens are stained layer by layer along with serial mechanical sectioning to achieve automated 3D imaging with high staining uniformity and time efficiency. 3D models of all vital organs in wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the 3D structure of their internal components (e.g., vessel network, glomeruli, and nerve tracts) can be reconstructed after imaging with TRUST to demonstrate its fast, robust, and high-content multicolor 3D imaging capability. Moreover, its potential for developmental biology has also been validated by imaging entire mouse embryos (~2 days for the embryo at the embryonic day of 15). TRUST offers a fast and cost-effective approach for high-resolution whole-organ multicolor 3D imaging while relieving researchers from the heavy sample preparation workload.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16208620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Terence TW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26203619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Terence TW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>Wentao Yu, has applied for a patent (US Provisional Patent Application No.: 63/254,546) related to the work reported in this manuscript..</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf3"><p>Lei Kang, has applied for a patent (US Provisional Patent Application No.: 63/254,546) related to the work reported in this manuscript..</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf4"><p>Victor TC Tsang, has a financial interest in PhoMedics Limited, which, however, did not support this work..</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf5"><p>Yan Zhang, has applied for a patent (US Provisional Patent Application No.: 63/254,546) related to the work reported in this manuscript..</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf6"><p>Ivy HM Wong, has a financial interest in V Path Limited, which, however, did not support this work..</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf7"><p>Terence TW Wong, has a financial interest in PhoMedics Limited, which, however, did not support this work.
