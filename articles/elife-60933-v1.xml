HIV cure. As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly, the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive. Here, we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states. Our results suggest that, contrary to common assumptions, the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets, and is remarkably conserved between individuals. However, reservoir composition differs between tissues and blood, as do cells successfully reactivated by different latency reversing agents. By selecting 8–10 of our 39 original CyTOF markers, we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells. These purified populations were highly enriched for replication-competent and intact provirus, transcribed HIV, and displayed clonal expansion. The ability to isolate unstimulated latent cells from infected individuals enables previously impossible studies on HIV persistence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>There is no cure for the human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), but anti-retroviral drugs allow infected people to keep the virus at bay and lead a normal life. These drugs suppress the growth of HIV, but they do not eliminate the virus. If the treatment is interrupted, the virus bounces back within weeks in most individuals. HIV can start growing again because it hides within particular immune cells, called T cells. These infected cells stay in the infected person’s body for their whole life in a dormant or “latent” state, and represent the main barrier to an HIV cure. If these cells could be eliminated or prevented from producing more virus without daily treatment, then HIV could be cured. The fact that HIV hides inside T cells has been known for a long time, but it has remained unclear exactly what kinds of T cells the virus prefers.</p><p>One challenge to characterizing latently-infected cells is that there is no single protein made by them that is not also made by uninfected T cells. The latently-infected T cells are also very rare: HIV mainly attaches to a protein called CD4, but only one in about a million T cells with CD4 contain the virus. To figure out which CD4-carrying T cells in a patient sample are latently infected, the cells are extracted from the patient’s body and ‘reactivated’ so the virus will start growing again. Unfortunately, the mixture of drugs used to reactivate the T cells changes the cells and the proteins they are producing, which obscures the features the latently-infected T cells had before reactivation.</p><p>Neidleman, Luo et al. developed a new approach to trace the infected, reactivated T cells back to their state before reactivation. Using computational methods and a laboratory technique called mass cytometry, the levels of approximately 40 different proteins were measured in millions of T cells from people living with HIV. These experiments provided an ‘atlas’ of overall T cell features onto which each reactivated cell could be mapped. The population of latently-infected T cells exhibited common features among all the participants. Selecting a few of the most abundant proteins on the surface of the latently-infected cells allowed these cells to be physically separated from all other immune cells.</p><p>In the future, this relatively pure population of infected T cells could be used to study how HIV can persist for many decades. The ‘map’ of these cells’ features will provide a valuable resource for HIV researchers and might enable the discovery of new drugs to eliminate the latent T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV replication but does not eliminate the latent reservoir, which persists for decades in CD4+ T cells and forms a major barrier to HIV cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finzi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wong et al., 1997</xref>). Our understanding of the phenotypic features of latent cells in vivo is limited, in large part because the lack of a universal surface biomarker makes it impossible to directly identify these cells. As a result, fundamental questions remain, such as whether latent cells distribute equally among all CD4+ T cell subsets, and to what extent the reservoir is similar between individuals and between blood and tissues.</p><p>In the absence of direct ways to phenotype latent cells, characterizing the composition of the HIV reservoir has largely entailed sorting CD4+ T cells based on predefined sets of cell-surface proteins, followed by quantitating HIV through a variety of methods. A vast majority of infected cells in virally suppressed individuals harbor defective HIV genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Imamichi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Older quantitation methods based on measuring total HIV DNA/RNA levels, regardless of provirus integrity, are being replaced with methods quantitating levels of replication-competent or genome-intact provirus. These methods afford a more accurate picture of the cells leading to viral rebound during treatment interruption, which are the most relevant targets for HIV cure. The ‘gold standard’ in virus quantitation has been the quantitative viral outgrowth assay (qVOA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finzi et al., 1997</xref>). qVOA has not identified significant differences in the amount of replication-competent HIV in the most commonly studied subsets of memory CD4+ T cells – central memory (Tcm), effector memory (Tem), and transitional memory (Ttm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2020</xref>). Such observations have led many researchers to consider the replication-competent reservoir as equally residing in all cell subsets, which if true makes targeting it more difficult.</p><p>The analysis of proviral sequences, on the other hand, has revealed differences in the frequencies of genome-intact provirus in different sorted subsets. For instance, sequencing of near full-length HIV provirus has identified Th1 and Tem, particularly those that are HLADR+, as subsets preferentially harboring intact viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horsburgh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Viral sequencing has also revealed many intact proviruses within clonally expanded populations, particularly within the Tem and Th1 subsets, and those expressing Ox40 or CD161 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Scheerder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2019</xref>). These and many other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) have solidified the view that clonal expansion plays a major role in maintaining the long-lived HIV reservoir.</p><p>Although analyses of sorted populations have provided meaningful insights into HIV persistence, they have been limited to comparing cell populations that differ in one or two markers. Thus, they do not provide a comprehensive view of the phenotypic features of latent cells. Several methods have recently enabled the direct phenotyping of reservoir cells at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grau-Expósito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pardons et al., 2019</xref>), providing deeper analyses of the reservoir. These methods entail stimulating cells from ART-suppressed patients with a mitogen to induce the expression of HIV RNA and/or proteins, which serve as markers for identifying or isolating cells using FACS. However, one important limitation with these methods is that they require ex vivo stimulation before phenotyping as viral proteins are not typically expressed at detectable levels in unstimulated latent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pardons et al., 2019</xref>). This stimulation will induce phenotypic changes associated with T cell activation, and expression of HIV accessory genes from reactivation will result in host cell remodeling (e.g. downregulation of cell-surface CD4), which will further alter the phenotypes of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, although current methods enable phenotyping of reactivated cells, there is at present no methodology to directly assess the phenotypes of individual latent cells in their original dormant state.</p><p>To overcome this limitation, we applied the principles behind Predicted Precursor as determined by SLIDE (PP-SLIDE), an analytic method we recently established that combines high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping and computational approaches. We have used PP-SLIDE to predict the state of CD4+ T cells before phenotypic changes induced by productive HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we applied it to determine the features of in vivo latent CD4+ T cells before their reactivation by ex vivo stimulation, and validated these findings with patient specimens. Through PP-SLIDE analysis, we were able to address questions fundamental to our understanding of HIV latency and to isolate highly enriched populations of replication-competent latent cells for mechanistic studies of reservoir maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Validation of PP-SLIDE as a method to trace reactivated cells back to their latent state</title><p>PP-SLIDE was recently validated as an approach to trace HIV-remodeled cells to their original pre-infection states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). To determine if it can trace reactivated cells to their original latent state, we tested it first in J-Lat cells, an in vitro model of HIV latency. J-Lat cells are Jurkat cells harboring a single integrated HIV provirus that can be reactivated upon stimulation. Multiple lines of J-Lats have been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>) that have diverged slightly over successive passages. We tested how well PP-SLIDE traces reactivated cells back to their original clone when given the choice of two parental clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells of clone 6.3 were reactivated by stimulation with PMA/ionomycin and phenotyped using a CyTOF T cell panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), along with unstimulated cells of clone 6.3 and another clone 5A8. Using PP-SLIDE (see Materials and methods), the high-dimensional CyTOF-generated information from reactivated 6.3 cells (identified by expression of HIV Gag) was matched against an atlas of concatenated unstimulated 5A8 and 6.3 cells to identify the most similar unstimulated cell for each reactivated 6.3 cell. These unstimulated cells, identified using a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approach, are collectively termed ‘kNN latent cells’. The error rate, defined as the % of reactivated 6.3 cells that matched to unstimulated 5A8 cells, was 0.8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results suggest that although reactivation greatly changes the phenotype of a latent cell, some of the original ‘identity’ of the cell is still retained and that PP-SLIDE can be used to capture this information and thereby identify precursors of reactivated latent cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Validation of PP-SLIDE as a method to trace reactivated J-Lat clones to their parent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic.

The CyTOF profiles of reactivated cells were matched against those of the unstimulated atlas cells. Assuming each reactivated cell retained some of its original pre-stimulation identity and that a phenotypically similar cell was present in the atlas of unstimulated cells, we used PP-SLIDE to identify, for each reactivated cell, the nearest-neighbor within the atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

When visualized against the atlas of unstimulated cells by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Maaten, 2009</xref>), Gag+ reactivated cells occupied a unique region, confirming their distinct phenotype relative to unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). kNN latent cells mapped to several distinct regions of the atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), suggesting a non-random distribution among memory CD4+ T cells.

We focused first on the Tcm, Tem, and Ttm subsets, as they have been the most commonly studied memory CD4+ T cells in the context of HIV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chomont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Josefsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pardons et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soriano-Sarabia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</xref>). In all four donors, the contribution of Tem to the reservoir was greater than its contribution to total memory CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not identify any kNN latent cells with the Ttm phenotype, likely because this subset is relatively rare in blood and not efficiently captured in our samples, each of which harbored fewer than 100 kNN latent cells. When the three FlowSOM clusters of atlas cells with the highest frequencies of kNN latent cells were examined for the relative contributions of the Tcm, Tem, and Ttm subsets, we found that they were all comprised of multiple subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that although Tem are over-represented among kNN latent cells, the clusters most enriched for kNN latent cells – as classified by unbiased clustering based on ~40 markers – are a mixture of Tcm/Tem/Ttm subsets.</p><p>These findings could suggest that the reservoir is quite different between individuals. Alternatively, they could mean that latency markers shared between individuals are not those used to define Tcm/Tem/Ttm cells. Consistent with the latter, when datasets from the four donors were combined and re-run within the same tSNE, the kNN latent cells from the four donors resided within a similar region of the plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results argue that kNN latent cells between different donors are in fact similar. Consistent with this conclusion, relative to total memory CD4+ T cells, kNN latent cells consistently expressed higher levels of select markers of immune checkpoint (PD1, CTLA4), activation (CD69, CD25, HLADR), and T cell differentiation states (Tbet, CRTH2, CCR6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

One of the four suppressed participants who had donated a leukapheresis specimen, PID3010, also agreed to the collection of two sets of lymph node specimens via fine needle aspirates (FNAs) spaced 6 months apart. Upon isolation, each FNA was immediately mock-treated or stimulated for 40 hr with PMA/ionomycin and then subjected to PP-SLIDE. Unlike with blood specimens, memory CD4+ T cells were not purified ahead of time since FNAs yielded limited numbers of cells. However, we pre-gated on memory CD4+ T cells to compare with purified blood cells. The atlases from the three specimens (one blood, two FNAs) showed that blood and FNA cells were phenotypically distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The kNN latent cells from the FNAs, similar to those from blood, were not randomly distributed and remained similar across the longitudinal specimens as demonstrated by their occupying similar regions of tSNE space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Several antigens distinguished kNN latent cells in the blood versus tissues. For instance, CD27, an antigen expressed on Tcm cells, and CD69, a marker of activation in blood but a T resident memory (Trm) marker in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantero-Pérez et al., 2019</xref>), were more highly expressed on FNA kNN latent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). PD1 and CXCR5, markers of Tfh that are preferentially expressed in latent cells particularly in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banga et al., 2016</xref>), were also expressed at especially high levels on kNN latent cells from FNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The co-stimulatory molecule ICOS was expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells exclusively in FNAs, while the exhaustion marker TIGIT was more variably expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

As longitudinal gut specimens were not available, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis comparing gut specimens from four donors to the blood specimens previously analyzed by PP-SLIDE. While differences in the reservoir between the blood and gut were observed, some interesting similarities also emerged. kNN latent cells from the gut were mostly CD69<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>lo</sup>, while those from blood exhibited a much more variable expression pattern of these two antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By contrast, kNN latent cells from both the gut and blood expressed high levels of PD1 but relatively low levels of CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Another similarity was that CTLA4 and CCR6, previously reported to be preferentially expressed on latent cells from tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gosselin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGary et al., 2017</xref>), were both highly expressed in kNN latent cells from the gut and blood.

Interestingly, the FNA atlas cells appeared equidistant to the blood and gut atlas cells, an observation confirmed by Euclidean distance calculations. By contrast, kNN latent cells from FNA and gut tended to cluster more closely together, away from those from blood, which we also confirmed by Euclidean distance calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together with the above analyses suggesting that kNN latent cells from both tissue compartments express high levels of CD69 and PD1, these results suggest that phenotypic features of the reservoir are shared between different tissue sites. That said, a notable difference was that kNN latent cells from FNAs included both naïve and memory cells, while those from the gut only included memory cells, potentially due to the under-representation of naïve cells within the gut compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Markers of kNN latent cells enrich for the replication-competent, genome-intact reservoir</title><p>To determine whether surface markers differentially expressed on kNN latent cells can enrich for the replication-competent reservoir, we custom-designed sorting strategies for each of the four donor blood specimens.

Our panels took into account the expression levels of markers in kNN latent cells, the numbers of cryopreserved cells available from the participant, and the overall abundance of the populations in each sequential gate. The latter two aspects were important considerations as an infrequent population of cells may be highly enriched for kNN latent cells but too rare to sort in sufficient numbers for viral outgrowth and other downstream assays. We arrived at panels of 8–10 markers individualized for each participant. For each donor specimen, we isolated a PD1+ population that we submitted to further selection with the relevant marker panel (enriched) and two PD1+ populations that we did not subject to further selection (disenriched).

The HIV-permissive MOLT-CCR5 cell line was added to propagate viral replication, and after 2 weeks supernatants were quantitated for viral outgrowth by p24 ELISA.

Both scoring methods revealed strikingly more outgrowth in the enriched relative to both disenriched populations in all four donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Consistent with the PP-SLIDE and outgrowth results, enriched cells harbored higher frequencies of intact p24 sequences than disenriched ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To assess the extent of clonal expansion, a major driver of HIV persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), we determined the proportions of expanded identical sequences (EIS). EIS were prominent in both populations, but the proportions of EIS with intact p24 sequences were consistently higher in the enriched ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). A phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that in two of the donors (PID1695 and PID5003), EIS from the enriched and disenriched populations formed distinct lineages, while in donor PID3010 multiple EIS were shared between the enriched and disenriched populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>As the enriched population from PID5003 harbored a particularly high frequency of intact p24 sequences, we analyzed this donor in more detail. We categorized all the sequences analyzed from this individual into those that were full-length intact (i.e. no defects along the entire proviral genome), and those harboring large internal deletions, hypermutations, premature stop codons, and inversions. Remarkably, 65.2% of the enriched population was fully intact, compared to only 0.9% for the disenriched population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This corresponded to an overall frequency of 214 full-length intact sequences per million in the enriched population, as compared to only two per million in the disenriched population. The vast majority (95.5%) of the proviruses in the disenriched population harbored large internal deletions. EIS were prominent among both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Among the EIS in the enriched population, 66.7% were fully intact, compared to 0% in the disenriched population. Fully-intact EIS in the enriched population comprised two groups, suggesting two major expansions of replication-competent reservoir cells in this population of cells highly enriched for replication-competent HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Collectively, these results show that surface markers identified by PP-SLIDE can be used to enrich for replication-competent latent cells and that these cells are enriched for the transcriptionally active reservoir and exhibit clear evidence of clonal expansion of fully-intact proviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Universal panel enriches for latent cells with replication-competent HIV</title><p>The sort panels implemented above were tailored for each donor specimen. Given that some features of kNN latent cells are shared between individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we set out to design a universal panel to enrich for latent cells in a donor-independent fashion. We designed a sorting strategy incorporating eight surface antigens that enrich for kNN latent cells from all four blood specimens analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). As TIGIT was found to be expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells in some but not all donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), we designed a strategy to isolate two enriched populations – one TIGIT<sup>high</sup> and one TIGIT<sup>med/low</sup> – to test the hypothesis that TIGIT is indeed not a marker of latent cells shared between donors. These populations were compared to a PD1+ population disenriched for kNN latent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Furthermore, the TIGIT<sup>high</sup> population harbored more viruses in some donors and the TIGIT<sup>med/low</sup> one in others, validating the notion that TIGIT is not a marker of latent cells shared between donors.

A common viewpoint, based on the limited number of studies that have conducted viral outgrowth assays on sorted cell populations, is that latent HIV persists in all types of CD4+ T cells with no preference for one subset over another. If so, targeting latently infected cells as a curative strategy would be all the more difficult. Taking advantage of recent developments in high-parameter single-cell phenotyping and our PP-SLIDE analysis pipeline, we now show that latently infected cells are not randomly distributed among CD4+ T cells, and provide an in-depth view of the phenotypic features of the in vivo blood and tissue reservoir.</p><p>Multiple observations make us confident that PP-SLIDE identifies the physiologically relevant reservoir. First, our in vitro assay with J-Lat cells showed the method could predict the correct precursor cell 99.2% of the time. Second, cells sorted based on PP-SLIDE were enriched for genome-intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in the expected populations. Of note, our PP-SLIDE characterization had charted the translation-competent reservoir, defined as latent cells able to produce viral proteins upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter et al., 2018</xref>), which may include some replication-incompetent HIV provirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Imamichi et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, our viral outgrowth results closely aligned with the enrichment of kNN latent cells, confirming that PP-SLIDE identifies markers of the replication-competent HIV reservoir most relevant for a cure. Third, using our ‘universal panel,’ we validated the preferential presence of the replication-competent reservoir in expected populations in four untested donors, and PP-SLIDE’s prediction that the latent reservoir is preferentially maintained in TIGIT-expressing cells in some but not all donors.</p><p>The sorting strategies used in our validation experiments were designed to enable comparison of different populations of memory CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of PD1, a marker preferentially expressed on reservoir cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chomont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fromentin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pardons et al., 2019</xref>) and which we found expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells. This was implemented for two reasons: First, to demonstrate that we can enrich for latent cells beyond the selection afforded by PD1 alone. Indeed both our viral outgrowth and proviral sequencing results confirmed PP-SLIDE’s prediction that some but not all PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cells harbor high frequencies of latent HIV. Second, to enable mechanistic comparisons of highly similar populations of sorted cells harboring vastly different levels of replication-competent HIV. We found that in 7/8 cases, the enriched populations initiated more HIV transcription than their disenriched counterparts, suggesting that the transcriptionally active reservoir associates most closely with the replication-competent reservoir and therefore should be a target of HIV curative strategies. We also found that relative to disenriched populations, the enriched ones harbored higher proportions of EIS with intact p24, consistent with the importance of clonal expansion in driving the maintenance of the replication-competent HIV reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hosmane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lorenzi et al., 2016</xref>), although it should be noted that cells with different integration sites can harbor the same proviral sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Of particular interest was our in-depth comparison of two PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cell populations from PID5003. A striking 65.2% of proviruses in the enriched population from this donor were fully intact, versus 0.9% in the disenriched, despite both being PD1 expressors. To put these numbers in perspective, on average only 2–3% of sequences from infected individuals treated during chronic infection are intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>). The overall frequency of intact provirus in the enriched PID5003 population was also extremely high: at 214 per million cells, it was more than an order of magnitude higher than what is observed in Tem (range = 1–26, median, 13 per million), the subset with the highest frequencies of intact provirus as assessed by FLIPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>). This high frequency is not due to an unusually large overall reservoir in this donor, as the phenotypically-similar (PD1+) disenriched population sequenced from this donor exhibited a frequency of only two per million. Our observation that this enriched population, but not the disenriched one, exhibited robust viral outgrowth, further suggests that the intact proviruses in this population are replication-competent. Interestingly, the intact sequences in this enriched population consisted of two large clusters of EIS, suggesting two major clonal expansions in this well-defined population of memory CD4+ cells sorted based on eight surface markers. As these two clusters of viral sequences likely integrated at different genomic sites, these observations support a host rather than virus-driven expansion of these latent cells.</p><p>That we could find such vastly different levels of intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in our enriched versus disenriched populations goes against the notion that the reservoir is ‘everywhere’ and randomly distributed in all subsets. But how do our observations fit with prior reports that the frequencies of replication-competent provirus, as determined from outgrowth assays, were similar between sorted subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2020</xref>)? We believe that the previously sorted subsets were not ones that differ markedly in reservoir frequencies. Most prior subset analyses had focused on the Tem and Tcm subsets, and when focusing on just these subsets our PP-SLIDE results indeed support the notion that both Tem and Tcm were prominent among kNN latent cells. However, our finding that the proportions of Tem were greater among the kNN latent cells than among atlas cells suggests that latency is somewhat biased toward the Tem subset, a finding in line with the higher prevalence of intact provirus in Tem over Tcm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>). Further supporting a non-random distribution of the reservoir is our identification of markers consistently expressed at higher levels on kNN latent cells relative to memory CD4+ T cells. Such markers include ones previously implicated in latency (PD1, CTLA4, Ox40) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fromentin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGary et al., 2017</xref>), some activation markers (CD25, CD69), and markers of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells (Tbet, CRTh2, and CCR6, respectively) suggesting preferential persistence of HIV in more differentiated cells. The reservoir may persist in these cells due to antigen- or homeostatically-driven expansion of these cells which can maintain the reservoir through repeated cycles of clonal expansion.</p><p>Our analysis of longitudinal specimens by PP-SLIDE also provided insights into the stability of the reservoir and its capacity for reactivation. By comparing kNN latent cells from different donors versus longitudinal samples, we found intra-individual variability to be less than inter-individual variability. This observation implies that the phenotypic properties of the reservoir are stable over time, a feature that may facilitate its targeting. In fact, longitudinal stability also held for the reservoir’s susceptibility to the LRAs we tested. Our observation that different stimulatory signals reactivate different latent cells further suggests that ‘shock and kill’ strategies may require multiple LRAs, each preferentially targeting different cell subsets, as recently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grau-Expósito et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pardons et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although our study focused on the blood reservoir for logistical and technical reasons, we also conducted PP-SLIDE analyses on tissue specimens. Perhaps not surprising given the known phenotypic differences between T cells from blood versus tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), we found that blood and tissue kNN latent cells differ quite dramatically. High-dimensional distance calculations revealed that kNN latent cells were more similar between lymph node and gut than between the tissues and blood, suggesting phenotypic commonalities in the latent reservoir found in tissues. Indeed, kNN latent cells from both lymph node and gut expressed high levels of the Trm marker CD69, suggesting that Trm in these tissues, like those from the cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantero-Pérez et al., 2019</xref>), preferentially harbor the reservoir. Together with our observation that kNN latent cells from all sites examined expressed high levels of PD1, these results suggest PD1-expressing Trm as possible targets to eliminate the tissue reservoir. Given recent findings that blood, lymph nodes, and gut are the major sources of HIV dissemination in ART-suppressed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaillon et al., 2020</xref>), targeting latent cells in the compartments analyzed in this study may be sufficient to make a meaningful reduction in the reservoir.</p><p>Our study has some limitations, in particular, a relatively small sample size of only eight blood and five tissue donors, although some donors were characterized longitudinally. Nonetheless, our findings do not support the existence of a single surface biomarker that can be used to target the entire HIV reservoir at once. However, PP-SLIDE enables in-depth charting of the latent reservoir residing in the blood and, likely, any tissue we can access. For therapeutic applications, surface antigens identified by PP-SLIDE as preferentially co-expressed on latent cells can be targeted with a series of bi- or multi-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klein et al., 2016</xref>). More importantly, our ability to isolate highly enriched populations of replication-competent reservoir cells enables in-depth functional analyses of the reservoir and potentiates future implementation of discovery-based approaches such as scRNAseq and PCR-activated cell sorting (PACS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark and Abate, 2017</xref>). These approaches hold great promise for identifying novel markers for HIV eradication but require a high frequency of latent cells that was not achievable previously. We envision that implementing PP-SLIDE on cells phenotyped by scRNAseq together with Antibody-seq approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>) will enable even higher-resolution mapping, with the added advantage that whole-transcriptome approaches do not require pre-defining markers of interest, and allow for the discovery of unanticipated—and perhaps unique—markers of latent cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The identities of both cell lines were authenticated and tested for mycoplasma contamination within the past 10 years. Both cell lines were cultured in RP10 media (RPMI 1640 medium [Corning] supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS, VWR], 1% penicillin [Gibco], and 1% streptomycin [Gibco]). Cells were either processed for CyTOF in the absence of stimulation or stimulated with 16 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 μM ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 hr before processing for CyTOF analysis as described in the appropriate section below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Preparation of HLACs</title><p>Uninfected and HIV-infected human lymphoid aggregate cultures (HLACs) were used as a source of cells to validate the CyTOF panel. Human tonsils from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) were dissected into small pieces and pressed through a 40 μm strainer (Fisher). The resulting HLAC cells were cultured at a concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in 96-well U-bottom polystyrene plates (VWR) in Complete Media (CM) (consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% FBS, 100 μg/mL gentamicin [Gibco], 200 μg/mL ampicillin [Sigma-Aldrich], 1 mM sodium pyruvate [Sigma-Aldrich], 1% non-essential amino acids [Mediatech], 1% Glutamax [ThermoFisher], and 1% Fungizone [Invitrogen]) for 3 days in the absence or presence of 100–200 ng/mL p24<sup>Gag</sup> of F4.HSA.

CD4+ T cells were then purified by negative selection using the EasySep Human CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies), and then further enriched for memory cells by negative selection with CD45RA MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) to remove naïve cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Isolation and preparation of lymph node cells</title><p>Lymph node specimens were obtained by FNA biopsies of 1–2 lymph nodes in the inguinal chain area. For sampling, 3cc slip tip syringes and either 23- or 22-gauge needles, 1 ½ inch in length, were used. Generally, 4–5 passes per lymph node were performed. A portion of the first pass was taken for fixation in 95% alcohol onto a slide, which was then stained with Toluidine Blue and then examined by microscopy. After confirmation from the cytopathologist that the sample was representative of the target lymph node, the remaining sample in the needle was transferred into RPMI medium (Corning). Due to the small numbers of cells from these specimens, the cells were neither cryopreserved nor enriched for CD4+ T cells and were immediately prepared for PP-SLIDE analysis. A total of two FNAs were drawn from the same participant (PID3010) ~6 months apart.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Isolation and preparation of gut cells</title><p>Processing of sigmoid biopsies into single-cell suspensions was performed similar to approaches recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapecar et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, tissue specimens were first incubated for 20 min at 37°C with rotation in intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) solution (consisting of 200 mL DPBS, 10 mM DTT [Sigma-Aldrich], 5 mM EDTA [Thermofisher], 10 mM HEPES [Thermofisher], and 5% FBS), after which supernatants were saved and tissues subjected to two additional rounds of treatment. Media from these incubations were combined, filtered through a 70 micron filter (Fisher), and the resulting IELs were resuspended in CM. The tissue pieces remaining after the IEL incubations were incubated for 20 min at 37°C with 10 mL rinse buffer (RPMI 1640 with 10 mM HEPES and 5% FBS). Tissue pieces were then placed into a gentleMACS C Tube (Miltenyi Biotec) in 1 mL of digestion solution consisting of 6 mL RPMI-1640, 10 mM HEPES, 5% FBS, 6 mg collagenase (Worthington-Biochemical Corp), and 7.5 μg/mL DNAse (Sigma-Aldrich), and rotated for 30 min at 37°C. About 2 mL of Rinse Buffer was then added for a total of 3 mL. The sample was vortexed for 10 s and the sample processed through the GentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) to isolate cells from the lamina propria. The tissue specimens were then mechanically dissociated for 10 passes using a 5 mL syringe and a blunt, 20G needle (Becton Dickinson). After adding 5 mL Rinse Buffer, the sample was passed through a 70-micron strainer, washed with another 10 mL Rinse Buffer, and passed through a new 70-micron strainer. The flow-through material containing cells was then pelleted and washed once with 5 mL Rinse Buffer. The cells were then treated at 4°C for 30 min with 1 mL of DNAse solution (6 mL RPMI-1640, 10 mM HEPES, 5% FBS, and 7.5 μg/mL DNAse (Sigma-Aldrich)). The cells were then washed once in CM, and then combined with the IELs. Of note, these gentle processing conditions were established and optimized to minimize digestion-induced changes in surface antigen expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapecar et al., 2017</xref>). Due to the small number of cells from these specimens, the cells were neither cryopreserved nor enriched for CD4+ T cells, and were immediately prepared for PP-SLIDE analysis.

Labeling was then stopped by the addition of an equal volume of pre-warmed, 100% FBS, and the labeled cells were incubated at 37°C for an additional 10 min. The sample was then washed three times in RP10. Memory CD4+ T cells not exposed to CFSE were treated identically in parallel. The time = 0 specimen was immediately stained as described below. The remaining cells were cultured with or without activation with 16 nM PMA, 1 μM ionomycin, and 100 IU/mL IL2 (all three reagents from Thermofisher). At the indicated time points, cells were stained with APC/Cyanine7 anti-human CD3 (Clone SK7, Biolegend), PE/Cy7 anti-human CD4 (Clone A161A1, Biolegend), Alexa Fluor 700 anti-human CD8 (Clone SK1, Biolegend), and Zombie Red (Biolegend) as a Live/Dead discriminator. Stained cells were fixed and analyzed by FACS on an LSRII (BD Biosciences). Flowjo (BD Biosciences) was used for analysis.

Next, 2 mL of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 25 μM cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the cells. The cells were quickly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 60 s, after which 10 mL of CyFACS (metal contaminant-free PBS [Rockland] supplemented with 0.1% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide [Sigma-Aldrich]) was added to quench the reaction. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 2% PFA in CyFACS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice in CyFACS, after which they were resuspended in 100 μL of CyFACS containing 10% DMSO.

These cells were diluted to 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and stimulated with 16 nM PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μM ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 hr. This stimulation time was chosen as it is similar to times previously implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2018</xref>) and shorter stimulations under these conditions did not lead to reactivation. Where indicated, cells were instead stimulated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD38 beads (Gibco), or 12 nM PEP005 (Ingenol 3-angelate, Sigma-Aldrich) with 40 nM romidepsin (Sigma-Aldrich). For gut specimens, to minimize cellular toxicity, cells were instead stimulated for 16 hr with 160 nM PMA and 1 μM ionomycin. All stimulations were conducted in the presence of 100 IU/mL IL2 (Thermofisher). To prevent spreading infection, a cocktail of ART consisting of 5 μM AZT, 5 μM Ritonavir, 8 nM Efavirenz, 10 μM Lamivudine, 50 nM Raltegravir, and 0.5 μg/mL T-20 was added. To limit the death of reactivated cells, 10 μM of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (R and D Systems Inc) was added as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grau-Expósito et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>CyTOF staining and data acquisition</title><p>Staining of cells for analysis by CyTOF was conducted similar to recently described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapecar et al., 2017</xref>).

Droplets were quantified using the QX100 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the QuantaSoft software (version 1.6.6, Bio-Rad) in the ‘Rare Event Detection’ quantification mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Full-length individual proviral sequencing assay (FLIPS)</title><p>The FLIPS assay was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiener et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, HIV-1 proviruses within sorted CD4+ T cell subsets were amplified and sequenced at limiting dilution to near full-length (9 kb; 92% of the genome). A median of 140 individual proviruses (range 18–254) was sequenced per sorted population of cells from three of the four participant blood specimens analyzed by PP-SLIDE. The next-generation sequencing was conducted using the Illumina MiSeq platform with individual proviruses de novo assembled using a specifically designed workflow in CLC Genomics. Proviruses were characterized as defective if they contained INDELs, stop codons, or APOBEC3G hypermutations, or intact (full-length) if they lacked such defects. Expanded identical sequences (EIS) were identified using ElimDupes from the Los Alamos database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/elimdupesv2/elimdupes.html">https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/elimdupesv2/elimdupes.html</ext-link>).

For the J-Lat experiments, equal numbers of the unstimulated live, singlet intact 6.3 and 5A8 were concatenated together as a source of the ‘atlas cells’. Reactivated 6.3 cells were identified by gating on the Gag-expressing cells in the stimulated 6.3 sample. For patient samples, events corresponding to live, singlet intact CD3+CD19-CD8- T cells from unstimulated samples were exported as a source of the atlas cells. Events corresponding to reactivated cells were identified by gating upon live, singlet intact CD3+CD19-CD8- T cells expressing Gag on all three Gag channels, and exported as the population of reactivated cells. Where indicated, naïve cells (CD45RA+CD45RO-) were gated out before export. Data export was conducted using FlowJo (BD Biosciences) and Cytobank software. tSNE analyses were performed using the Cytobank software with default settings. All cellular markers not used in the upstream gating strategy were included in generating the tSNE plots. Non-cellular markers (e.g. live/dead stain) and the HIV gag proteins were excluded for the generation of tSNE plots.

Given that some parameters in our panel, such as activation markers, may not be as informative as other antigens in mapping as they markedly change upon stimulation, we undertook a systematic way to assess how the removal of the most changed parameters affects error rates. We first ranked each antigen in terms of to what extent they changed upon stimulation. As expected, the top most changed parameters were mostly activation markers. We then conducted a series of PP-SLIDE analyses where we removed the topmost changed parameter, then the top two most changed parameters, etc. As more parameters were removed, the error rate improved up to when the top six most changed antigens were removed, when the error rate reached a minimum of 0.6%. Thereafter, the error rate increased, likely because power was lost as fewer parameters were left to conduct the mapping. The top six changed parameters were those that exhibited a &gt; 2.5 unit difference in expression levels upon reactivation. These data demonstrate that when PP-SLIDE is implemented on all phenotyping parameters it can map reactivated J-Lat 6.3 back to its correct clone with an error rate of 6.7% and that this can be improved to 0.8% when the most highly changed parameters were excluded in the analyses. Because these J-Lat PP-SLIDE results suggested that removing the most changed parameters can potentially improve the error rate, for each patient sample we conducted two sets of PP-SLIDE analyses: one using all phenotyping parameters, and one under conditions where we excluded most changed parameters (defined as a &gt;2.5 unit difference in expression levels). The kNN latent cells identified from the two PP-SLIDE analyses exhibited similar features. The results presented correspond to those implementing all phenotyping parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Empirical cumulative distribution analysis</title><p>To assess the intra-individual and inter-individual variability in kNN latent cells and to compare kNN latent cells reactivated following treatment with PMA/ionomycin, anti-CD3/CD28, and Romidepsin/PEP005, empirical cumulative distributions were calculated. The distributions of median distances in 32-dimensional space (corresponding to measured protein levels of antigens not used in the upstream gating strategy) corresponded to those between cells of the indicated pairs of samples. The median (Euclidean) distance over all cells in the first sample was computed for each cell in the second sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors. Then, similarly, the median (Euclidean) distance over all cells in the second sample was computed for each cell in the first sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors. The union of these two sets of median distances was used to determine the distribution of median distances between the sample pair. These resulting datasets were visualized in terms of a cumulative distribution function using the stat_ecdf function of the ggplot2 package in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Distribution analysis of FlowSOM clusters</title><p>This section describes in detail how FlowSOM was implemented to cluster the atlas and kNN latent cells, and how this information was used to demonstrate non-random distribution of kNN latent cells among memory CD4+ T cells.

To characterize the latent cells, memory CD4+ T cells from the same leukapheresis were stimulated for 40 hr with PMA/ionomycin, and reactivated cells were identified based on intracellular expression of HIV-1 gag proteins. A total of 20 such reactivated cells were identified from this sample. PP-SLIDE was implemented to identify the corresponding 20 kNN latent cells from the atlas. The 20 kNN latent cells were then assigned to the appropriate cluster of the atlas.

trace latently HIV-infected cells. The results suggest that contrary to common assumptions, the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets, and is conserved between individuals. This work addresses an important area of research as the identification and characterization of the latent HIV reservoir is critical to efforts to develop curative strategies. The techniques described provide a tool for identifying the latently-infected CD4+ T cell subsets and suggests potential applications in the design of therapeutic strategies to precisely study and target latently-infected cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Atlas of the in vivo HIV CD4 T Cell Reservoir&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Catherine Blish (Reviewer #1); Sara Gianella (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This well-written manuscript describes results from combining single-cell phenotyping with PP-SLIDE analysis to map HIV latently-infected CD4+ T cells that are activated ex vivo to their original status in the blood, lymph nodes and gut of the patients who have been taking ART. This work addresses an important area of research as the identification and characterization of the latent HIV reservoir is critical to efforts to develop curative strategies. The techniques described provide a tool for identifying the latently-infected CD4+ T cell subsets and suggests potential applications in the design of therapeutic strategies to precisely study and target latently-infected cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) The term Atlas is too strong given the small numbers studied and should be changed to something less 'global'.</p><p>Additionally, there are three major issues:</p><p>1) One is that the sample sizes are too small to draw the broad conclusions you have made both between individuals and within an individual. Ideally, a larger sample size would make this story stronger. However, the reviewers did appreciate the novelty of even this more limited study and therefore if it is not possible to test more samples, require that you really tone down the conclusions to reflect the sparse sampling. For this to be an &quot;atlas&quot; they expected that a deeper phenotyping such as that proposed with the single-cell RNA-sequencing, and a greater number of patients with a broader range of LRAs tested. So, a less global word should be used in the title.</p><p>2) Related to the first point, concerns were also raised about the claims of similarity based on Euclidean distance, which simply cannot be supported by the data, as well as the claims of repertoire stability when each comparison was only 1 pair. The reviewer noted that in Figure 4E, it's hard to say, as it is very difficult to tell the difference between the colors for the gut vs. FNA. In fact, it looks like they are forming distinct clusters, but that a single different cell in the FNA is driving the overlap between the Gut and FNA samples. If I'm interpreting it correctly, 6 FNA cells make a distinct cluster at the bottom with only 1 at the top. However, the Euclidean distance would average that out, calling into question the validity of the finding that the median and mean Euclidean distances, as one distinct cell seems to be driving the entire overlap. The conclusions may therefore need to be tempered or additional samples added to resolve this.</p><p>3) There were concerns on the staining and time of incubation. They require you to show the gag staining and the degree of enrichment using your combination of markers. For the staining, you should show the p24 staining used in the Cytof to classify the reactivated cells for the 4 donors. For the memory markers, CD27 and CCR7 should be bimodal, thus, it is important to explain how you classify the different memory subset CM, TM and EM and get distributions that are very different to what is commonly observed in people. You should also address the way you selected the disenriched population to compare to their enriched population as some of them like naive cells (CD62L+ CD27+) have low proviral content or are at extremely low frequency compared to the enriched population therefore having less proviruses as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60933.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) The term Atlas is too strong given the small numbers studied and should be changed to something less 'global'.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the title to not use the term “atlas,” and have removed “atlas” from the list of key words. The only remaining use of the term “atlas” is when we refer to the total population of unstimulated memory CD4+ T cells from each patient sample, and we have defined this use of the word in this context. As this use of the term “atlas” is now technical, simply to have a one-word phrase that is easy to refer to (instead of repeatedly stating “unstimulated memory CD4+ T cells from the same subject” which is unnecessarily wordy), we believe it appropriate to use the term in this context. Of note, the paper no longer states our having established an “atlas” of the HIV reservoir.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, there are three major issues:</p><p>1) One is that the sample sizes are too small to draw the broad conclusions you have made both between individuals and within an individual.

That being said, we would like to point out that the findings we reported in the 4 blood donors analyzed by PP-SLIDE were validated in four out of four new and completely untested donors (Figure 6F, previously named Figure 5F), demonstrating that the broad conclusions we had made from the original (limited number of) 4 donors can be generalizable. Although it is possible that if we test yet another four donors we may see some outliers (something that is not possible to perform as recruiting additional HIV-infected participants for this study are on hold due to COVID-19), we think our validation studies allow us to be somewhat confident in our conclusions. Furthermore, as noted above, we have now removed any use of the term “atlas” when referring to our characterization of the HIV reservoir.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the first point, concerns were also raised about the claims of similarity based on Euclidean distance, which simply cannot be supported by the data, as well as the claims of repertoire stability when each comparison was only 1 pair.

The conclusions may therefore need to be tempered or additional samples added to resolve this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the similar colors between the FNA and gut, we had thought to use two shades of blue to have tissue specimens all be colored blue. We have now changed the figure such that the FNA and gut specimens are completely different colors.</p><p>With regards to the validity of Euclidean distance measurement calculations, we would like to point out that we did not average any of the Euclidean distances. In the example the reviewer gave, he/she commented that one single outlier cell could have driven an inaccurate conclusion of overall similarity between two populations. In fact, we had used median (not mean) measurements to make sure that such outliers would not skew our data. In addition to showing the density plots, we also showed the data as empirical cumulative distribution curves, where the y-axis value corresponds to the proportion of the median distances that are less than the corresponding value indicated on the x-axis. These plots are the most quantitative and rigorous way of demonstrating the relative similarities of populations that are being compared.</p><p>The reviewer had specifically commented that a single cell in the FNA sample may have biased our results, as it appeared far away from another 6 cells in the tSNE plot. We would first like to point out that there were in fact a total of 49 FNA cells shown in the tSNE plot (not readily apparent because some cells were stacked on top of one another, but in fact they consist of the sum of the FNA kNN latent cells shown in Figure 4C), and that the “single” cell that the reviewer referred to is actually two cells stacked on top of one other. More importantly, tSNE is simply a visualization tool, and should not be used to draw conclusions about how similar populations are to one another. Furthermore, it is a visualization tool that is good at depicting local population relationships, but does not accurately depict long-distance relationships. To draw quantitative and statistically-sound conclusions about how similar or different populations to one another, other computational tools not dependent on tSNE, such as the Euclidean distance calculations we had implemented, are required.</p><p>To prove our point that the 2 FNA cells towards the top of the tSNE are not artificially driving our conclusions as the reviewer suggested, we, as an exercise, removed those two cells from the datasets:</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60933-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We then repeated the Euclidean distance calculation analysis with the remaining 47 cells FNA cells, and the original numbers of blood and gut cells. Even when the two FNA cells at the top of the tSNE are removed, it was clear that the FNA specimens are more similar to the gut than to the blood specimens (see Figure 4E).We therefore strongly believe our Euclidean distance calculation algorithm is a valid method for quantifying similarities/differences between populations and that the original conclusions we had drawn are sound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There were concerns on the staining and time of incubation.

The p24 staining (using two different anti-p24 antibodies) that was used in the CyTOF to classify reactivated cells for the 4 donors was shown Figure 2B (Of note, we referred to p24 as “Gag” since technically speaking, intracellular Gag is p55, not p24).</p><p>In addition to showing the staining, we have also indicated, for each donor, the numbers of reactivated cells identified by this staining p24.</p><p>In the original Figure 5—figure supplement 1 (now Figure 5, since a reviewer suggested to convert this original supplemental figure to a main one), we had shown the fold-enhancement of kNN latent cells in the final enriched population relative to each of the disenriched ones. This was calculated by dividing the frequency of kNN latent cells in the enriched population by the frequency of kNN latent cells in each of the disenriched populations. We now show within this figure the original frequency of kNN latent cells for each of the enriched populations, as requested. We have also added the kNN frequency information to the original Figure 5—figure supplement 5 (now renamed Figure 6—figure supplement 5), where shared features between kNN latent cells of different donors were used to design a universal sort panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the memory markers, CD27 and CCR7 should be bimodal, thus, it is important to explain how you classify the different memory subset CM, TM and EM and get distributions that are very different to what is commonly observed in people.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added to Figure 3—figure supplement 1 our strategy for identification of the Tcm, Ttm, and Ttm populations based on expression levels of CD27 and CCR7.</p><p>Of note, while CD27 staining on T cells is typically bi-modal, CCR7 is not. This is true not only in CyTOF data (this study, Ma et al. eLIFE, 2020, Neidleman et al. Cell Reports Medicine 2020, Cavrois et al. Cell Reports, 2017), but also in FACS data. As an example of such FACS data, we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> a figure from a paper (Soriano-Sarabia et al., 2014) that used flow cytometry to sort CD4+ Tcm and Ttm from ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals to demonstrate that the replication-competent reservoir is more enriched in Tcm than Ttm. Similar to what we have seen by CyTOF, CCR7 (here on the y-axis) stains as one continuous smear.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60933-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We also note that the frequencies of Tcm, Ttm, and Tem that we report, with Tcm being the most abundant and Ttm the least, are similar to those reported by this prior and other studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You should also address the way you selected the disenriched population to compare to their enriched population as some of them like naive cells (CD62L+ CD27+) have low proviral content or are at extremely low frequency compared to the enriched population therefore having less proviruses as well.</p></disp-quote><p>It is precisely because naïve cells from blood have low proviral content that we did not want to include them within the comparison group. In fact, we feel that one rather concerning aspect is that many published studies in the field reporting surface markers preferentially expressed on HIV reservoir cells are simply markers that are preferentially expressed on memory cells and not naïve cells. If a marker X is preferentially expressed on memory cells and not naïve cells, then sorting CD4+ T cells expressing marker X will enrich for the reservoir simply by enriching for memory cells. For this reason, we also believe it is very important to compare any potential “enriched” population of cells to a memory T cell population, not to total T cells.</p><p>Importantly, <italic>none</italic> of our disenriched populations had any naïve cells; that in our view would not be a fair comparison. In fact, we went to great lengths to choose populations of “disenriched” cells that – prior to our study – the field would believe to be very much enriched for the reservoir. All of our disenriched populations were memory CD4+ T cells expressing PD1. We chose to focus on PD1 because it is a surface protein that is well-accepted to be more highly expressed in HIV reservoir cells, and was demonstrated to enrich for replication-competent HIV (unlike other surface proteins which were only shown to enrich for total HIV DNA, a concern as most of the in vivo reservoir consists of defective proviruses). In essence, we had set a high bar for comparing our enriched populations to PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cells, but did so because we wanted to prove that PP-SLIDE is a robust platform that enables us to enrich already-enriched populations of cells. This proved to be the case as in all 8 donors in which we conducted viral outgrowth assays, our enriched populations harbored more replication-competent HIV than the corresponding PD1+ disenriched populations. With regards to how the markers other than PD1 were chosen in the disenriched populations, this was through a combination of manually assessing each surface markers’ expression levels on the kNN cells, the numbers of cryopreserved cells available from the participant, and the overall abundance of the populations of cells in each sequential gate, as stated in the subsection “Markers of kNN latent cells enrich for the replication-competent, genome-intact reservoir”.</p><p>These important aspects describing the rationale for comparing our enriched populations to disenriched populations of PD1+ memory cells are discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
