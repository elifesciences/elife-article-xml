We exploited proximity-dependent labeling to define the in vivo interactions of cohesin domains with DNA or with other cohesin domains that lie within the same or in different cohesin complexes. Our results suggest that both cohesin's head and hinge domains are proximal to DNA, and cohesin structure is dynamic with differential folding of its coiled coil regions to generate butterfly confirmations. This method also reveals that cohesins form ordered clusters on and off DNA. The levels of cohesin clusters and their distribution on chromosomes are cell cycle-regulated. Cohesin clustering is likely necessary for cohesion maintenance because clustering and maintenance uniquely require the same subset of cohesin domains and the auxiliary cohesin factor Pds5p. These conclusions provide important new mechanistic and biological insights into the architecture of the cohesin complex, cohesin–cohesin interactions, and cohesin's tethering and loop-extruding activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>SMC3</kwd><kwd>proximity biotinylation</kwd><kwd>AviTag</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Siheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35 GM-118189-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koshland</surname><given-names>Douglas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cohesin adopts a flexible butterfly conformation in vivo and forms spatial and temporal regulated ordered clusters to maintain cohesion and condensation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome segregation, DNA damage repair, and the regulation of gene expression require the tethering or folding of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Remarkably, these different types of chromosome organizations are all mediated by a conserved family of protein complexes called structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Onn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nolivos and Sherratt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassler et al., 2018</xref>). SMC complexes tether and fold chromosomes by two activities. First, they can tether together two regions of DNA, either within a single chromosome or between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Second, by combining this tethering activity with their ability to translocate along DNA, SMC complexes can also extrude DNA loops (loop extrusion) in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The molecular mechanisms for these activities and their regulation are still being elucidated.</p><p>SMC complexes have a conserved architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At their core, all SMC complexes have a dimer of two evolutionarily related proteins, which are called Smc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strunnikov et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strunnikov et al., 1995</xref>). Each Smc subunit has two globular domains, a head domain and a hinge domain, separated by a long 50-nm coiled coil. Smc subunits dimerize by two distinct interactions, one between the two heads and another between the two hinges. The separation of head and hinge dimers by their intervening long coiled coils allows the Smc dimers to achieve multiple conformations in vitro, including rings, rods, or butterflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The butterfly conformations result from bending of the coiled coils of the SMC subunits bringing the hinge and head domains in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2019</xref>). The Smc subunits also act as scaffolds to bind non-Smc proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of different complex architectures in vitro raises many questions. Which, if any, of these different conformations exist in vivo? How do any of these conformations contribute to different SMC functions? Are there other structural features of SMC complexes, like clustering (dimers or multimers)? If clusters exist, what is their function, and what factors control their formation?</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Smc3p reporters for proximity biotinylation experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoons showing the proposed ring, rod, or butterfly conformation of budding yeast cohesin.

Cohesion establishment requires two steps. First, the Scc2p/Scc4p complex loads cohesin on one sister chromatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>). Then cohesin is acetylated by Eco1p, which promotes tethering of the second sister chromatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tóth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Skibbens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Çamdere et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Proper chromosome segregation also requires that cohesion be maintained from S phase to M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>). Cohesin acetylation helps to maintain cohesion by preventing cohesin from being removed by Wpl1p from chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopez-Serra et al., 2013</xref>). Cohesion maintenance is also promoted by the cohesin binding protein called Pds5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noble et al., 2006</xref>). Pds5p facilitates efficient Eco1p-dependent acetylation of cohesin, thereby inhibits Wpl1p-dependent cohesin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Pds5p maintains cohesion by a second unknown mechanism that is independent of Wpl1p inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The complex activities and regulation of cohesin likely depend on the presence and modulation of one or more of its conformations. The ring, rod, and butterfly conformations of cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) have been interrogated both in vitro and in vivo. Cohesin rings have been observed by electron microscopy (EM) and liquid atomic force microscopy (AFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>). Rings have also been inferred to exist in vivo from experiments showing cohesin’s ability to topologically entrap DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haering et al., 2008</xref>). Rods have been seen by EM and inferred to exist in vivo from cross-linking experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soh et al., 2015</xref>); however, rods were not observed in liquid AFM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>). A butterfly conformation forms in vitro by bending of the cohesin coiled coil at the elbow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2019</xref>). While the butterfly structure is extremely rare in negatively stained electron microscopies, it was more prevalent in liquid AFM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>). The existence of a butterfly structure in vitro is also supported by the detection of interactions between purified Scc3p and the hinge in recent cryo-EM images of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>). In vivo, the existence of this structure has been inferred from imaging and functional interactions of the hinge and the head-bound Pds5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mc Intyre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eng et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, evidence for multiple cohesin conformations exists both in vitro and in vivo, but their physiological significance and relative abundances in vivo are unclear.</p><p>Like cohesin conformation, cohesin–cohesin interactions have also been investigated in vitro and in vivo. In two recent single molecular studies, the photobleaching of fluorescently tagged cohesin came to different conclusions about whether cohesin bound to DNA as monomers or dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). In vivo, the presence of dimers in cells was tested by co-immunoprecipitation. Other studies also disagree about the presence of dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haering et al., 2002</xref>). More recent in vivo studies revealed the functional complementation between distinct cohesin complexes that are individually defective on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>). This complementation could be best explained by the clustering of cohesins. These discrepancies make physiological significance and the relative abundance of cohesin clusters unclear. To begin to answer these many unanswered questions about cohesin clustering and architecture, we interrogated cohesin with the method of proximity-dependent biotinylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández-Suárez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jan et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developing a proximity biotinylation method to assess cohesin structure and clustering in vivo</title><p>Proximity biotinylation is a method that exploits the ability of the bacterial enzyme, BirA, to recognize a 15 amino acid AviTag and add a biotin moiety to a lysine residue within the AviTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández-Suárez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). In vivo, biotinylation of the AviTag is enhanced when the AviTag and BirA are fused to two interacting partners that place the BirA and AviTag in proximity. Importantly, the BirA and AviTag partners must be in very close proximity to generate AviTag biotinylation because this biotinylation only occurs when the AviTag binds to the active site of BirA.</p><p>Given that cohesin is a large complex, the levels of biotinylation of the AviTags inserted into different domains of cohesin should reflect their relative proximity to a BirA partner. We inserted AviTags (marked with an HA epitope) at each of the four positions in Smc3p of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> These AviTag reporters were positioned in the head domain (head reporter, in the flexible loop after residue A1089), within the coiled coil proximal to the head (CC reporter, in the joint after residue V966), at the elbow-proximal coiled coil (elbow reporter, after residue F864), and in the hinge domain (hinge reporter, after residue P533) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> for tag insertion sites in the elbow folded structure suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2019</xref>). We also generated three BirA partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) by inserting the BirA enzyme (marked with V5) in the Smc3p head domain (after Smc3p residue A1089), in the Smc3p hinge domain (after Smc3p residue P533), and at the C-terminus of the HUα DNA binding protein from bacteria. The biotinylation of an AviTag by a BirA partner inserted in the same molecule is defined as <italic>cis</italic>-biotinylation. The biotinylation of an AviTag by a BirA partner inserted in another molecule is defined as <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation.</p><p>Using these reagents, we developed an assay for BirA-based proximity-dependent biotinylation of Smc3p reporters in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Strains were constructed harboring different AviTag and BirA partners. Cultures of these strains were grown in media lacking biotin and then subjected to a short pulse of biotin to initiate biotinylation. The biotinylation was terminated by adding TCA. The purpose of this short pulse of biotin was dual. It allowed us to limit biotinylation to specific times in the cell cycle to test temporal regulation of the interactions between our reporters and a BirA-tagged partner. The biotin pulse also suppressed proximity-independent biotinylation of the reporters that occurs with extensive incubation with biotin. After the biotin pulse, protein extracts were prepared, and the biotinylated and non-biotinylated Smc3p-AviTag was detected by western blotting using the HA epitope. The biotinylated Smc3p-AviTag was present as a slower mobility species due to its binding to the streptavidin present in the protein sample buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>We first validated the gel shift as a measure of biotinylation of the AviTag by BirA in vivo. We examined the requirements for Smc3p-AviTag gel shift with one of our Smc3-AviTag reporters and a freely diffusible nucleoplasmic BirA. No biotinylation of the Smc3p-AviTag reporter was observed before the biotin pulse, in cells lacking BirA, or in cells expressing a reporter in which the critical AviTag lysine was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We observed a gel shift of the Smc3p-AviTag reporter only upon the simultaneous presence of the AviTag, BirA, and biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We conclude that the observed gel shift indeed reflected the biotinylation of the AviTag by BirA in vivo.</p><p>We performed three additional control experiments to ensure that we could properly interpret differences in biotinylation of the AviTag reporters. First, we showed that all the Smc3p-AviTag reporters and Smc3p-BirA were functional in vivo. Strains bearing any of these <italic>SMC3-AviTag or SMC3-BirA</italic> genes as the sole source grew at similar rates as the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that all four Smc3p-AviTag reporters are biotinylated to the same extent by freely diffusible nucleoplasmic BirA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This result established that any differences in their levels of biotinylation by a BirA partner reflected differences in the association with that partner rather than the inherent limitations of the reporters. We also showed that our western blot-based assay was quantitative because the Western signal of the Smc3p-AviTag reporter showed a linear response to serial dilutions of Smc3-AviTag protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

G1 cells in budding yeast assemble the Smc3p-Smc1p heterodimers rather than the full cohesin complex because Mcd1p is not expressed, and Scc3p cannot bind to the heterodimer without Mcd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haering et al., 2002</xref>). The heterodimers lie in the nucleoplasm because they are unable to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>). We observed that BirA in the Smc3p hinge domain robustly biotinylated (65–90%) AviTags in the elbow-proximal coiled coil, the head-proximal coiled coil, and the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The biotinylation of the AviTags likely occurred by interactions with the BirA partner in cis because of their close proximity.</p><p>However, some AviTag biotinylation in these strains could result from <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation (binding and biotinylation of the AviTag on one Smc3p by BirA on another Smc3p) as well as <italic>cis</italic>-biotinylation. To assess the potential contribution of <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation in G1, we constructed a strain with two copies of <italic>SMC3</italic>, one with the BirA in the head domain and the other with the AviTag in the hinge. The biotinylation of hinge Smc3p in G1 was reduced 87% compared to when BirA and AviTag were in the head and hinge of the same Smc3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We conclude that the majority of the biotinylation that we observe for Smc3p in the Smc3p-Smc1p heterodimers reflects the interaction of the partner domains in cis. We present additional data supporting the biotinytlation of doubletagged Smc3p occurs in cis for the fully assembled cohesin complex (see section entitled &quot;Pds5p is required for cohesin clustering on and off chromosomes&quot;).</p><p>The promiscuous <italic>cis</italic>-biotinylation pattern of the three AviTags by the hinge BirA strongly suggests that the heterodimer is structurally dynamic, transitioning between multiple conformations in vivo. If the heterodimer folded into a single rigid conformation (ring, rod, or butterfly), only one or no AviTag site would be close enough to bind to the BirA active site and be biotinylated. We suggest that the coiled coil between the hinge and elbow is flexible, allowing the hinge domain to bind to the elbow-proximal coiled coil, coiled coil, or head domains, reflecting multiple distinct butterfly conformations.</p><p>To test the robustness of this conclusion, we examined the interactions of the AviTag reporters with a BirA partner in the head. The head BirA robustly biotinylated head-proximal coiled coil and the hinge AviTags. The ability of the head BirA to biotinylate these two AviTags also is consistent with a folded but structurally dynamic heterodimer.</p><p>However, the head BirA, unlike the hinge BirA, poorly biotinylated the elbow reporter. Its biotinylation (12%) was 80–90% lower compared to the other AviTag reporters. This suppression of biotinylation could not be explained by the elbow reporter being generally inaccessible to BirA. The elbow reporter could be <italic>cis</italic>-biotinylated by the hinge BirA or <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylated by freely diffusible BirA to the same high level as the other AviTag reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We conclude that the head BirA, unlike the hinge BirA, must be constrained to prevent its interaction with the elbow reporter. We suggest that the coiled coil between the head and elbow is stiffer than the coiled coil between the hinge and elbow, thereby limiting the ability of the head domain to interact with the elbow.</p><p>We wondered whether the intramolecular interactions of Smc3p domains were altered by the assembly of the full cohesin complex or cohesin binding to DNA. Therefore, we examined the biotinylation pattern for Smc3p reporters in this same set of strains in mid-M (nocodazole arrested) where the cohesin was assembled and bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The biotinylation patterns were indistinguishable for the Smc3p in the fully assembled cohesin complex in mid-M and the Smc3p-Smc1p heterodimers in G1.

BirA can only biotinylate an AviTag when the enzyme touches its substrate directly. Therefore, preferential biotinylation of an Smc3p reporter would occur in cohesin clusters when the AviTag-tagged domain was close to the head domain BirA in the second Smc3p (Smc3p-BirA).

The cells were arrested in S phase (hydroxyurea), pulsed with biotin, then fixed and processed for ChIP using streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We detected biotinylated Smc3p reporter at centromeres (e.g., <italic>CEN3</italic>), at pericentric regions, and at arm CARs using qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These ChIP signals were specific to reporter biotinylation as they were absent or dramatically reduced in cells lacking BirA, that is, expressing only Smc3p-AviTag without Smc3p-BirA. We repeated these experiments using a strain bearing the same Smc3p-AviTag reporter but overexpressing the free nuclear BirA (NLS-BirA) that we showed maximally biotinylated all the Smc3p-AviTag reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The ChIP signals of biotinylated Smc3p head reporter by the NLS-BirA and that by Smc3p-BirA were similar at all CARs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This similarity indicates that cohesin molecules at all CARs tested are clustering in S phase.</p><p>We wondered whether the distribution of chromosome-bound cohesin clusters might change through the cell cycle, given the cell cycle-regulated changes in cluster abundance. We assayed for the presence of cohesin clusters in the mid-M phase (nocodazole) arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As in S phase arrested cells, Smc3p-BirA-mediated <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation of the Smc3p-AviTag reporter was robust at both <italic>CEN</italic> and pericentric regions. However, the <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation signal was greatly reduced at some arm CARs but still above the signal in the negative control of cells lacking cells without BirA. At other CARs, this signal was eliminated. The loss of ChIP signals was not due to loss of binding between the Smc3p-AviTag or Smc3p-BirA and CARs. First, the levels of biotinylated Smc3p-AviTag reporter by the free nuclear BirA at CARs was very similar in S phase and mid-M arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>), consistent with the robust binding of cohesin to CARs in HU and mid-M arrested cells reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blat and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). Second, the CARs continued to bind both Smc3p-AviTag and Smc3p-BirA in mid-M as evidenced by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that cohesin clusters at arm CARs are downregulated in mid-M by mechanisms other than dissociating cohesin from chromosomes.</p><p>To test whether the biotinylation levels of these representative loci were reflective of the genome, we analyzed the mid-M sample by ChIP-seq. All peaks of cohesin clusters correlate with previously identified regions of cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As predicted from the qPCR results, we observed robust <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation signal by Smc3p-BirA at the centromeres and pericentric regions and much weaker signal or no signal at arm CARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). In contrast, the biotinylation signal was robust at all CARs in cells with the free nuclear BirA. In summary, the qPCR and ChIP-seq results suggest that the majority of cohesins bound to chromosomes are clustering in S phase. In mid-M arrested cells, the presence of clusters remains high at the centromeres and pericentric regions but is reduced on chromosome arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Only fully assembled cohesins cluster</title><p>We reasoned that the cell cycle control of cohesin assembly might contribute to cohesin clustering.

The levels of biotinylation are slightly lower, but the pattern of biotinylation was the same in the presence of clustering (presence of Pds5p, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or absence of clustering (Pds5p depleted, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

These results revealed that three domains of cohesin, the Mcd1p linker, Mcd1p ROCC, and Smc3p hinge, are important for cohesin clustering.

Cohesin with mcd1p-V137K binds to chromosomes but fails to bind Pds5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eng et al., 2014</xref>). Failure of the <italic>mcd1-V137K</italic> mutated cohesin in clustering suggests that Pds5p must be recruited to chromosome-bound cohesin to promote cohesin clustering and cohesion maintenance. In contrast, chromosome-bound cohesin molecules with mcd1p-Q266 or smc3p-D667 bind Pds5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robison et al., 2018</xref>), which suggests that recruitment of Pds5p to cohesin is not sufficient for cohesin clustering and cohesion maintenance. Taken together, these results are consistent with a mechanism where Pds5p is first recruited to cohesin by Mcd1p linker, and then the Mcd1p ROCC region, together with Smc3p hinge domain, promotes cohesin clustering and cohesion maintenance. Finally, cohesin molecules with either version of mutated mcd1p subunit are acetylated to the same level as wild-type cohesin and bind to chromosomes as stably as wild-type cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the mechanism for cohesin clustering and cohesion maintenance is likely independent of any additional functions of these domains in promoting cohesin acetylation and stable binding of cohesin to chromosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we use proximity labeling between cohesin domains to probe the in vivo architecture of cohesin, both on and off DNA. Importantly, labeling only occurs when the two interacting domains are close enough to bring the AviTag to the BirA active site. The proximity labeling of AviTags on the elbow, coiled coil, or the head by BirA on the hinge strongly supports the bending of the coiled coil into a butterfly conformation in vivo, as inferred previously from FRET, genetic experiments, and a recent cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mc Intyre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). However, the existence of only one single butterfly conformation in vivo would not accommodate BirA labeling of multiple AviTags in various positions because of the proximity constraints for labeling by our method. Therefore, we suggest that the labeling of multiple AviTags reflects the formation of additional butterfly conformations. These multiple conformations may reflect the inherent flexibility of cohesin molecules as their coil coils bend to form the structure shown in EM or additional important intermediates in loop extrusion and/or tethering. The formation of multiple distinct butterfly conformations is likely a generic property of SMC complexes as rapid transitions between the ring and multiple butterfly conformations have been observed in recent time-lapse AFM imaging of condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We also show that BirA partner on DNA could label the head and hinge domains of cohesin, but not the coiled coil. This result is consistent with independent DNA binding activities located in the head and hinge domains of cohesin. The existence of two independent DNA binding sites in cohesin in vivo has been predicted from mutants that uncouple cohesion from stable DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). Super-resolution imaging of cohesin on worm meiotic chromosomes has also suggested the proximity of the head and the hinge domains to the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Köhler et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the existence of at least two independent DNA binding activities within cohesin was also inferred from genetic experiments and the observation of cohesin’s loop extrusion activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). The restriction of DNA binding to the head and hinge domains is likely an intrinsic feature of SMC complexes since AFM images of condensin have shown that DNA is localized to the head and hinge of condensin but not the coiled coil.</p><p>The existence of butterfly conformations and DNA binding to both the hinge and head domains has been used to propose a scrunching mechanism for loop extrusion by SMC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). These structural features of cohesin could also explain how scrunching could be converted to the DNA tethering that is necessary for cohesion. We previously suggested that cohesin could be converted from extruding DNA to tethering DNA by blocking the release of Adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) from cohesin, thereby trapping an intermediate state in the loop extrusion cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Çamdere et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we speculate that the hinge and head of extended cohesin each could bind a different sister chromatid at or near the DNA replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The subsequent formation of the butterfly conformation, cohesin acetylation, and, possibly, association with other factors prevents ADP release that is needed to dissolve the butterfly. Trapping of this intermediate prevents additional cycles of scrunching that would release the sister DNA molecule, and as a result, generates a stable tether between sister chromatids.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of cohesin cluster regulation during cell cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing the initial steps of asymmetric loop extrusion by cohesin. Mcd1p, Scc3p, and Pds5p are omitted from the cartoon for clarity. Cohesin monomer binds DNA with both the head and hinge domains (cohesin complex in extended conformation may adopt rod or open ring structures), then the coiled coil domain bends to form the butterfly conformation and extrude a DNA loop. In subsequent steps (not shown here), DNA is transferred from the hinge to a second DNA binding site on the head. The hinge binds a new region of DNA and repeats the cycle, increasing the size of the loop. Cohesin dimmers can extrude DNA symmetrically. This model has been proposed for the condensin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>). Mcd1p and Scc3p are omitted from the model for simplicity. (<bold>B</bold>) Cartoon showing sister chromatid cohesion by cohesin. Cohesin binds sisters with its head and hinge domains, respectively, and tethers sister chromatids. This tethering state proceeds to the butterfly conformation where it is trapped. Clustering of cohesins in the butterfly conformation stabilizes tethering between sisters and maintains cohesion. (<bold>C</bold>) Cartoon showing regulation of cohesin clusters during cell cycle. Cohesin complexes form clusters at all previously identified binding sites at early S phase, including centromeres, pericentric cohesin-associated regions (CARs), and arm CAR sites. Most of the clusters at chromosome arms dissolve in mid-M phase. A small fraction of cohesin complexes remain in the clustering state and keep sister chromatids tethered. Pds5 protein participates in the stabilization of cohesin clusters through S phase into mid-M.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62243-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our biotin-based proximity labeling experiments also revealed that cohesins form ordered clusters in vivo, both off and on DNA. This conclusion is based upon two observations. First, the detection of robust <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation between cohesin complexes on and off DNA. Second, the pattern of <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation for different AviTag reporters is more restricted than the patterns of biotinylation by freely diffusible BirA or <italic>cis</italic>-biotinylation within cohesin. Importantly, the restricted <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylation between cohesin, on and off DNA, could not be inferred from a model in which cohesin clustering is mediated by disordered aggregation or DNA-dependent phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryu et al., 2020</xref>). Rather, it fits with the model that cohesin molecules in butterfly conformation form oligomers (dimers or multimers), with the head domain of one cohesin molecule near the head and hinge domains of the other cohesin molecules of the same oligomer.</p><p>The existence of ordered clusters of butterfly cohesins on chromosomes in vivo fits several published observations. Cohesin–cohesin interactions on chromosomes in vivo were inferred from functional cooperation between mutated yeast cohesins in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a superresolution microscopy study of the worm germline reveals that on the meiotic chromosome axis, meiotic cohesin adopts a conformation that exhibits close proximity between their head and hinge domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Köhler et al., 2017</xref>). A second study showed that cohesin clusters (~4) on meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Woglar et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the clustering of cohesin butterflies may be a conserved feature of eukaryotic chromosomes.</p><p>Previously, we suggested two potential roles of cohesin clusters in cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eng et al., 2015</xref>). First, cohesion could be achieved by clustering of two cohesins, each bound to a sister chromatid (handcuff model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In this model, clusters would be required for cohesion establishment and maintenance. Alternatively, a single cohesin could have two DNA binding sites, and therefore be competent to form cohesion. Lateral clustering of individually cohesion-competent cohesin would generate sites of multivalent cohesion. In this second model, clustering would not be obligatory for cohesion establishment. Rather, the multivalent cohesion of the cluster would fortify cohesion by making it persist at a specific locus even when tethering of individual cohesins fails. We prefer the second model since in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that individual cohesins have multiple DNA binding sites (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>), and a single cohesin is competent to generate cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haering et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A role for cohesin clusters in cohesion maintenance is strongly supported by the observation that mutations that specifically fail to maintain cohesin clustering (<italic>pds5-AID</italic>, <italic>mcd1-Q266</italic>, <italic>mcd1-V137K</italic>, and <italic>smc3-D667</italic>) also specifically fail to maintain cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robison et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, Pds5p-dependent cohesion maintenance is independent of Eco1p and Wpl1p as is the maintenance of cohesion clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>). Pds5p may indirectly promote cluster maintenance by modulating a post-translational modification (other than acetylation by Eco1p) that alters cluster formation or dissolution. Alternatively, Pds5p may act directly to stabilize clusters by binding to different regions of two adjacent cohesin complexes within the cluster. The regions of Mcd1p and Smc3p necessary for cohesin clustering could impact Pds5p function or impact cohesin domains that directly mediate clustering.</p><p>The abrogation of cohesin clusters in our mutants also informs on the role of clusters in loop extrusion in budding yeast. We recently showed that cohesin forms positioned loops genome-wide in mid-M. These loops continue to form in cells depleted of Pds5p or expressing mcd1p-Q266 where cohesin clustering is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costantino et al., 2020</xref>). The ability of these mutants to loop extrude but not to cluster suggests that cohesin clusters are not obligatory for loop extrusion in vivo. Cohesin clustering, for example, cohesin dimerization, may modulate its ability to promote symmetric or asymmetric looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our study shows that budding yeast also regulates the level and position of clusters on chromosomes. The ChIP experiment results with <italic>trans</italic>-biotinylated cohesin suggest that clusters occur in S phase at all previously identified sites of cohesin binding (centromeres, pericentromeric regions, and the many CARs along chromosome arms). In mid-M, clusters are specifically reduced at arm CARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). This reduction in arm clusters likely leads to a reduction in the robustness of arm cohesion in mid-M, given the correlation between the cohesin clustering and cohesion maintenance (this study). Interestingly, the reduction of arm cohesion also occurs in mammalian prophase by <italic>WAPL</italic>-dependent destabilization of cohesin binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the reduction of arm cohesion is likely a conserved feature of mitosis (albeit by different mechanisms).</p><p>Proper mitotic chromosome segregation requires the establishment and maintenance of tension that results from the bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores and the surrounding cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makrantoni and Marston, 2018</xref>). This cohesion may be strengthened by the cohesin clusters around the centromere, helping the tension to persist after bipolar attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Similarly, bipolar attachment of homologs during meiosis I requires tension that is generated by cohesion distal to the crossover site. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, COH-3/COH-4 cohesins are remodeled prior to anaphase I of meiosis, persisting primarily distal to the crossover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, imaging data suggest that COH-3/COH-4 cohesins form clusters. These clusters may also serve to strengthen cohesion and facilitate the persistence of tension. Thus, the regulation of cluster persistence in the genome may be a conserved feature of eukaryotes that is important for proper sister chromatid and homolog alignment in both meiosis and mitosis. In summary, the analysis of cohesin by proximity labeling in vivo has provided important new mechanistic and biological insights into the architecture of the cohesin complex and the cohesin–cohesin interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">qPCR primers</td><td valign="top">IDT</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-Mcd1</td><td valign="top">V.

Chromatin was then supplemented with an additional 1% SDS and heated at 60°C for 5 min. About 900 μl ice-cold FA-STD was added to the tube to cool down the chromatin. The solution was supplemented with 1 mg/ml of BSA Cohn fraction V (Millipore-Sigma) and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Fisher), then incubated with 60 μl Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 at 4°C overnight.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Adèle L Marston as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript uses proximity-dependent biotinylation to probe cohesin structure in vivo. They report 3 main findings. First, the head and the hinge of the same Smc3 protein are in proximity when Mcd1 is present and functional. Second, individual Smc3 molecules which are not part of the same cohesin complex are close enough for biotinylation, even in the absence of stable DNA binding. Third, Pds5 is required for the proximity of separate Smc3 complexes. This manuscript is clearly presented, reports a very promising technique and makes some interesting observations. However, several observations need additional controls and some conclusions need to be toned down to adjust for the limitations of the presented technique.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 4. The authors find that biotinylated Smc3 is enriched at the pericentromeres and centromeres, but not at arm sites in M phase. One caveat with this experiment is that authors have not shown that the various tagged Smc3 proteins localize normally, only that they are sufficient to support cell viability. If Smc3-BirA itself is preferentially localized at the centromeres, this could explain this result. Since there are Smc3 alleles which affect the ATPase activity of the heads and which accumulate at centromeres, this is a real possibility. The authors should analyse the localization of the different tagged versions of Smc3 by ChIP and compare them.</p><p>2) The authors conclude that cohesin adopts a &quot;butterfly&quot; configuration because they observed increased biotinylation when placing Avitag and BirA in the hinge and head domains of Smc3. A few points are relevant to this interpretation. First, the authors need to explain better what they mean by butterfly conformation. Second, the AviTag in the Smc3 coiled coil is located at the Smc3 joint (close to the head domain). Even in the folded state (butterfly?), the coiled coil-AviTag is closer to the head than the hinge AviTag. The schemes presented in Figure 1C and the manuscript text are somewhat misleading. The conclusions on the architecture of cohesin need to be revised accordingly and a more realistic scheme of cohesin (and of elbow-folded cohesin) with the position of the AviTags would be helpful for the reader. Third, taking this into account, the fact that DNA-BirA efficiently labels hinge and heads (but not the coiled coil) is thus likely owed to steric effects (not necessarily reporting on cohesin architecture including elbow-folding). Fourth, the authors need a negative control in Figure 2 to ensure that simply putting both tags in the same molecule doesn't generate biotinylation. If the assay reports on the butterfly conformation as the authors propose, the prediction would be that placing them in the cc and either the hinge or heads would prevent (or at least significantly reduce) biotinylation. This needs to be tested.</p><p>3) The experimental procedures do not include sufficient detail to understand how exactly the experiments were performed and there are no figure legends for the main figures. In particular it is difficult to understand how biotinylated Smc3 was detected. Was-an anti-Smc3 antibody used that detects all versions of the protein, or is it only the Avitag that is detected, or some other epitope tag? This is particularly important to know for the &quot;<italic>in trans</italic>&quot; experiments were presumably the different versions of Smc3 are detected. In addition, authors need to show molecular weight marks on the western blots.</p><p>4) The term oligomerization is misleading as it implies physical interaction while the biotinylation assay merely measures proximity. The term “clustering” or similar seems more appropriate. This interpretation needs to be revised carefully throughout the manuscript</p><p>5) The authors argue that cohesin-cohesin &quot;oligomerization&quot; (meaning proximity) is a function of cohesion maintenance. However, they observe biotinylation when the BirA and Avitag are on different Smc3 proteins even in G1 cells when Mcd1 is overexpression and where there would be no cohesion. Therefore, the conclusion that cohesin-cohesin proximity is a function of cohesion is not valid and needs to be revised.</p><p>6) The authors demonstrate that oligomers form off DNA but they also argue, using specific mutants defective in these processes, that the roles of cohesin in cohesion/condensation (which must occur on DNA) are necessary for oligomerization. This calls the functional importance of the authors findings into question and the authors need to clarify this point.</p><p>7) The conclusion that Pds5 leads to clustering of cohesin independent of DNA/chromosomes is intriguing. However, given point 6, there is a concern that this observation is a limitation of the assay, rather than reporting on the biology. Ideally this should be substantiated by independent confirmation. Can such clustering off the chromosome be observed by imaging, for example with a split GFP system or similar? Whether this clustering has functional relevance would be another important question, however it is not clear how it can be addressed in the absence of more detailed knowledge about the clustering mechanism. At the very least, the potential short-comings of the assay should be discussed.</p><p>8) The authors use bacterial HU protein to localise BirA on DNA, and suggest that this leads to the general presence of BirA along DNA. The potential drawback is that this enzyme binds with higher affinity to certain DNA structures like junctions and nicks, as well as introducing torsional changes into DNA. These peculiarities of HU could affect and hence interfere with the readout. Have the authors tested BirA is localised to an endogenous chromatin protein?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62243.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 4.

The published cryo-EM structure is one of several possible butterfly conformations. We clarify the nomenclature in the Introduction. We believe our evidence now suggests that cohesin structure is likely dynamic accommodating multiple butterfly conformations consistent with the dynamically folding condensin seen in the recent AFM studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the AviTag in the Smc3 coiled coil is located at the Smc3 joint (close to the head domain).

We now describe the assay better in the Results, figure legend of Figure 1C and D and Materials and methods.</p><p>&quot;After the biotin pulse, protein extracts were prepared, and the biotinylated and non-biotinylated Smc3p-AviTag was detected by Western blot using the HA epitope. The biotinylated Smc3p-AviTag was present as a slower mobility species due to its binding to the streptavidin presented in the protein sample buffer (Figure 1C and D).&quot;</p><p>We did not image the size markers on Western membranes. We do not feel it is necessary to record markers when we are focusing on one protein and the protein (with or without gel shift) generates the only bands on the gel. It is a common practice in the field to leave the marker out (for one of many examples, see Haering et al., 2002). See Figure 1D for the protein markers from our first gel shift experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The term oligomerization is misleading as it implies physical interaction while the biotinylation assay merely measures proximity. The term “clustering” or similar seems more appropriate.

[…] These results are consistent with cohesin clustering in an ordered manner that enables head-head and head-hinge interactions between different cohesin molecules, but disfavors interaction between CC of one cohesin complex and the head of another cohesin.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors argue that cohesin-cohesin &quot;oligomerization&quot; (meaning proximity) is a function of cohesion maintenance.

Therefore, the conclusion that cohesin-cohesin proximity is a function of cohesion is not valid and needs to be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>From comments 5-7, it is clear that the reviewers missed a major point of the manuscript that obviously reflected our poorly written text. This statement is the opposite of what our data suggest and what we intended to convey to the reader. As the reviewer indicated oligomers form independent of cohesion since they form off of DNA, and on unreplicated DNA in S or G1. However, our data strongly suggest that clustering is required to maintain cohesion from S to M. We had suggested this conclusion in the Discussion of the previous version of the manuscript but failed to explain how our results support this conclusion in the Results section. Our logic is the time-tested and central strategy of molecular biology, to look for a correlation between mutations that block a particular molecular phenotype and the appearance of a specific biological phenotype. We show that 4 different mutations that block cohesin clustering block the maintenance of cohesion. We conclude that these results strongly suggest that cohesin clustering is required for cohesion maintenance. We apologize to the reviewers for a poor text that confused them for this central point. We have retitled the last section of the Results and modified the text, to make clear that clustering is required for cohesion maintenance and not cohesion causes clustering.</p><p>&quot;Evidence that the biological function of cohesin clustering is to maintain cohesion and RDN condensation.</p><p>The requirement of Pds5p in the maintenance of cohesin clusters correlated with its unusual biological functions to maintain cohesion genome-wide and condensation of the tandemly repeated rDNA locus. Therefore, we hypothesized that Pds5p-dependent cohesin clustering was necessary for cohesion maintenance and RDN condensation. […] This hypothesis predicts that cohesin mutations that specifically block cohesion maintenance and RDN condensation would likely be defective in cohesin clustering.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors demonstrate that oligomers form off DNA but they also argue, using specific mutants defective in these processes, that the roles of cohesin in cohesion/condensation (which must occur on DNA) are necessary for oligomerization.

The fact that cohesin has activities like ATPase or clustering off of DNA does not make them irrelevant for their function on DNA. Indeed our assay may be detecting cohesin dimers. I think the reviewer would agree that forming dimers off of DNA does not exclude the importance of a dimer on DNA as has been postulated for loop extrusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors use bacterial HU protein to localise BirA on DNA, and suggest that this leads to the general presence of BirA along DNA.
