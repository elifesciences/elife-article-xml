Signal samples from all trials and timepoints within each distance were randomly allocated to one of the 10 folds to be used in the 10-fold cross-validation process. This meant that, on any given iteration of cross-validation, a single sample was never in both the training and the testing set, but samples in the training and testing set could be drawn from different timepoints of the same experimental trial. Autocorrelation in the data over time could therefore have inflated the decoding accuracy. To correct this, we have re-run the analysis decoding <italic>distance to object</italic> ensuring that training and testing sets drew from independent trials, and re-ran all analyses that drew on these decoding results. Analyses that did not decode <italic>distance to object</italic> are not affected, and analyses decoding <italic>distance to object</italic> on error trials are also not affected.</p><p>We replicate our main finding of being able to use neural patterns to predict the occurrence of errors, along with all the effects of attention. The interaction indicating decreased distance decoding for late vs early blocks in monitoring but not active conditions has decreased in strength from being evident (BF &gt;3) at two consecutive time-windows to one (BF = 6.7) and there is no longer a main effect of target frequency.

Thus, the lower connectivity for <italic>miss</italic> vs. <italic>correct</italic> trials could result from (at least) two possible causes: the pair of regions representing two distinct sets of information (i.e., becoming in some sense less connected on misses) or the pair represent similar information that is distorted by higher levels of noise on misses.
