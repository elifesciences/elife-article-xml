Specific environmental signals such as changes in salinity, osmolarity, nutrient availability, phosphate limitation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, iron availability, and presence of polyamines (spermidine and norspermidine), indole or bile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Teschler et al., 2015</xref>) can also affect biofilm formation. Within this complex regulatory network, VpsR and VpsT, whose regulons extensively overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyhan et al., 2007</xref>), are the main transcriptional activators of the <italic>vpsI</italic> and <italic>vpsII</italic> clusters and the <italic>rbmA</italic>, <italic>rbmC</italic>, and <italic>bap1</italic> genes encoding the matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zamorano-Sánchez et al., 2015</xref>). HapR is the main repressor of biofilm formation and inhibits transcription of both the activators and the genes encoding the VPS and the matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waters et al., 2008</xref>). HapR also regulates other processes, such as virulence factor production, type VI secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kovacikova and Skorupski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>), and intracellular c-di-GMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammer and Bassler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waters et al., 2008</xref>), which in turn indirectly affect biofilm formation.

Loss of BipA leads to widespread shifts in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> proteome at low temperatures, including increased production of the main biofilm transcriptional regulators VpsR and VpsT. Our data suggest that temperature could control BipA activity by altering its structural conformation and turnover. Finally, we show that the effects of BipA are only apparent in the absence of HapR, underscoring the intricacies of coordinating transcription and translation in response to temperature and cell density to govern biofilm development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temperature governs colony morphology in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> HapR<sup>−</sup> strains</title><p>Prolonged colony growth in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> can lead to the development of rugose colonies, which are tightly associated with biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yildiz and Schoolnik, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yildiz and Visick, 2009</xref>).

Previous studies have described the existence of a complex interplay of regulatory mechanisms that ultimately result in the transcriptional control of the biofilm genes. Here, complementary genetic and proteomic approaches led us to discover that BipA is critical for temperature-dependent changes in production of biofilm components and altered colony morphology in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> HapR<sup>−</sup> strains. Loss of BipA alters the levels of &gt;300 proteins in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> grown at suboptimal temperature, increasing the relative levels of 250 proteins, including virtually all known biofilm-related proteins in this pathogen. Thus, BipA not only impacts the expression of the biofilm formation program but also likely shapes other aspects of pathogen physiology at low temperatures.</p><p>BipA is a broadly conserved translational GTPase whose precise cellular function has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibbs and Fredrick, 2018</xref>). A growing body of evidence indicates that BipA facilitates 50S subunit biogenesis at suboptimal temperature. <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 cells lacking BipA exhibit cold sensitivity and accumulate immature 50S particles when grown at suboptimal temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choudhury and Flower, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibbs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krishnan and Flower, 2008</xref>). Recent evidence shows that mature free 30S subunits accumulate in the absence of BipA, presumably due to a shortage of available 50S partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibbs et al., 2020</xref>). In line with these <italic>E. coli</italic> studies, our sucrose gradient sedimentation analyses indicate that BipA is important for 50S subunit assembly in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, specifically at low temperatures. In the mutant strain, larger subunit peaks (which include immature particles) are observed, as is a &lt;50S shoulder, characteristics of an assembly defect. Notably, compared to that of <italic>E. coli</italic>, this 50S assembly defect in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is more subtle, which may explain why no obvious growth defect is observed at 22°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Supplementary Figure 2).</p><p>How does loss of BipA cause de-repression of biofilm formation genes at 22°C? One possibility is that the defect in 50S assembly alters the free subunit concentrations in the cell, which has variable consequences on translation depending on the particular mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>). Initiation of translation entails two major steps − formation of the 30S initiation complex and docking of the 50S subunit. An increase in free mature 30S subunits and/or decrease in free mature 50S subunits would be expected to enhance translation of certain mRNAs, reduce translation of other mRNAs, and have no impact on translation of still other mRNAs. We speculate that such perturbed translation in the absence of BipA results in increased production of one or more key regulatory proteins, like VpsR and/or VpsT, leading to transcriptional activation of the entire biofilm regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with this general model, <italic>E. coli</italic> cells lacking LepA, a related translational GTPase involved in 30S biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibbs et al., 2017</xref>), show numerous changes in protein synthesis that depend on specific mRNA features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our observation that HapR<sup>+</sup> strains do not undergo temperature-dependent shifts in biofilm conflicts with results previously reported for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> A1552 and <italic>Vibrio salmonicida</italic>, which both encode functional HapR homologs. In <italic>V. cholerae</italic> A1552, increased c-di-GMP production at low temperatures by specific diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and the cold-shock gene <italic>cspV</italic> lead to higher biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Townsley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Townsley and Yildiz, 2015</xref>). However, it is important to note that we did not perform identical assays to the previous groups. For instance, biofilm and colony morphology might not be strictly equivalent phenomena or subtle changes in experimental conditions might also influence the impact that c-di-GMP production has on biofilm-associated phenotypes in this strain. Furthermore, the six DGCs that were induced at low temperature in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> A1552, and account for the increased biofilm production at low temperature, did not appear to be differentially expressed in our RNA-seq studies of co969. Since it is known that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> El Tor and classical biotypes (HapR<sup>+</sup> and HapR−, respectively) modulate c-di-GMP levels using different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammer and Bassler, 2009</xref>), which in turn results in differential regulation of biofilm formation, it seems likely that the presence or absence of HapR could account for the observed differences in the temperature-dependent regulation between these <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains. These results further underscore the diversity of biofilm regulatory processes in pathogenic <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> especially in strains where the master regulator HapR is absent.</p><p>The data presented in this work show that HapR neither regulates BipA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) nor influences the effect of Δ<italic>bipA</italic> on cell motility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Supplementary Figure 6). Although HapR or BipA alone (HapR<sup>+</sup> strains and high temperature or HapR<sup>−</sup> strains at low temperature, respectively) are sufficient to prevent rugose colony morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Supplementary Figure 3A and B), these proteins both contribute to the repression of biofilm gene expression via transcriptional and translational control. Moreover, our proteomics data showed that BipA, like HapR, impacts many processes including virulence, competence, QS, and protein secretion. We propose that biofilm formation represents just one of several cellular programs whose regulation involves combined transcriptional and translational control.</p><p>Since BipA is highly conserved in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibbs and Fredrick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Margus et al., 2007</xref>), it is possible that temperature-dependent control of biofilm gene expression by BipA observed in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is conserved in other bacteria. In agreement with this hypothesis, deletion of <italic>bipA</italic> has been associated with increased biofilm levels in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neidig et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Bordetella holmesii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hiramatsu et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the basis of regulation appears to be transcriptional in the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi and Hwang, 2018</xref>) and post-transcriptional in the case of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Steady-state levels of BipA increase substantially in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> at reduced temperature, without an increase in transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). CD experiments suggest that BipA adopts a conformation at 37°C that makes the protein more susceptible to degradation. These data raise the possibility that temperature-dependent control of BipA is governed by the intrinsic stability of the protein in the cell. Since bacteria thrive within a wide range of temperatures, it would be interesting to identify the amino acid residues in the sequence of BipA that dictate its capacity to change conformation, stability, and half-life in response to temperature fluctuation. Differences in the sequence of BipA may also explain distinct regulatory outcomes between species. For example, BipA is crucial for resistance to the antimicrobial peptide P2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sy et al., 1995</xref>), but not in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mathur and Waldor, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, defining the cellular processes and regulatory networks that lay under the control of BipA will shed light on how <italic>V. cholerae</italic> coordinates multiple behaviors in response to temperature changes.

Samples were normalized by total protein content and run in a 10% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gel for protein separation. Proteins were then transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore) using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer system (Bio-Rad). After blocking the membrane at room temperature for 2 hr with TBS-T buffer (24.2 g Trizma, 87.6 g NaCl in 1 l H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) containing 5% (w/v) milk, the membrane was incubated at 4°C o/n with the monoclonal anti-flag M2 primary antibody (Sigma Aldrich) in TBS-T buffer containing 5% (w/v) milk, washed with TBS-T buffer, incubated at RT for 1 hr with α-mouse secondary antibody in TBS-T buffer and again washed with TBS-T buffer. BipA-flag was detected by addition of SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminiscence substrate (Thermo Scientific) and detection of the signal using a LAS4000 (Fujifilm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Purification of BipA-His</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells carrying plasmid pET22b-<italic>bipA</italic>-His were grown at 37°C in LB media containing Cb (100 µg/ml) and 0.4% glucose (w/v) until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.4. Then, expression of the BipA-His fusion protein was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosidase) and further incubation for 2 hr at 37°C. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C 6000 rpm 30 min, resuspended in equilibration buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl) in the presence of protease inhibitors (cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets), and cell crude extracts were prepared by disruption in a pressure cell homogenizer FC600 (Julabo) followed by centrifugation at 4°C 15,000 rpm 30 min. BipA-His was purified from the soluble fraction by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) previously equilibrated with equilibration buffer. After washing with washing buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl), BipA-His was eluted with elution buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole) and then buffer exchanged to 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 + 100 mM NaCl by dialysis at 4°C o/n using a Spectra/Por molecular porous membrane tubing (6–8 kD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://spectrumlabs.com/">Spectrumlabs.com</ext-link>). Purified proteins were stored either at 4°C, for immediate use, or at −80°C after addition of 10% glycerol. For CD experiments, an additional buffer exchange was performed to 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl by dialysis at 4°C o/n using a Spectra/Por molecular porous membrane tubing (6–8 kD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://spectrumlabs.com/">Spectrumlabs.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Circular dichroism</title><p>About 2.5 µM of BipA-His in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl) was pre-incubated for 30 min at the appropriate temperature (37, 22, or 15°C) or pre-incubated for 30 min at 37°C and then shifted to 22°C for further 30 min. Then, CD was measured in a Jasco J-720 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Japan; 190–260 nm; 1 mm quartz cuvette, 3 µm scan, five averaged scans). Background spectra were always subtracted prior to analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Sucrose gradient sedimentation</title><p>Cultures were grown in LB (10 g/l NaCl) media until mid-exponential phase.

Absorbance at 254 nm was measured across the gradient, and data were quantified using Peak Chart (Brandel), software designed specifically for the ISCO/Brandel system employed. For each trace, areas under the 30S, 50S, 70S, and polysome peaks were integrated, and the corresponding values were normalized with respect to the 70S value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantitative label-free proteomics</title><p>Samples used for quantitative label-free proteomics were prepared as follows. Three biological replicates, each of them being a pool of four independent colonies of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> co969 or <italic>V. cholerae</italic> co969 Δ<italic>bipA</italic>, either grown at 37°C or 22°C (co969 37C, co969 22C, co969 Δ<italic>bipA</italic> 37C, co969 Δ<italic>bipA</italic> 22C) were analyzed. Total protein extracts were prepared by resuspending the collected pellets in 200 µl 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 + 200 mM NaCl, disrupting the cells in a bead beater (4°C, maximum speed for 1 min 15 s) and collecting the supernatants. Twenty micrograms of total protein extracts were run in a 12% pre-cast acrylamide gel at 100V for 20 min, and total protein bands were excised from the gel. Gel slices were digested as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burian et al., 2015</xref>). Peptide mixtures were then separated on an EasyLC nano-HPLC (Proxeon Biosystems) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpy et al., 2014</xref>) with the following modifications: peptides were eluted with an 130-min segmented gradient of 5–33–90% HPLC solvent B (80% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid). The acquired MS spectra were processed with the MaxQuant software package, version 1.5.2.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) with the integrated Andromeda search engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2011</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpy et al., 2014</xref>). Database searches were performed against a target-decoy <italic>V. cholerae</italic> complete database obtained from UniProt, containing 3783 protein entries and 248 commonly observed contaminants. The label-free algorithm was enabled, as was the ‘match between runs’ option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luber et al., 2010</xref>). Label-free quantification protein intensities from the MaxQuant data output were used for relative protein quantification. Downstream bioinformatic analysis (Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-sample t-tests) was performed using the Perseus software package, version 1.5.0.15. p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Determination of statistically significant differences was only possible for proteins that appeared in all four conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>β-galactosidase assay</title><p>Samples for β-galactosidase assays were prepared as follows.

strains to form smooth colonies at 22ºC and transition to rugose colonies at 37ºC. In this process, a ribosome-associated protein, named BipA, remodels the proteome at low temperature, modifying the levels of over 200 proteins. At 37ºC, in vitro experiments suggest that the levels of BipA decreases due to a conformational change that makes BipA more susceptible to protease degradation. Because BipA is a conserved GTPase, the findings could also be important to understand deep phenotypic transitions linked to temperature changes in other pathogens and bacteria in general.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A temperature-dependent translational switch controls biofilm development in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jay Zhu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation among the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from each individual review below, while the reviewers think that the work is sound and elegantly conducted, they both question whether BipA, being a translational factor, performs a more general task than controlling biofilm development in a temperature-dependent manner. After discussion, we decided that proving the specificity of BipA in temperature-dependent biofilm induction and thus, a bona fide BipA-dependent switch mechanism, would be required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We hope that the reviewers comments will be helpful to prepare the manuscript for submission to another journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by del Peso et al., investigates the temperature-dependent regulation of smooth/rugose colony formation in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. The results revealed that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains deficient in HapR, the master repressor of biofilm development, form smooth colonies at 22ºC and rugose colonies at 37ºC; because a protein named BipA represses the formation of rugose colonies at 22ºC. At 37ºC, in vitro experiments suggest that the levels of BipA decrease due to a conformational change that makes BipA more susceptible to protease degradation. BipA modifies the levels of over 200 proteins which are ultimately responsible for the rugose/smooth phenotype.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript has a solid logical flow. However, there are two main issues with the manuscript that require further clarification.</p><p>1) BipA is a ribosome associated GTPase. Thus, it is difficult to envision how this protein can be involved in a regulatory strategy for a specific group of proteins. BipA might be responsible for a basic function that affects the translation of proteins at low temperature, and the rugose phenotype of the colony might just be an indirect consequence of the absence of the protein. One simple experiment to investigate this possibility is to analyze the expression of a reporter protein (GFP, B-gal) in the WT and bipA mutant strains at 20ºC and 37ºC. If BipA is regulating the expression of some specific proteins, the levels of the reporter protein should not be affected by the absence of BipA.</p><p>2) In relation to the previous point, complementation of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> bipA mutant with bipA orthologues from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonasaeruginosa</italic> restore smooth colony morphology phenotype at 22ºC. I do not know how to interpret this finding. Do the authors think that these three bacteria share a regulatory pathway to control colony rugosity?</p><p>3) Another point that requires further clarification is the relationship between BipA and c-di-GMP. How does the absence of BipA affect c-di-GMP levels at 22ºC? Rugose colony morphology is usually related to high levels of c-di-GMP. Thus, the absence of BipA could cause an increase in the levels of c-di-GMP at 20ºC by favoring the accumulation of a diguanylate cyclase or reducing the levels of a phosphodiesterase.</p><p>4) Title. I think that the term &quot;translational switch&quot; is misleading. The levels of BipA seem to depend on a temperature-dependent structural conformation and susceptibility to protease activity. BipA modifies the levels of target proteins by a mechanism that remains unknown. Thus, it is not clear what the authors mean by translational switch.</p><p>5) Figure 1D (If I correctly understood the figure) suggests that a rugose colony grown at 37ºC contains smooth colonies, almost in similar numbers, to rugose colonies. Am I right? Does this mean that rugose colonies contain a mixture population of smooth and rugose bacteria? Is BipA mutated in these smooth colonies?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors start with a nice phenotype (temperature-dependent rugose colony formation in certain <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains); and through a series of painstaking experiments and screens, the authors discovered that a ribosome assembly factor BipA represses biofilm formation at low temperatures. They also provide data showing that BipA is less stable at 37C. The experimental designs are logical and data are nicely presented. The genetic screens are elegant. My major concern is that BipA has global effects on protein translation at low temperature and rugosity happens to be one of many. It is unclear what physiological role BipA plays and what mechanism of BipA regulation is (besides BipA stability). Major comments are listed below.</p><p>1) Rugose phenotype vs. biofilm formation. The authors are absolutely right that the rugose phenotype is linked to biofilm formation. However, since the temperature-dependent phenotype is new, the authors may want to perform &quot;classical&quot; biofilm assays in order to support their claim that temperature controls biofilm.</p><p>2) HapR issue. BipA effects are only observable in hapR- background (by the way, please offer an explanation why N16961 is an exception) but BipA stability is not affected by HapR. Thus the question is what the role of BipA is in hapR+ background? I wish the authors performed proteomic studies using a hapR+ background as well.</p><p>3) Growth of bipA mutants. The authors show that bipA does not affect growth at any temperature, but it seems that the growth condition tested (Supplementary figure 3) is different from growing on plates.</p><p>4) Figure 3C shows that at 37C, bipA- is no longer rugose. Isn't that BipA is a repressor and is not stable at 37C anyway? Similarly, in Figure 3D, no rugosity is seen at 37C.</p><p>5) BipA stability assays. The experiments are pretty crude for such an important aspect of the manuscript. It would be nice to see more quantitative measurements such as pulse-chase experiments. The authors may also want to show FLAG-tag itself does not affect protein stability and BipA-FLAG is functional. The trypsin partial digestion assays are poorly conducted. Even at 22C, with seconds, BipA-His has been degraded. We can argue that BipA is just very sensitive to trypsin digestion and the BSA control isn't.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60607.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

However, we believe our proteomics data suggest that BipA is not a global translational regulator. To further investigate this possibility, we performed two additional experiments. First, we constructed additional translational reporters in housekeeping proteins predicted to be unaffected by BipA from the proteomics, and indeed found that the levels of these proteins do not change between low or high temperatures (Figure 6D in the revised manuscript), whereas there are substantial shifts in biofilm-associated putative BipA-impacted proteins like VpsR and VpsL.</p><p>We also performed additional polysome analysis on lysates from WT and <italic>bipA</italic>-mutant co969 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and found that there is a modest defect in 50S subunit assembly in the mutant strain (Figure 5 in the revised manuscript). A similar defect has been reported in <italic>E. coli</italic> to also preferentially alter the levels of some, but not all proteins (Gibbs et al., 2020), supporting the idea that BipAdependent control of ribosome assembly has targeted effects on the proteome.</p><p>We recognize that the previous version of the manuscript portrayed BipA as a biofilmspecific regulator, which was not our intention. We have significantly re-written parts of the manuscript to more accurately convey our conclusion, which is that BipA does indeed alter the levels of proteins responsible for the phenotype of interest (colony rugosity/biofilm formation), but also influences proteins thought to participate in a wide variety of cellular functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In relation to the previous point, complementation of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> bipA mutant with bipA orthologues from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> restore smooth colony morphology phenotype at 22ºC. I do not know how to interpret this finding. Do the authors think that these three bacteria share a regulatory pathway to control colony rugosity?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the BipA orthologues we tested in this study share high sequence identity, it is not surprising that complementation of the <italic>V. cholerae bipA</italic> mutant with these sequences rescued the inappropriate 22C rugosity phenotype, as it suggests a functional BipA in the context of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm regulatory network exerts temperature-dependent control of colony rugosity. However, since we did not characterize <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>P. putida</italic> BipA mutants, we cannot conclude that this specific function of BipA in those species, which have biofilm regulatory schemes that differ significantly from <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, is the same. We think it is likely BipA controls the levels of proteins in those species’ proteomes, but without extensive further work whether its specific impact on biofilm-associated proteins and downstream colony rugosity is conserved remains an open question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another point that requires further clarification is the relationship between BipA and c-di-GMP. How does the absence of BipA affect c-di-GMP levels at 22ºC? Rugose colony morphology is usually related to high levels of c-di-GMP. Thus, the absence of BipA could cause an increase in the levels of c-di-GMP at 20ºC by favoring the accumulation of a diguanylate cyclase or reducing the levels of a phosphodiesterase.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we compared the levels of c-di-GMP for the WT and <italic>bipA</italic> mutant strains at both 37ºC and 22ºC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We did not observe significant differences in the levels of this second messenger between the two strains at either temperature, indicating that c-di-GMP is not involved in the BipA-mediated control of colony rugosity. We note that known diguanylate cyclases in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome were unaltered in the comparative RNAseq analysis in Figure 2, further suggesting that this phenotype is c-di-GMP-independent.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>c-di-GMP quantification in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> WT and Δ<italic>bipA</italic> mutant at different temperatures.</title><p>A) Representative HPLC chromatograms of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> soluble nucleotide profiles.

Thus, it is not clear what the authors mean by translational switch.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point, and we agree that our data do not conclusively identify the mechanism by which BipA modifies the levels of certain proteins in the proteome, only that this process is temperature dependent and possibly a result of a defect in ribosome subunit assembly in the mutant strains. We have revised our title to “BipA exerts temperature-dependent control of biofilm-associated colony morphology in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>” and appropriately scaled back claims regarding BipA’s effect on translation throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1D (If I correctly understood the figure) suggests that a rugose colony grown at 37ºC contains smooth colonies, almost in similar numbers, to rugose colonies. Am I right? Does this mean that rugose colonies contain a mixture population of smooth and rugose bacteria? Is BipA mutated in these smooth colonies?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1D does not show mixtures of smooth and rugose colonies – rather, it shows the colony-forming units (i.e. amount of viable bacteria) in colonies collected from conditions where smooth or rugose colonies are present. Since CFU densities did not vary greatly between smooth and rugose colonies, we concluded that this process was occurring independently of cell growth (i.e. the increased contrast of the colony is not due to simple increases in cell number).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors start with a nice phenotype (temperature-dependent rugose colony formation in certain <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains); and through a series of painstaking experiments and screens, the authors discovered that a ribosome assembly factor BipA represses biofilm formation at low temperatures.

However, we would like to emphasize that colony morphology was not the only biofilm “readout” we used in this study. The RNAseq, qPCR and proteomic analyses all invariably identified strong upregulation of biofilm-associated structural and regulatory genes in rugose colonies compared to smooth colonies.</p><p>To address this point, we revised the manuscript to refrain from making direct statements about biofilm formation except for in the Discussion. In the revised manuscript, we now refer to colony morphology more specifically, as well as to “biofilm-associated” phenotypes to more accurately reflect our data. We also changed the title of the manuscript to “BipA exerts temperature-dependent control of biofilmassociated colony morphology in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) HapR issue. BipA effects are only observable in hapR- background (by the way, please offer an explanation why N16961 is an exception) but BipA stability is not affected by HapR. Thus the question is what the role of BipA is in hapR+ background? I wish the authors performed proteomic studies using a hapR+ background as well.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s first point, N16961 may be an exception to our identification of BipA effects in HapR- strains due to additional genetic background changes that prevent this strain from forming rugose colonies at high temperatures. N16961 has over 200 SNPs compared to other commonly used strains such as C6706 (and likely co969), and dissecting this observation, while biologically interesting, is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>The role of BipA in HapR+ background is an interesting point for discussion. In the revised manuscript, we are careful to emphasize that BipA does not solely impact biofilm gene regulation. As shown by our proteomics studies, BipA influences the levels of many other proteins with roles in diverse cellular processes such as motility, cell envelope maintenance and metabolism. We verified that at least one of these processes (motility) is indeed altered in <italic>bipA</italic> mutant strains, and that this phenotype is in fact independent of HapR (Supplementary figure 7). Thus, the HapR dependence of BipA’s effect on colony rugosity may be a special circumstance. Since HapR levels are regulated by external inputs, specifically quorum sensing, BipA could plausibly still impact biofilm formation and/or colony morphology in HapR+ strains in environments where HapR is intact, but not produced. We suspect that performing the proteomics in a HapR+ background would be interesting, but ultimately yield many of the same hits that the HapR- analyses revealed. In other words, BipA would impact the abundance of the same proteins, but in the case of HapR+ strains, the ultimate downstream influence on biofilm formation would be masked by the dominant effects of HapR (leaving BipA’s effect on other cell processes intact).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Growth of bipA mutants. The authors show that bipA does not affect growth at any temperature, but it seems that the growth condition tested (Supplementary figure 3) is different from growing on plates.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional imaging of plate-grown <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to address this point. As shown in Supplementary figure 3, there is no visible difference between WT and BipAdeficient strains in colony growth at different times or different temperatures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3C shows that at 37C, bipA- is no longer rugose. Isn't that BipA is a repressor and is not stable at 37C anyway? Similarly, in Figure 3D, no rugosity is seen at 37C.</p></disp-quote><p>BipA- colonies are more rugose than WT colonies and have higher contrast values, and hence seem darker in the representative images. We suspect this may be due to minimal or barely detectable levels of BipA activity at 37C, so in the complete absence of this protein there is indeed a subtle increase in rugosity at this temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) BipA stability assays. The experiments are pretty crude for such an important aspect of the manuscript. It would be nice to see more quantitative measurements such as pulse-chase experiments. The authors may also want to show FLAG-tag itself does not affect protein stability and BipA-FLAG is functional.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a valid point that the stability assays are not high-resolution snapshots of BipA stability. However, we note that the primary observation in the manuscript in this section is that BipA protein levels are drastically changed at different temperatures, while <italic>bipA</italic> transcript levels remain the same. We have re-written this section to reflect that temperature-mediated sensitivity to proteolysis is just one hypothesis for a model of control of BipA’s abundance, and that our current data do not allow us to conclusively determine this mechanism.</p><p>As the reviewer requested, we generated a stable co969 strain expressing only the BipA-FLAG fusion protein. This strain exhibits identical colony morphology to the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), strongly suggesting that the fusion protein is functional and not drastically altered in stability or abundance.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Colony morphology of BipA-FLAG derivative.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60607-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The trypsin partial digestion assays are poorly conducted. Even at 22C, with seconds, BipA-His has been degraded.
