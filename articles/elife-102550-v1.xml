To address this, we developed HiCapR, a psoralen crosslinking-based RNA proximity ligation method coupled with post-library hybridization, enabling high-resolution mapping of RNA-RNA interactions across the HIV-1 genome. This approach confirmed canonical structural motifs, including stem-loop architectures in the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) and Rev Response Element (RRE), as well as dimerization sites within the 5’-UTR critical for viral packaging. Notably, HiCapR identified novel homodimerization events distributed along the genome, suggesting an expanded regulatory role of RNA multimerization in splicing regulation and selective encapsidation. Intriguingly, while infected cells exhibited extensive long-range RNA interactions—particularly within the 5’-UTR—virion-packaged genomes displayed a marked reduction in such interactions, indicative of a structural transition from a loosely organized state to a condensed conformation. This spatial reorganization coincided with the preservation of stable genomic domains essential for dimerization, which persisted throughout virion assembly. These domains, enriched at homodimer interfaces, likely serve as structural scaffolds ensuring fidelity during genome packaging. This work establishes HiCapR as a robust tool for probing RNA interactomes and provides mechanistic insights into how HIV-1 exploits RNA topological heterogeneity to regulate its life cycle. The identification of conserved structural domains and transient interaction networks opens avenues for targeting RNA conformation in antiviral strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>RNA structure</kwd><kwd>homodimers</kwd><kwd>long range interction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HiCapR uncovers HIV RNA homodimers and long-range interactions that show structural dynamics critical for viral packaging and assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a significant global health concern despite advancements in antiretroviral therapy even with the newest report of total seven AIDS patients been completely ‘cued’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mallapaty, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emery and Swanstrom, 2021</xref>). Research on HIV-1 RNA structure and function has intensified, focusing on assembly, release, and maturation processes, using NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keane et al., 2015</xref>), cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and chemical probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tomezsko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2022</xref>). However, our knowledge of the global architecture and the long-range interactions within the HIV-1 RNA genome remains limited, primarily due to the complexity and dynamic nature of these structures.</p><p>The HIV genome, comprising two copies of positive-sense RNA, has been extensively studied to understand its regulatory elements, such as the 5’-UTR, crucial for dimerization and selective packaging into viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, interactions involving the nucleocapsid protein (NC) and the dimerization signal (Ψ) play pivotal roles in the assembly and maturation of HIV virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the RRE in the HIV genome, responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport of viral RNA, exhibits structural variability impacting virus replication rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherpa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>). While current techniques like SHAPE began to provide insights into local RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tomezsko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saldi et al., 2021</xref>), studying the intricate long-range RNA interactions and homodimers within the HIV genome under physiological conditions remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the limitations of these methods in capturing the full spectrum of RNA interactions and the dynamic nature of the viral genome.</p><p>Proximity ligation-based methods have been shown to be particularly useful for studying long-range RNA interactions, as they can overcome the RNA length limitations of traditional techniques. These methods have been applied to the study of various viruses, including influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Sage et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyamoto and Noda, 2020</xref>), Zika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ziv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huber et al., 2019</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ziv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and have led to the identification of numerous RNA structures that are closely related to the virus lifecycle. We and others have recently shown that RNA proximity ligation data also contains information about RNA homodimerization events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabryelska et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, as of now, there are no proximity ligation studies of long-range interactions or dimeric interactions of the HIV RNA genome. Probably due to high requirements of starting material, making it very difficult for low abundant HIV sample treatment.</p><p>In this study, we modified our previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) by integrating a hybridization-based capture of HIV-1 sequence after library construction, resulting in a method we call High throughput Capture of RNA interactions (HiCapR). This advancement enabled the comprehensive capture and analysis of the complete HIV RNA genome. By applying HiCapR to both infected cells and virions, we uncover a distinct genomic compression pattern in virions, highlighting the critical role of global genome folding in HIV packaging and assembly. Our findings not only reveal the presence of persistent genomic domains within virions that facilitate whole genome dimerization, even the transgenerational inheritance but also a significant reduction of long-range RNA-RNA interactions in virions compared to infected cells. These insights provide a new perspective on the functional implications of HIV RNA structure in splicing and packaging processes and may lead to the identification of new targets for antiviral intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Capturing in vivo HIV genome RNA structure in infected cells and in virion</title><p>To effectively capture and analyze full-length low abundant HIV RNA-RNA interactions in infected cells, we developed an improved version of the protocol, which we call <italic>HiCapR</italic>.

Applying this strategy, we compared the NL4-3 and GX2005002 strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2015</xref>,which are two distinct HIV-1 strains that exhibit different prevalence patterns in various geographical regions. The NL4-3 strain is a well-characterized laboratory strain that is widely used in HIV research and is representative of the HIV-1 subtype B, which is highly prevalent in Europe and the Americas. On the other hand, GX2005002 is a primary isolate of the CRF01_AE subtype, which is one of the most prevalent strains in Southeast Asia, particularly in China.

The alignment rate exceeded 90%, and we achieved an average depth of coverage of approximately 11,500 X across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The uniform distribution of reads post-capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrates HiCapR’s effectiveness in capturing the entire HIV RNA genome with minimal bias.

The chimeric rate, a crucial indicator of ligation efficiency, was approximately 1% in non-ligation controls and around 9% in the ligation group, aligning with the widely reported range. The proportion of 5'–3' and 3'–5' chimeras was nearly equal in long-range interactions, while proximal interactions were enriched for 3'–5' chimeras. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a high degree of correlation (<italic>r</italic>&gt;0.99) between biological replicates, indicating high reproducibility.

One of the extensively investigated structures is 5'-UTR, as these structures are closely associated with crucial life processes of HIV.</p><p>Chimeras analysis support the presence of key structural elements, including TAR, polyA, SL1, SL2, and SL3, as well as polyA-SL1 in the monomeric conformation in the HIV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the pivotal role of the 5'-UTR in replication, packaging, transcription and translation, we noted that the 5'-UTR sequence of HIV is not highly conserved across different HIV strains. A comparison between the NL4-3 and GX2005002 strains revealed notable insertions and deletions in the U5 region, along with point mutations in the loop of the SL1 core region, which is critical for HIV dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings raise questions about the conservation of the structural integrity of this region. We therefore applied the comradesFold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ziv et al., 2018</xref>) to our HiCapR data to generate 1000 structure predictions of the 5'-UTR (extending 100 nt downstream of the AUG start codon) for each sample, and then performed MDS analysis after aligning the viral genome coordinates of both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This analysis revealed that the reported dimer and monomer structures clustered together in NL4-3 but form distinct clusters in GX2005002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Further investigation is needed to unravel the mechanisms and biological significance of this compression in the HIV-1 genome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Emerging insights into HIV-1 dimerization through newly identified dimer sites</title><p>Our detailed analysis has consistently identified approximately 20 candidate dimer peaks both within and beyond the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) across the NL4-3 and GX2005002 strains of HIV. Intriguingly, these peaks show a notable enrichment in the vicinity of splicing sites, frequently featuring a sequence motif that bears a strong resemblance to the RNA binding signature of the Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factors (SRSF). This enrichment pattern and the presence of the SRSF-like motif at these sites suggest a potential regulatory role of these dimers in the complex landscape of HIV RNA splicing. The pervasive presence of homodimers flanking almost every splicing site introduces the intriguing hypothesis that these dimers could be actively participating in the regulation of alternative splicing or facilitating the export of unspliced genomic RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This hypothesis warrants rigorous investigation in subsequent studies to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of these observations. Collectively, these findings hint at a significant interplay between RNA dimerization and splicing processes within the HIV genome, which could have profound implications for our understanding of viral gene expression and replication strategies.</p><p>Moreover, significant dimer signals were observed in the RRE flanking sequences, adding complexity to its functional role, potentially impacting nucleocytoplasmic transport, Gag binding, and virus packaging processes. Given previous studies highlighting Gag binding to RRE and the crucial role of RRE in anchoring Gag synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emery and Swanstrom, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kutluay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker and Sherer, 2017</xref>), it is further hypothesized that HIV-1 homodimers may play a role in HIV splicing or assist in transporting unspliced full-length RNA out of the nucleus for genome packaging.</p><p>Interestingly, the observation that candidate dimer sites are located within genomic domains suggests that dimerization may be influenced by the local RNA folding environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). It is possible that the dense local interaction around these sites may facilitate dimerization by bringing the two regions of the genome into close proximity. Alternatively, dimerization may play a role in shaping the local chromatin environment by promoting even initiating the formation of genomic domains. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between RNA genomic domains and dimer sites in the HIV-1 genome. However, the identification of these candidate dimer sites within genomic domains provides a starting point for investigating the role of local genome RNA interactions in HIV-1 replication and dimerization. These findings may have implications for the development of novel antiviral therapies that target the dimerization process and may provide new avenues for future research in this field.</p><p>In summary, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the HIV-1 genome using reliable HicapR, revealing potential dimer sites and long-range interactions, particularly within the 5'-UTR as well as persistent structure domains? These findings significantly advance our understanding of the structure, dynamics and robustness of HIV RNA and their involvement in splicing, assembly and packaging processes, potentially leading to the development of novel antiviral therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and virus infection</title><p>The MT4 cell lines (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_2632">CVCL_2632</ext-link>) were cultured under specific conditions: RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MT-4 cells are human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells derived from peripheral blood leukocytes of a 50-year-old Japanese male adult T-cell leukemia patient, established through co-culture with umbilical cord lymphocytes from a male infant. The cells are lymphoblastic-like, round, and grow in suspension. MT-4 cells express CD4 receptors, which are key receptors for the invasion of viruses such as HIV, making MT-4 cells highly sensitive to HIV. The MT-4 cell line we use was kindly donated by Professor Lu Shan from the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The identity of the cell line has been verified by STR profiling, and the results show that the STR profile of this MT-4 cell line is consistent with the standard reference profile. Besides, the cell line tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were maintained at a temperature of 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and saturated humidity. To initiate infection, cells were exposed to HIV-1 NL4-3 (HIV-1 strain of subtype B) or HIV-1 GX2005002 (HIV-1 primary strain of CRF01_AE which is one of the main strain in China, accession: GU564222) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.15. Concurrently, parallel control groups consisting of uninfected cells were also established.

We have reorganized results part 1. We hope the revision provides a logical flow and clarity to the results, making it easier for readers to follow the progression of the study and the significance of the findings regarding to the HiCapR method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Is there any reason that the authors mention &quot;genome structure of SARS-CoV-2&quot; in L95?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful question. We have deleted this sentence in the revised paper.</p><p>Initially, the mention of our previous work on SARS-CoV-2 serves two purposes: firstly, to demonstrate our capability to perform proximity ligation assays on viral samples; and secondly, to underscore the necessity of the hybridization step, which is particularly relevant for the study of HIV.</p><p>Unlike SARS-CoV-2, which is highly abundant in infected cells and does not require post-library hybridization, HIV-1 presents a unique challenge due to its typically low viral RNA input within cells. The simplified SPLASH protocol, while effective for more abundant viral RNAs, does not provide the necessary coverage for high-resolution analysis when applied directly to HIV samples.</p><p>Now, we have deleted this sentence according to your comments, and discuss the technical difference elsewhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) L102: Please clarify the purpose of comparing &quot;NL4-3&quot; and &quot;GX2005002.&quot; Additionally, could you explain what NL4-3 and GX2005002 are? The connection between NL4-3, GX2005002, and HIV appears to be missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question, and we apologize for the misleading. &quot;NL4-3&quot; and &quot;GX2005002&quot; are two distinct HIV-1 strains that exhibit different prevalence patterns in various geographical regions. The NL4-3 strain is a well-characterized laboratory strain that is widely used in HIV research and is representative of the HIV-1 subtype B, which is highly prevalent in Europe and the Americas. On the other hand, GX2005002 is a primary isolate of the CRF01_AE subtype, which is one of the most prevalent strains in Southeast Asia, particularly in China.</p><p>The reason for comparing these two strains in our study is twofold. Firstly, it allows us to assess the applicability and versatility of our HiCapR method across different HIV-1 strains that may have distinct genetic and structural features. This is crucial for understanding the potential broad utility of our method in studying various HIV-1 strains globally. Secondly, by comparing these strains, we can begin to elucidate any strain-specific differences in RNA structure, homodimer formation, and long-range interactions, which may have implications for viral pathogenesis, transmission, and response to therapeutic interventions.</p><p>The connection between NL4-3, GX2005002, and HIV lies in their representation of different subtypes of the HIV-1 virus, which exhibit genetic diversity and are associated with different geographical distributions. This diversity is epidemiologically and clinically relevant, as it may be associated with different pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms, and might has implications for vaccine development and treatment strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 1A is not able to clearly present the innovation point of HiCapR.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment.

These elements are crucial for understanding the local RNA structures involved in HIV replication and pathogenesis. By visualizing the base pairing probability as a heatmap, we have identified the most stable base pairs in the 5’ UTR of HIV, which is consistent across both NL4-3 and GX2005002 strains (Figure 2D). This consistency suggests robustness in the overall structure despite sequence variations and alternative RNA conformations, indicating a high level of agreement between HiCapR and SHAPE methods in detecting local interactions.</p><p>Furthermore, HiCapR not only confirms the presence of known structural elements but also reveals alternative conformations of the 5'UTR that support the alternative conformations found in SHAPE analysis. This additional layer of information provides a more comprehensive view of the RNA structures, highlighting HiCapR's ability to capture local RNA interactions with a high degree of accuracy comparable to established methods like SHAPE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The paper needs further language editing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thoroughly revised the paper.

We will provide a more thorough comparison between HiCapR and the original method, detailing the specific improvements and how they enable the analysis of low-abundance viral RNAs like HIV. This will include:</p><p>Post-library Hybridization: Unlike the original method, HiCapR incorporates a post-library hybridization step. This innovation allows for the capture of target RNA involved in interactions after library construction, offering additional flexibility and enhancing the resolution of the analysis.</p><p>Enhanced Sensitivity: HiCapR has been optimized to work with extremely low viral RNA input, which is a significant advancement over the original method. This is crucial for studying viruses like HIV, where obtaining high quantities of viral RNA can be challenging. As a matter of fact,</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Experimentally, the manuscript seems to be based on a single biological replicate, so there is strong concern about reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the issue of reproducibility in our study. We understand the importance of experimental replication in ensuring the reliability of our findings. In response to your concern, we would like to provide the following clarification and additional details regarding the reproducibility of our HiCapR experiments:</p><p>Replicates in HiCapR Experiments: All ligation and control samples in our HiCapR experiments were performed in three biological replicates. This was done to ensure the high reproducibility of our results. The high degree of correlation (r &gt; 0.99) between these replicates underscores the reliability of our findings.</p><p>Dimer Validation Experiments: To validate the dimer formation of RRE and 5’-UTR, we employed multiple independent methods, including Native agarose gel electrophoresis, Agilent 4200 TapeStation Capillary electrophoresis, and Biomolecular Binding Kinetics Assays. These methods provide complementary perspectives on the dimer formation, enhancing the robustness of our validation process. The data presented in Figure 3C and Supplementary figure S12 are representative results from these experiments, which consistently support our findings on dimer formation.</p><p>Agreement Between Cellular and Virion RNA: Our study also demonstrates a significant similarity between virions in the supernatant and infected cells from the same viral strain, as shown in Supplementary Figure S3. This consistency further validates the reproducibility and reliability of our HiCapR method in capturing RNA structures and interactions under different conditions.</p><p>Consistency across two strains: Our study includes a comprehensive analysis of two distinct HIV-1 strains, NL4-3 and GX2005002, which are prevalent in Europe and Southeast Asia, respectively. The consistency in our findings across these strains serves as a strong indicator of the reproducibility and general applicability of our HiCapR method. Specifically, presence of key structural elements such as TAR, polyA, SL1, SL2, and SL3 in both NL4-3 and GX2005002 strains, suggests a robust structural framework that is conserved across different strains, despite sequence variations. Additionally, our study reveals approximately 20 candidate dimer peaks conserved between the NL4-3 and GX2005002 strains along the genome. The conservation of these dimer peaks across strains indicates a reproducible pattern of dimerization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors perform an extensive computational analysis from a limited number of datasets, which are in thorough need of experimental validation</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment.</p><p>In response to your concern, we would like to clarify that while our manuscript does present an extensive computational analysis, we have also conducted a series of experiments. Specifically, we have validated dimer formation using multiple independent methods (afore discussed).</p><p>Given the time-consuming nature of additional experiments, we have chosen to share the HiCapR data with the community in a timely manner. This approach allows for more immediate communication and evaluation of the data on HIV structure, which we believe is valuable for advancing the field.</p><p>We are committed to further investigating the functional implications of our structural findings. We plan to conduct more experiments to explore the functional linking between the structural insights of HIV, which will help to deepen our understanding of the virus's replication and potential antiviral strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I suggest a major revision of the manuscript.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) The article lacks consistency in its presentation. The expression of the proper noun is wrong in the paper.

We have revised the sentence to provide a complete and clear description of our methodology. The revised sentence is as follows: &quot;Homodimers were identified in accordance with the methods previously reported in the literature.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors perform an extensive computational analysis from a limited number of datasets, which are in thorough need of experimental validation. There is a single series on in vitro validation of the interaction of an homodimerization site, described in five lines (278-283) plus the Figure panel 3c with a very brief legend, and an extremely minimalist Figure S12. The panel to Figure 3c contains Kd values which have not been assessed for significant digits.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive feedback on our manuscript.</p><p>We acknowledge that our computational analysis is based on a limited number of datasets. Due to the initial exploratory nature of our study and the logistical challenges of generating additional datasets, we have focused on in-depth analysis of the available data. We are currently working on further validating our findings and are committed to publishing these results in a follow-up study.</p><p>Regarding Experimental Validation:</p><p>We agree that the initial description of our in vitro validation of the homodimerization site was concise. To address this, we have expanded the description of our experimental procedures. Specifically, we have detailed the methods used for the in vitro transcription, the preparation of RNA samples, and the use of the Octet R8 platform for biomolecular binding kinetics assays.</p><p>For the Kd values presented in Figure 3c. We have now included standard error of the mean and have defined the significant digits in the figure legend. This revision provides a more accurate representation of the binding affinities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As a further example to be experimentally validated, splice sites are discussed after lines 354, for which unsophisticated validation techniques such as targeted RT-PCR are widely accepted.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to your comment, we would like to clarify that the splice sites mentioned in our study are well-established and widely recognized in the literature. They have been previously characterized and are considered canonical within the HIV research community. Given their established nature, we have relied on this foundational knowledge in our analysis.</p><p>However, we concur with the importance of validating the regulatory role of homodimers in splicing, which is a significant aspect of HIV biology. While we have provided evidence for the presence of these homodimers and their potential implications for splicing, we acknowledge the need for further functional studies to elucidate their mechanistic role.</p><p>Due to the scope and length constraints of the current manuscript, we have chosen to focus on the structural and interaction analyses provided by HiCapR. The functional validation of these homodimers and their impact on splicing will be pursued in subsequent studies, which we plan to initiate promptly. We believe that a dedicated follow-up study will allow for a more in-depth exploration of this complex and important aspect of HIV gene regulation.</p><p>We are committed to advancing our understanding of the functional significance of these homodimers in the context of HIV splicing and will ensure that this line of investigation is thoroughly addressed in our future work.</p><p>Thank you again for your valuable feedback. We look forward to contributing further to the field with our ongoing research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
