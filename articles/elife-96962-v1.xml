sUA at physiological levels may be essential for the maintenance of health. Yet, the fundamental physiological functions and molecular targets of sUA remain largely unknown. Using enzyme assays and in vitro and in vivo metabolic assays, we demonstrate that sUA directly inhibits the hydrolase and cyclase activities of CD38 via a reversible non-competitive mechanism, thereby limiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) degradation. CD38 inhibition is restricted to sUA in purine metabolism, and a structural comparison using methyl analogs of sUA such as caffeine metabolites shows that 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one is the main functional group. Moreover, sUA at physiological levels prevents crude lipopolysaccharide (cLPS)-induced systemic inflammation and monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced peritonitis in mice by interacting with CD38. Together, this study unveils an unexpected physiological role for sUA in controlling NAD<sup>+</sup> availability and innate immunity through CD38 inhibition, providing a new perspective on sUA homeostasis and purine metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>uric acid</kwd><kwd>CD38</kwd><kwd>nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>hyperuricemia</kwd><kwd>hypouricemia</kwd><kwd>MSU crystal</kwd><kwd>gout</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>uricase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI [JP21H02641]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamai</surname><given-names>Ikumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI [JP23K18181]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamai</surname><given-names>Ikumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI [JP22K19372]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arakawa</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020376</institution-id><institution>Gout and Uric Acid Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant 2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamai</surname><given-names>Ikumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Soluble uric acid at physiological levels limits NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation and excessive inflammation by directly inhibiting CD38.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary loss of uricase activity in humans and certain primates completely blocks the degradation of soluble uric acid (sUA), leading to higher physiological levels of sUA than in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 1992</xref>). Owing to renal reabsorption, sUA is strictly maintained in humans rather than being eliminated as a waste. It has been suggested that sUA functions as an abundant antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glantzounis et al., 2005</xref>) and is crucial to maintain blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>). Although hyperuricemia may promote the precipitation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal, an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martinon et al., 2006</xref>), resulting in diseases such as gout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dehlin et al., 2020</xref>) and kidney stone disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howles and Thakker, 2020</xref>), numerous studies have indicated the protective potential of sUA in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kutzing and Firestein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, abnormal reduction of sUA levels is clinically associated with the risk of various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kutzing and Firestein, 2008</xref>), including cardiovascular diseases and kidney diseases. Intriguingly, rapid urate reduction in the initiation of therapy even increases gout flares in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2005</xref>). Depletion of sUA in uricase-transgenic mice shortens lifespan and promotes sterile inflammation induced by microbial molecules or pro-inflammatory particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kono et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shi, 2010</xref>). Thus, data supports that sUA provides a physiological defense against excessive inflammation, aging, and certain diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ãlvarez-Lario and MacarrÃ³n-Vicente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ames et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cutler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kutzing and Firestein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Linnerz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wen et al., 2024</xref>). However, the underlying molecular basis of sUA physiology remains poorly understood.</p><p>To gain insight into target-based physiological functions of sUA, our laboratory utilized magnetic bead-conjugated 8-oxoguanine (8-OG, an sUA analog; technically, sUA cannot be directly conjugated to the beads) and proteomic analysis to screen the potential candidates of sUA-binding proteins. We discovered several binding proteins of 8-OG (unpublished data), including CD38 that was verified by enzyme inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which raised our interest in exploring the role of CD38 in sUA physiology. CD38 is mainly expressed in immune cells and has type II or type III membrane orientation, with the catalytic domain facing the outside or inside of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Zhao, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>).

Functionally, CD38 serves as a hydrolase to degrade nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2019</xref>), an essential cofactor for various metabolic reactions that sustain life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luongo et al., 2020</xref>), as well as its precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chini et al., 2020</xref>), thus regulating inflammation, aging, and various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2019</xref>). Its cyclase catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD<sup>+</sup> to drive calcium mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 1989</xref>), which is crucial for social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin et al., 2007</xref>) and neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Partida-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of soluble uric acid (sUA) as an endogenous inhibitor for CD38.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Preliminary screening of 8-oxoguanine (8-OG) binding proteins by mass spectrum (MS)-based proteomics, and effect of 8-OG (50 Î¼M) on CD38 activity (n=3 experiments/technical replicates).

Uracil or 1,3-DHI-2-one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>) alone did not affect CD38 activity.

Given that the physiological concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine are generally within 20 Î¼M, both NAMPT and PARP might not be affected by purine metabolism under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B and D</xref>). Thus, we further investigated whether CD38 mediates the effect of sUA on NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation. Short-term and moderate âsUA-supplementationâ model was constructed by gavage of inosine and oxonic acid (OA, a uricase inhibitor with a K<sub>i</sub> in the nanomolar range; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fridovich, 1965</xref>) in mice with ânatural hypouricemiaâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5C</xref>). The plasma sUA levels (around 120 Î¼M) in our models were close to the minimum physiological concentrations in humans but were markedly lower than that in other long-term and hyperuricemia-associated disease models in rodents, which enabled us to evaluate the physiologically inhibitory effect of sUA on CD38 activity. Although OA was a weak inhibitor of CD38 with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A and B</xref>), it seemed unlikely to affect CD38 activity in our models because of the incomplete inhibition of uricase, as evidenced by plasma sUA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C</xref>).

This indicates that CD38 mediates, at least in part, the suppressive effect of sUA on NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation. The suppression of NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation by the sUA-CD38 interaction was validated by a decrease in cADPR production under inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D</xref>) but not under non-inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5F</xref>), possibly because of physiological compensation via other cADPR synthases. However, sUA had a minor effect on NMN levels in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4F</xref>), likely due to the rapid conversion of NMN to NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mills et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, WT and CD38 KO mice showed similar NAD<sup>+</sup> baselines in whole blood, suggesting that the metabolic background has been reprogrammed in CD38 KO mice; for instance, sirtuins with higher activity in CD38 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho-Pereira et al., 2016</xref>) may consume more NAD<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, sUA release in vivo showed that both plasma sUA and whole blood NAD<sup>+</sup> gradually returned to their initial levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which confirmed the reversible regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> availability by sUA and excluded potential interference from the gene regulation involved in other bioconversion pathways of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Metabolic assays using recombinant hCD38 further verified that increased NAD<sup>+</sup> availability is mediated by direct CD38-sUA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the tissue levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMN were not increased in 1- and 3-day sUA-supplementation models, probably because the tissue uptake of sUA was physiologically saturated before treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5A and B</xref>). The NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the brain and heart appeared to be elevated in 7-day model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5GâI</xref>). Thus, the sUA-CD38 interaction in the circulation may indirectly increase tissue NAD<sup>+</sup> availability. Our models within 7 days did not show an increase in serum IL-1Î² production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>), but we did not prolong the treatment time because long-term administration of OA might induce renal damage with concomitant inflammation related to cell death.</p><p>Considering the rapid conversion of NMN to NAD<sup>+</sup> in vivo, we assessed the effect of sUA on extracellular NMN degradation in vitro. sUA directly inhibited NMN degradation by recombinant hCD38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7A</xref>). Whereas sUA or another CD38 inhibitor failed to boost intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in primed WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with NMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7B</xref>). This is likely because another NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming enzyme, PARP1, is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Minhas et al., 2019</xref>) and the NMN transporter expression is very low in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chini et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, sUA increased extracellular NMN availability in WT BMDMs but not in CD38 KO BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7C and D</xref>). The addition of recombinant hCD38 restored the suppressive effect of sUA on extracellular NMN degradation in CD38 KO BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7E</xref>). Accordingly, sUA may also increase NAD<sup>+</sup> availability by inhibiting CD38-medaited NMN degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>sUA physiologically prevents excessive inflammation by interacting with CD38</title><p>NAD<sup>+</sup> is crucial for the activity of sirtuins that limit the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Misawa et al., 2013</xref>), and cADPR may regulate calcium signaling to promote cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murakami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeidler et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, CD38 plays a key role in inflammation via NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piedra-Quintero et al., 2020</xref>). We confirmed the role of CD38 in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CD38 KO reduced IL-1Î² release driven by several inflammasome activators and the fungal component zymosan in primed BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). However, pre-incubation with sUA at physiological levels hardly suppressed inflammasome activation in primed WT BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). sUA uptake was very low in primed WT BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting a crucial role of intracellular sUA in regulating inflammasome activation in vitro. However, extracellular sUA may inhibit CD38-mediated NMN degradation to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in vivo, thus limiting excessive inflammation via sirtuins signaling. In fact, we noticed that sUA pre-incubation moderately limited IL-1Î² release in primed THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), and CD38 blockade abrogated this effect without reducing sUA uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>), which suggests CD38 as a key mediator in the immunosuppressive effect of sUA at physiological levels. Notably, sUA did not induce IL-1Î² release in primed WT BMDMs and THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).

CD38 is crucial for neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Partida-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2001</xref>), we therefore investigated the effect of sUA on MSU crystal-induced peritonitis via CD38. After 1-day sUA supplementation, plasma sUA at the minimum physiological levels of humans (OA plus inosine group) inhibited the recruitment of viable cells and neutrophils and reduced the production of IL-1Î² and IL-6 in WT mice but not in CD38 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E, G, and H</xref>), which verified the involvement of CD38 in the suppressive effect of sUA on inflammation and innate immunity. CXCL1 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) was not affected by sUA, indicating that the sUA-CD38 interaction may inhibit circulating immune cells in response to chemokines. Moreover, sUA may interfere with the interaction between CD38 and adhesion molecules such as CD31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deaglio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deaglio et al., 1998</xref>) to suppress immune cell migration. Intriguingly, intact IL-8 signaling has been reported in CD38 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Partida-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2001</xref>), and sUA at a high concentration (595 Î¼M) inhibits neutrophils in response to IL-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Whereas we did not observe decreased neutrophil recruitment by sUA in CD38 KO mice, likely because plasma sUA levels (around 120 Î¼M) in our models are insufficient to affect IL-8 signaling. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that sUA at supraphysiological levels interacts with other targets to regulate IL-8 signaling and Î²2-integrin, which requires further investigation in the future.</p><p>Inosine, an sUA precursor, may also exhibit anti-inflammatory effect by interacting with adenosine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomez and Sitkovsky, 2003</xref>). Scott et al. reported that after oral administration, serum inosine concentrations slightly increased and then rapidly returned to the initial levels in mice within 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott et al., 2002</xref>). We stimulated the mice with cLPS or MSU crystals 2 hr after the second treatment, suggesting the negligible contribution of inosine. To verify this and exclude the potential contribution of OA, we evaluated the effects of 1-day treatment of inosine or OA on inflammation in vivo. The results showed that OA or inosine alone hardly affected cLPS-induced systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5AâC</xref>) and MSU crystal-induced peritonitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5DâH</xref>), as well as plasma sUA levels and whole blood NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism under inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4EâH</xref>). Thus, these results suggested that sUA at physiological levels limits innate immunity to avoid excessive inflammation by interacting with CD38.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we unveiled CD38 as a direct physiological target for sUA and thus defined its fundamental physiological functions in the regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> availability and innate immunity, which promotes understanding of the molecular basis of sUA physiology as well as providing an important clue to explore the potential impact of abnormal sUA levels (independent of MSU crystals) on health and disease.</p><p>It has been reported that NAD<sup>+</sup> decline contributes to inflammation, aging-related dysfunction, and multiple diseases, including hearing loss, obesity, diabetes, kidney diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2019</xref>) and possibly even in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rajman et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> boosting by CD38 inhibitors has been a promising therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Escande et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peclat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">TarragÃ³ et al., 2018</xref>). We discovered a structural feature for pharmacological inhibition of CD38 based on sUA analogs such as caffeine metabolites. Indeed, sUA and its analogs have similar functions, such as antioxidant property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nishida, 1991</xref>) and neuroprotective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haberman et al., 2007</xref>), supporting that they share a functional group, 1,3-DHI-2-one, that interacts with the same targets, including but not limited to CD38. Importantly, our results support that sUA at physiological levels limits CD38 activity to maintain NAD<sup>+</sup> availability, providing the molecular basis for sUA preventing NAD<sup>+</sup> decline-associated senescence and diseases. sUA levels seem to increase with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iwama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuzuya et al., 2002</xref>), raising a possibility that sUA elevation within physiological range is a compensatory response to aging in organisms. Given that CD38 expression is relatively low in young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho-Pereira et al., 2016</xref>), aged mice would be more appropriate to test this hypothesis. The apparent K<sub>i</sub> values imply that CD38 is completely inhibited by sUA in blood or in some tissues under physiological conditions; however, this might not be the case because other endogenous substance may also regulate CD38 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dogan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hara-Yokoyama et al., 1996</xref>). In spite of this, altered sUA levels are able to indicate the changes in the activities of CD38 and other molecular targets of sUA, which partially explains the correlation between sUA homeostasis disruption and disease risk. For instance, abnormal reduction of sUA levels such as hypouricemia may result in higher CD38 activity in the circulation due to the reversible inhibitory effect of sUA, thus negatively influencing health as well as increasing the risk of certain diseases. However, it does not mean that higher sUA levels are better, because excessive elevation of sUA levels promotes the precipitation of MSU crystals. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that long-term and crystal-free hyperuricemia (&gt;420 Î¼M) in humans may overly modulate additional unknown targets, especially in CD38-negative cells, thereby partially covering the CD38-mediated physiological functions of sUA. To identify more molecular targets for sUA, drug affinity responsive target stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lomenick et al., 2009</xref>) and cellular thermal shift assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martinez Molina et al., 2013</xref>), which detect the direct interactions between binding proteins and their ligands, may serve as alternative strategies.</p><p>Another unexpected observation is the restrictive effect of sUA at physiological levels on excessive inflammation, which is complementary to several recent studies regarding the immunosuppressive effect of crystal-free hyperuricemia in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Similar to itaconate, an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hooftman et al., 2020</xref>), sUA production increases in activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ives et al., 2015</xref>). It has been reported that intracellular sUA reduction promotes certain inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ives et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kono et al., 2010</xref>), hence sUA at physiological levels may function as an endogenous regulator of inflammasomes to avoid excessive inflammation by inhibiting CD38 activity. On the other hand, chemical phase transition (crystal precipitation) is essential for sUA as a danger signal to trigger immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberts et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ives et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shi et al., 2003</xref>). We and another laboratory demonstrated that MSU crystals upregulate CD38 to promote inflammatory responses in primed macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yan, 2021</xref>). A recent study confirmed CD38 upregulation in gout patients and further validated the role of CD38 in experimental models of gouty inflammation induced by MSU crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabarse et al., 2024</xref>). Importantly, in this study, we showed that CD38 mediates the opposite effects of sUA (especially at physiological levels) and MSU crystals on inflammation and innate immunity. Therefore, a sudden and rapid reduction of the circulating sUA levels by high-dose urate-lowering medications may disrupt the immune balance by rapidly releasing CD38 activity before MSU crystal dissolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4âfigure supplement 6</xref>), resulting in the increased risk of gout attack in the initiation of therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wen et al., 2024</xref>), a well-known paradox in gout therapy. Several clinical studies even observed that blood sUA levels decrease during gout flares, and the resolution of gouty inflammation is coming with a recovery of sUA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Logan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Urano et al., 2002</xref>). Given the distinct effects of sUA and MSU crystals on certain targets, intracellular and/or extracellular microcrystals should be excluded when evaluating the pathological role of sUA at high levels in relevant studies. In addition, our findings also provide biological evidence for the neuroprotection of sUA. It has been reported that CD38 is involved in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meyer et al., 2022</xref>); thus, sUA in central nervous system tissues may directly inhibit CD38 activity to limit neuroinflammation and the progression of such diseases.</p><p>Previously, a physiological medium containing sUA was shown to inhibit UMP synthase to reshape cellular metabolism in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantor et al., 2017</xref>). We identified a unique sUA-CD38 interaction in this study, highlighting the physiologically essential role of sUA as a purine metabolite in sustaining life. Accumulated data suggests a remarkable overlap between the effects of sUA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ãlvarez-Lario and MacarrÃ³n-Vicente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ames et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cutler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kutzing and Firestein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Linnerz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wan et al., 2020</xref>) and CD38 inhibition/KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meyer et al., 2022</xref>) in counteracting excessive inflammation, aging, and certain diseases, which also strongly supports our current findings. It should be noticed that we used an exogenous compound as the background in mice to mimic the deficiency of uricase in humans, and tissue sUA levels were unchanged after sUA supplementation, suggesting some of the limitations in our models when evaluating the physiological relevance. Therefore, it is important to extend these studies to global sUA-depletion models in primates or uricase-transgenic mice. Moreover, the commercial recombinant hCD38 without a transmembrane region was partially used in this study, we cannot exclude the potential interaction between sUA and the transmembrane region of CD38, although comparable K<sub>i</sub> values were obtained in crude enzymes containing full-length CD38. In addition to identification of the allosteric sites of CD38, the crystallographic structure of the active full-length CD38-sUA complex should be captured using cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the inhibitory mechanisms in the future. However, the present study clearly demonstrated that sUA at physiological levels directly inhibits CD38 and consequently limits NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation and excessive inflammation, suggesting that sUA is crucial for the physiological defense in humans against aging and diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Importantly, the inhibition constants calculated supports the claim that sUA inhibits CD38 under physiological conditions. These findings are of extreme importance to understand the regulation of an enzyme that has been shown to be the main NAD+/NMN-degrading enzyme in mammals, which impacts several metabolic processes and has major implications to understanding aging diseases. The manuscript is well written, the figures are self explanatory, and in the experiments presented, the data is very solid. The authors discuss the main limitations of the study, especially in regard to the in vivo results.

Importantly, the inhibition constants calculated support the claim that sUA inhibits CD38 under physiological conditions. These findings are of extreme importance to understanding the regulation of an enzyme that has been shown to be the main NAD+/NMN-degrading enzyme in mammals, which impacts several metabolic processes and has major implications for understanding aging diseases. The manuscript is well written, the figures are self-explanatory, and in the experiments presented, the data is very solid. The authors discuss the main limitations of the study, especially in regard to the in vivo results. As a whole, I believe that this is a very interesting manuscript that will be appreciated by the scientific community and that opens a lot of new questions in the field of metabolism and aging. I found some issues that I believe constitute a weakness in the manuscript, and although they do not require new experiments, they may be considered by the authors for discussion in the final version of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs thoughtful comments and favorable review of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors acknowledge the existence of several previous papers involving pharmacological inhibition of CD38 and their impact on several models of metabolism and aging.

How does this group relate with previous structures that were shown to inhibit CD38 and do not have this chemical structure? Is sUA inhibiting CD38 in a different site? A crystallographic structure of CD38-78c is available in PDB that could be used to study or model these interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>Currently, there are several kinds of CD38 inhibitors, including NAD+/NMN analogs, flavonoids, 4-quinolines, etc. [Ref 1], but they do not have 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one or similar groups. We also noticed that sUA and its analogs have no remarkable structural similarity with these inhibitors. We have ever tried to identify the binding sites of sUA on CD38 by NMR. Since our NMR method required a large sample size, we had to prepare recombinant human CD38 using a cell-free protein synthesis system. However, the obtained CD38 protein showed a lower Vmax than commercial recombinant CD38 expressed in HEK293 cells, raising a concern of spatial conformation deference in the synthesized CD38. Thus, we were unable to get convinced data to confirm if sUA has different binding sites. Given the difference in structural feature and inhibition type, we did not use the PDB data regarding 78c-CD38 interaction for analysis in this study.</p><p>(1) Chini, E. N., et al. (2018).

However, all the experiments were performed in very young mice, where CD38 expression is low in most tissues (10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.006). This point should be mentioned in the discussion and maybe put in the context of variations of sUA levels during aging.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs kind suggestions. Yes, CD38 expression in young mice is relatively low and we used young mice in this study; thus, aged mice would be promising to furthest evaluate the interaction between CD38 and sUA. Regarding the changes in sUA levels during aging, previous reports indicate that sUA levels seem to increase with age in mice and humans [Ref 1, 2]. We speculate that this increase is a physiologically compensatory response to aging in organisms. Accordingly, we added more details in the discussion (second paragraph).</p><p>(1) Iwama, M., et al.

Unfortunately, the study still lacks data to support this model, as they could not replicate their in vivo findings using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, a standard model to assess inflammasome activation. Without an alternative approach, the study lacks data to establish in vitro that sUA inhibition of CD38 reduces inflammasome activation in macrophages - consequently, they cannot determine yet if both NAD+ accumulation and sirtuin activity in macrophages is a mechanism leading to sUA role in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply thank the reviewer for pointing out this weakness in our work. In fact, we tried to prepare stable CD38 KD/KO THP-1 cells in the middle of 2021; however, we faced some technical problems due to the limitations of instruments. Thus, we used CD38 KO mice to prepare CD38 KO BMDMs, as shown in the first version of manuscript, we failed to replicate the results in BMDMs because of the low uptake of sUA. To address the reviewerâs concern regarding the lack of an in vitro link between CD38 and sUA immunosuppression, we used 78c, a highly specific and potent inhibitor of CD38, to block CD38 in primed THP-1 cells. Then we evaluated the effect of sUA pre-incubation on MSU crystal-induced IL-1Î² release in primed THP-1 cells (vehicle and CD38 blockade). The added results in Figure 4-figure supplement 2B and 2C indicated that CD38 blockade largely impaired the immunosuppressive effect of sUA without reducing sUA uptake. In addition, we found that sUA at physiological levels boosted NAD+ levels in THP-1 cells (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B) without affecting the activities of other key enzymes involved in NAD+ synthesis and degradation, including NAMPT and PARP (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). All these results supported that CD38 is a key mediator for sUA at physiological levels to regulate inflammasome activation in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors propose that soluble Uric acid (sUA) is an enzymatic inhibitor of the NADase CD38 and that it controls levels of NAD modulating inflammatory response.

Analysis of multiple tissues is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is necessary to confirm if sUA affects other NAD+-consuming and synthesizing enzymes. To address the concern and to provide additional validation, we tested the direct effects of sUA and other purine derivates on the activities of another two key enzymes involved in the metabolic network of NAD+, including PARP (NAD+-consuming enzyme) and NAMPT (NAD+-synthesizing enzyme). The added results in Figure 3-figure supplement 2 showed that sUA has no effect on PARP and NAMPT activity, suggesting that CD38 is a main target for sUA in regulating NAD+ availability. In addition, we also confirmed both PARP and NAMPT were not affected by purine metabolism under physiological conditions. Although hypoxanthine and xanthine, at 500 Î¼M (supraphysiological levels), slightly inhibited PARP activity, it has no physiological significance due to their low physiological concentrations (generally below 20 Î¼M). Further evaluation of these inhibitory effects under pathological conditions would be of interest but were beyond the focus of this study.</p><p>Given that tissue sUA uptake is saturated under physiological conditions (tissue sUA did not increase in our models, Figure 3-figure supplement 5A and 5B), CD38 and other potential targets in tissues may be not affected by sUA in our models. We used CD38 KO mice to confirm if sUA interacts with other targets to regulate NAD+ degradation and inflammatory responses. A previous study [Ref 1] revealed that inhibition of other enzymes involved in NAD+ metabolism, such as PARP, resulted in a significant increase of NAD+ availability in CD38 KO mice, which indicates that CD38 KO mice can be used to exclude the potential interaction between sUA and other targets. In fact, we did not observe significant effects of sUA in CD38 KO mice. More importantly, we added the additional validation regarding PARP and NAMPT activity according to the reviewerâs kind suggestion, which further confirmed that CD38 is the main target for sUA in our models.</p><p>(1) TarragÃ³, M.

Yes, sUA depletion model is ideal for further validation, as we discussed in the limitations of this study. Given that introduction of exogenous recombinant uricase (immunometabolism may be affected) to deplete sUA is not ideal for the evaluation under physiological conditions, uricase-transgenic mice would be a promising model. However, now we have no uricase-transgenic mice, and we are unable to prepare CD38 KO/uricase-transgenic mice for additional validation within a reasonable time. In the first version of manuscript, therefore, we used an sUA-release model in sUA-supplementation mice as a further validation in Figure 3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Flux studies would also be necessary to make the conclusion stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>Answer: We highly appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion regarding metabolic flux analysis. Yes, flux analysis using specifically designed isotope-labeled NAD+ is an ideal validation in mice, as it can track any sUA-induced changes in NAD+ metabolism. However, we are unable to synthesize or obtain suitable isotope-labeled substrates for in vivo validation due to the technical limitations and financial burdens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The manuscript is very solid and very well-presented and discussed. In my opinion, the only weakness in the writing is that the message about finding an endogenous regulator of CD38 activity and NAD levels gets blurred by the temptation of jumping into the potential of developing new pharmacological CD38 inhibitors based on sUA structure. My recommendation would be to focus on delivering a clear message about sUA as a physiological inhibitor of CD38, and the possible implications for understanding the onset and evolution of metabolic diseases and aging. Maybe leave the potential of developing novel sUA-based CD38 inhibitors for a final comment. I understand this last point is very attractive, but there are very potent pharmacological CD38 inhibitors already available with promising results.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs valuable suggestions. Yes, there are some promising CD38 inhibitors with nanomolar Ki such as 78c. To clearly focus on sUA as a physiological inhibitor of CD38, we simplified the description in the manuscript and just keep the discussion of functional group. Since the data regarding the development of CD38 inhibitors in our manuscript remain limited, we did not put it in a separate part. We believe the simplified information is still sufficient for medicinal chemists who are interested in the development of CD38 inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) The authors present several pieces of data to explain why there is no impact of sUA in inflammasome-mediated cytokine secretion, which is convincing and supports that BMDM will not be a model of choice to establish macrophages as the target of sUA. However, their data with THP-1 cells is compelling and could be further explored using shRNA, or CRISPR approaches to deplete CD38, thus establishing a mechanistic link in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs thoughtful comments. We added more results as mentioned before (please see our response to public review).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is a severe lack of linearity in how the figures are presented in the main text, making it difficult to read through the manuscript. The figures should be presented in the order they appear in the panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We improved the figure assembly according to eLife guidelines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) The authors do not appropriately address the finding that CD38 impacts the secretion of IL-1b in BMDM (Figure S6B) and in vivo (Figure 4), possibly independently of sUA.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the regulatory effect of CD38 on cytokine release seems independent of sUA. In fact, we used CD38 KO BMDMs to validate the role of CD38 in the inflammasome activation. We showed that sUA levels are comparable between WT and KO mice, suggesting that CD38 KO does not affect the baselines and boosted levels of sUA in our models. In this situation, we were able to evaluate the immunosuppressive effects of sUA at the same physiological levels in WT and CD38 KO mice, thus providing evidence to support that sUA at physiological levels limits excessive inflammation via CD38.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3F: the legend on the x-axis lacks the indication of which groups were treated with recombinant hCD38.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments. We improved Figure 3 by adding more information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the results on panels 3 and 4 provide robust evidence that sUA is anti-inflammatory through CD38, the title of the figures extrapolates their findings (i.e., no data shows CD38-sUA, either in vitro or in vivo).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs kind suggestion. We provided data to support the direct interaction between CD38 and sUA in Figure 3F; we admitted that we did not show the data regarding the direct interaction in mice in Figure 4. To help readers easily track the results, however, we used a conclusion-like title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The introduction could briefly mention NMN and CD38 activity as an ecto-enzyme to facilitate the understanding of their findings by a general audience, especially the dosing of NMN and their data on BMDM.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more description regarding CD38 and NMN in the introduction part.
