endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it inhibits cholesterol synthesis by blocking activation of SREBPs. This feedback protects against cholesterol overaccumulation in the plasma membrane (PM). But how does ER know whether PM is saturated with cholesterol? In this study, we define three pools of PM cholesterol: (1) a pool accessible to bind <sup>125</sup>I-PFO*, a mutant form of bacterial Perfringolysin O, which binds cholesterol in membranes; (2) a sphingomyelin(SM)-sequestered pool that binds <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* only after SM is destroyed by sphingomyelinase; and (3) a residual pool that does not bind <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* even after sphingomyelinase treatment. When LDL-derived cholesterol leaves lysosomes, it expands PM's PFO-accessible pool and, after a short lag, it also increases the ER's PFO-accessible regulatory pool. This regulatory mechanism allows cells to ensure optimal cholesterol levels in PM while avoiding cholesterol overaccumulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02882.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02882.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02882.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane that is made of lipid molecules and proteins. Almost half of the lipid molecules in the plasma membranes of animal cells (including human cells) are cholesterol molecules. Since cholesterol helps to keep the membrane stable, its level in the plasma membrane is tightly regulated.</p><p>Cholesterol is produced within animal cells, but it can also be taken up from outside the cell, primarily from low density lipoprotein (or LDL for short). When ingested LDL is broken down inside a cell, most of the cholesterol molecules are added to the plasma membrane, but some end up in the membrane of an organelle inside the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>The amount of cholesterol in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum regulates the activation of a protein called SREBP, a transcription factor that is attached to this membrane. If the level of cholesterol becomes too low, this transcription factor travels to the cell nucleus, where it switches on the genes that cause the cell to produce more cholesterol and also to take up more LDL from the environment.</p><p>When the amount of cholesterol in the membrane is high enough, the SREBP protein remains attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, which reduces the production of cholesterol and the uptake of LDL.</p><p>Here, Das et al. study the movement of cholesterol molecules between the plasma membrane and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum by using a toxin that binds to membranes that are rich in cholesterol. These experiments showed that the plasma membrane contains three different types or ‘pools’ of cholesterol. Das et al. found that only one of these pools is ‘labile’: it grows when there is an excess of LDL, and shrinks when cholesterol is running low in the cell. Furthermore, excess cholesterol is first added to this labile pool in the plasma membrane before it is added to the pool in the endoplasmic reticulum. This suggests that the production, uptake, and breakdown of cholesterol are all controlled by partitioning this molecule between the labile pool in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>The next challenge is to determine how the three pools of cholesterol in the plasma membrane are maintained, and what regulates the distribution of cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum and the labile pool in the plasma membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02882.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02882.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>SV-589 human fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>sphingomyelin</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>cholesterol–phospholipid complexes</kwd><kwd>Perfringolysin O</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL20948-37</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1793</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12SDG12040267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Precise control of cellular cholesterol levels is achieved by organization of cholesterol into three distinct pools in the plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal cells tightly control the level of cholesterol in their plasma membranes (PMs). Control is mediated by SREBP-2, a membrane bound protein that activates transcription of genes encoding most, if not all, enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espenshade and Hughes, 2007</xref>). SREBP-2 is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes where it binds to an escort protein called Scap. When ER cholesterol is less than ∼5 mole% of total ER lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>), the Scap/SREBP-2 complex enters COPII-coated vesicles that move to the Golgi, where two proteases liberate the active fragment of SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). The active fragment enters the nucleus where it activates transcription of the cholesterol-synthesizing genes and also the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which supplies the cell with exogenous cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>).</p><p>When cholesterol-depleted cells are incubated with cholesterol-carrying LDL, the lipoprotein binds to its receptor, enters the cell through endocytosis in clathrin-coated vesicles and reaches lysosomes where its cholesterol is liberated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</xref>). The lysosome-derived cholesterol is delivered to the PM and the ER membrane. When the ER cholesterol rises above a sharp threshold of 5 mole% of total ER lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>), the Scap/SREBP complex binds to an ER anchor protein called Insig, and this prevents its transport to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). As a result, cholesterol synthesis and uptake from LDL are reduced. If excess cholesterol accumulates, it is removed from the PM and delivered to the ER where it is esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) for storage as cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</xref>).</p><p>The above studies expose a potential paradox. The Scap/SREBP system functions to regulate the concentration of cholesterol in the PM where the vast majority (60–90%) of a cell's total cholesterol is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Duve, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 1989</xref>). Within PMs, cholesterol accounts for 40–50% of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ray et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, the cholesterol sensor for the Scap/SREBP system is located not in the PM, but in the ER, which contains only ∼1% of a cell's total cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lange and Steck, 1997</xref>). Within the ER, cholesterol accounts for no more than 5% of total membrane lipids. How does the small ER cholesterol pool monitor the cholesterol concentration in the large PM pool? The current paper suggests a possible resolution of this paradox.</p><p>The key to the proposed solution lies in the paths by which cholesterol moves from lysosome to the PM and to the ER. Before the current understanding of SREBP was obtained, it was suggested that LDL-derived cholesterol moves from lysosomes to the PM, and after the capacity of the PM is saturated, then secondarily to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu and Tabas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lange et al., 1997</xref>). Others proposed a different route whereby cholesterol moves directly from lysosomes to the ER without involving the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neufeld et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Underwood et al., 1998</xref>). Studies supporting either route rely on indirect approaches to monitor the arrival of LDL-derived cholesterol at the PM and at the ER. In all studies, arrival of cholesterol at the ER was monitored by measuring the formation of cholesteryl esters mediated by ACAT, a resident ER membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 1995</xref>). On the other hand, arrival of LDL-derived cholesterol at the PM was monitored using four different methods: (1) treatment of intact cells with cholesterol oxidase, a soluble cholesterol-modifying enzyme that converts cholesterol to cholestenone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lange et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Underwood et al., 1998</xref>); (2) treatment of intact cells with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), a soluble acceptor that extracts cholesterol from membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neufeld et al., 1996</xref>); (3) treatment of intact cells with amphotericin B, a polyene antibiotic that forms pores in cholesterol-rich membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Underwood et al., 1998</xref>); and (4) lipid extraction of unfractionated whole cells, followed by thin layer chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu and Tabas, 1991</xref>). None of the aforementioned approaches directly measured the concentration of cholesterol in purified PMs.</p><p>Once LDL-derived cholesterol arrives at the PM or ER, the manner in which it is organized within each membrane also remains controversial. In particular, the distribution of cholesterol in the PM has been studied intensely. The idea that cholesterol forms complexes with PM phospholipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) in membranes has a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finean, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2005</xref>). It is possible that these complexes exist in the PM of living cells. Under the right conditions, they could coalese to form higher-order structures, such as the proposed lipid raft domains that are enriched in cholesterol and SM and are involved in cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Rose, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>). However, the size and lifetime of these lipid rafts remain hotly debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edidin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gowrishankar et al., 2012</xref>). Whatever the underlying organization of cholesterol in the PM may be, reducing the SM content of PM by treatment with sphingomyelinase (SMase) causes a portion of PM cholesterol to move to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Slotte and Bierman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scheek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We recently described a probe that measures an accessible pool of cholesterol in the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2013</xref>). This probe, designated <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup>, is an <sup>125</sup>I-labeled, mutant version of Perfringolysin O, a bacterial protein toxin that binds to cholesterol-rich membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flanagan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2013</xref>). <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> retains the ability to bind cholesterol, but (unlike the native version, PFO) it no longer forms pores at 4°C. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2013</xref>). We showed that cholesterol in PMs is not accessible to <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* until the cholesterol concentration exceeds a threshold of ∼35 mole% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2013</xref>), which is considerably higher than the 5 mole% threshold for PFO binding to purified ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). Below these thresholds, PM and ER cholesterol are inaccessible to PFO.</p><p>In the current paper, we use <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* binding to define three pools of cholesterol in the PM. The first pool is the ‘PFO-accessible pool’ that binds <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* when the membrane is in its native cholesterol-replete state. This pool is labile, and it is depleted selectively when cells are deprived of cholesterol. The second pool binds <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* only after SM in the PM is destroyed by SMase. This pool, which is not depleted by cholesterol deprivation, is referred to as the ‘SM-sequestered pool’. The remaining cholesterol exists as a third pool and does not bind <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* even after SMase treatment. We name this third pool the ‘essential pool’ because depletion of this pool causes cells to round up and dissociate from the petri dish. After LDL-cholesterol is liberated in lysosomes, it is transported out of lysosomes and expands the PM's PFO-accessible pool. After a short lag, it also increases the ER's PFO-accessible regulatory pool. These data indicate how one pool of cholesterol in the PM can regulate overall cholesterol homeostasis in animal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transport of LDL-derived cholesterol in fibroblasts: from lysosome to plasma membrane and ER</title><p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref> were designed to determine the time course of delivery of LDL-derived cholesterol to the ER as compared with the PM. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we used <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding to monitor delivery to the PM, and we used ACAT-mediated cholesterol esterification as an indirect monitor of cholesterol delivery to the ER. Human SV-589 fibroblasts were depleted of cholesterol by incubation in lipoprotein-deficient serum plus the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor compactin. We then added varying amounts of LDL together with [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate. After the incubation, one set of cells was harvested for measurement of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate. The other set was chilled to 4°C and used to measure <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, when LDL was added at 50 μg protein/ml, the amount of <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding increased within 1 hr and continued to increase for 6 hr. In contrast, we detected no synthesis of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate until after 2 hr. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, we fixed the incubation time at 4 hr and varied the LDL concentration. LDL at 3 μg protein/ml clearly increased the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> without significantly increasing cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formation, which increased only when the LDL concentration was at least 10 μg protein/ml. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> plots cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formation vs <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A,B</xref>. Irrespective of whether the incubation time or LDL concentration was varied, cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formation did not increase until PM <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding rose above 3 μg/mg protein. These data raise the possibility that LDL-derived cholesterol must first expand a pool of cholesterol in the PM before it is delivered to the ER in sufficient amounts to undergo esterification by ACAT.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02882.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Movement of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes to cell surface and to ER in human fibroblasts.</title><p>On day 0, SV-589 cells were set up in medium A at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per 60-mm dish.

In order to have a more direct measurement of the cholesterol content of ER and PMs, we isolated pure ER membranes and pure PMs using previously described techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2013</xref>). We then estimated the accessibility of cholesterol in both the membranes by measurement of the polymerization of native PFO, which forms SDS-resistant oligomers upon binding to membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). In the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we first depleted cells of cholesterol and then added LDL. After varying times, one set of cells was harvested for purification of PMs, and a duplicate set was harvested for purification of ER membranes. The purified membranes were incubated with His-tagged PFO, after which the protein was solubilized with SDS-containing buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. SDS-resistant PFO oligomers were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. When PMs were studied, oligomers of PFO reached a half-maximal value after 30 min (top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interaction of PFO with ER membranes was markedly different. At time periods up to 1 hr after LDL addition, PFO migrated as a monomer (bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). At 1.5 hr, the oligomer abruptly appeared, and it did not increase further with time. These results are similar to those obtained when ER cholesterol was monitored by [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The time-lag of 1 hr between PFO binding to PM vs ER membranes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> does not necessarily mean that cholesterol levels in ER do not increase during this period—only that cholesterol levels have not increased past the 5 mole% threshold level for PFO binding to ER membranes. The absence of an initial lag for the PM indicates that PM cholesterol rapidly surpassed the 35 mole% threshold level for PFO binding to PM. Despite several efforts, we have been unable to measure directly the kinetics of arrival of LDL-derived cholesterol at PM and ER, owing to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of purified ER membranes that allow accurate and reproducible measurements of the mass of newly arrived cholesterol. Nonetheless, the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref> suggest that LDL-derived cholesterol expands a pool of PM cholesterol before raising ER cholesterol by sufficient amounts to undergo esterification by ACAT or be bound by <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sphingomyelin sequesters a pool of cholesterol in the plasma membrane</title><p>The estimation of membrane cholesterol by the PFO oligomerization assay is non-linear and reflects the threshold nature of PFO binding to cholesterol-containing membranes.

These data show that compactin reduced PM cholesterol from 43% to 27 mole% of PM lipids (blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), with a corresponding decrease in <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* binding by 12 µg/mg protein (blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using this result, we can derive an approximate relationship between <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* binding and the magnitude of the PFO-accessible pool: 1 µg/mg protein of <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* binding corresponds to 1.3 mole% of PM cholesterol that is PFO-accessible.

Considered together, these data indicate that when PM cholesterol was reduced to 27 mole% of PM lipids, little of the residual cholesterol was accessible to PFO, but 2/3 of this residual pool (18 mole%) was made accessible by SMase treatment. The remaining 1/3 of the residual pool (9 mole%) was inaccessible to PFO even after SMase treatment.

In contrast, the content of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate was low at 15 min, and it rose progressively throughout the rest of the incubation. These data indicate that SM depletion first releases cholesterol into a PFO-accessible pool, and then the excess cholesterol is transported to the ER. The absolute amount of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formed at 2 hr (0.38 nmol/mg) was much less than we generally observed when LDL is added (for example, 7 nmol/mg per hr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

How does a transcription factor residing in the cholesterol-poor ER membrane regulate the cholesterol content of the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane (PM)? Here, we show how the controlled distribution of LDL-derived cholesterol to PM and ER accomplishes this regulatory task. As long as the newly expanding LDL-derived and PFO-accessible PM cholesterol pool remains low, little cholesterol moves to the ER, SREBPs are transported to the Golgi for processing, and the cell acquires cholesterol from endogenous synthesis and uptake of LDL. As this PM pool expands, more cholesterol moves to the ER. Once this ER cholesterol surpasses a 5 mole% threshold, it blocks SREBP transport, reducing the cellular accumulation of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). In the ER, excess cholesterol is esterified for storage as cholesteryl esters, further preventing the accumulation of excess cholesterol in the PM.</p><p>Our analysis of the current results suggests that the PM contains three pools of cholesterol, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. One pool is accessible to <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* binding (shown in green). In LDL-treated cells, the PFO-accessible pool accounts for 16% of PM lipids. The second pool, shown in red, is inaccessible to <sup>125</sup>I-PFO, but becomes accessible when cells are treated with SMase. The size of this SM-sequestered pool, as determined from five independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6 fig8">Figures 3–6, 8</xref>), ranges from 10 to 23% of total PM lipids, with a mean of 15%. The third pool, shown in purple, is termed the ‘essential pool’. This pool was also determined from the aforementioned five experiments; it accounts for 12% of PM lipids and is not accessible to <sup>125</sup>I-PFO*, even after SMase treatment. We call it ‘essential’ because reducing this pool with a high concentration of HPCD (&gt;2%) causes cells to round up and dissociate from the petri dish, which indicates that this pool is essential for PM integrity. Although all of the results in the current study were done with human fibroblasts, we also found that the PM of CHO cells contains three pools of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whether these findings apply to other cell types grown under various conditions needs to be tested in future studies.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02882.013</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram illustrating the three pools of cholesterol in the PM of human fibroblasts under different conditions.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02882.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02882.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02882-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><p>When cells are depleted of sterols by treatment with compactin in lipoprotein-deficient serum, the PFO-accessible pool becomes depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Even though the other two pools of cholesterol remain in compactin-treated cells, there is no transport to the ER and no cholesterol esterification. When sterol-depleted cells are treated with SMase, the SM-sequestered pool is released, and the liberated cholesterol becomes accessible for <sup>125</sup>I-PFO binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), restoring the PFO-accessible pool. Under these conditions even without the addition of LDL, a small amount of cholesterol is transported from PM to ER where it is esterified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>The accessibility of only a portion of PM cholesterol to PFO is consistent with earlier work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lange et al. (1980)</xref>, who showed that only a portion of PM cholesterol is susceptible to the enzyme cholesterol oxidase. It seems likely that both PFO and cholesterol oxidase recognize the same pool of accessible cholesterol in the PM. While our work does not reveal the molecular basis of cholesterol accessibility, it is worth noting that studies on model lipid membranes have suggested a thermodynamic basis for this pool of accessible cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lange et al., 2013</xref>). According to these studies, at low concentrations of cholesterol, most of the cholesterol is tied up in complexes with phospholipids and would not be accessible to soluble proteins such as PFO or cholesterol oxidase. At higher concentrations of cholesterol, the bilayer phospholipids become limiting, and a pool of cholesterol emerges that is not tied up in complexes with phospholipids. It is this ‘free’ cholesterol that is accessible to PFO (or cholesterol oxidase). The free cholesterol concentration is related to thermodynamic quantities termed chemical activity or fugacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The portion of PM cholesterol that is inaccessible to extracellularly added PFO could theoretically be sequestered either in the extracellular or in the cytoplasmic PM leaflets by membrane phospholipids. This PFO-inaccessible pool is subdivided into the SM-sequestered pool and the essential pool. Loss of SM upon SMase treatment increases the chemical activity of cholesterol in the outer leaflet of the PM and expands the pool of PFO-accessible cholesterol. Some of this accessible cholesterol could be transferred to the inner leaflet of the PM by cholesterol flip-flop, but there is no mechanism in the PM to convert this excess cholesterol into an inert form as ACAT does in the ER membrane. Instead, the excess PM cholesterol is transported to the ER membrane by vesicular or non-vesicular pathways to shut down SREBP processing and to be converted into cholesteryl esters by ACAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scheek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009</xref>). The physical nature of the SM-sequestered pool of cholesterol is not known, although a model of cholesterol-SM complexes is plausible based on studies in model membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lönnfors et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lange et al., 2013</xref>). The idea of complexes of cholesterol and phospholipids is not new: more than 60 years ago, an X-ray diffraction study of nerve fibers suggested a 1:1 complex between cholesterol and phospholipid as the structural basis of the myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finean, 1953</xref>). Higher-order structures such as the proposed lipid raft domains rich in SM and cholesterol provide an additional mechanism for cholesterol sequestration.</p><p>The existence of an essential pool of PM cholesterol is inferred from the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in which PM cholesterol was depleted by incubation of the cells with varying concentrations of HPCD. At the highest HPCD concentration tested (2%), the PFO-accessible pool was totally depleted, and the SM-sequestered pool was reduced by 80% (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). At this point, PM cholesterol was reduced from the control value of 45–22% of total PM lipids. Despite this severe reduction in PM cholesterol, the cells appeared normal by phase contrast light microscopy. When we increased the HPCD concentration above 2%, the morphology of the cells was drastically altered. The cells rounded up and many of them dissociated from the petri dish. Thus, the PM cholesterol that is retained at 2% HPCD is essential for normal PM morphology. Inasmuch as most of this residual cholesterol is neither PFO-accessible nor SM-sequestered, we term it the essential pool. The physical nature of this pool is unknown, and it may well represent multiple subpools of cholesterol in complex with PM phospholipids other than SM. The further delineation of the molecular nature of all three pools of PM cholesterol in fibroblasts and other cell types is a challenge for future membrane structural biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>We obtained [1-<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid (55 mCi/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO; paraformaldehyde from Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA; <italic>S. aureus</italic> SMase from Sigma, St. Louis, MO; and monoclonal anti-His antibody from GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA.
