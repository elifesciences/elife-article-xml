important phenotypes. We have developed a rapid, scalable system for assessing the role of candidate genes using zebrafish. We generated transgenic zebrafish in which Cas9 was knocked in to the endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> locus, a master transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage. The main advantage of this system compared to existing techniques is maintenance of endogenous regulatory elements. We used this system to identify both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous regulators of normal melanocyte development. We then applied this to the melanoma setting to demonstrate that loss of genes required for melanocyte survival can paradoxically promote more aggressive phenotypes, highlighting that in vitro screens can mask in vivo phenotypes. Our genetic approach offers a versatile tool for exploring developmental processes and disease mechanisms that can readily be applied to other cell lineages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas9</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>melanocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019346</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005190</institution-id><institution>Melanoma Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018962</institution-id><institution>Debra and Leon Black Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA229215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA238317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2CA186572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014599</institution-id><institution>Mark Foundation For Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017458</institution-id><institution>Alan and Sandra Gerry Metastasis and Tumor Ecosystems Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005976</institution-id><institution>Harry J.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-type-specific knockout of genes is crucial for unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying cell function, development, and transformation. Efficient methods are critical as sequencing projects such as All of Us, the UK Biobank, and the Cancer DepMap continue to identify hundreds of new candidate genes on a regular basis, many of which have yet to be characterized in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayer and Huser, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>). Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) have emerged as a powerful genetic model organism for studying these processes. The large number of animals that can be easily generated makes it advantageous (compared to other systems like mice) for querying large numbers of genetic variants that may have links to human diseases. However, most studies in this system use germline knockout, which makes it difficult to determine whether the identified gene has a specific function in a particular lineage, or whether the phenotype reflects a more general developmental defect. Furthermore, many genes that might have lineage-specific functions cannot be studied using germline knockout, since embryonic lethality often accompanies global knockout of essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amsterdam et al., 2004</xref>). To overcome these limitations, several groups have explored tissue-specific and conditional knockout strategies in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grajevskaja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalvaitytė and Balciunas, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh Angom et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shin et al., 2023</xref>). For example, the MAZERATI system uses tissue-specific promoter transgenes to drive Cas9 expression, which are introduced via plasmid injection into one-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablain et al., 2021</xref>). This system has been shown to be versatile and powerful. One potential limitation of promoter fragment transgenes is that these fragments could lack certain regulatory regions. For this reason, it is common in systems such as mice to knock in genetic cassettes (i.e. Cre recombinase) into endogenous loci.</p><p>In this study, we wished to develop such an endogenous system to understand in vivo genetic dependencies, using melanocytes and melanoma as an exemplar. Skin color pigmentation is among the most heterogeneous of genetic systems, with a large number of loci linked to melanocyte development. Mutations in pleiotropic genes such as <italic>sox10, ednrb, jam3b, tuba8l3, meox1,</italic> and <italic>kit</italic> yield clear defects in melanocyte/melanophore development, but these mutants also have defects in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parichy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eom et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parichy and Turner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irion et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parichy et al., 1999</xref>). Many of these genes are also expressed in melanoma, but their specific in vivo function in tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. By integrating the Cas9 nuclease into the endogenous melanocyte-specific <italic>mitfa</italic> locus, we achieved specific gene disruption across the melanocyte developmental lineage. We used our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> knock-in animals to inactivate the pigmentation gene <italic>albino</italic> and the embryonic essential genes <italic>sox10, tuba1a,</italic> and <italic>ptena/b</italic> in melanocytes without additional developmental or off-target phenotypes.

GWAS-like efforts such as the UK Biobank and the US All of Us programs have identified thousands of germline variants (SNPs) that may be linked to interesting phenotype variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayer and Huser, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>). A conceptually similar approach is also happening in diseases such as cancer, in which efforts such as the TCGA, ICGC, and DepMap have continued to unveil new potential somatic variants (SNVs) linked to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Across these efforts, in both development and disease, the large number of candidate variants makes it challenging to connect these genotypes to phenotypes. This is especially acute in melanoma, where the large number of somatic variants generated by UV radiation leads to a high number of background mutations that may or may not have pathogenic function. Thus, there is a substantial need for in vivo models that allow for rapid and efficient modeling of candidate genes.</p><p>Prior work in the zebrafish has shown that promoter fragments driving Cas9 can provide efficient and scalable approaches to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablain et al., 2021</xref>). For example, MAZERATI has been nicely applied to melanoma models to study genetic dependencies in the melanocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablain et al., 2021</xref>). The technology we describe in this work largely builds off the logic of this and related systems. One difference between our <italic>mitfa</italic>-Cas9 knock-in line compared to MAZERATI is that it maintains the endogenous regulatory elements needed for control of the <italic>mitfa</italic> gene. We do not yet fully know when or if this difference would be important, but given the complex role of MITF transcription as a ‘rheostat’ in melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoek and Goding, 2010</xref>), it is reasonable to assume these endogenous elements could become important in some circumstances. Because in our study we did not directly compare the <italic>mitfa</italic>-Cas9 knock-in approach versus MAZERATI, we cannot make direct statements about which is more efficient. However, because both techniques reliably result in melanoma, each researcher will be able to choose the technology that is most appropriate for their biological question.</p><p>One advantage of Cas9 approaches in this system is the ability to screen phenotypes in both the F0 generation (as mosaics) and the F1 generation (3 months later). Although the F0 phenotypes we observe are indeed subtle, they are still quantifiable. This enables rapid screening of candidate genes for melanocyte-specific functions. Promising hits can then be more specifically validated in the F1 generation, which is particularly advantageous for efficiently generating biallelic knockouts, especially for genes with recessive phenotypes like <italic>albino</italic>. On a per-gene basis, this saves well over 3 months of work compared to germline recessive knockouts and eliminates the issue of inbreeding, promoting healthier genetic lines and facilitating the potential for outcrossing with any available fish line. Because we demonstrate that Cas9 is completely restricted to the melanocyte lineage, with no detectable off-target expression, this easily allows us to discern the melanocyte-specific effect of pleiotropic genes very efficiently.</p><p>One interesting observation of our melanoma studies is evidence that loss of melanoma genetic dependencies like <italic>SOX10</italic> (as suggested by the human DepMap data) can still lead to a small number of tumors, albeit with seemingly different biological behaviors. In the human samples we analyzed, loss of <italic>SOX10</italic> leads to acquisition of a <italic>SOX9</italic><sup>hi</sup> state instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, in our ‘escaper’ fish, we do see an increase in SOX9 expression in two out of three fish, which would be consistent with the human data. <italic>SOX9</italic> is increasingly recognized to be a potent mediator of tumor cell invasiveness, so it is possible this could explain the somewhat more mesenchymal/invasive appearance of these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). This phenomenon clearly needs further study in future work, where the effect could be better quantified in a larger cohort and the relevant mechanism identified. But if this SOX10 to SOX9 switch holds up, one implication of this finding is that clinical targeting of transcription factors like <italic>SOX10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takahashi et al., 2024</xref>) – long considered an ideal therapeutic approach – could lead to unexpected outcomes, in which tumors might proliferate less but become more invasive or resistant to therapy. Whether this phenomenon of <italic>SOX10/SOX9</italic> switching is a general phenomenon, or specific to that class of TFs, remains to be determined. However, a similar phenomenon has been observed for <italic>MITF</italic>, another melanocytic TF, suggesting this idea of TF switching needs to be more thoroughly explored in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hossain and Eccles, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Travnickova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, while our studies clearly focused on the melanocyte lineage, highly similar approaches could be taken for virtually any cellular lineage in which master regulators or markers are known. Given the large number of already identified promoter/enhancer fragments in the zebrafish, this would be an important extension of our system to study gene variants in the context of development and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weiss et al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>Our approach has several limitations that may need to be addressed in future studies. Due to the constitutive nature of the Cas9, we have little control over the timing of its expression. Because it is knocked into the endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> locus, the expression of Cas9 will vary with the endogenous regulation of that gene. This may lead to somewhat paradoxical and unexpected results. For example, germline deletion of <italic>sox10</italic> results in the colorless phenotype, which is an animal completely devoid of melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutton et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, when we knock out <italic>sox10</italic> specifically in the <italic>mitfa</italic>+ cells with our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> system, we see a much more subtle phenotype, and not all melanocytes are lost. We speculate this could be due to timing: the germline allele will already have loss of <italic>sox10</italic> function very early in the development of the melanocyte lineage (i.e. at the neural crest stage), whereas our knock-in approach will inactivate <italic>sox10</italic> much later in development after melanocyte specification has already occurred. This could reflect different downstream targets of <italic>sox10</italic> in these two scenarios. In future iterations of this general approach, swapping the Cas9 for an inducible version would allow for better-timed knockout of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Because <italic>mitfa</italic> itself is expressed in melanoblasts, melanophores, and xanthophores during different stages of development, choosing a promoter (e.g. PMEL) that is more tightly restricted to melanocytes may be advantageous. Another limitation is that our fish will result in a single functional copy of <italic>mitfa</italic>. While this does not result in any obvious phenotype (i.e. the melanocytes are normal) and this gene is not currently known to exhibit haploinsufficiency, it is possible that under certain circumstances, the loss of one copy of <italic>mitfa</italic> could have unintended phenotypes. For example, in the tumor setting, having only one copy of <italic>mitfa</italic> could theoretically reduce tumor incidence since it can act as an oncogene in some situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garraway et al., 2005</xref>). This possibility of haploinsufficiency will need to be further explored in the future. Finally, although our system was relatively efficient, we still did not see 100% knockout. This may reflect that it is relatively easy to bypass the CRISPR lesion in an exon with an in-frame mutation. The use of multiple gRNAs, or gRNAs that target promoter regions, rather than exons, could further augment efficiency of knockout. Alternatively, instead of targeting DNA, we could consider using RNA-targeting CRISPR enzymes. Recent work has shown that RNA degradation induced by Cas13 works in zebrafish and may allow for more nuanced knockdown rather than knockout of a given candidate gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kushawah et al., 2020</xref>). This may especially have advantages in the context of melanoma, where genes are commonly dysregulated rather than completely knocked out. We envision it would be relatively straightforward to knock Cas13 into the locus of interest using an analogous approach to the one we have taken here.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Plasmids, fish lines, and other materials generated from this study are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Zebrafish husbandry and ethics statement</title><p>All zebrafish experiments adhered to institutional animal protocols and were conducted in compliance with approved procedures.

The authors use multiple candidate genes - albino, sox10, tuba1a, ptena/ptenb, tp53 - to demonstrate that their system induces lineage-restricted gene editing.

There is a slight concern that tumor onset with this system is hindered by the heterozygous state it imparts to the lineage master regulator (here, mitfa).

For this method, the authors knock-in a Cas9 encoding sequence into the mitfa locus. This mitfaCas9 line has restricted Cas9 expression, allowing the authors to generate melanocyte-specific knockouts rapidly by follow-up injection of sgRNA expressing transposon vectors.</p><p>The paper presents some interesting vignettes to illustrate the utility of their approach. These include (1) a derivation of albino mutant fish as a demonstration of the method's efficiency, (2) an interrogation and novel description of tuba1a/tuba1c as a potential non-autonomous contributor to melanosome dispersion, and (3) the generation of sox10 deficient melanoma tumors that show &quot;escape&quot; of sox10 loss through upregulation of sox9. The latter two examples highlight the usefulness of cell-type targeted knockouts (Body-wide sox10 and tuba1a loss elicit developmental defects). Additionally, the tumor models involve highly multiplexed sgRNAs for tumor initiation which is nicely facilitated by the stable Cas9.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The approach is clever and could prove very useful for studying melanocytes and other cell types. As the authors hint at in their discussion, this approach would become even more powerful with the generation of other Cas9-restricted lineages so a single sgRNA construct can be screened across many lineages rapidly (or many sgRNA and fish lines screened combinatorially).</p><p>The biological findings used to demonstrate the power of the approach are interesting in their own right. The non-autonomous effect of tuba1a/tuba1c loss on melanosome dispersion are striking and demonstrates very nicely how one could use Perlee et al.'s approach to search for similar mechanisms systematically. The dual targeting nature of the tuba1a/tuba1c sgRNA also suggests similar approaches might be explored for knocking out paralogs. The observation of the sox9 escape mechanism with sox10 loss is a beautiful demonstration of the relevance of SOX10/SOX9's reciprocal regulation in vivo. This system would be a very nice model for further interrogating mechanisms/interventions surrounding Sox10 in melanoma.</p><p>Finally, the figure presentation is very nice. This work involves complex genetic approaches, including multiple fish generations and multiplexed construct injections. The vector diagrams and breeding schemes in the paper make everything very clear/&quot;grok-able,&quot; and the paper was enjoyable to read.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors' claims are grounded and tested rigorously. The major weaknesses that we raised in the first round of reviews were either addressed experimentally or are now detailed as limitations in the text. Congrats on the beautiful paper!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100257.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Perlee</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yilun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Miranda V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Swanson</surname><given-names>Jacob B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>NYU Langone Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>Nelly M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ming</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ames</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lionnet</surname><given-names>Timothee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>NYU Langone Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McGrail</surname><given-names>Maura</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ames</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Perlee et al. sought to generate a zebrafish line where CRISPR-based gene editing is exclusively limited to the melanocyte lineage, allowing assessment of cell-type restricted gene knockouts.

While the genetic approaches are solid, the argued increase in efficiency of this model compared to current tools was untested, and therefore unable to be assessed. Furthermore, the mechanistic explanations proposed to underlie their phenotypes are mostly unfounded, as discussed further in the Weaknesses section. Despite these concerns, there is still a clear use for this genetic methodology and its implementation will be of value to many in vivo researchers.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strongest component of this manuscript is the genetic control offered by the mitfa:Cas9 system and the ability to make stable, lineage-specific knockouts in zebrafish.

However, no direct comparison is made with other tools that achieve the same genetic control, such as MAZERATI. This is a missed opportunity to provide researchers the ability to evaluate these two similar genetic approaches. In addition, Fig.1 shows that not all melanocytes express Cas9. This is a major caveat that goes unaddressed. It is of paramount importance to understand the percentage of mitfa+ cells that express Cas9. The histology shown is unclear and too zoomed out of a scale to make any insightful conclusions, especially in Fig.S1. It would also be beneficial to see data regarding Cas9 expression in adult melanocytes, which are distinct from embryonic melanocytes in zebrafish. Moreover, this system still requires the injection of a plasmid encoding gRNAs of interest, which will yield mosaicism. A prime example of this discrepancy is in Fig.6, where sox10 is clearly still present in &quot;sox10 KO&quot; tumors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these points. While our method has the advantage of endogenous knockin (thus keeping all regulatory elements), you are correct that we did not make a direct comparison with existing technologies like MAZERATI, and therefore we cannot make comparative claims about efficiency. Based on this, we have revised the manuscript to remove these points, reduce the strength/boldness of the claims, and make it more clear what our system achieves in comparison to existing systems. In reference to the other specific points you raise above about mosaicism and extent of Cas9 expression:</p><p>- We have added a paragraph to address the advantages and disadvantages of mitfaCas9 compared to expression of Cas9 with lineage-specific promoters including MAZERATI in the discussion.</p><p>- Figure 1C has been revised to more clearly show the overlap of mitfa and Cas9 in melanocytes.</p><p>- We then quantified the percentage of mitfa+ cells expressing Cas9 from the in situ hybridizations (Supplemental Figure S1D). We did attempt to look at Cas9 protein expression in both embryonic and adult melanocytes by immunofluorescence. Unfortunately, the Cas9 antibodies commercially available did not work on the zebrafish embryos or adult tailfins, so we are limited in proper quantification to the in situs in the embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors argue that their model allows rapid manipulation of melanocyte gene expression. Enthusiasm for the speed of this model is diminished by minimal phenotypes in the F0, as exemplified in Fig.2. Although the authors say &gt;90% of fish have loss of pigmentation, this is misleading as the phenotype is a very weak, partial loss. Only in the F1 generation do robust phenotypes emerge, which takes &gt;6 months to generate. How this is more efficient than other tools that currently exist is unclear and should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>This needed clarification, and we have now modified the Discussion to reflect this more accurately. What we were trying to show is that both F0 and F1 fish can be useful in screening for the effect of any given gene. In the F0, while you are correct that the phenotype is indeed weak/partial, it is also quantifiable and therefore can be used as a rapid screen for potential effects of knockout, so it can help with speed. The major advantage of the F1 generation is that we can generate fully penetrant phenotypes for recessive genes since the fish just needs to have 1 copy of the Cas9/sgRNA instead of 2. This means we do not have to go to F2 or F3 generations, which really does save time. But we agree this could be achieved using MAZERATI, and so we have added these considerations to the manuscript, as we feel these are important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, the authors find that melanocyte-specific knockout of sox10 leads to only a 25% reduction in melanocytes in the F1 generation. This is in contradiction to prior literature cited describing sox10 as indispensable for melanocyte development. In addition, the authors argue that sox10 is required for melanocyte regeneration. This claim is not accurate, as &gt;50% of melanocytes killed upon neocuproine treatment can regenerate. This data would indicate that sox10 is required for only a subset of melanocytes to develop (Fig.3C) and for only a subset to regenerate (Fig.3G). This is an interesting finding that is not discussed or interrogated further.</p></disp-quote><p>We too were initially very puzzled by this result. We do not completely understand it, but we have two thoughts about it. First could be timing. sox10 usually starts to be expressed around the 1-somite stage, and so in the original sox10/colourless mutant (which truly has no melanocytes), sox10 will be lost during those early stages. In contrast, mitf comes on later (around 18hpf) so this might indicate that there is a subset of melanocytes that are dependent upon this early expression of sox10. This may indicate that there could be different functions of sox10 early in melanocyte development versus later timepoints after melanocytes have already been specified. This might also help explain our findings during regeneration. Second could be genetic compensation. Since in the other parts of the paper we seem to see a somewhat reciprocal relationship between sox10 and sox9, it is conceivable that loss of sox10 in the melanocytes could be compensated for by sox9 (or even other genes) in our CRISPR approach (as opposed to the ENU allele in colourless). Since we really do not fully understand this, we have added a section to the Discussion about this issue, mentioning these possibilities but leaving open other yet to be defined mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Tumor induction by this model is weak, as indicated by the tumor curves in Figs.5,6. This might be because these fish are mitfa heterozygous. Whereas the avoidance of mitfa overexpression driven by other models including MAZERATI is a benefit of this system, the effect of mitfa heterozygosity on tumor incidence was untested. This is an essential question unaddressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in the BRAF;p53 group especially tumor incidence is very low, although PTEN loss does accelerate it. One possibility is exactly as you stated, and that mitfa heterozygosity is the etiology. The other possibility is that in the MAZERATI approach (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30385465/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30385465/</ext-link>) the authors used the casper background as opposed to the wild-type T5D as we did in our study. In unpublished observations, we have found that casper (with miniCoopR rescue) is markedly more sensitive to melanoma induction compared to WT fish in this setting. In fact, in looking at our BRAF;p53 curves compared to the original Patton paper curves (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15694309/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15694309/</ext-link>) which were also done in a WT background with no miniCoopR, they are fairly similar. This might indicate that casper + miniCoopR particularly sensitizes the fish to melanoma. However, because we do not fully know the reasons for this, we have now included both of these possible reasons in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig.6, the authors recapitulate previous findings with their model, showing sox10 KO inhibits tumor onset. The tumors that do develop are argued to be highly invasive, have mesenchymal morphology, and undergo phenotypic switching from sox10 to sox9 expression. The data presented do not sufficiently support these claims. The histology is not readily suggestive of invasive, mesenchymal melanomas. Sox10 is still present in many cells and sox9 expression is only found in a small subset (&lt;20%). Whether sox10-null cells are the ones expressing sox9 is untested. If sox9-mediated phenotypic switching is the major driver of these tumors, the authors would need to knockout sox9 and sox10 simultaneously and test whether these &quot;rare&quot; types of tumors still emerge. Additional histological and genetic evaluation is required to make the conclusions presented in Fig.6. It feels like a missed opportunity that the authors did not attempt to study genes of unknown contribution to melanoma with their system.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not mean to overstate the admittedly early observations from these fish. Invasiveness in the fish models can be difficult to precisely quantify, and therefore is somewhat qualitative. While we did not mean to imply that every cell that loses sox10 will become sox9 positive (which is clearly not the case), the human single-cell RNA-seq data does suggest these are somewhat mutually exclusive populations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32753671/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32753671/</ext-link>). This phenomenon has also long been observed even prior to single-cell approaches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25629959/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25629959/</ext-link>). So while we agree our data is not definitive in this regard, it is consistent with the literature and was presented mainly to provide areas for future exploration with the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this manuscript introduces a solid method to the arsenal of zebrafish genetic tools but falls short of justifying itself as a more efficient and robust approach than what currently exists. The mechanisms provided to explain observed phenotypes are tenuous. Nonetheless, the mitfa:Cas9 approach will certainly be of value to many in vivo biologists and lays the foundation to generate similar methods using other tissue-specific regulators and other Cas proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that by toning down the language around what we have observed, and providing as honest an assessment as possible as to what might be occurring, that the manuscript will be helpful for future studies aiming to knock out genes in the melanocyte lineage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a genetic tool utilizing mutant mitfa-Cas9 expressing zebrafish to knockout genes to analyze their function in melanocytes in a range of assays from developmental biology to tumorigenesis. Overall, the data are convincing and the authors cover potential caveats from their model that might impact its utility for future work.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors do an excellent job of characterizing several gene deletions that show the specificity and applicability of the genetic mitfa-Cas9 zebrafish to studying melanocytes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Variability across animals not fully analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>To more clearly show variability across animals, we calculated the percentage of mitfa+ cells that express Cas9 across n=7 mitfaCas9 embryos. We also expanded Supplemental Figure 2 to show loss of pigmentation across n=7 individual adult MG-<italic>albino</italic> F2 fish instead of one representative image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Perlee et al. present a method for generating cell-type restricted knockouts in zebrafish, focusing on melanocytes. For this method, the authors knock-in a Cas9 encoding sequence into the mitfa locus. This mitfaCas9 line has restricted Cas9 expression, allowing the authors to generate melanocyte-specific knockouts rapidly by follow-up injection of sgRNA expressing transposon vectors.</p><p>The paper presents some interesting vignettes to illustrate the utility of their approach. These include (1) a derivation of albino mutant fish as a demonstration of the method's efficiency, (2) an interrogation and novel description of tuba1a as a potential non-autonomous contributor to melanocyte dispersion, and (3) the generation of sox10 deficient melanoma tumors that show &quot;escape&quot; of sox10 loss through upregulation of sox9. The latter two examples highlight the usefulness of cell-type targeted knockouts (Body-wide sox10 and tuba1a loss elicit developmental defects). Additionally, the tumor models involve highly multiplexed sgRNAs for tumor initiation which is nicely facilitated by the stable Cas9.</p></disp-quote><p>Strengths:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The approach is clever and could prove very useful for studying melanocytes and other cell types. As the authors hint at in their discussion, this approach would become even more powerful with the generation of other Cas9-restricted lineages so a single sgRNA construct can be screened across many lineages rapidly (or many sgRNA and fish lines screened combinatorially).</p><p>The biological findings used to demonstrate the power of the approach are interesting in their own right. If it proves true, tuba1a's non-autonomous effects on melanosome dispersion are striking, and this example demonstrates very nicely how one could use Perlee et al.'s approach to search for other non-autonomous mechanisms systematically. Similarly, the observation of the sox9 escape mechanism with sox10 loss is a beautiful demonstration of the relevance of SOX10/SOX9's reciprocal regulation in vivo. This system would be a very nice model for further interrogating mechanisms/interventions surrounding Sox10 in melanoma.</p><p>Finally, the figure presentation is very nice. This work involves complex genetic approaches including multiple fish generations and multiplexed construct injections. The vector diagrams and breeding schemes in the paper make everything very clear/&quot;grok-able,&quot; and the paper was enjoyable to read.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The mitfa-driven GFP on their sgRNA-expressing cassette is elegant, but it makes one wonder why the endogenous knock-in is necessary. It would strengthen the motivation of the work if the authors could detail the potential advantages and disadvantages of their system compared to expressing Cas9 with a lineage-specific promoter from a transposon in their introduction or discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this needed a better and more clear explanation. There are many excellent examples of promoter driven Cas9 approaches. Within melanocytes, Ablain and others have developed the MAZERATI system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30385465/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30385465/</ext-link>) which is very powerful, especially for melanoma development. In our minds, the major advantage of endogenous knockin is that we retain all of the natural regulatory elements (many of which are not known) and so small promoter fragments always run the risk of missing certain types of regulation. While these regulatory elements may not matter under homeostatic conditions, they may become very important under perturbation, stress or disease states. This is why it is common, for example, in the mouse field, to knock in things like Cre into endogenous loci. We have now added a clarification of this to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the above - is mitfa haplosufficient? If the mitfaCas9/+ fish have any notable phenotypes, it would be worth noting for others interested in using this approach to study melanoma and pigmentation.</p></disp-quote><p>In normal melanocytes, <italic>mitfa</italic> is haplosufficient. There are no visible differences between mitfaCas9/+ and wild-type fish at any stages of development (Figure S1C). Although we did not directly compare tumor growth in mitfa-/+ and <italic>mitfa</italic>+/+ fish in this study, it is possible that the disruption of <italic>mitfa</italic> in mitfaCas9/+ fish affects melanoma development. Most zebrafish melanoma models involve the overexpression of <italic>mitfa</italic> with MiniCoopR vectors and it would be interesting in future studies to determine how <italic>mitfa</italic> heterozygosity affects melanoma initiation or progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A core weakness (and also potential strength) of the system is that introduced edits will always be non-clonal (Fig 2H/I). The activity of individual sgRNAs should always be validated in the absence of any noticeable phenotype to interpret a negative result. Additionally, caution should be taken when interpreting results from rare events involving positive outgrowth (like tumorogenesis) to account for the fact many cells in the population might not have biallelic null alleles (i.e., 100% of the gene product removed).</p><p>Along those lines: in my opinion, the tuba1a results are the most provocative finding in the paper, but they lack key validation. With respect to cutting activity, the Alt-R and transgenic sgRNA expression approaches are not directly comparable. Since there is no phenotype in the melanocyte specific tuba1a knockouts, the authors must confirm high knockout efficiency with this set of reagents before making the claim there is a non-autonomous phenotype. This can be achieved with GFP+ sorting and NGS like they performed with their albino melanocytes.</p><p>The whole-body tuba1a knockout phenotype is expected to be pleiotropic, and this expectation might mask off-target effects. Controls for knockout specificity should be included. For instance, confidence in the claims would greatly increase if the dispersed melanosome phenotype could be recovered with guide-resistant tuba1a re-expression and if melanocyte-restricted tuba1a reexpression failed to rescue. As a less definitive but adequate alternative, the authors could also test if another guide or a morpholino against tuba1a phenocopies the described Alt-R edited fish.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful suggestions, which led us to an important discovery. While validating the original <italic>tuba1a</italic> guide RNA, we found that <italic>tuba1a</italic> sg1 also targets <italic>tuba1c</italic>, a gene that shares 99.78% homology with <italic>tuba1a</italic> in zebrafish. To determine which gene was responsible for the melanocyte phenotype, we designed multiple new guide RNAs specifically targeting either <italic>tuba1a</italic> or <italic>tuba1c</italic> and used Alt-R to globally knock them out in zebrafish embryos. However, none of these guides successfully replicated the phenotype (Sanger sequencing validation for the most efficient <italic>tuba1a</italic> and <italic>tuba1c</italic> guides is provided below).</p><p>Ultimately, we identified a new guide RNA (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGTCTACAAAGACAGCCCTA</named-content>-3’) that successfully phenocopied the original <italic>tuba1a</italic> sg1 melanocyte phenotype. <italic>Tuba1c</italic>—but not <italic>tuba1a</italic>—was predicted to have a mismatch at the 3’ end of the guide sequence, which is typically expected to inhibit target cleavage. Surprisingly, despite this mismatch, we observed robust cleavage in both <italic>tuba1a</italic> and <italic>tuba1c</italic>. Since the melanocyte phenotype was only reproducible when <italic>both tuba1a</italic> and <italic>tuba1c</italic> were targeted, this suggests potential compensatory interactions between these highly similar genes. We have updated the text and figures to reflect this finding and have included validation of this second guide RNA (<italic>tuba1a/c</italic> sg2) in Supplemental Figure 3.</p><p>As you suggested, we also conducted GFP+ sorting and NGS to confirm knockout of both <italic>tuba1a</italic> and <italic>tuba1c</italic> in melanocytes of mitfaCas9 fish (Figure S3G). The knockout percentages were comparable to those observed in our previous experiment with MG_-albino_ fish. This also confirms that this method can be used to sort and sequence GFP+ cells even when pigmentation is retained, which was not the case for albino fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have similar questions about the sox10 escapers, but these suggestions are less critical for supporting the authors claims (especially given the nice staining). Are the sox10 tumors relatively clonal with respect to sox10 mutations? And are the sox10 tumor mutations mostly biallelic frameshifts or potential missense mutations/single mutations that might not completely remove activity? I am particularly curious as SOX10 doesn't seem to be completely absent (and is still very high in some nuclei) in the immunohistochemistry.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to address this question by performing DNA sequencing on the FFPE blocks that we had retained from the original study. While our sequencing facility said this should be possible, we could not consistently generate high enough quality DNA to make a definitive statement either way. While we are very curious to know what the nature of the mutations are in these “escapers”, the student who performed these studies has now graduated, and it would take us several additional months to a year to fully address it. Given this, we would prefer to leave this open question to a future paper, but have addressed this limitation in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>Overall, the reviewers felt and eLife concurs that your manuscript is insightful and appropriate for publication. Reviewers were impressed by your generating a zebrafish line where CRISPRbased gene editing is exclusively limited to the melanocyte lineage, allowing assessment of celltype restricted gene knockouts. Your use of multiple candidate genes to demonstrate that your system induces lineage-restricted gene editing is compelling and will be of interest to the broad readership of eLife. This method will allow researchers to bypass embryonic lethal and non-cell autonomous phenotypes emerging from whole body knockout, drive directed phenotypes, such as depigmentation, and induce lineage-specific tumors, such as melanomas. This said, the argued increase in efficiency of this model compared to current tools was untested, and therefore it remains difficult for a reader to assess the extent to which your new model represents a major advance over prior ones. Of additional concern are the mechanistic explanations proposed to underlie the phenotypes, as these are largely unfounded. Thus, in preparing your final publication version of the paper, eLife strongly encourages you to fully address the reviewers' thoughtful comments. In particular, the boldness of the claims made in the manuscript should be reduced. Terms like &quot;highly efficient&quot; and &quot;rapid&quot; are unsupported due to the lack of comparison with other well-established methods, like MAZERATI.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above in each of the reviewer points above, we agree with both of these points.
