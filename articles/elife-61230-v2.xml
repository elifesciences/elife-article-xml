cellular toxicity due to the accumulation of non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins, termed mitoprotein-induced stress. Despite the burden mis-localized mitochondrial precursors place on cells, our understanding of the systems that dispose of these proteins is incomplete. Here, we cataloged the location and steady-state abundance of mitochondrial precursor proteins during mitochondrial impairment in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We found that a number of non-imported mitochondrial proteins localize to the nucleus, where they are subjected to proteasome-dependent degradation through a process we term nuclear-associated mitoprotein degradation (mitoNUC). Recognition and destruction of mitochondrial precursors by the mitoNUC pathway requires the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and is mediated by combined action of the E3 ubiquitin ligases San1, Ubr1, and Doa10. Impaired breakdown of precursors leads to alternative sequestration in nuclear-associated foci. These results identify the nucleus as an important destination for the disposal of non-imported mitochondrial precursors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>protein import</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG043095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM119694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009282</institution-id><institution>United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuler</surname><given-names>Max H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During times of mitochondrial impairment, non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins are targeted to the nucleus for proteasome-dependent degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging and associated with many age-related and metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wallace, 2005</xref>).

Recent studies have shown that non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins are toxic for cells and identified several cellular pathways that combat this stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">MÃ¥rtensson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>).

Thus, our understanding of the fate of non-imported mitochondrial precursors and the systems that regulate their disposal is likely incomplete. Here, using microscopy and immunoblot-based screens in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we find that non-imported mitochondrial proteins accumulate in many regions of the cell upon mitochondrial depolarization and identify the nucleus as a previously unrecognized quality control destination for non-imported mitochondrial precursors. We show that many mitochondrial proteins localize to the nucleus upon import failure, where they are subjected to proteasome-dependent destruction via redundant action of the E3 ubiquitin ligases San1, Ubr1, and Doa10. When degradation capacity is exceeded, mitochondrial precursors are sequestered into nuclear-associated protein foci.</p><p>Interestingly, we determined that the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Omura, 1998</xref>) is necessary for non-imported precursor protein induced-toxicity, degradation, and sequestration into nuclear-associated foci, but dispensable for nuclear localization. The presence of an MTS is also required for degradation and toxicity of non-imported proteins that localize to cellular regions other than the nucleus, implicating the MTS as a major driver of non-imported precursor toxicity. Finally, we show that nuclear accumulation of non-imported precursors arises during cellular aging. Overall, this work demonstrates that non-imported mitochondrial proteins exhibit numerous fates within cells and outlines a nuclear-based quality control pathway for non-imported mitoproteins we refer to as mitoNUC (nuclear-associated mitoprotein degradation).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The non-imported version of the mitochondrial protein Ilv2 localizes to the nucleus</title><p>We previously showed that the mitochondrial network undergoes extensive fragmentation and depolarization during replicative aging in budding yeast, which is defined as the number of times an individual yeast cell undergoes division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>).

Because depolarization is prominent, and the import of Ilv2 requires a mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) potential, we wondered whether the fraction of Ilv2-GFP localized to the nucleus represented a non-imported precursor pool of this protein. Consistent with that idea, treatment of cells with the mitochondrial IM depolarizing agent trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parker, 1965</xref>) also caused Ilv2-GFP accumulation in the nucleus, which was marked with 4â²,6-Diamidine-2â²-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Nuclear localization did not result from GFP-tagging, as indirect immunofluorescence showed a similar nuclear localization for native Ilv2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) as well as functional C-terminally FLAG-tagged Ilv2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) in FCCP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, Ilv2-GFP localized to the nucleus in cells conditionally depleted of the essential OM protein import channel Tom40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mnaimneh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vestweber et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>), indicating that nuclear localization was not caused by off-target effects of FCCP, but was specific to defects in mitochondrial protein import.</p><p>We hypothesized that the nuclear pool of Ilv2 likely represented a fraction of the protein that could not be imported into mitochondria. Consistent with that idea, western blot analysis revealed that higher-molecular-weight forms of Ilv2, Ilv2-GFP, and Ilv2-HA accumulated in cells treated with FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Mitochondrial proteins such as Ilv2 are synthesized with an N-terminal MTS extension that is proteolytically removed from the mature peptide only after they transit the mitochondrial IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mossmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the higher-molecular-weight form of Ilv2 in FCCP-treated cells likely represents the immature, precursor form of the protein. In support of the idea that the non-imported pool of Ilv2 localizes to the nucleus, the precursor form of Ilv2-HA was specifically enriched in nuclear fractions isolated from FCCP-treated cells, while other mitochondrial proteins, including Tom70, Tim44, as well as the mature form of Ilv2-HA, were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, we utilized the Recombination-Induced Tag Exchange (RITE) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verzijlbergen et al., 2010</xref>), which consists of an estradiol-induced Cre recombinase in combination with gene-targeted loxP sites to facilitate on-demand epitope-tag switching upon exposure of cells to estradiol, to examine the fate of both old and newly synthesized Ilv2 in the same cell. We found that only newly synthesized Ilv2 (Ilv2 New, RFP tagged) localized to the nucleus upon FCCP treatment, while Ilv2 already present in mitochondria (Ilv2 Old, GFP tagged) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that when the translocation of Ilv2 into mitochondria is blocked by genetic or pharmacologic impairment of mitochondrial import, the non-imported precursor form of Ilv2 alternatively localizes to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The nucleus in one of several fates for non-imported mitochondrial proteins</title><p>We next sought to determine the extent to which non-imported proteins localize to the nucleus in cells lacking efficient mitochondrial import. To address this question in a systematic manner, we imaged a collection of yeast strains expressing 523 distinct mitochondrial proteins with carboxy-terminal GFP fusions from their endogenous loci in the absence or presence of FCCP. These strains were derived from the yeast GFP collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huh et al., 2003</xref>) and co-expressed Tom70-mCherry, a mitochondrial OM marker that localizes to mitochondria independently of the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hughes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">SÃ¶llner et al., 1990</xref>). We found that 6.4% of the mitochondrial proteins analyzed behaved like Ilv2, exhibiting nuclear localization in FCCP-treated cells (class 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Additionally, we identified four other major outcomes for mitochondrial proteins after membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These included continued localization to the mitochondrion (class 2, e.g., Tom20, 8.2% of all proteins), accumulation in the cytoplasm (class 3, e.g., Acp1, 36.1% of all proteins), localization to the ER (class 4, e.g., Mir1, 2.7% of all proteins), and reduced overall abundance to the point of being nearly undetectable (class 5, e.g., Cox15, 42.2% of all proteins). A subset of proteins (4.4%) localized to regions of the cell distinct from these five major classes upon FCCP treatment and associated with unidentified cellular membranes and foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the majority of cases across protein classes, a portion of each protein localized to the mitochondrial network in addition to its new location, likely stemming from either residual mature form still present in the mitochondrion or continued delivery of a fraction of the precursor pool to the mitochondrial network (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> images).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The nucleus in one of several fates for non-imported mitochondrial proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yeast expressing the indicated mCherry or GFP-tagged mitochondrial proteins Â± FCCP.

Furthermore, we showed that FLAG-tagged versions of representatives from all classes of proteins also behaved identically to their GFP counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) and determined that conditional depletion of the essential OM protein import channel Tom40 led to similar protein fates as treatment of cells with FCCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mnaimneh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vestweber et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). While we have not been able to validate our entire screen list using native antibodies, our results suggest that the observed changes in mitochondrial protein localization for representatives from each class are not caused by the presence of a GFP tag or off-target effects of FCCP.</p><p>We concurrently analyzed steady-state protein abundance via western blotting of the same set of GFP-tagged mitochondrial proteins in the absence and presence of FCCP, as this approach provided useful information about the state of Ilv2 in the nucleus.

We confirmed the changes in steady-state abundance for representatives from each class using antibodies against native forms of the proteins, as well as in strains expressing C-terminally HA-tagged versions of the proteins. We observed similar steady-state abundance changes as compared to our results for each GFP-tagged protein we retested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>). Interestingly, further analysis indicated that the decline in class 5 protein abundance was either completely or partially blunted by proteasome inhibition via MG-132 depending on the individual protein substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D,E</xref>), implicating the proteasome in their destruction. Also, as with Ilv2, precursor forms of Acp1 and Lat1 (class 3 and 5) were visible in the presence of FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our screen revealed several patterns amongst the proteins that comprised each screen class, and many of our observations aligned well with those from previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Nuclear-localized class 1 proteins were predominantly mitochondrial matrix enzymes, including numerous members of the TCA cycle. Most class 2 proteins that continued to localize to depolarized mitochondria were mitochondrial OM proteins that do not require a membrane potential for mitochondrial targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017</xref>). Class 3 (cytoplasm) proteins were largely soluble proteins, several of which (e.g., Idh1, Idh2, Mss116, and Cis1) were previously found to be enriched in cytosolic extracts isolated from mitochondrial import-deficient yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>). ER-localized class 4 proteins were generally integral IM and OM proteins, some of which were previously reported to localize to the ER in cells with compromised mitochondrial import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, class 5, the largest of the classes, consisted of both soluble and membrane-bound mitochondrial proteins. These results indicate that numerous fates exist for non-imported mitochondrial proteins and that the nucleus represents a previously unrecognized destination for mitochondrial precursors during import failure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nuclear protein quality control clears non-imported mitochondrial proteins</title><p>We next sought to understand the basis for the nuclear localization of non-imported mitochondrial proteins in the absence of functional mitochondrial import. The eukaryotic nucleus harbors a large proportion of cellular proteasomes and is a quality control destination for misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Enam et al., 2018</xref>). Because the overall abundance of nuclear-localized mitochondrial proteins declined during FCCP treatment, we tested whether non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins were directed to the nucleus for proteasomal degradation. In support of that idea, the decline in steady-state levels of Ilv2-GFP and Ilv2-HA upon FCCP treatment was blunted in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Ilv2 decline was also prevented in strains lacking a combination of three E3 ubiquitin ligases that operate in nuclear-associated protein quality control, San1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samant et al., 2018</xref>), Ubr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prasad et al., 2010</xref>), and Doa10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng and Hochstrasser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>) (E3 KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This result was true for GFP-tagged, HA-tagged, and untagged endogenous Ilv2. No combination of single or double knockouts completely prevented loss of Ilv2 upon mitochondrial depolarization, suggesting these ligases act redundantly to promote non-imported mitochondrial protein clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, the addition of proteasome inhibitor or deletion of the aforementioned E3 ligases each led to a marked elevation in the higher-molecular-weight precursor form of Ilv2 in the presence of FCCP, suggesting the immature, Ilv2 precursor was the form of the protein specifically marked for proteasome clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). In line with this observation, cycloheximide-chase analysis demonstrated that the half-life of the Ilv2, Ilv2-HA, and Ilv2-GFP precursor forms were altered in the E3 KO strain, while the mature forms were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Furthermore, ubiquitin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Ilv2 was ubiquitylated in the presence of FCCP in a San1-, Ubr1-, and Doa10-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Proteasome-dependent degradation of a non-nuclear class 5 substrate (Lat1) was unaffected in the E3 KO strain, indicating that additional E3 ligases promote clearance of non-nuclear localized mitochondrial precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). Moreover, we found that our observations extend beyond Ilv2, as GFP-tagged versions of two other nuclear candidates identified in our screen, Dld1 and Dld2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>) were also eliminated in a proteasome and San1/Ubr1/Doa10-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâF</xref>).

Mitochondrial matrix proteins such as Ilv2 are synthesized as precursors with an N-terminal MTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>). The MTS is removed by mitochondrial-localized proteases after import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mossmann et al., 2012</xref>), and failure to remove and clear MTSs leads to toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mossmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poveda-Huertes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roise et al., 1986</xref>). To test whether the presence of an MTS on an unimported mitochondrial precursor protein is problematic, we analyzed strains containing single-copy plasmids expressing full-length Ilv2-GFP (FL), MTS-deleted Ilv2-GFP (ÎMTS), and MTS<sub>Ilv2</sub>-GFP only (MTS) from the constitutive GPD promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Like endogenous Ilv2-GFP (Endo), plasmid-derived FL-Ilv2-GFP localized to the nucleus and nuclear-associated foci, and its abundance declined with FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâE</xref>). By contrast, Ilv2 lacking an MTS (ÎMTS-Ilv2-GFP) constitutively localized to the nucleus even in the absence of FCCP, but never formed nuclear-associated foci or decreased in abundance with FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâE</xref>). MTS<sub>Ilv2</sub>-GFP localized to mitochondria and exhibited no nuclear localization, puncta formation, or changes in total abundance with FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâE</xref>). Thus, information in the mature, C-terminal portion of Ilv2 is necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization, but the presence of an MTS is required for non-imported Ilv2 degradation and sequestration into nuclear-associated foci.</p><p>Because Ilv2 lacking an MTS was not subjected to quality control, we wondered whether ÎMTS-Ilv2-GFP was still toxic to cells. In contrast to overexpressed FL Ilv2-GFP, which impaired growth of both wild type and E3 KO cells in the presence or absence of FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), overexpressed Ilv2 lacking its MTS did not slow cell growth, and neither did overexpressed MTS<sub>Ilv2</sub>-GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The same was true for non-tagged versions of Ilv2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the presence of an MTS on unimported Ilv2 rendered the protein toxic and promoted its subsequent quality control. Importantly, the association between the presence of an MTS, degradation, and toxicity was conserved for other nuclear class proteins. Like Ilv2, Dld2 lacking its MTS constitutively localized to the nucleus, but was not subjected to degradation or sequestered into nuclear foci, and was no longer toxic to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1BâF</xref>). Moreover, degradation and toxicity of Cox15 and Lat1, which are degraded by a non-nuclear proteasome pathway, also required an N-terminal MTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Thus, the presence of an MTS on an unimported mitochondrial protein drives toxicity and targets the protein for quality control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MTS-mediated toxicity is not entirely linked to mitochondrial import clogging</title><p>Recent studies have shown that the failure to degrade some non-imported mitochondrial proteins leads to toxicity because the undegraded precursors clog mitochondrial import pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">MÃ¥rtensson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>). Since we found that the MTS of Ilv2 was required for its toxicity, we wondered whether Ilv2 overexpression and/or expression of Ilv2-NES impaired mitochondrial protein import. To test this, we first assayed the impact of full-length Ilv2 overexpression on mitochondrial protein import using a well-established in vitro import assay that analyzes uptake and subsequent processing of in vitro translated DHFR fused to the MTS of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> ATP synthase subunit 9 (Su9-DHFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfanner et al., 1987</xref>). We found that overexpression of GFP-tagged full-length Ilv2 (FL), but not MTS-deleted Ilv2-GFP (ÎMTS) or MTS<sub>Ilv2</sub> only (MTS)-GFP, decreased import of Su9-DHFR into isolated mitochondria, as indicated by reduced formation of the mature form of Su9-DHFR during incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Remarkably, we found that Ilv2-NES-GFP, despite its high toxicity, had little to no impact on the in vitro import of Su9-DHFR and hadÂ only mild effects on the steady-state levels of Tim54 and Aco1 in isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). Given the fact that this version of Ilv2 is highly toxic to cells both in the presence and inÂ theÂ absence of FCCP, it seems that the toxicity of non-imported Ilv2 cannot be completely attributed to its ability to act as a mitochondrial import clogger, and likely stems from additional deleterious effects of the protein on unidentified cellular processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior studies demonstrated that the accumulation of unimported mitochondrial precursors causes proteotoxicity termed mitoprotein-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). To combat this stress, cells mount a coordinated response that involves upregulation of proteasome capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>), downregulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>), and clearance of precursors that accumulate at the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">MÃ¥rtensson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Metzger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>) and ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Laborenz et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we surveyed the mitochondrial proteome under conditions of mitochondrial import impairment to get a clearer picture of the full spectrum of fates for non-imported mitochondrial proteins. We found that mitochondrial precursors accumulate in many regions of the cell and identified the nucleus as an important quality control destination for sequestering and destroying non-imported mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, we demonstrated that the N-terminal MTS is a major driver of non-imported protein toxicity. Our findings also indicate that non-imported mitochondrial proteins represent a large class of potential substrates for nuclear protein quality control. This discovery raises the intriguing possibility that non-imported mitochondrial proteins may synergize with other aggregate-prone proteins to overwhelm protein quality control systems during aging and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies to determine what drives non-imported mitochondrial proteins to various cellular destinations, and addressing whether mitoproteins perform signaling or metabolic functions at these sites (much like the mito-nuclear signaling protein ATFS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nargund et al., 2012</xref>) will help illuminate how cells adapt to the significant burden of mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

When import is perturbed and mitochondrial precursor proteins accumulate outside mitochondria, cells suffer from severe proteotoxic stress and respond by activating adaptive programs. However, the precise molecular events of this precursor-induced toxicity are still unknown. In this manuscript, Shakya and colleagues reveal the fate of many mitochondrial precursor proteins when their import into mitochondria is blocked by dissipating the inner membrane potential. Using high-throughput microscopy screening, they show that different mitochondrial proteins are now localized to different cellular compartments (including cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus) or are basically depleted from the cell when they cannot be imported into mitochondria. They demonstrate that nuclear-localized proteins are subject to proteasomal degradation and that the mitochondrial targeting signal is crucial for its nuclear quality control.</p><p>Overall, this is an exciting study which fills an important gap in our knowledge about the quality control of mitochondrial proteins. It will at the same time serve as a valuable resource for many researchers working in the field. The manuscript is very well suited for a widely-read journal like <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The nucleus is a quality control center for non-imported mitochondrial proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Johannes M. Herrmann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the import of hundreds of proteins from the cytosol. When import is perturbed and mitochondrial precursor proteins accumulate outside mitochondria, cells suffer from proteotoxic stress and respond by activating adaptive programs. However, the precise molecular events of this precursor-induced toxicity are still unknown. In this manuscript, Shakya and colleagues reveal the fate of many mitochondrial precursor proteins when their import into mitochondria is blocked by dissipating the inner membrane potential. Using high-throughput microscopy screening, they show that different mitochondrial proteins are now mislocalized to different cellular compartments (including cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus) or are basically depleted from the cell when they cannot be imported into mitochondria. They demonstrate that nuclear-localized proteins are subject to proteasomal degradation and that the mitochondrial targeting signal is crucial for its nuclear quality control.</p><p>Overall, this is an exciting study which fills an important gap in our knowledge about the quality control of mitochondrial proteins. It will at the same time serve as a valuable resource for many researchers working in the field. The manuscript is very well suited for a widely-read journal like <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness of the manuscript is the exclusive reliance on tagged proteins. As a requirement for resubmission we ask that at least in selected key experiments you will demonstrate your findings also for an untagged protein for which antibodies exist (many antibodies against mitochondrial proteins in yeast exist). This is especially important since the GFP tag is large and well-folded and known to slow down translocation â for example, the GFP-tag slows down the import of Ilv2 as can be seen by more precursor accumulating (even in the absence of CCCP) relative to the smaller tag HA. Similar difference between GFP-tagged and HA-tagged forms are observed also for Acp1.</p><p>2) The authors use an overexpression of Ilv2-/Cox15-/Lat1-GFP variants to demonstrate the relevance of their MTS for the toxicity, nuclear distribution and QC of these proteins. However, the overexpression of the MTS-containing constructs obviously constitutes a severe stress to the cells already without CCCP treatment (Figure 4G and I). It's likely that these constructs act as &quot;cloggers&quot; of the mitochondrial translocases, similar to what was shown in the Weidberg and Amon, 2018 and Boos et al., 2019 papers. Therefore, what the authors observe in these strains might at least partly be due to secondary effects. This is crucial for the interpretation of these observations. Therefore, the authors should carefully check whether in these strains, the import of other mitochondrial proteins is impaired (precursor accumulation in Western blot, activation of classical stress responses). The key experiments should also be repeated with expression at endogenous levels and ideally without fusion of a large, stably folded GFP (a short tag such as HA or Myc should be ok).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61230.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness of the manuscript is the exclusive reliance on tagged proteins.

Following the reviewersâ recommendation, we have confirmed many of our key findings by evaluating untagged, endogenous proteins using available antibodies. In each case, the results recapitulate our previous findings that were based on epitope tagged proteins. First, we now show that native Ilv2 localizes to the nucleus in FCCP-treated cells via indirect immunofluorescence (Figure 1C), similar to its GFP and FLAG tagged counterparts. We also find that the steady-state levels of native Ilv2 behave similarly to Ilv2-GFP and Ilv2-HA in the presence and absence of FCCP, including the fact that native Ilv2 precursor levels accumulate upon treatment of cells with FCCP (Figure 1E). Moreover, we show that the precursor form of native Ilv2 has a half-life similar to the GFP- and HA-tagged forms upon FCCP treatment (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F), and that the turnover of native Ilv2 is dependent on San1, Ubr1, and Doa10 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C). Finally, we show that overexpression of untagged Ilv2 leads to MTS-dependent toxicity in the same manner as its GFP tagged counterpart (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A).</p><p>In addition to these new experiments with native Ilv2, we also confirmed the localization and steady-state abundance of several proteins from our screen using antibodies against the endogenous proteins. We confirmed mitochondrial and ER localization for Tom20 and OM45, respectively, via indirect immunofluorescence (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B). We also confirmed the prior observed changes in steady-state abundance upon FCCP treatment with antibodies directed against native Ilv2 (Class 1), Tom70 (Class 2), Tom20 (Class 2), Idh1 (Class 3), OM45 (Class 4), Tim54 (Class 5), Tim50 (Class 5), and Tim18 (Class 5) (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B). Steady-state abundance of the GFP-tagged versions of these proteins +/- FCCP has been provided in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A for comparison. Overall, while we certainly cannot rule out that the GFP tag may interfere with the localization and behavior of some of the mitochondrial proteins in our original screen, it does appear that the major conclusions drawn previously about the role of the nucleus in Ilv2 degradation and many fates for non-imported proteins are supported by our new observations. We added additional text in the Results to indicate that not all proteins from the screen have been validated with endogenous antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use an overexpression of Ilv2-/Cox15-/Lat1-GFP variants to demonstrate the relevance of their MTS for the toxicity, nuclear distribution and QC of these proteins.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of additional experiments evaluating the impact of Ilv2-GFP overexpression (and an MTS-less variant) on mitochondrial import both in vivo and in vitro. We used both Ilv2-GFP and untagged GFP in different versions of these assays, as we found that both cause similar levels of toxicity when overexpressed (see new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A). As can be seen in new Figure 6A, we found that overexpression of full-length Ilv2-GFP modestly blunted the in vitro import of the classically utilized Su9-DHFR substrate into isolated mitochondria. Deletion of Ilv2âs MTS prevented this effect. Moreover, Ilv2-GFP overexpression led to a small reduction in the steady-state abundance of Tim54 in purified mitochondria, but not matrix protein Aco1 (Figure 6B). Both of these effects were not as strong as the impact of treating cells with FCCP, which severely reduced Su9-DHFR import and Tim54 and Aco1 steady-state abundance in isolated mitochondria (Figures 6C-D). Consistent with a modest import defect upon Ilv2 overexpression, we observed a small to moderate increase in the amount of Idh1 that now localized in the cytoplasm in cells overexpressing Ilv2 (Figures 6E-F, ~10% in WT cells, and ~30% in Ilv2-OE cells). For comparison, Idh1 mis-localized to the cytoplasm in nearly 100% of FCCP-treated cells, in agreement with our original screen data (Figure 6E-F). Overall, these data suggest that Ilv2 OE leads to a modest block in mitochondrial import, but not as robust as in cells treated with FCCP. Given the severe growth defect observed in Ilv2 OE strains compared to growth of cells on FCCP, it seems likely that some of the toxicity associated with Ilv2 OE is independent of its impact on mitochondrial import.</p><p>To test this further, we constructed a strain expressing a form of Ilv2 that cannot localize the nucleus. We did this by inserting a nuclear export signal at the C-terminus of Ilv2 on the chromosome, just before an in-frame GFP. As shown in Figures 4F-G, this version of Ilv2, Ilv2-NES, is constitutively excluded from the nucleus, even in the presence of FCCP, and not degraded upon FCCP treatment (Figure 4H). Interestingly, even at endogenous levels, this version of Ilv2 is highly toxic to cells, even more so than Ilv2 OE (Figure 4I). This result suggests that nuclear localization is required to prevent Ilv2 toxicity. Interestingly, we analyzed the impact of Ilv2-NES on mitochondrial import, and found that it had no effect on in vitro import of Su9-DHFR and steady-state the abundance of mitochondrial proteins (Figures 6G-H). Thus, the toxicity of Ilv2 does not appear to entirely correlate with its ability to act as a clogger of mitochondrial import. We have added all of this new data to the manuscript where we indicated above, and have now concluded that nuclear sequestration of Ilv2 is important to mitigate its toxicity in cells, and that toxicity likely results from a combination of mitochondrial import clogging and other effects on the cell that remain unclear at this time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
