Biofilms occur most commonly on medical implants, and a key event in implant colonization is the robust adherence to the surface, facilitated by interactions between bacterial surface proteins and host matrix components. <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is equipped with a giant adhesive protein, extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp), which facilitates bacterial interactions with surface-deposited, but not soluble fibronectin. The structural basis behind this selective binding process has remained obscure. Using a suite of single-cell and single-molecule analysis techniques, we show that <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is capable of such distinction because Embp binds specifically to fibrillated fibronectin on surfaces, while ignoring globular fibronectin in solution. <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> adherence is critically dependent on multivalent interactions involving 50 fibronectin-binding repeats of Embp. This unusual, Velcro-like interaction proved critical for colonization of surfaces under high flow, making this newly identified attachment mechanism particularly relevant for colonization of intravascular devices, such as prosthetic heart valves or vascular grafts. Other biofilm-forming pathogens, such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> express homologs of Embp and likely deploy the same mechanism for surface colonization. Our results may open for a novel direction in efforts to combat devastating, biofilm-associated infections, as the development of implant materials that steer the conformation of adsorbed proteins is a much more manageable task than avoiding protein adsorption altogether.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A usually harmless bacterium called <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> lives on human skin. Sometimes it makes its way into the bloodstream through a cut or surgical procedure, but it rarely causes blood infections. It can, however, cause severe infections when it attaches to the surface of a medical implant like a pacemaker or an artificial replacement joint. It does this by forming a colony of bacteria on the implant’s surface called a biofilm, which protects the bacteria from destruction by the immune system or antibiotics.</p><p>Understanding how <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> implant infections start is critical to preventing them. This information may help scientists develop infection-resistant implants or new treatments for implant infections. Scientists suspect that <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> attaches to implants by binding to a human protein called fibronectin, which coats medical implants in the human body. Another protein on the surface of the bacteria, called Embp, facilitates the connection. But why the bacteria attach to fibronectin on implants, and not fibronectin molecules in the bloodstream, is unclear.</p><p>Now, Khan, Aslan et al. show that Embp forms a Velcro-like bond with fibronectin on the surface of implants. In the experiments, Khan and Aslan et al. used powerful microscopes to create 3-dimensional images of the interactions between Embp and fibronectin. The experiments showed that Embp's attachment site is hidden on the globe-shaped form of fibronectin circulating in the blood. But when fibronectin covers an implant surface, it forms a fibrous network, and Embp can attach to it with up to 50 Velcro-like individual connections. These many weak connections form a strong bond that withstands the force of blood pumping past.</p><p>The experiments show that the fibrous coating of fibronectin on implants makes them a hotspot for <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> infections. Finding ways to block Embp from attaching to fibronectin on implants, or altering the form fibronectin takes on implants, may help prevent these infections. Many bacteria that form biofilms have an Embp-like protein. As a result, these discoveries may also help scientists develop prevention or treatment strategies for other bacterial biofilm infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic></kwd><kwd>Embp</kwd><kwd>fibronectin</kwd><kwd>bacterial adhesion</kwd><kwd>multivalent</kwd><kwd>AFM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF16-0342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>Nasar</given-names></name><name><surname>Aslan</surname><given-names>Hüsnü</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Golbek</surname><given-names>Thaddeus Wayne</given-names></name><name><surname>Roeters</surname><given-names>Steven Joop</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fibronectin can shift from a globular to fibrillated form when adsorbing to implant surfaces, and this shift makes it accessible to attachment by <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, which is the leading cause of implant-associated infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biomedical implants such as catheters, prosthetics, vascular grafts, and similar devices have revolutionized the medical field. However, implants can lead to severe infections due to bacterial biofilms: The formation of multicellular bacterial communities encased in a protective extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arciola et al., 2018</xref>). Bacteria in the biofilm evade phagocytosis by immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vor et al., 2020</xref>), and the immune system can therefore not eradicate the infection. Furthermore, a fraction of the cells enter a dormant state in which they are highly tolerant to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rowe et al., 2021</xref>). With the rise in use of biomedical implants, there is an urgent and growing need to understand how biofilm infections arise, such that new strategies for preventative treatment can be developed.</p><p>Staphylococci, particularly <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> are the culprits of most implant-associated infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oliveira et al., 2018</xref>). Despite its low virulence, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is common in these infections due to its prowess in biofilm formation. <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> attaches to implant surfaces via adsorbed host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">François et al., 1998</xref>) and it expresses an array of surface-bound proteins (adhesins) that bind to host proteins, such as fibrin, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin, and collagen to initiate biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foster, 2020</xref>). One such adhesin is the extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp), which is found in the vast majority of clinical isolates of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rohde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salgueiro et al., 2017</xref>)<italic>,</italic> suggesting that this giant 1 MDa protein is important for this species’ pathogenicity. Embp contains a number of repetitive motifs. These were originally described based on sequence similarity to be 21 ‘Found in Various Architecture’ (FIVAR) repeats and 38 alternating repeats of ‘G-related Albumin Binding’ (GA) and FIVAR repeats combined, named FIVAR-GA repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After the crystal structure was recently solved, the domain structure was updated and consists of ten 170-aa F-repeats that each represent two FIVAR repeats, and forty 125-aa FG-repeats that each represent the previously termed FIVAR-GA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büttner et al., 2020</xref>). These 50 repeats can bind to Fn by interacting with FN12 of the Fn type III repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and it is presumed that this interaction aids the colonization of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The structure of extracellular matrix-binding protein Embp (<bold>A</bold>), its ligand fibronectin (<bold>B and C</bold>), and our hypothesis of selective binding of Embp to the fibrillated form of fibronectin via a multivalent interaction (<bold>D</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Embp consists of 50 fibronectin (Fn)-binding repeats (10 F-repeats and 40 FG-repeats).

We wondered how bacteria like <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> can colonize implant surfaces by interacting with adsorbed Fn when the same protein is also abundant in a soluble form in blood. Presumably, Fn-binding proteins on the bacterial cell surface become occupied with soluble Fn before being able to interact with Fn on the implant surface. The aim of this study was to determine how pathogens overcome this dilemma and bind to host proteins on tissue or implant surfaces while ignoring soluble forms of the same protein. Understanding the pathogens’ ability to selectively colonize implant surfaces reveals conceptual mechanisms for how pathogens control their location and fate in the host.</p><p>In this study, we investigate Embp’s interaction with Fn. Fn circulates in bodily fluids in a compact globular form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rocco et al., 1984</xref>), while fibrillated Fn contributes to the assembly of the extracellular matrix of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baneyx et al., 2001</xref>). It is the stretching of Fn upon interacting with cell surface integrins, which exposes self-binding domains and triggers Fn fibrillation. This mechanism ensures that Fn only fibrillates in the extracellular matrix of tissue and not in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhong et al., 1998</xref>). We hypothesize that <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> interacts selectively with fibrillated Fn because FN12 is buried in the globular form of the protein. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a fibrillated ligand provides an opportunity for a multivalent interaction with the many repetitive F- and FG-repeats of the Embp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Using a model system of polymer-coated surfaces that facilitate Fn adsorption in either globular or fibrillated conformation, we probed Embp’s interaction with Fn by flow cell and advanced atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. The AFM can be used as a tactile tool for biological samples, which employs a cantilever with a sharp tip scanned over a sample with low forces in air or liquid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dufrêne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Müller and Dufrêne, 2008</xref>). We used a mode of AFM in which the sharp tip intermittently contacts the surface while scanning over it to create a 3D real-space image. Doing so enabled us to reveal the globular and fibrillar Fn conformations on polymer surfaces. Beyond the surface morphology, AFM can be used to measure the quantitative forces acting between the tip and the sample surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The latter provides insights in many biological binding events by the modification of the probe, for example, by attaching a single cell at the end of the cantilever instead of a sharp tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viljoen et al., 2021</xref>). Attaching a cell or proteins on the probe and using it to measure quantitative forces on the sample of interest are referred as single-cell (SCFS) or single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) which enables the observation of the nature of biomolecular binding events and their dynamics. Using native and recombinant Embp (rEmbp) in a series of analyses at the population, single-cell, and single-molecule levels, we confirmed that Embp selectively interacts with fibrillated Fn. The interaction is a Velcro-like mechanism where multiple binding domains must interact simultaneously to facilitate strong attachment. Such strong attachment via a single protein is particularly beneficial under high sheer stress, such as in the vascular system, and it was exactly under these conditions that Embp gave the cells an advantage. Embp homologs are present in other important pathogens capable of biofilm formation in the vascular system, and our study reveals a mechanism for how bacteria may accomplish this feat.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Embp does not interact with soluble Fn</title><p>We hypothesized that Embp selectively binds to fibrillated Fn, which would allow the bacteria to colonize surfaces via Fn without being blocked by soluble Fn in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To study the interaction between Embp and Fn, we expressed Embp fusion proteins comprised of either 5 F-repeats (Embp_5F) or 9 FG-repeats (Embp_9FG), each fused to the native export signal and anticipated C-terminal cell wall anchor region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büttner et al., 2020</xref>), in the surrogate host <italic>Staphylococcus carnosus</italic> TM300, which has no other mechanisms for attachment to Fn. The full-length Embp is too large to clone into a surrogate host, and it was therefore not possible to investigate the full-length Embp protein.

Fn consists of two nearly identical subunits linked by a pair of disulfide bonds at the C terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kar et al., 1993</xref>). Each subunit consists of three domains: F1, F2, and F3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Potts and Campbell, 1996</xref>). The globular and compact conformation of Fn is sustained by intramolecular electrostatic interactions between F1 1st-5th, F3 2nd-3rd, and F3 12th-14th repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maurer et al., 2015</xref>). Binding sites in these regions remain buried in the globular conformation; however, upon fibrillation on a surface or tissue interface, these binding sites become exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klotzsch et al., 2009</xref>). Since Embp only binds to fibrillated Fn, we hypothesize that it interacts with epitopes that are buried in the globular conformation, but become exposed when Fn fibrillates. Indeed, it was previously reported that <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> binds near the C terminal of Fn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arciola et al., 2003</xref>), and studies of recombinant Fn verified the interaction between Embp and the 12th repeat of the F3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christner et al., 2010</xref>). This repeat may be one of several interaction points and has not been confirmed in full-length Fn adsorbed in its natural conformation. To test the interaction between the 12th repeat of the F3 domain and the Fn-binding F- and FG-repeats, we repeated cell adhesion analysis on Fn-coated PEA after blocking the C-terminal heparin-binding domain II (F3 12th-14th repeat) with antibody sc-18827. Control samples were blocked with antibody F0916 specific for the F3 5th repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

As the adherence was not completely abolished by blocking the Fn-binding site, we cannot exclude the possibility that Embp interacts with other epitopes in Fn. However, the F3 12th-14th repeat is of major significance.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp) only mediates bacterial attachment to fibrillated fibronectin (Fn).</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus carnosus</italic> TM300 expressing either F- (panel <bold>A</bold>) or FG-repeats (panel <bold>B</bold>) were passed through flow cells for 2 hr before enumeration of attached cells by microscopy.

This discovery has implications for our understanding of how <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> colonizes host tissue and biomedical implants. Colonization and biofilm formation is the only virulence factor of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, and it is therefore imperative to cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Both et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Implants provide a surface for attachment and are therefore vulnerable to biofilm infections. The implant surface is immediately covered by host proteins when it is inserted into the body, and bacterial attachment is assumed to occur via specific receptor-ligand interactions between adhesins on the bacterial cell and host proteins adsorbed to the implant surface. The abundance of the same host proteins in solution poses a dilemma: How can bacteria attach to implant surfaces via proteins that are also available in solution? Based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büttner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christner et al., 2010</xref>), we hypothesized that adsorption-induced conformational changes can affect how accessible a host protein is for bacterial adhesins. In the case of Embp and Fn, the fibrillation of Fn on the implant surface is decisive for its availability as a ligand for bacterial attachment. The selective interaction with fibrillated Fn illustrates how biology has solved the need for interaction with a protein in one location (the extracellular matrix of host tissue) while ignoring the same protein in another location (the bloodstream).</p><p>Our results also challenge notion that adsorbed host proteins always assist bacterial colonization. Motivated by this assumption, much research has been devoted to developing materials or coatings that prevent protein adsorption altogether. However, our results suggest that biomaterials’ susceptibility to bacterial colonization does not only depend on protein adsorption, but also on the conformation of adsorbed proteins – a concept that is familiar to cell biologists studying adhesion of mammalian cells, but less so to microbiologists studying bacterial attachment. The role of host protein conformation in bacterial attachment could explain the conflicting results from in vitro studies of how serum proteins affect attachment of staphylococci. Some studies report increased attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paharik and Horswill, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maxe et al., 1986</xref>), while others report the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paulsson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pestrak et al., 2020</xref>). Perhaps these discrepancies reflect differences in how the underlying material affected the conformation of adsorbed serum proteins. Our study investigated bacterial attachment in a simplified model system with only one host protein, but if the concepts hold true in serum, it opens a door to controlling bacterial attachment by manipulating the conformation of adsorbed proteins, which is a more manageable task than avoiding protein adsorption entirely.</p><p>The large number of repetitive domains in Embp and its homologs in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Ebh) and <italic>Streptococcus defectivus</italic> (Emb) is unusual among bacterial adhesins, and we wondered how pathogens benefit from producing such large proteins. One benefit could be that the adhesin protrudes from the cell surface, which makes it easier to overcome electrostatic repulsion and reach its ligand. At present, no experimental evidence is available to directly demonstrate the organization of Embp on the cell surface. However, given the stretched overall architecture revealed by structural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büttner et al., 2020</xref>), it appears plausible the molecule’s length is similar to that of Ebh in <italic>S. aureus</italic>.

It is thus likely that Embp extends well beyond the electric double layer.</p><p>Another advantage of adhesins with repetitive binding domains is the possibility for multivalent interaction with the ligand. Such multivalency is only possible if the ligand is fibrillated and thereby presenting many copies of its binding domain in proximity of one another. Indeed, we showed that a single FG module interacts weekly with Fn, while the interaction force of 15 FG-repeats was 432±48 pN. We therefore propose that the selective interaction with fibrillated Fn is caused by (i) the exposure of an otherwise buried binding domain and (ii) the possibility of a stronger, multivalent interaction between multiple FG-repeats and the fibrillated ligand.</p><p>The typical strength of receptor-ligand bonds is about 20–200 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Müller et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, the interaction between 15 FG-repeats and Fn resulted in a very strong bond, and the interaction with full sized Embp is likely much stronger. Moreover, the force required to detach Embp from fibrillated Fn will depend on whether all binding repeats detach at once, or whether detachment can occur from the serial unbinding of the repeats one by one. This is akin to detachment of Velcro: The attachment is very strong, but detachment can be obtained by the serial unbinding of individual interactions. The force-distance curves can provide information about how detachment occurs. On a close inspection, it is clear that initial retraction events are the strongest and provide the highest adhesion force, indicating that multiple bonds are broken at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). But we also observe multiple subsequent perturbations as evidence to serial rupture, unfolding or stretching events. This holds true for interactions with 15 FG-repeats, but multiple perturbations are also observed for a single FG-repeat. In this case, the perturbations likely arise from the stretching and ruptures of surface-bound Fn yielding an average adhesion force of 92±27 pN, which is around the detection limit for this setup. Similar results were observed for 4 repeating units with average adhesion force of 68±43 pN. On surfaces with globular Fn, little to no interaction was observed, although 15 repeating units undergo certain irregular interactions. An explanation for the observed irregularities could be simply the protein’s self-occupation/entanglement as would often happen with long polymer chains. Additionally, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the surface distribution of Fn can vary, depending on the local density. This may be an insignificant problem for the dynamics of cell populations, however, when it comes to assessing the behavior of an individual cell or protein, the local density can affect the results.</p><p>In conclusion, the specific binding domain and repetitive structure of Embp provides an opportunity for <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> to interact selectively and strongly with fibrillated Fn, using a single adhesive protein. The open question is how this unique Velcro-like of interaction plays into the pathology of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and other pathogens that contain homologs of this protein in their genome. The genome of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is highly variable, and not all isolates possess the same repertoire of genes for host colonization and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Post et al., 2017</xref>). Embp, however, is present in two-thirds of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates from orthopedic device-related infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Post et al., 2017</xref>) and 90% of isolates from bloodstream infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salgueiro et al., 2017</xref>), which indicates some importance for its pathogenicity. In a recent study of adhesive vs. invasive <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates, Embp was not more frequent in any of the groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Both et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, there is no indication of a general role of Embp for invasiveness vs. colonization. We speculate that strong attachment via a single protein like Embp could be particularly advantageous in locations where shear forces make attachment difficult. Biofilms generally do not form in blood vessels unless there is an implant or a lesion on the endothelium. Infections like endocarditis often start with such a lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steckelberg and Wilson, 1993</xref>), which makes the site susceptible to bacterial attachment. Fibrillated Fn forms on the surface of platelets in the early stages of wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">To and Midwood, 2011</xref>), and perhaps the abundance of fibrillated Fn plays role in the elevated infection risk by <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains that carry Embp. The abundance of Embp among isolates from such infections remains to be investigated.</p><p>We show here that Embp makes a moderate contribution to attachment under low flow, leading to a 21% increase in the number of attached bacterial, while it is essential for attachment under high flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Other than Embp, only the autolysin Aae has been reported to bind Fn based on in vitro studies of purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heilmann et al., 2003</xref>), and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> 1585 does contain this gene. It is possible that Aae and even non-specific interaction forces contributed to adhesion of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> at low flow, whereas only Embp attaches with sufficient force to prevent detachment at high flow.</p><p>Previously published studies have shown that the binding force of some bacteria adhesins is promoted by external mechanical forces, such as shear stress when under flow, achieved in the ‘dock, lock, and latch’ mechanism observed for the Clf-Sdr family of adhesins when binding to fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herman-Bausier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanzieleghem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Viela, 2019</xref>). However, our data do not suggest that increased shear stress would strengthen the interaction force between Embp and Fn, as the overall attachment rate of bacteria decreases by approximately 80% at the high flow rate. Furthermore, the structural analysis of Embp carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büttner et al., 2020</xref>, points out that the Embp represents a novel mode of interaction between bacterial adhesins and host extracellular matrix proteins. Considering the giant size of Embp, one can speculate that stretching of Embp due to lateral external mechanical forces will increase its contact area with surface-organized Fn, and thereby increase the probability of successful binding events leading to adhesion. However, our data do not reveal whether this is the case. What we can conclude with certainty is that Embp is essential for attachment when host colonization is challenged by shear forces, and this observation suggests that Embp may be significant for biofilm formation in the cardiovascular system, for example, on cardiovascular grafts. Future research in animal models will determine Embp’s role in colonization of endothelial cells and implants in the cardiovascular system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, Strain background<break/><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1585 WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15752207/">15752207</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC12228</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clinical isolate</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1585Pxyl/tet <italic>embp</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19943904/">19943904</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expresses Embp from inducible promotor</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Δ<italic>embp</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33082256/">33082256</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Deficient of Embp</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/><italic>Staphylococcus carnosus</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TM300 × pEmbp_5F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33082256/">33082256</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant Embp fragment (5 F-repeats) expressed in surrogate host</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/><italic>Staphylococcus carnosus</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TM300 × pEmbp_9FG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33082256/">33082256</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant Embp fragment (9 FG-repeats) expressed in surrogate host</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fibronectin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog #

The concentration of Fn (20 µg ml<sup>–1</sup>) results in very small IR absorbances of the polymer layers, therefore, the spectra of stacks of eight coated CaF2 windows were measured simultaneously. For this, eight spin-coated CaF2 window surfaces with PMA and PEA were incubated for 1 hr with the 20 µg ml<sup>–1</sup> Fn solution in PBS prepared in D<sub>2</sub>O (d-PBS hereafter), after rinsing the surfaces with d-PBS and placed four sets of windows (spaced by 25 µm Teflon spacers that were filled by d-PBS, with the polymer and protein-coated sides submerged in the d-PBS) in a custom-made IR cell. The incubated sample spectra were background-corrected by subtracting the spectra of the same neat d-PBS loaded windows. Before subtraction, we (i) corrected for small differences in the overall transmission of the protein and background samples (due to e.g. small differences in the amount of scattering of the IR beam, which can become significant with eight consecutive windows) by subtracting the absorption at 7500 cm<sup>–1</sup>, and (ii) corrected for small differences in the exact water layer thickness by scaling the spectra using a spectrally isolated absorption band of the D<sub>2</sub>O (the <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub> combination band of the solvent’s OD bending and stretching mode 1 at 3840 cm<sup>–1</sup>) to determine the scaling factor. But there is no reason to assume that the water and polymer layers thicknesses are related. Therefore, the resulting background-corrected amide-I (1600–1700 cm<sup>–1</sup>) PEA + Fn spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) still contains a tail of the 1733 cm<sup>–1</sup> ester peak, which is absent in the resulting PMA + Fn spectrum. This is (i) because there is approximately six times more PEA present than PMA (as indicated by a least-square fit that minimized the total intensity of the subtraction of the PMA from the PEA background spectra in the 1700–1760 cm<sup>–1</sup> region, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>), and (ii) because the Fn incubation results in a slight loss of polymer, which is impossible to compensate for well by subtraction of the polymer spectra, because the 1733 cm<sup>–1</sup> ester peak shape is affected by the presence of the protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4d</xref>). The broadening of this peak by Fn incubation is probably because the ester groups in contact with the protein are slightly shifted with respect to the more buried ester groups that are not changed by the protein adsorption, resulting in two subpeaks that are slightly offset in frequency. Even though the PMA layer appears to be thinner and/or less dense, it will probably still be composed of many monolayers (as indicated by the XPS measurements), so this difference in thickness is not expected to affect the protein’s interfacial behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of bacterial attachment under flow</title><p>Ibidi sticky-slide VI 0.4 chambers (Ibidi, Germany) were glued to polymer-coated glass by using an equivalent mixture of silicon (DOWSIL 732 – Dow corning) and UV activating glue (Loctite 3106 Light Cure Adhesive).

Three replicate samples were analyzed, and individually grown bacterial cultures were used on each replicate.</p><p>The first experiment compared attachment of <italic>S. carnosus</italic> TM300 × pEmbp_5F and <italic>S. carnosus</italic> TM300 × pEmbp_9FG to PEA and PMA surfaces with and without Fn to investigate if the Fn-binding domains of Embp interacted selectively with the fibrillated form of Fn. The second experiment investigated which domain of Fn Embo interacted with. Previous studies had shown that that Embp binds to the F3 12th-14th domain of Fn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christner et al., 2010</xref>), however, this experiment was only performed with recombinant fragments of Fn and not the full-length protein. We therefore investigated the role of this Fn domain in the attachment of bacteria via Embp. Flow cell experiments were carried out as described above, comparing attachment via F or FG to fibrillated Fn directly or after blocking for F3 12th-14th domain within IgG antibodies (anti-Fn, sc-18827, Santa Cruz Biotech). As a control, fibrillated Fn was blocked with IgG antibodies specific for another Fn domain (F3 5th domain). The unbound antibodies were removed with PBS (6 ml hr<sup>–1</sup>, 15 min) before investigating bacterial attachment as described above.</p><p>The final experiment addressing attachment under flow compared the attachment of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> 1585 Pxyl/tet <italic>embp</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Δ<italic>embp</italic>. The strains were inoculated from single colonies into BHI broth (amended with 5 μg ml<sup>‒1</sup> erythromycin and 200 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> AHT for the Pxyl/tet <italic>embp</italic> strain) and grown overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS to OD<sub>600</sub>=0.3, transferred to the syringe pump and passed through the flow cells at either 1 or 18 ml min<sup>–1</sup> flow rate for 1 hr followed by a 30 min PBS washing step of 6 or 36 ml min<sup>–1</sup>, respectively. Attached cells were imaged by brightfield microscopy and by CLSM after staining with 20× SYBR Green II (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Hydrodynamic radius</title><p><italic>S. epidermidis</italic> 1585 Pxyl/tet <italic>embp</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Δ<italic>embp</italic> were prepared as described above, transferred to cuvettes and analyzed by dynamic light scattering (Folded Capillary Zeta Cell, Malvern, PA).

For SCFS measurement, colloidal probes with 10 µm glass beads (SHOCON-BSG-B-5, Applied NanoStructures Inc, Mountain View, CA) were selected and coated by polymerizing a dopamine solution of 4 mg ml<sup>–1</sup> dopamine hydrochloride (99%, Sigma-Aldrich, H8502) in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.5, and then calibrated in situ for single-cell attachment. <italic>S. carnosus</italic> TM300 expressing 5 F- and 9 FG-repeats were subcultured from overnight cultures and incubated for 6 hr in fresh media, harvested and resuspended in PBS as described above. A 100 µl drop of this solution was placed on a glass slide and incubated for 10 min, after which the unadsorbed bacteria were removed by rinsing with PBS. A colloidal probe was immersed and positioned on top of a single cell with the help of inverted optical microscope. The probe was made to contact a single cell for 5 min then retracted after the cell attachment. Once a cell was picked up (confirmed by optical microscopy), the substrate was changed to Fn-coated surfaces and SCFS was executed. The acquired force-distance plots were processed using the Nanowizard’s (JPK, Germany) own processing software. Experiments were conducted on two replicate samples (minimum 20 replicate force curves on each).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cloning and purification of F- and FG-repeats</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> 1585 WT strain using the Qiagen DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) by following the instructions of the manufacturer. The only exception made in the kit protocol was that cells were lysed with 15 U of lysostaphin, which was added to buffer P1. The nucleotide sequence of 1, 4, and 15 repeats of the FG-repeats was amplified from genomic DNA using primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) with Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Kit (NEB – E0553S). The PCR products were purified with GenElute PCR Clean-Up Kit (Sigma-Aldrich NA1020). The expression vector pET302/NT-His was digested with EcoR1 restriction enzyme (NEB R0101S) and run on a 1.5% agarose gel. The digested vector was purified from the gel using the GenElute Gel Extraction Kit (Sigma-Aldrich NA1111). The purified PCR product of each rEmbp was ligated with the digested vector in a ratio of 3:1 using the Gibson assembly ligation matrix mix (NEB E5510S). Each ligation reaction was incubated for 1 hr at 50°C. The ligated products were transformed into the chemically competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain (Top10). The colony PCR was performed with REDTaq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich R2523) using the T7 promoter primer as forward and the T7 terminator primer as the reverse. Cells from each selected colony were grown overnight in LB with 100 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> ampicillin, and a plasmid miniprep was prepared using GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Thermo Scientific K0702). Plasmids were sequenced with both T7 promoter and terminator primers by the Eurofins A/S (Hamburg, Germany). The plasmid of each Embp construct was transformed into an expression system (chemically competent <italic>E. coli</italic>, BL21-DE3). A single colony of the transformants was used to inoculate 2 l of LB with 100 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> ampicillin until the OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. For the overexpression, cells were induced with 1 M IPTG, and incubated for 16 hr on 28°C in shaking incubator at 180 rpm. Cells were harvested and lysed in binding buffer with sonication (30% amplitude, 15 s off, 15 s on) for 3 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered with a 0.22 μm syringe filter and run on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column using ÄKTA Purifier-10 purification system. The column was washed with 5–8 column volumes, and the fusion proteins Embp was then eluted in fractions using elution buffer. Fractions of each rEmbp were pooled, concentrated with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter tubes with a cut-off 3 kDa (Millipore Sigma UFC9003). Proteins were further purified with (HiTrap Q FF) column by anion exchange (IEX) chromatography using IEX binding and elution buffer, followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with column (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL) using MES buffer on ÄKTA Purifier-10 purification system. After each column, the elution fractions were run on SDS-PAGE to check the purification quality.

For the SMFS experiments, the probes were prepared by attaching rEmbp fragments of various lengths with the use of 6× His-NTA interaction. The procedure was similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Obataya et al., 2005</xref>. In short, silicon probes were cleaned with ozone, and UV light then kept in one to one isopropyl alcohol and ethanol mixture overnight. Tips were rinsed in deionized water and air-dried, after which they were functionalized with 2% (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane in EtOH for 30 min. Probes were then exposed to maleimide-C3-NTA in 50% DMF/100 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5±0.1) overnight. Ten mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> was used to chelate the NTA groups on the tip, which was then dipped in bovine serum albumin (1 mg ml<sup>–1</sup> in PBS) to passivate the surface. The attachment of 6× His-tagged rEmbp fragments with 1, 4, or 15 repeating units of Fn-binding repeats was completed by 1 hr incubation of respective samples at room temperature. After a probe for each repeating unit was prepared, force-distance curves were collected on three replicate samples and processed, as mentioned above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Visualization, Resources, Writing – original draft, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – original draft, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing – original draft, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-76164-transrepform1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Figure 1: Source data file contains original image files.

It is important to determine how shear-stress impacts on the strength of the bond between Embp and fibronectin, which can be performed using AFM. For MSCRAMMs such as SdrG and ClfB, shear forces actually promote strong binding by simulating the final stage of the dock-latch-lock process, which should be addressed and may require experimentation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree that the discussion should be elaborated with considerations of how the Embp‐Fn interaction compares with interaction mechanisms previously described for other bacterial adhesins and human ECM proteins.</p><p>The common binding mechanisms are the tandem‐zipper (e.g. between FnBP in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and Fn), and the “dock‐lock‐and‐latch” (DLL) mechanism between the Clf‐SdrG subfamily of MSCRAMMS and fibrinogen. The DLL mechanism is particularly interesting under flow, as the strength of the bond increases under mechanical stress (https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.12663, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2015.12.009, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00360, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03080).</p><p>The interaction between Embp and Fn, however, represents a novel mode of interaction between bacterial adhesins and host ECM proteins. Structural analyses (Büttner et al., 2020) do not suggest that it follows either the DLL or tandem zipper mechanisms, and it interacts with a different part of Fn, in volving FN12 near the C‐terminal of Fn which has never been implicated in interaction with bacterial Fn‐binding proteins before. Büttner et al., 2020 therefore argue that the Embp‐Fn interaction represents a novel principle in pathogen‐ECM interaction.</p><p>When investigating <italic>S. epidermidis’</italic> attachment to Fn under flow, we observed that the number of attached bacteria decreased at high flow, but the relative importance of Embp increased. We have re‐run the statistical analysis and discovered an error in our initial submission. Initially we deemed the contribution of Embp to attachment at low flow to not be significant, but a two‐tailed T‐test assuming unequal variance revealed a P value of 0.03. Hence, at low flow, Embp increased the number of attached bacteria by approximately 21%. Attachment at low flow was therefore primarily caused by other mechanisms, and one could argue that Embp contributes with approximately 20%. At high flow, there was no attachment of bacteria lacking Embp, making Embp solely responsible for attachment. The overall attachment rate at high flow was only 23% of the attachment rate at low flow. This number is consistent with the attachment rate one would predict if all other attachment mechanisms except Embp was eliminated. Our data therefore provides no indication that the attachment strength of an individual Embp protein is stronger at higher flow.</p><p>In preparation for adhesion experiments with <italic>S.</italic> carnosus expressing fractions of Embp, conducted initial adhesion experiments to Fn‐coated surfaces different flow rates (3, 6, and 12 ml/min), and we observed higher adhesion rates at the lowest flow rate, which was subsequently used for the experiments depicted in figure 4. The data was not recorded and only used to choose a flowrate for the subsequent experiments, but the observation strengthens our notion that Embp does not adhere more strongly at increasing flow rates.</p><p>We can speculate how flow might affect Embp‐mediated attachment. Considering that Embp contains 50 Fn‐binding repeats and that it is predicted to have a rod‐like structure (Büttner et al., 2020), the lateral force exerted by flow might stretch Embp across the Fn‐covered surface and increase the chance of multiple interactions. Such stretcing may occur at both flow‐rates used in our experiment, but it would be interesting to address how flow vs static conditions affect Embpmediated attachment in the future. Such an experiment requires a bacterial model that expressess full‐length Embp while lacking other Fn‐interacting mechanisms, and this model is not currently available. Embp is too large to be expressed at full length in a surrogate host, and development of such a model would therefore require knock‐out of all other adhesion mechanisms in the S. epidermidis strain carrying Embp. This work is therefore beyond the scope of our current paper.</p><p>We have elaborated the Discussion section of the manuscript with the points made above.</p><p>The last part of the Discussion section now reads:</p><p>“Previously published studies have shown that the binding force of some bacteria adhesins is promoted by external mechanical forces, such as shear stress when under flow, achieved in the “dock, lock and latch” mechanism observed for the Clf‐Sdr family of adhesins when binding to fibrinogen [44‐47]. However, our data do not suggest that increased shear stress would strengthen the interaction force between Embp and Fn, as the overall attachment rate of bacteria decreases by approximately 80% at the high flow rate. Furthermore, the structural analysis of Embp carried out by Büttner et al., [1] points out that the Embp represents a novel mode of interaction between bacterial adhesins and host ECM proteins. Considering the giant size of Embp, one can speculate that stretching of Embp due to lateral external mechanical forces will increase its contact area with surface‐organized Fn, and thereby increase the probability of successful binding events leading to adhesion. However, our data do not reveal whether this is the case. What we can conclude with certainty is that Embp is essential for attachment when host colonization is challenged by shear forces, and this observation suggests that Embp may be significant for biofilm formation in the cardiovascular system, e.g. on cardiovascular grafts. Future research in animal models will determine Embp’s role in colonization of endothelial cells and implants in the cardiovascular system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would aid the discussion if the authors could discuss the population biology of strains expressing Embp. I assume it is not on a mobilizable island…is it found primarily in ST2 strains, etc. I think this is important, have we selected strains that can adhere to foreign bodies? is Embp expression part of that selection process? The brief discussion related to the function of Embp and adherence to native, damaged tissue, which may have been the original function of this protein, is very effective.</p></disp-quote><p>Recent work from the Rohde lab has demonstrated that while there is a specific ST signature related to invasive <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains, only few genetic elements were associated with invasive <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates. Embp, however, is not enriched in invasive isolates, and can be found in invasive and colonizing isolates in almost equal percentages (Both et al., (2021) PloS Pathogens 17(2)). We have elaborated the Discussion section to include this information. The relevant paragraph now reads:</p><p>“The genome of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is highly variable, and not all isolates possess the same repertoire of genes for host colonization and biofilm formation [36]. Embp, however, is present in two thirds of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates from orthopedic device‐related infections [36] and 90 % of isolates from blood stream infections [9], which indicates some importance for its pathogenicity. In a recent study of adhesive vs invasive <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates, Embp was not more frequent in any of the groups [28]. Hence, there is no indication of a general role of Embp for invasiveness vs colonization. We can speculate that strong attachment via a single protein like Embp could be particularly advantageous in locations where high shear forces make attachment difficult, such as in the blood stream. Biofilms generally do not form in blood vessels, unless there is an implant or a lesion on the endothelium. Infections like endocarditis often start with such a lesion [37], which makes the site susceptible to bacterial attachment. Fibrillated Fn forms on the surface of platelets in the early stages of wound healing [38], and perhaps the abundance of fibrillated Fn plays role in the elevated infection risk by <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains that carry Embp. The abundance of Embp among isolates from such infections remains to be investigated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are a few concerns that I have, overall, I think the manuscript will be very impactful.</p><p>1.

Future research in animal models will determine Embp’s role in host and implant colonization in the cardiovascular system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would aid the discussion if the group could discuss the population biology of strains expressing embp. I assume it is not on a mobilizable island…is it found primarily in ST2 strains, etc. I think this is important--have we selected for strains that can adhere to foreign bodies? is Embp expression part of that selection process? I was glad to see the brief discussion related to the function of Embp and adherence to native, damaged tissue, which may have been the original function of this protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Recent work from the Rohde lab has demonstrated that while there is a specific ST signature related to invasive <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains, only few genetic elements were associated with invasive <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates. Embp, however, is not enriched in invasive isolates, and can be found in invasive and colonizing isolates in almost equal percentages (Both et al., (2021) PloS Pathogens 17(2)). We have elaborated the Discussion section to include this information. The relevant paragraph now reads:</p><p>“The genome of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is highly variable, and not all isolates possess the same repertoire of genes for host colonization and biofilm formation [36]. Embp, however, is present in two thirds of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates from orthopedic device‐related infections [36] and 90 % of isolates from blood stream infections [9], which indicates some importance for its pathogenicity. In a recent study of adhesive vs invasive <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> isolates, Embp was not more frequent in any of the groups [28]. Hence, there is no indication of a general role of Embp for invasiveness vs colonization. We can speculate that strong attachment via a single protein like Embp could be particularly advantageous in locations where high shear forces make attachment difficult, such as in the blood stream. Biofilms generally do not form in blood vessels, unless there is an implant or a lesion on the endothelium. Infections like endocarditis often start with such a lesion [37], which makes the site susceptible to bacterial attachment. Fibrillated Fn forms on the surface of platelets in the early stages of wound healing [38], and perhaps the abundance of fibrillated Fn plays role in the elevated infection risk by <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains that carry Embp. The abundance of Embp among isolates from such infections remains to be investigated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 85-An advantage</p></disp-quote><p>OK</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 101, italicize S. epidermidis</p></disp-quote><p>OK</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>–The role of AFM in elucidating the interactions between staphylococcal wall anchored proteins and ligands should be discussed in the introduction and discussion.

As the reviewer suggested, we have added the rationale behind using advanced atomic force microscopy methods to investigate the surface morphology and quantitative biomolecular interactions and referenced high‐impact publications for example by Dufrene <italic>et al.,</italic> as to support the rationale. The quoted texts below are added to the manuscript’s introduction and Discussion sections. The last paragraph of the Introduction now reads:</p><p>“In this study, we investigate Embp’s interaction with Fn. Fn circulates in bodily fluids in a compact globular form [13], while fibrillated Fn contributes to the assembly of the extracellular matrix of tissue [14]. It is the stretching of Fn upon interacting with cell surface integrins, which exposes selfbinding domains and trigger Fn fibrillation. This mechanism ensures that Fn only fibrillates in the extracellular matrix of tissue and not in the blood stream [15]. We hypothesize that <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> interacts selectively with fibrillated Fn, and that a fibrillated ligand provides an opportunity for a multivalent interaction with the many repetitive F and FG repeats of the Embp. Using a model system of polymer‐coated surfaces that facilitate Fn adsorption in either globular or fibrillated conformation, we probed Embp’s interaction with Fn by flow cell and advanced Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) experiments. The AFM can be used as a tactile tool for biological samples, which employs a cantilever with a sharp tip scanned over a sample with low forces in air or liquid environments[16, 17]. We used a mode of AFM in which the sharp tip intermittently contacts the surface while scanning over it to create a 3D real‐space image. Doing so enabled us to reveal the globular and fibrillar Fn conformations on polymer surfaces. Beyond the surface morphology, AFM can be used to measure the quantitative forces acting between the tip and the sample surface [18]. The latter, provides insights in many biological binding events by the modification of the probe, for example by attaching a single‐cell at the end of the cantilever instead of a sharp tip [19]. Attaching a cell or proteins on the probe and using it to measure quantitative forces on the sample of interest are referred as Single Cell or Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy which enables the observation of the nature of biomolecular binding events and their dynamics. Using native and recombinant Embp in a series of analyses at the population‐, single‐cell‐, and single‐molecule levels, we confirmed that Embp selectively interacts with fibrillated Fn. The interaction is a Velcro‐like mechanism where multiple binding‐domains must interact simultaneously to facilitate strong attachment. Such strong attachment via a single protein is particularly beneficial under high sheer stress, such as in the vascular system, and it was exactly under these conditions that Embp gave the cells an advantage. Embp homologs are present in other important pathogens capable of biofilm formation in the vascular system, and our study reveals a mechanism for how bacteria accomplish this feat.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The AFM experiments should be more detailed as exemplified by Dufrene's papers</p><p>The rationale for the application of AFM to study adhesin-ligand interactions should be explained simply for the non-expert. Three different approaches have been employed – non-parametric contact mode imaging of immobilized Fn (Figure 2), single cell force microscopy and single molecule force microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>This valuable comment by the reviewer aligns well with the previous one, therefore we have addressed them simultaneously. Please see the reply to the above comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The 3D structure of the Fn binding domains of Embp has been published by one of the co-authors of the current study. To advance the state of the art in a substantial way the molecular details of the binding interaction of Embp with the type III Fn domain should be provided or at least modelled.</p></disp-quote><p>We validate the interaction of F and FG repeats with the FNIII(12‐14) domain using full‐length Fn in this study.
