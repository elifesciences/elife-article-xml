However, for complex olfactory systems, it is unknown what proportion of primary olfactory sensory neurons can individually drive avoidance or attraction. Similarly, the rules that govern behavioral responses to receptor combinations are unclear. We used optogenetic analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to map the behavior elicited by olfactory-receptor neuron (ORN) classes: just one-fifth of ORN-types drove either avoidance or attraction. Although wind and hunger are closely linked to olfaction, neither had much effect on single-class responses. Several pooling rules have been invoked to explain how ORN types combine their behavioral influences; we activated two-way combinations and compared patterns of single- and double-ORN responses: these comparisons were inconsistent with simple pooling. We infer that the majority of primary olfactory sensory neurons have neutral behavioral effects individually, but participate in broad, odor-elicited ensembles with potent behavioral effects arising from complex interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>olfactory receptor neuron</kwd><kwd>valence</kwd><kwd>odor</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AGA-SINGA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tumkaya</surname><given-names>Tayfun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Block grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tumkaya</surname><given-names>Tayfun</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Hyungwon</given-names></name><name><surname>Claridge-Chang</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education -

These diverse sensory inputs are thought to interact with each other, with previously stored information, and with the internal physiological state of the animal to elicit a more or less appropriate behavioral response. Two central problems of neuroscientific research are (1) how individual sensations influence behavior and (2) how multiple streams of sensory information are reconciled into meaningful behavior. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system is an effective model to address these critical questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisthen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), facilitated by powerful genetic approaches, the ability to handle large sample sizes, and the numerical simplicity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural systems. Flies detect odors with their antennae and maxillary palps, which together contain ~1300 olfactory-receptor neurons (ORNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lai et al., 2008</xref>). The odor-response profile of each adult ORN is determined by one of ~45 possible receptor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gomez-Diaz et al., 2018</xref>). ORNs sharing the same receptor type converge on a glomerulus in the antennal lobe, where they synapse with local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2000</xref>). Innervating throughout the antennal lobe and connecting multiple glomeruli, the LNs facilitate both excitatory and inhibitory interactions between glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Groschner and MiesenbÃ¶ck, 2019</xref>). This modified information is relayed by the PNs to higher brain centers, namely mushroom bodies and the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wong et al., 2002</xref>). The distinct nature of the ORN types allows us to consider each type as a single channel of information input. Mapping how ORNs steer behavior would inform a broader understanding of how sensory circuits influence behavioral output.</p><p>Odor-induced activity in ORNs can trigger approach and avoidance behaviors, collectively referred to as behavioral âvalenceâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>). At least some ORN-driven behaviors appear to follow simple rules: a subset of receptors respond specifically to single odorants, and their ORNs individually drive innate valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ache and Young, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grabe and Sachse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haddad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haverkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suh et al., 2007</xref>). These acutely tuned, strongly valent ORN classes include neurons tuned to danger (e.g. toxic odorants) and pheromones. Given the direct relationship between such odors and valence, these ORN types and their associated downstream pathways have been termed âlabeled linesâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grabe and Sachse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hildebrand and Shepherd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>). The existence of labeled lines proves that at least some olfactory behaviors follow simple ORN-activity rules.</p><p>Unlike labeled lines, many other olfactory receptors are broadly tuned to respond to many odorants, and most pure odorants evoke responses across many ORN classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>). As most olfactory behavior relies on activity in ORN groups, there is the outstanding question of how individual channels contribute to an odorâs overall valence. It is not known how much more complex multi-ORN valence is compared to the relative simplicity of labeled-line behavior. Earlier studies have looked at whether multi-glomerular olfactory valence could be explained by statistical models of ORN or PN activity patterns. Depending on the type of experiments, some found that valence could be explained by simple rules, for example weighted summation of larval ORN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>). Other studies found no relationship between single-glomerulus properties and odor-evoked behavior, or invoked more complex models of antennal-lobe function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuebler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer and Galizia, 2011</xref>). Due to the manyâmany relationship of most odorants and ORNs, using natural odors to isolate single-ORN valence effects is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haddad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thoma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turner and Ray, 2009</xref>). One study overcame this challenge by activating single-ORN types optogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>). Using eight attractive ORN types the researchers found that two-way ORN valence combinations follow either summation or max-pooling; this supports the idea that olfactory valence arises from simple rules. Thus, both simple mechanisms (labeled lines, summation) and complex inter-channel interactions have been invoked to explain olfactory valence, but their relative importance remains controversial.</p><p>The present study had two primary aims: to map which single ORN types drive valence; and to examine the extent to which simple pooling rules govern ORNâvalence combinations. To do so, we measured the valence coding of the primary olfactory system by optogenetically stimulating single ORN classes. In the wild, olfaction typically occurs in windy environments, and is influenced by hunger state, so we explored whether single-type-ORN valence is similarly contingent on these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sengupta, 2013</xref>). We activated pairs of ORN types to investigate how their combinations influence valence, and built statistical models of ORN interactions. All the results indicate that ORNâvalence computations are complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An optogenetic behavior assay reports on sensory valence</title><p>We investigated which single classes of primary chemosensory neurons can elicit preference behavior, and the capability of the present experimental system to replicate prior studies. Generating <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines that express the red-light-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson (Chr) in different receptor neurons, we tested whether individual neuronal types drive attraction or avoidance. Flies were presented with a choice between light and dark environments in a wind- and light-induced self-administration response (WALISAR) apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Only one pheromone-receptor class showed sexual dimorphism: activation of Or47b neurons (sensors of an aphrodisiac pheromone) was attractive to males, while females were indifferent.</p><p>Together, these results indicate that in isolation, most ORN classes do not drive valence. The presence of six known valent ORN types in the 10 hits, and the predominance of neutral ORNs suggest that most olfactory channels influence behavior only when activated in concert as part of an odor-evoked ensemble.

Moreover, as the light intensity increased, the Î² points shifted further away from the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) and, in some cases, flipped dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). For these ORN-type pairs, increasing intensity is associated with two phenomena: one of the two ORNs tends to become more dominant; and the combination rules are different at different activity levels. Thus, the interactions between ORN pairs vary depending on receptor identity and stimulus intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Single ORN information predicts odor behavior poorly</title><p>The variable interactions between pairs of ORN types support the idea that olfactory valence is determined by complex dynamics in multiple layers of downstream circuits. So we anticipated that models using ORN activity would not be strongly predictive of odor valence. To explore this, we drew on data from two previous studies that used a panel of 110 odorants: one used the odor panel to make physiological recordings from 24 ORN typesâof which 23 were tested for behavioral valence in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>); the other study measured behavioral valence for all 110 odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>). We adopted a partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), to reduce the 23-dimensional feature space into fewer latent variables (LVs) with internal correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Various models based on various numbers of LVs could partially predict odor preference. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model with eight LVs had the best performance, with an adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj) of 0.23. While the two-dimensional space defined by the first two LVs supports a partial separation of aversive and attractive odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), the low R2adj score indicates that linear combinations of the available ORN-activity patterns are only weakly predictive of valence. The poor predictiveness of both the MLR model and a support-vector regression model were further confirmed by cross-validation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> - Sheet 1). For non-linear models, performance was limited by the relatively small sample size: two models with non-linear kernels (polynomial and radial basis function) had high error rates and learning curves indicating overfit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> - Sheet 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Lastly, we asked whether the models could be improved with incorporation of the optogenetic valence data. Although valence-weighting improved the R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj</sub> of the MLR model from 0.23 to 0.33, the predictive performances of the models were not improved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> - Sheet 2). This further supports the hypothesis that linear combinations of ORN activity can only account for a minority of odor preference.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Most ORN classes have no individual effect on valence</title><p>This studyâs primary goal was to identify the proportion of ORNs that can drive valence behavior individually. The screen results indicate that 10/45 of single ORN-types have the ability to influence locomotor preference. Thus, most ORN types are not individually valent. Of the 10 valent ORN types, 6 have previously known roles in valence: two sensors each for pheromones, chemical-threat odorants, and food-aroma molecules. So the past two decades of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfaction research have already identified a large proportion of strongly valent ORN types. The screen identified four novel valent ORNs (85d, 59 c, 35 a, 47 a) with ligands and ecological roles yet to be determined. Around 60% of pure odorants are valent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>), while at least three of the known valent ORN classes (those for geosmin, CO<sub>2</sub>, and cVA) are specialized to bind specific ligands exclusively. This disconnect between a preponderance of valent odorants (~60% of odorants) and the scarcity of broadly tuned, valent ORN types ( â¤ 15%) implies that most olfactory valence arises from combined activity in multiple ORN classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathew et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parnas et al., 2013</xref>). This idea is also supported by the Orco activation result showing that broad activation across ~70% of ORNs drives strong attraction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Wind and hunger effects on ORN valence are minor</title><p>Another goal of this study was to ask whether two contextual factorsâwind and hungerâwould increase olfactory valence. Prior studies observed that the Orco neurons are either not optogenetically valent or that airflow is essential for valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suh et al., 2007</xref>). However, our experiments showed that olfactory neurons elicit valence without airflow, and that wind has little to no amplifying effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Note also that even though <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae behavioral tests are routinely performed in still air, they display both olfactory behavior and optogenetic ORN valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hernandez-Nunez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathew et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the overall evidence indicates that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs influence valence behavior even without wind. A second factor, hunger, has also been reported to increase olfactory attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gelperin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ko et al., 2015</xref>). However, in the single-ORN screen, starvation had modest effects on valence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If anything, valence was somewhat lower for several attractive ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). There are at least two plausible explanations as to why starvation did not affect many single-ORN valences. First, the difference in olfactory responses between fed and starved animals might only be pronounced for weaker olfactory stimuli: one study showed that the ethyl acetate (EA) response difference between fed and starved flies declines as the EA concentration increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty, 2010</xref>). So optogenetic activation might be too strong to observe the starvation effect. Second, ORNs likely have less influence in isolation. Co-activated glomeruli modulate each other via lateral inhibition and excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Groschner and MiesenbÃ¶ck, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wilson, 2008</xref>). As most odors activate multiple ORN types, any hunger effect might require these lateral signals. One study found that five vinegar-responsive ORNs are modulated by hunger only when activated in concert, but not when they are activated in subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Root et al., 2011</xref>). In our results, a notable exception was the hunger switch of Orco valence in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The absence of hunger amplification in single-ORN valenceâand its presence in female Orco valenceâalso suggests that the potentiating effects of hunger on olfactory attraction might only operate on multi-ORN stimuli like Orco activation and natural odors. That neither wind nor hunger increased valence of single-ORNs verifies that the majority of single receptor types, on their own, do not convey valence information. Together, the single-ORN results support the idea that most odor-guided locomotion arises from the broad activation of ORNs simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How is ORN information combined?</title><p>Many individual odorants bind multiple olfactory receptors, and most natural odors are complex blends that activate receptors broadly, such that odors typically activate multiple ORN classes. A number of groups have constructed statistical models of the relationship between initial layers of olfactory systems and their eventual valent locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuebler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kundu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer and Galizia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mohamed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Riffell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thoma et al., 2014</xref>). The existence of labeled lines indicates that, at least for some odorants and their receptors, ORNs can have a deterministic effect on valence. In a model of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval olfaction, the weighted summation of ORN activity in just five of 21 receptors could be used to predict odor valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>). In adults, an optogenetic study of ORNs reported that combination valences could be explained by summation and/or max-pooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>), further supporting a direct relationship. Summation and max-pooling correspond to special cases of two-way combination weightings of (0.5, 0.5) and (0, 1), respectively; the present analysis found little support for such equal or all-or-none weightings. Rather, the ORN combinations have diverse, intermediate valence weights within the weight space. Moreover, these weights shift as the stimulus intensity increases, and appear to even swap dominancy at different intensities. These features suggest complex ORN-channel interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible models of ORN combination</title><p>The variability of Î² values across a range of stimuli indicates that (1) single-ORNs can contribute a dynamic range of weights when co-activated, (2) the experiment captured particular instances of ORN activation from these many possible neural response mechanisms, and (3) that many ORN combinations likely share downstream targets. Therefore, we can cautiously infer that the underlying neural network is multifactorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>) and perhaps context-specific. Several kinds of complex architectures and dynamics could contribute to multi-ORN valence. The increasing dominance of one ORN observed in some of the pairs suggests competitive, antagonistic interactions between channels, such as those mediated by broad lateral synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>) or ephaptic inhibition between neighboring ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Su et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, motor programs associated with valence might only require a subset of channel combinations to be active, with the remainder playing ancillary roles. However, reverse-engineering the exact combination mechanisms through estimated Î² values would require a larger set of experiments with distinct stimuli. Translating the patterns of Î² shifts into the specific structure of the neural network carries the risk of over-interpreting the current data set.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Technical differences between studies</title><p>It is relevant to note that several of our conclusions on olfactory valence, notably the nature of ORN-valence combination, diverge from those made in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>). Along with sampling error, it is possible that these discrepancies can be attributed to differences in experimental design and analysis, some of which are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> - Sheet 3. Here, we discuss the different ways the optogenetic valence effect was controlled. As Chrimson was not available at the time, the earlier study used Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), which requires intense blue light (up to 1500 ÂµW/mm<sup>2</sup>) that adds significant heat and elicits strong responses in the fly visual system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> - Sheet 3). As these stimuli can profoundly alter behavior, especially during a lengthy illumination regime (64 min total), the researchers used genetically blind flies and an infrared laser for compensatory heat. While these technical measures were prudent, they were used largely in place of genetic controls: relative to the experimental animals (N = ~ 2512), the study used few responder UAS controls (N = 88) and no driver Gal4 controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> - Sheet 3). The earlier study appears to have averaged technical replicates to represent behavioral variation, a procedure that under-reports variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell, 2016</xref>). The present study dealt with these issues with two changes. First, it was able to make use of the Chrimson channel, which requires lower light intensity and a red wavelength to which the fly eye is less receptive. Second, all non-optogenetic effects were accounted for with balanced experimental, driver, and responder groups (N = ~ 5148 in each group). In our opinion, our approach of testing all three groups in sufficient sample sizesâand using them to calculate effect sizesâenables the exclusion of all confounding influences, including heat, visual effects, and genetic background.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This study incorporates at least four assumptions that potentially limit the generalizability of the findings. First, the use of narrow chambers effectively canalizes fly locomotion into one dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>). While this simplifies analysis, it could either alter valence, and/or increase locomotion relative to either broader chambers or behavior in the wild. Second, although the olfactory receptors have been shown to express in specific ORN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>), we cannot rule out that they might express elsewhere in the fly nervous system, so some of the valence results could be the result of activity in several neuron types. Third, optogenetic light is not equivalent to odor stimulation: there may be differences in firing rate, response dynamics, or other features of ORN stimulation that mean these data are not directly generalizable to odor-elicited activity. Fourth, no electrophysiological recordings were made from the optogenetically activated ORNs, so their firing rates relative to odor-elicited activity are unknown; published recordings from optogenetic and odor stimuli suggest an approximately five-fold difference in firing rates in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Do single-ORN-class properties govern valence?</title><p>While larval valence has been predicted with a summation model, similar models for olfactory behavior in other systems have not been successful.

In adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, an analysis of the physiological and behavioral responses to 110 odors found that ORN activities and odor valence have no linear correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that valence determination could arise from a downstream computation, for example in the antennal lobe, where incoming ORN activity patterns and outgoing projection-neuron activity patterns are dissimilar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Groschner and MiesenbÃ¶ck, 2019</xref>). Indeed, the physiological-activity patterns in projection neurons have been reported to be at least partially predictive of odor valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parnas et al., 2013</xref>), leading to the idea that the antennal lobe extracts valence features. To examine this, we modeled published ORN activity and valence data sets, finding that linear models of ORN activity data could account for a minor fraction of olfactory-behavior variance, and this was not substantially improved with single-class ORN valence information. All the observations in the present study point to a minimal role for simple pooling rules, and support the idea that odor valence is primarily governed by complex circuit dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>Flies were raised on fly medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Temasek Life Sciences Laboratories, 2018</xref>) at 25 Â°C in a 12 hr light:12 hr dark cycle.

Two rectangular assemblies (11.5 Ã 14.5 Ã 0.3 cm) were cut from acrylic sheets; each assembly contained 26 chambers (50 Ã 4 Ã 3 mm), herein referred to as WALISAR chambers. Airflow inlets and outlets were milled into the ends of each chamber. Optogenetic illumination was achieved using LEDs [LUXEON Rebel LEDs on a SinkPAD-II 10 mm Square Base; red (617 nm), green (530 nm), blue (470 nm), each equipped with lenses (17.7Â° 10 mm Circular Beam Optic)] and attached to heatsinks located above the arena on both sides at a ~ 45Â° angle. The LEDs were grouped by color and were powered by 700 mA BuckPuck drivers. Custom instrumentation software (CRITTA) was used to control the intensity and timing of the LEDs throughout the experiments. To achieve a half-dark/half-lit arena for the optogenetic choice experiments, two black acrylic shields were placed between the arena and the LEDs on each side and were adjusted to cast shade on either half of the chamber. By switching the LEDs on either side, the half of the arena that was lit could be alternated. The temperature difference between the dark and lit halves of the WALISAR chambers that could arise from the LED illumination was measured for the duration of a whole experiment using thermocouples, and found to be a negligible ~0.3 Â°C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4545940">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4545940</ext-link>). Compressed air was connected to the airflow inlets of the arena, with an intervening stopcock valve (Cole-Parmer) to modulate the flow rate. The air flow in all experiments using wind was 35 cm/s, as described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Wilson, 2016</xref>).

A single experimental cycle consisted of: acclimatization of the flies for 30 s; illumination of the left half of the arena for 45 s; no illumination for 30 s; illumination of the right half of the arena for 45 s; and no illumination for 30 s. The chambers were manually tapped against the incubator base before each cycle. Each group of flies was tested in six conditions comprising three light intensities (14, 42, 70 ÂµW/mm2), each with and without wind (35 cm/s) (on/off), totaling 12 steps (S1âS12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The total experiment duration was 180 s Ã 12 = 2160s = 36 min. The light intensities were measured with a thermal power sensor (Thorlabs S310C) connected to a power and energy-meter console (Thorlabs PM100D). The flies were recorded with an AVT Guppy PRO F046B camera fitted with an IR bandpass filter, which was positioned on the top of the arena.

The responses in the two orders were similar for eight of the 12 epochs, being different only for S2, S3, S10, and S11. The difference was due to the weak valence responses in the second- and third-order epochs: S2 and S3 produced lower effects in the ascending order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), S10 and S11 produced lower effects in the descending order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). The underestimation of the second- and third-order epochs had little effect on the overall interpretation of the results because eight of the epochs generated similar results. Moreover, even a hypothetical extreme case in which the valence is overlooked in the second- and third-order epochs would result in a false negative, rather than a false positive. As such, the experimental order was concluded to not have a major effect on the WALISAR results. Additionally, the effect sizes in the first epoch tended to be smaller than the second epoch when the light was downwind of the air flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>); to eliminate this bias, only second epochs were used for further data analysis.</p><p>One concern is that the activity rates and temporal structure of optogenetic stimulation are likely different from direct odor stimulation.

The valence of each fly was measured in terms of how much time it spent in the light after first encountering one of the lit zones. Specifically, the first frame in which a fly entered the lit zone was considered the start of the test session; after this initial light encounter, the amount of time spent in the dark was subtracted from time spent in the light and finally divided by the total amount of time. This metric is designated âTime Spent After Light Encounterâ (TSALE). The duration between the first light discovery and the end of the light epoch varied across individual files, from never discovering the light (0 s) to being exposed to the light at the start of the epoch (60 s). As such, each flyâs TSALE score was weighted by the post-light duration, termed âweighted Time Spent After Light Encounterâ (wTSALE). This weighting was achieved by multiplying the TSALE with the ratio between the remaining time and the full duration of the test epoch. The wTSALE score was calculated for each fly and then averaged for the control and test genotypes. To calculate the effect sizes, responder and driver controls were pooled into a single control group. The mean difference (â) between the pooled-control and test groups was taken as the effect size (ÎwTSALE).

While relatively unknown in behavioral genetics, EB is widely used to filter omics data, having been originally developed for microarray data, and currently routinely used for, among other applications, mass spectrometry proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koh et al., 2019</xref>). This approach is intrinsically connected to the traditional analysis workflow based on hypothesis testing with multiple-testing correction, but with a major difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Efron and Tibshirani, 2002</xref>). The hypothesis-testing approach is solely based on tail probabilities under the null hypothesis, and does not consider true signals. The key advantage of EB is that it explicitly models distributions of both the noises (null hypotheses) and the true signals (alternative hypotheses). Thus, for the analysis of a genetic screen, the key difference of this approach (compared to the conventional hypotheses testing-based analysis) is that we evaluate the significance of response levels across all ORNs simultaneously, modeling their distributions as a mixture of a random noise component and a real signal component. Empirically speaking, when the true effect sizes are modest, this typically increases the sensitivity of detecting mild effect sizes. Further, the mixture modeling produces a confidence score, that is the posterior probability of true signal from the underlying Bayesian model, which is the complement of the local false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Efron, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis with Empirical Bayes</title><p>To draw conclusions from multiple experiments (performed at one of three light intensities) for a given ORN, the dimension of the data was reduced into one summary statistic (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow/></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) for each ORN, as follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Efron et al., 2001</xref>:<disp-formula id="equ1">,<mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean of the wTSALE score for experimental and control flies.

The empirical Bayes method directly models the valence Z scores as random variables from a two-component mixture, where the noise component is modeled as Gaussian distribution and the signal component (true behavioral changes) is modeled by a non-parametric distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Efron, 2010</xref>). In effect, the method borrows statistical information across the ORNs to learn the data generating distributions of the null and alternative hypotheses. As the inferential method is based on the Bayesian framework, the model fit naturally yields the posterior probability of true change of each ORN as well as the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with any posterior probability threshold. The true signal component is subsequently divided into positive and negative sub-components depending on the sign of the Z-scores. From this three-component mixture, a signed probability is derived to indicate the likelihood that the valence score came from each of the three candidate distributions (negative, neutral, and positive valence). Prior to calculating the signed probabilities, EBprot removes outliers from the valence distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koh et al., 2015</xref>). Effect sizes associated with a &lt; 25% FDR were considered for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Modeling the valence responses of ORN combinations</title><p>The ORN-combo valences were modeled using three functions, each widely used in neural network research for input pooling: summation, max-pooling, and min-pooling.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Most primary olfactory neurons have individually neutral effects on behavior&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew C Smear (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We appreciated the quality, extent, and importance of this work. While doing so, we had a few concerns that we think the authors should be able to address. They are listed below.</p><p>1. Anaesthesia: We were concerned about the short recovery period post cold anesthesia and prior to the behavioural assay. Since cold anesthesia is known to have effects on behaviour, could the authors please demonstrate that a longer duration of recovery doesn't alter their findings of neutral ORN valence?</p><p>2. wTSALE: We were concerned that this method of weighting used by the authors may be obscuring real behavioural phenomenon and therefore masking valence. Could the authors please revisit this? Providing more traces of the different response types â attraction, avoidance, weak responses, etc. â would also be helpful.</p><p>3. ORN combinations: One of the key points of this manuscript is what it tells us about the rules by which ORN combinations work. While the authors show what their study rules out, we felt that they fall short of discussing what might be occurring instead. So, could the authors please include some discussion around this point?</p><p>In this section we also recommend incorporating SupFig8 into the main figure 5. It possible that different ORN pair use different interaction rules and the grouped analysis in figure 5 would mask this. Sup Fig8 is more informative in this regard.</p><p>4. Statistics: The statistics in this manuscript are quite involved. We recognise that the authors are promoting the use of Empirical-Bayes methods for statistical inferences. Since this is not commonplace, could the authors please incorporate an intuitive explanation about Empirical Bayes, its assumptions, and why it's better suited to the analysis? We think this will greatly improve accessibility of this manuscript, and therefore its impact.</p><p>5. Comparison with the Bell and Wilson study: Could the authors please include the number of ORN pairs tested in the B and W study and their own (28 and 7)? With respect to the stimulation conditions listed in this table (Supp Table 4), we assume that the authors' count of 6 conditions is because they are including with and without airflow for their 3 light intensities. In this case, the B and W study should be listed as 16. Alternatively (indeed preferably), the two studies should be listed as 8 and 3 respectively.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1A I cannot tell the direction of airflow in the corridors. The air port is only shown on one side, does that mean airflow is unidirectional? Where is the exhaust?</p><p>I would prefer a more schematic/conceptual drawing of the arena than this quasi-realistic one where the main feature that pops out to me are the flies themselves. I would prefer that the drawing conveys the technical details needed to evaluate what the flies experience in the assay.</p><p>Fig1F The y-axis label wTSALE should be swapped for a term with some intrinsic meaning. There isn't even any basic description of what wTSALE means in the Results section, the reader has to go to the Methods. I think it would be helpful for the reader to understand the assay more clearly if the full description is in the Results. It is basically the proportion of time the flies spend outside the light, with the clock starting only after the fly has experienced the light the first time. That's pretty easy to understand and the y-axis label could be % time outside light' or even 'preference light' for positive values and 'preference dark' for negative values without criminally oversimplifying the measurement (IMO).</p><p>Also I am not convinced the weighting the authors use (i.e. wTSALE vs TSALE) is really justified. Essentially they are trying to control for shorter sampling periods of the fly's behavior in an extremely simple linear way. That implies that short sampling periods may not be representative â is it fair to simply weight those down so the score goes closer to zero since that actually indicates a lack of preference? Basically since any value on their y-axis carries meaning, it seems unfair to weight some points down simply because sampling wasn't extensive enough. Why not just require some minimal time window for flies to have experienced the light (i.e. know what they are choosing) and look at the overall proportion of time in light vs dark?</p><p>P.10 &quot;This result indicates that wind has essentially no impact on ORN-elicited behavior in walking flies&quot; this should read 'single-ORN-elicited behavior' since this is all the authors tested. ORN-elicited behavior could be read as ORN activation in general i.e. odor-based activation, where there is likely an effect of wind at least in some assays.</p><p>Figure 5: The authors analyze all ORN pairs together to test whether they summate/max pool/min pool but prior work (Bell and Wilson) showed that some pairs summate while others max pool, which would confound the style of grouped analysis in Figure 5G-I.</p><p>Additionally since only 7 combinations were used and only 3 intensity levels, this figure is the weakest part of the paper, which up to this point has been extremely extensive. It also makes the first entry in Table 4 (Number ORNs tested = 45 vs n=8 for Bell and Wilson) unfair since Bell and Wilson actually looked at all combinations among 8 ORNs.</p><p>Can the authors discuss more about how the dominant Î² value can flip as the stimulation intensity increases? How would that work in terms of neural activity in the biological network? Also, what does the diversity of Î² values imply about biological network, does it potentially correspond to different weights on different downstream targets?</p><p>Ending on a negative result is a little disappointing â one positive point the authors could make is that (with one exception) the ORN combinations all transition towarrds more max pooling at higher stimulation rates. This suggests an competitive interaction between channels, which is easy to imagine. Undoubtedly it is complex with different downstream targets having different rules, but this is one fairly consistent trend.</p><p>I should say that I found Bell and Wilson more convincing because they examine interactions for each ORN pair over a wider range of spike rates. Here there are just three points for comparison, and when my eyes look at Figure 5C-E it seems that there is not a lot of difference between the three interaction modes.</p><p>Finally, the authors should somehow incorporate FigS8 into the main text since I'm sure that the interaction mode depends on the pair of ORNs being examined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â I need to understand the raw data better. What are the flies actually doing here? In 1B, the example fly seems to be walking back and forth at about 0.1 Hz. Is this representative of the population? Do the flies ever not move at all? How is this outcome dealt with? The methods mention that Empirical Bayes has a principled way of excluding outliers. What is that way? When the fly's path enters into the illuminated region, it seems to immediately stop and walk back to the opposite wall, and then on its next two cycles it stops before entering the illuminated region. Is this because the light spreads or does the fly remember where it hit the light before? What happens when the illumination occurs when the fly is already on the illuminated side? The effect of Gr66a&gt;Chr (1F) is much larger than any of the OR effects. What does a weaker avoidance response look like? What does an attraction response look like? The mean +/- 95% CI plots of 1C-E do not answer these questions. More individual animal trajectories and population occupancy heat maps would help a lot. Exclusively compressing the data to the one wTSALE number may well be obscuring worthwhile features of the behavior. With a richer characterization of the behavior, it might be possible to reduce the sample size and simplify the statistics.</p><p>â The statistical methods are unusual and seem unnecessarily complicated (at least to me). Further, why these were used instead of something more conventional? Readers (at least this reader) would benefit greatly from clear language giving an intuition for how Empirical Bayes works, what are its assumptions, and why it is superior to more conventional, easier-to-understand methods.</p><p>â The distribution of wTSALE in Figure 2 F and G is striking. In these plots, including the controls, there is a large mode at wTSALE=1. This mode is not apparent in the distributions of 1F. Why are control flies so much more attracted to light in these experiments? How does Empirical Bayes deal with non-Gaussian distributions?</p><p>â What direction does the wind flow through the chamber? It appears to run perpendicular to the illumination axis. Could this matter? Does wind itself impact the locomotion of the flies? Since only Î´-wTSALE is shown, it seems possible that wind may affect the behavior in a way that would obscure an effect. Here again it would be helpful to show more of what the flies are actually doing.</p><p>â The authors invoke &quot;complex circuit dynamics&quot; to explain the results of the combined-receptor experiments. I'm not sure what the authors mean here. &quot;Dynamics&quot; implies that time-dependent processes determine valence. If this were the case, these experiments would show no effect, since the stimuli don't recapitulate the dynamics of odor-evoked ORN activity. The discussion in a recent paper by Ron Yu's group (Qiu et al., 2021; Current Biology), deals with the non-labelled-line-ness of the mouse olfactory system in a thoughtful way. A similar discussion would benefit this paper as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors use a large array of GAL4 driver lines that they claim cover only the relevant ORN type. However, for most of these lines this was not examined. Although in the past such lines were used for behavior experiments, recent studies are much stricter with the use of driver lines. Many studies have demonstrated that even expression in a single neuron (other than the target neurons) either in the central brain or in the VNC can affect behavioral results. The authors therefore must show that the lines used in this study only label the target neurons either by providing adequate citations or by examining this directly with confocal stacks of both whole brain and VNC.</p><p>2. The authors do not show the relevance of their optogenetic activation of ORNs to odor activation of ORNs. Previous studies have shown that optogenetic activation of ORNs generates a firing rate of approximately 30 Hz (Bell and Wilson, 2016; Fox and Nagel, 2021). In contrast, ORNs can reach firing frequencies of up to 250 Hz in response to odors (Hallem and Carlson, 2006). In addition, ORNs show temporal dynamics, whereas I presume that the continuous illumination generates a more uniform response. The authors briefly discuss this in the methods section. They claim that &quot;continuous illumination is a more conservative method (Tumkaya et al., 2019)&quot;. However, the same authors claim in their Tumkaya et al., 2019 manuscript that &quot;These results suggest that neither stimulation type is necessarily superior to the other: static- or pulsed-light stimulation can capture more of the native responses than the other in inducing olfactory behavior, depending on the neuronal type&quot;. The authors also claim that &quot;We also benchmarked behavioral responses for the Orco neurons against results from a prior study that performed physiological recordings and used a different temporal structure (Bell and Wilson, 2016), finding that the WALISAR protocol has comparable sensitivity (Figure S3)&quot;. The fact that both optogenetic activations has similar behavioral results does not imply any relevance to an olfactory cue.</p><p>My main concern is that the current optogentic stimulation probably activates ORNs relatively weakly, thus mimicking low odor concentration. As low odor concentrations elicit in many cases only weak behavioral responses it is more than possible that the lack of behavioral effect is just due to &quot;low concentration&quot; and not an indication to the actual role of each ORN.</p><p>Taken together, I think the authors should go the extra mileage and show some relevance to olfactory stimuli.</p><p>3. The authors own data raises potential problems with their approach. Some of the ORNs that are classified as driving aversion or attraction seem to change valence value they induce with the light intensity. For example, the authors report Or42b to drive attraction in agreement with published literature. However, at the strongest light intensity it is actually neutral. Similarly, the authors report Or85d to drive aversion. However, at the strongest light intensity it is also neutral. So, are these ORs &quot;neutral&quot;?</p><p>4. The authors test a number of previously suggested linear models and find that they do not predict how two-ORN odor valence emerges from single-ORN valence. However, linear models were shown to be insufficient to predict odor valence (Badel et al., 2016). It is thus not surprising that these linear models failed.</p><p>5. The authors use two databases, one of odor responses (Hallem and Carlson 2006) and one of behavioral responses (Knaden et al., 2012) along with a linear model to try and predict odor valence from ORN activity. However, as mentioned above linear models are not adequate for describing the relation between ORN activity and Odor valence. Furthermore, I think the Knaden et al., database is a wrong database to use in this context. Knaden et al., used a trap assay. In this assay, flies are captured in the trap after a single entrance to the odor source. Thus, exploratory behavior, in which flies examine the odor and then can decide to avoid it, cannot occur, and this assay is expected to be biased towards reporting odors as attractive. Indeed, this was the case in the Knaden et al., database in contrast to other published results. This database was suitable for the claim raised by Knaden et al., that looked only at the most aversive and attractive odors, but it cannot be used to try to predict any odor valence.</p><p>6. The authors used cold anesthesia just prior to loading the flies to the chambers and only 30 second acclimation following the cold anesthesia. However, cold anesthesia is known to have effects on behavior, increasing response time, reducing locomotion and reducing overall responses (just a few examples, Barron, 2000; MacMillan et al., 2017, Trannoy et al., 2015). I think most studies today try to avoid cold anesthesia just before the experiment. My concern here is that the lack of effect for most ORNs, may arise from general behavior impairment. Can the authors give a few examples from the neutral ORNs without cold anesthesia?</p><p>7. The authors conclude that: 1. &quot;the majority of primary olfactory sensory neurons have neutral behavioral effects individually&quot;. This conclusion (as mentioned above) is definitely correct for the optogenetic activation, but its relevance to odor valence is questionable. Furthermore, Badel et al., 2016 already demonstrated with actual odor stimuli that âWe find that the behavior is accurately predicted by a model summing normalized glomerular responses, in which each glomerulus contributes a specific, small amount to odor preference.â Thus, the novelty of the current study is not large.</p><p>Their second conclusion is that âolfactory sensory neuronsâ¦participate in broad, odor-elicited ensembles with potent behavioral effects arising from complex interactionsâ. I agree with them that olfactory coding is complex. However, they did not show any actual odor responses to support their claim, neither did they provided even one complex mechanism. I think that stating that olfaction is complex is just not enough.</p><p>8. To my understanding the order of the Î² coefficients can affect the interpretation of the data. However, I could not find a reference for this in the methods. Can the authors please elaborate on this?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71238.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciated the quality, extent, and importance of this work.

Thus, even if earlier epochs were underestimating valence, the latter epochs are less likely to be affected.</p><p>Second, when compared with the literature, the positive controls are concordant. To benchmark our method, we used a quantitative literature review with standardized effect sizes of two reference lines: Gr66a-Gal4 and Orco-Gal4 (Figure 1-S3). It shows that our assay yields valence that is very similar to previous studies.</p><p>Comparing maximal scores, the comparisons of these lines include a 20% decrease (Gr66a), a 10% increase (Orco-Gal4 with wind), and a 5-fold increase (Orco-Gal4 in no wind). This shows that the overall protocol with the brief cold anesthesia does not systematically underestimate valence when compared with published protocols.</p><p>Third, the unbiased screen turned up a majority of hits that were already reported in the literature as being valent ORN types.

For Or67d, the majority of the flies discover the optogenetic light within the first ~5 seconds of a WALISAR experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>). The full-epoch metric conserves more preference information than a short-epoch cutoff, but there still are a few flies whose first light encounter does not occur until much later in the epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>). For example, a fly that encounters the light in the final three seconds of the test will give less reliable preference information. To account for this difference, we linearly weighed the preference scores by the percentage of epoch that the flies actually experienced. So, wTSALE does not underestimate valence, but rather is an unbiased and robust metric that is fairly similar to other metrics.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>wTSALE presents Or67d-induced behaviour more accurately than commonly used metrics in the fieldA.</title><p>An estimation plot presents the individual preference (upper axes) and valence (lower) of flies with activatable Or67d+ neurons in the WALISAR assay.

While relatively unknown in behavioral genetics, EB is widely used to filter omics data, having been originally developed for microarray data, and currently routinely used for, among other applications, mass spectrometry proteomics (Koh et al., 2019). This approach is intrinsically connected to the traditional analysis workflow based on hypothesis testing with multiple-testing correction, but with a major difference (Efron and Tibshirani, 2002). The hypothesis-testing approach is solely based on tail probabilities under the null hypothesis, and does not consider true signals. The key advantage of EB is that it explicitly models distributions of both the noises (null hypotheses), and the true signals (alternative hypotheses). Thus, for the analysis of a genetic screen, the key difference of this approach (compared to the conventional hypotheses testing-based analysis) is that we evaluate the significance of response levels across all ORNs simultaneously, abelled their distributions as a mixture of a random noise component and a real signal component. Empirically speaking, when the true effect sizes are modest, this typically increases sensitivity. Further, the mixture abelled naturally produces a confidence score, i.e. the posterior probability of true signal from the underlying Bayesian model, which is the inverse of the local false discovery rate (Efron, 2010).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Comparison with the Bell and Wilson study: Could the authors please include the number of ORN pairs tested in the B and W study and their own (28 and 7)? With respect to the stimulation conditions listed in this table (Supp Table 4), we assume that the authorsâ count of 6 conditions is because they are including with and without airflow for their 3 light intensities. In this case, the B and W study should be listed as 16. Alternatively (indeed preferably), the two studies should be listed as 8 and 3 respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers and Editors for their guidance.

There isnât even any basic description of what wTSALE means in the Results section, the reader has to go to the Methods. I think it would be helpful for the reader to understand the assay more clearly if the full description is in the Results. It is basically the proportion of time the flies spend outside the light, with the clock starting only after the fly has experienced the light the first time. Thatâs pretty easy to understand and the y-axis label could be % time outside lightâ or even âpreference lightâ for positive values and âpreference darkâ for negative values without criminally oversimplifying the measurement (IMO).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have improved the description of wTSALE to the Results, in a section titled âWALISAR data analysis: the wTSALE metricâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also I am not convinced the weighting the authors use (i.e. wTSALE vs TSALE) is really justified. Essentially they are trying to control for shorter sampling periods of the flyâs behavior in an extremely simple linear way. That implies that short sampling periods may not be representative â is it fair to simply weight those down so the score goes closer to zero since that actually indicates a lack of preference? Basically since any value on their y-axis carries meaning, it seems unfair to weight some points down simply because sampling wasnât extensive enough. Why not just require some minimal time window for flies to have experienced the light (i.e. know what they are choosing) and look at the overall proportion of time in light vs dark?</p></disp-quote><p>Requiring a minimum time window and weighting the score are doing similar things, just that one is thresholded while the other is graded. The weighting was introduced as a non-thresholded way to allow all the available data to contribute in proportion to the time the animal was responding to the optogenetic light, which we consider to be the relevant metric. Regardless, as we show in the metric case study, the exact choice of metric does not dramatically alter the preference outcomes. We are aware that we made many assumptions and human decisions in the course of this project, however the use of wTSALE cannot account for inter-study differences.</p><p>Extended discussion: Extracting data from the final seconds of an experiment, and using this data to calculate a preference index is a common practice in the field. These brief arbitrary durations may range from as short as 5 s to 10 s or even just the final position (Aso et al., 2014; Dolan et al., 2019). While widely used, the conventional approach has potential issues, which encouraged us to implement wTSALE.</p><p>We investigated possible undersampling arising from using the last 3, 5, or 10 seconds of the optogenetic activation of Or67d neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-C</xref>). The overall conclusion remains the same across the three calculations in this example: that Or67d triggers attraction. This comparison shows that wTSALE is not masking or obscuring valence. However, there is a problem with the short-duration metrics: the majority of the flies have either a -1 or +1 preference index (PI). (Indeed, there are so many data points at the extremes, the swarm plot cannot display them). This distorted, tail-heavy, high-variability distribution shows that, for short-duration epochs, P.I. scores are heavily dependent on where in the chamber the flies happened to be for those few seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-C</xref>).</p><p>Instead of an under-sampled short epoch, one could use the entire test to calculate preference index. However this approach introduces a new pitfall: it would include all flies even if they never encountered optogenetic lightâthe intervention that is under investigation. As our analysis of the Or67d activation experiment demonstrates, when the whole epoch was used to measure preference, there are many flies with apparent âtotal aversionâ (PI = â1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>). Given that these flies never crossed into the illuminated side of the chamber and experienced activity in the Or67d neurons, it is misleading to conclude that these flies âavoidâ the activation of Or67d neurons 100% of the time.</p><p>The metric used in our studyâwTSALEâutilizes all the locomotion data following a fly encountering the optogenetic light. It (1) eliminates the need for selecting an arbitrary cutoff; (2) uses all of the relevant tracking data for the analysis, thereby reducing sampling error and variation, while capturing the attraction response triggered by the Or67d neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1E</xref>).</p><p>We have shown the metrics case study here, which demonstrates that wTSALE is not misestimating valence when compared to more conventional metrics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P.10 âThis result indicates that wind has essentially no impact on ORN-elicited behavior in walking fliesâ this should read âsingle-ORN-elicited behaviorâ since this is all the authors tested.

The charts shown in Figure 5J display the axes and diagonal lines, abelled either âsummationâ or âmax poolingâ. If either/both of the simple rules governed ORN combinations, the Î² weights would be expected to cluster along these lines. Instead, we observe a broad scatter that shifts with increasing intensity. Both of these features (the locations of the weight markers and the fact that they shift) erode confidence in the either/or simple-rule hypothesis.</p><p>The present study was started a year before the publication of Bell and Wilson, and, while we realized early on that this study would inevitably be at least a partial replication, we never intended it to be a full-throated critique of the prior study. Bell and Wilson is an excellent, pioneering study. Nevertheless it is, like the present study, imperfect. We have not used effect sizes and other state-of-the-art analytic methods for their own sake, but because they have been established in the statistical literature to work better than <italic>ad hoc</italic> methods. To determine the combination type, Bell and Wilson used significance tests between the ORN-combination P.I. and two other metrics (the sum of the components and the larger component), combined with the calculation of <italic>P</italic> value ratios. This analysis shares all the well-documented problems associated with significant testing for confirmatory analyses, including false dichotomization. The primary B and W analysis workflow is: (1) continuous P.I. data is recast as binary outcomes (significant/not significant), and (2) this new binary data is then mapped to a dual mechanistic hypothesis (sum or max). However, this is based on the false assumption that significant differences are only compatible with the sum or max hypotheses.</p><p>It is likely that the B and W data, if it were analyzed with effect-size methods, would also show a variety of non-sum, non-max, weighted poolings. Indeed, two exemplar combinations (Bell and Wilson, Figure 5BC) have response magnitudes that exceed both models, and the overview matrix (Bell and Wilson, Figure 6A) shows that 11 of 28 tests were non-significant. We would have liked to re-analyze B and Wâs data with best-practice methods, but when we requested the authors to share their data, they declined. Another barrier to a re-analysis is that their experiments included no Gal4 controls (not done) and very few UAS controls (Supplementary File 2 â Sheet 3), making it impossible to calculate effect sizes that correctly isolate the optogenetic influence.</p><p>We moved the former Figure 5GHI to the supplement, and Figure S8 to the main Figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally since only 7 combinations were used and only 3 intensity levels, this figure is the weakest part of the paper, which up to this point has been extremely extensive.

Therefore we can cautiously infer that the underlying neural network is multifactorial and perhaps context-specific. However, we also believe that reverse-engineering the exact on-off combinations through estimated Î² values requires a wider set of experiments with distinct stimuli than we present. Attempting to translate the meaning of Î² shifts into the structure or variability of the neural network carries a high risk of over-interpretation.</p><p>We have added a section (âPossible models of ORN combination combinationâ) to mention possible mechanisms underlying the Î² shifts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ending on a negative result is a little disappointing â one positive point the authors could make is that (with one exception) the ORN combinations all transition abelle more max pooling at higher stimulation rates.

First, the optogenetic response should incorporate variance from both experimental and test animals; by omitting the controls (and therefore control variance) is expected to increase precision. Second, based on our reading of their Experimental Procedures, the optogenetic response in B and W appears to be averaged from the 16 technical replicates, potentially increasing apparent precision by â16, i.e. four-fold. With both statistical practices applied in tandem, it seems likely that the overall precision could be increased by as much as eight-fold.</p><p>Using published effects and our own preliminary control experiments as guidelines, the present study selected a sample size (N = 52, 52, 52 for test, UAS, and Gal4 control flies) that would be adequate to detect medium effect sizes.

In sum, the overall distribution of valence Z-scores is therefore abelled as a flexible non-parametric distribution, not bound by Gaussian distribution assumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â What direction does the wind flow through the chamber? It appears to run perpendicular to the illumination axis. Could this matter? Does wind itself impact the locomotion of the flies? Since only Î´-wTSALE is shown, it seems possible that wind may affect the behavior in a way that would obscure an effect. Here again it would be helpful to show more of what the flies are actually doing.</p></disp-quote><p>Wind runs through the narrow chamber from one end to the other, perpendicular to the light bands.

Iâm not sure what the authors mean here. âDynamicsâ implies that time-dependent processes determine valence. If this were the case, these experiments would show no effect, since the stimuli donât recapitulate the dynamics of odor-evoked ORN activity. The discussion in a recent paper by Ron Yuâs group (Qiu et al., 2021; Current Biology), deals with the non-labelled-line-ness of the mouse olfactory system in a thoughtful way. A similar discussion would benefit this paper as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We added a Discussion section about possible circuit dynamics that support the observed results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors use a large array of GAL4 driver lines that they claim cover only the relevant ORN type. However, for most of these lines this was not examined. Although in the past such lines were used for behavior experiments, recent studies are much stricter with the use of driver lines. Many studies have demonstrated that even expression in a single neuron (other than the target neurons) either in the central brain or in the VNC can affect behavioral results. The authors therefore must show that the lines used in this study only label the target neurons either by providing adequate citations or by examining this directly with confocal stacks of both whole brain and VNC.</p></disp-quote><p>Ultimately, in every project, decisions must be made on how to allocate limited resources, and early on we decided to pursue a behavioral study, not an anatomical survey. Anatomical surveys of this scale are major undertakings (Couto et al., 2005; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005). While we appreciate that this is a potential concern, this is outside the scope of this project, and respectfully request that this is not made a prerequisite for publication.</p><p>We have added a description to the new Limitations section in the Discussion that highlights that non-antennal cells could be responsible for some of the effects observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors do not show the relevance of their optogenetic activation of ORNs to odor activation of ORNs. Previous studies have shown that optogenetic activation of ORNs generates a firing rate of approximately 30 Hz (Bell and Wilson, 2016; Fox and Nagel, 2021). In contrast, ORNs can reach firing frequencies of up to 250 Hz in response to odors (Hallem and Carlson, 2006). In addition, ORNs show temporal dynamics, whereas I presume that the continuous illumination generates a more uniform response. The authors briefly discuss this in the methods section. They claim that âcontinuous illumination is a more conservative method (Tumkaya et al., 2019)â. However, the same authors claim in their Tumkaya et al., 2019 manuscript that âThese results suggest that neither stimulation type is necessarily superior to the other: static- or pulsed-light stimulation can capture more of the native responses than the other in inducing olfactory behavior, depending on the neuronal typeâ. The authors also claim that âWe also benchmarked behavioral responses for the Orco neurons against results from a prior study that performed physiological recordings and used a different temporal structure (Bell and Wilson, 2016), finding that the WALISAR protocol has comparable sensitivity (Figure S3)â. The fact that both optogenetic activations has similar behavioral results does not imply any relevance to an olfactory cue.</p><p>My main concern is that the current optogentic stimulation probably activates ORNs relatively weakly, thus mimicking low odor concentration. As low odor concentrations elicit in many cases only weak behavioral responses it is more than possible that the lack of behavioral effect is just due to âlow concentrationâ and not an indication to the actual role of each ORN.</p><p>Taken together, I think the authors should go the extra mileage and show some relevance to olfactory stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: neuronal photoactivation is not a naturalistic stimulus, but a physiological intervention. In this case, we are using a behavioral readout of the depolarizing input into the system. The use of simplified, well-controlled non-natural experimental preparations has a long tradition in the history of neuroscience. All such reductionist experiments have their limitations and serve as a counterpoint to more naturalistic experiments, which typically have the converse limitation of complexity.</p><p>Extended discussion: The relevance of the optogenetic screen to olfactory valence is supported by at least two lines of evidence.</p><p>First, of the ten ORN types identified by the screen, six ORN types have been previously identified by other groups (using odorants) as ORNs that drive attraction or aversion. The re-discovery of these ORN types lends further credibility to the idea that the optogenetic screen is relevant to olfactory preference. Considering the noise and poor reproducibility in behavioral experiments and neuroscience at large (Button et al., 2013), it is reasonable to characterize these independent replications as displaying remarkable fidelity.</p><p>Second, there is a point of reference with an excellent odor-based study that used an odorant-triggered, olfactory-receptor method of ORN activation: geosminâOr56a heterologous olfactory stimulation (Chin et al., 2018). In comparison with this olfactogenetic assessment of ORN-evoked behaviors, there are five receptor types (35a, 42b, 47a, 67d, Gr21a/Gr63a) that are neutral in with the odorant-evoked intervention, but show valence in our assay (Supplementary File 1, Author Response Tables 1, 2). Of these, for the two receptor types covered by multiple studies (42b, Gr21/Gr63a), the olfactogenetic result is the outlier while our screen is compatible with the broad consensus (Supplementary File 1). These observations indicate thatâwhen compared with a naturalistic mode of odorant activationâthe Chrimson activation protocol used in the present study does not consistently underestimate ORN valences.</p><p>As experimental interventions, the complexity of naturalistic stimuli poses a challenge. For many odorants, receptor deconvolution is a complex problem that makes it challenging to unambiguously determine ORNâbehavior causality. Many ORNs bind a multitude of odorants promiscuously. Even for particular odorantâORN pairs with high affinity and specificity (abelled lines), it is difficult to completely rule out weak but nevertheless potentially widespread binding to âoff-targetâ ORNs.</p><p>We consider that the study already has relevance to olfactory processing.</p><p>We have added a passage to the new Limitations paragraph about the differences in firing rates between optogenetic and olfactory stimuli, and the important concern about relevance to olfactory stimuli. We request that odorant experiments are not made a requirement of publication.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides"

The authors own data raises potential problems with their approach. Some of the ORNs that are classified as driving aversion or attraction seem to change valence value they induce with the light intensity. For example, the authors report Or42b to drive attraction in agreement with published literature. However, at the strongest light intensity it is actually neutral. Similarly, the authors report Or85d to drive aversion. However, at the strongest light intensity it is also neutral. So, are these Ors âneutralâ?</p></disp-quote><p>The data do not support these ORNs as neutral. The optogenetic data give robust signals in the EB screen, showing signed probabilities of +1.0 (42b) or â1.0 (85d) for some intensities. Both of these ORN-type results corroborate either the majority of published reports (42b) or the sole available published result (85d). Thus, the available data strongly support these two ORNs as being attractive and aversive, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors test a number of previously suggested linear models and find that they do not predict how two-ORN odor valence emerges from single-ORN valence. However, linear models were shown to be insufficient to predict odor valence (Badel et al., 2016). It is thus not surprising that these linear models failed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors use two databases, one of odor responses (Hallem and Carlson 2006) and one of behavioral responses (Knaden et al., 2012) along with a linear model to try and predict odor valence from ORN activity. However, as mentioned above linear models are not adequate for describing the relation between ORN activity and Odor valence. Furthermore, I think the Knaden et al., database is a wrong database to use in this context. Knaden et al., used a trap assay. In this assay, flies are captured in the trap after a single entrance to the odor source. Thus, exploratory behavior, in which flies examine the odor and then can decide to avoid it, cannot occur, and this assay is expected to be biased towards reporting odors as attractive. Indeed, this was the case in the Knaden et al., database in contrast to other published results. This database was suitable for the claim raised by Knaden et al., that looked only at the most aversive and attractive odors, but it cannot be used to try to predict any odor valence.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree: we consider the title of Knaden <italic>et al.,</italic> (âSpatial Representation of Odorant Valence in an Insect Brainâ) to be justified. A trap assay can be viewed as a valence assay that depends on movements between the two trap entry points, around which there are odorant gradients and/or intermingling plumes. Each fly interacts with and moves in these plumes. While each fly is associated with a single outcome, the proportion of outcomes over many flies is used to estimate a preference. Using count-type data is fairly common in fly behavior, such as the olfactory T-maze which uses the endpoint locations of flies as the end of a two minute epoch. As detailed above in the discussion around wTSALE, we prefer video analysis, but nevertheless consider that endpoint and count data are valid ways to measure valence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors used cold anesthesia just prior to loading the flies to the chambers and only 30 second acclimation following the cold anesthesia. However, cold anesthesia is known to have effects on behavior, increasing response time, reducing locomotion and reducing overall responses (just a few examples, Barron, 2000; MacMillan et al., 2017, Trannoy et al., 2015). I think most studies today try to avoid cold anesthesia just before the experiment. My concern here is that the lack of effect for most ORNs, may arise from general behavior impairment. Can the authors give a few examples from the neutral ORNs without cold anesthesia?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the above discussion about cold anesthesia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors conclude that: 1. &quot;the majority of primary olfactory sensory neurons have neutral behavioral effects individually&quot;. This conclusion (as mentioned above) is definitely correct for the optogenetic activation, but its relevance to odor valence is questionable. Furthermore, Badel et al., 2016 already demonstrated with actual odor stimuli that âWe find that the behavior is accurately predicted by a model summing normalized glomerular responses, in which each glomerulus contributes a specific, small amount to odor preference.â Thus, the novelty of the current study is not large.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the summary of and their viewpoint on the excellent Badel <italic>et al.,</italic> study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Their second conclusion is that &quot;olfactory sensory neuronsâ¦participate in broad, odor-elicited ensembles with potent behavioral effects arising from complex interactions&quot;. I agree with them that olfactory coding is complex. However, they did not show any actual odor responses to support their claim, neither did they provided even one complex mechanism. I think that stating that olfaction is complex is just not enough.</p></disp-quote><p>Many possible neuronal mechanisms could generate the weighting shifts observed. We are reluctant to make over-reaching specific conclusions. We note that even in deep-learning neural nets that can perform impressive classification tasksâwhere there is complete knowledge of the âsynapticâ weightsâthere is typically little understanding how they do so (Knight, 2017; Zeiler and Fergus, 2014).</p><p>We have added a section to the Discussion that discusses possible mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. To my understanding the order of the Î² coefficients can affect the interpretation of the data. However, I could not find a reference for this in the methods. Can the authors please elaborate on this?</p></disp-quote><p>The question is ambiguous, answers to two possible interpretations:</p><p>â The ordering of the Î² weights in the regression does not affect the outcome.</p><p>â The ordering of the Î² weights in Figures 5 and S7 are the same.</p><p>References</p><p>Aso Y, Sitaraman D, Ichinose T, Kaun KR, Vogt K, Belliart-GuÃ©rin G, PlaÃ§ais P-Y, Robie AA, Yamagata N, Schnaitmann C, Rowell WJ, Johnston RM, Ngo T-TB, Chen N, Korff W, Nitabach MN, Heberlein U, Preat T, Branson KM, Tanimoto H, Rubin GM. 2014.
