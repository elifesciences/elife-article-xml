Organogenesis begins with the local activation of cell proliferation in the plant body. In the following stages, proliferation is restricted to certain areas, which is essential for the formation of properly sized and structured organs. However, the molecular underpinnings of such regulation remain mostly unknown.</p><p>LRs serve as building blocks of the root system architecture and are crucial for the uptake and transport of water and minerals. The first visible step of LR formation occurs within the parent root, where a few cells start to divide, comprising the LR primordium. The LR primordium grows and eventually emerges out of the parent root to form a new LR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Torres-Martínez et al., 2019</xref>). This process has been described in detail in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis), rendering it one of the most ideal systems to study the molecular mechanisms of organ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Wangenheim et al., 2016</xref>). In Arabidopsis, a small number of cells in a few adjacent files of the xylem pole pericycle layer, termed LR founder cells, first divide in the anticlinal (orthogonal to the proximodistal axis of the primary root) orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Wangenheim et al., 2016</xref>). The local accumulation of the phytohormone auxin is critical for LR initiation, driving LR founder cell identity acquisition and division via the degradation of the SOLITARY ROOT (SLR/IAA14) repressor, thus activating the expression of downstream genes mediated by the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS ARF7 and ARF19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavenus et al., 2013</xref>). However, much less is understood about the coordinated periclinal (parallel to the proximodistal axis of the root) and anticlinal divisions that subsequently take place. In particular, the manner in which cell proliferation becomes confined to the central zone of the primordium, giving rise to the dome-shaped structure, largely remains a mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Torres-Martínez et al., 2019</xref>), although the requirement of several factors, such as polar auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benková et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geldner et al., 2004</xref>), control of auxin response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Smet et al., 2010</xref>), peptide hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Smet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>), transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du and Scheres, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirota et al., 2007</xref>), symplastic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2013</xref>), epigenetic gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Napsucialy-Mendivil et al., 2014</xref>), and mechanical interaction with the overlaying tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vermeer et al., 2014</xref>), has been revealed.</p><p><italic>root redifferentiation defective 1</italic> (<italic>rrd1</italic>), <italic>rrd2</italic>, and <italic>root initiation defective 4</italic> (<italic>rid4</italic>) are temperature-sensitive mutants of Arabidopsis that were originally isolated by us via screening using adventitious root (AR) formation from hypocotyl tissue segments as an index phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konishi and Sugiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugiyama, 2003</xref>). In addition to AR formation, other aspects of development, such as seedling growth and callus formation, were affected by high-temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konishi and Sugiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugiyama, 2003</xref>). Most notable among these aspects was their LR phenotype, in which abnormally broadened (i.e. fasciated) LRs were formed at 28°C (non-permissive temperature), but not at 22°C (permissive temperature), in a tissue culture setting; thus, we termed the three mutants as temperature-dependent fasciation (TDF) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsuka and Sugiyama, 2012</xref>). It was later revealed that the early stages of LR development are likely affected in the TDF mutants, and that the fasciated LRs exhibit exclusive enlargement of inner tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsuka and Sugiyama, 2012</xref>), suggesting that the genes responsible for the TDF mutations (TDF genes) encode negative regulators of cell division that are important for the size restriction of the central zone during the formation of early stage LR primordia; however, their molecular identity has remained elusive.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of the temperature-dependent fasciation (TDF) mutations on the early stages of lateral root (LR) development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fasciated LRs formed at 28°C in the TDF mutant explants vs. a normal root on the wild-type (WT) explant after 6 days of culture.

Although organelle gene expression is typically associated with organelle-specific functions, it might also be involved in higher order physiological activities including the regulation of organogenesis. Mitochondria are considered the ‘powerhouses’ of the cell, as they supply the energy that is necessary for cellular activities. In comparison with other eukaryotes, RNA metabolism in mitochondria is particularly complex in plants, and entails numerous nuclearly encoded RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammani and Giegé, 2014</xref>). Given the relaxed nature of transcription, post-transcriptional processing, such as RNA editing, splicing, maturation of transcript ends and RNA degradation, are known to play predominant roles in shaping the plant mitochondrial transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammani and Giegé, 2014</xref>). Many factors that participate in plant mitochondrial RNA processing have been identified; however, the implications of their role in regulating plant organ development remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammani and Giegé, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we report a detailed analysis of the TDF mutants. We found that LR fasciation in the TDF mutants was caused by extra cell division in the early stages of LR formation. Next, we identified all three TDF genes as encoding nuclearly encoded mitochondrial RNA processing factors. Analysis of mitochondrial RNA demonstrated that RRD1 is involved in the removal of poly(A) tails, and that both RRD<italic>2</italic> and RID4 are RNA editing factors. Defective protein composition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was found in <italic>rrd2</italic> and <italic>rid4</italic>. Phenocopying of the TDF mutants by mitochondrial respiratory inhibition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction, together with its reversal by ROS scavenging, suggested that ROS generation resulting from impaired RNA processing is the primary cause of the extra cell division observed during early LR development in the TDF mutants. Our discovery shed light on a new aspect of mitochondrial RNA processing that is relevant in the control of plant organogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of the TDF mutations on LR formation</title><p>To gain insight into fasciated LR formation in the TDF mutants, a detailed investigation was carried out using the semi-synchronous LR induction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohtani et al., 2010</xref>), in which nearly de novo LR formation is induced from root explants of young seedlings upon culture in auxin-containing root inducing medium (RIM). In this system, a 6-day culture of TDF mutant explants results in high rates of LR fasciation at 28°C (non-permissive temperature) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but not at 22°C (permissive temperature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsuka and Sugiyama, 2012</xref>). To determine the stage of LR formation at which developmental abnormalities occur in the TDF mutants, LR primordia from earlier time points were examined. In Arabidopsis, LR formation begins with anticlinal cell divisions in the xylem pole pericycle cell file, producing an array of short cells flanked by longer cells, which serve as the origin of the LR primordium (stage I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Wangenheim et al., 2016</xref>). This is followed by periclinal divisions throughout the primordium, with the exception of the flanking cells in some occasions, creating two cell layers (stage II; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Subsequent periclinal cell divisions take place in the central zone of the primordium, producing the third cell layer (stage III), followed by the fourth cell layer (stage IV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additional anticlinal cell division, together with cell expansion at the innermost cell layer, gives rise to a dome-shaped primordium (stage V; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The comparison of the number of cells within the area consisting of more than one layer (MOL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirota et al., 2007</xref>) between stages II and III, revealed that all TDF mutants showed an increase in this parameter in a temperature-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, C–E). The same trend was observed in primordia at stage IV and V, for which the widths of the MOL and more than three layer (MTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirota et al., 2007</xref>) areas were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, F–H). These results showed that the LRs of TDF mutants contain more basal cells in the initial steps of LR development, namely as early as stage II, than normal LRs and indicated that the increase in the number of cells along the lateral axis of the primordium induces the expansion of its central zone, giving rise to an abnormally broadened and flat-shaped LR. As there was no significant increase in LR density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; Kruskal-Wallis test, p&gt;0.3), LR fasciation in the TDF mutants seems to be the result of the expansion of individual primordia, as opposed to the fusion of multiple primordia because of overcrowding that is observed in some other mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Smet et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Positional cloning and expression analysis of the TDF genes</title><p>To clone the TDF genes, we mapped the mutated loci in the TDF mutants based on the temperature-sensitive AR formation phenotype, which originally led to the isolation of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konishi and Sugiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugiyama, 2003</xref>).

Recent human and animal studies have led to an increased appreciation of its participation in the maturation process of a wide variety of noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In plants, however, PARN plays a distinct role in the removal of the poly(A) tails of mitochondrial mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirayama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirayama, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanazawa et al., 2020</xref>). Given the sequence similarity to PARN and its mitochondrial localization, we hypothesized that RRD1 is also involved in regulating the poly(A) status of mitochondrial mRNA. To test this possibility, we first performed a microarray analysis of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs prepared from wild-type and <italic>rrd1</italic> explants that had been induced to form LRs at 28°C, and found a substantial increase in mitochondria-encoded poly(A)<sup>+</sup> transcripts in <italic>rrd1</italic> explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1, A</xref> to C).

In fact, a comparative analysis of polyadenylated and total RNA levels via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed a selective increase in polyadenylated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

However, these sites were not considered as targets of RRD2 and RID4 for the following reasons. These sites were incompletely edited, even in the wild type, as opposed to most other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that their editing is relatively slow and highly susceptible to fluctuations in the kinetic balance between editing and transcription.

This revealed a substantial loss of complex V (ATP synthase complex) in <italic>rid4</italic> at both 22°C and 28°C culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), likely caused by defective mRNA editing of <italic>atp4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which is a component of this protein complex. No noticeable differences were found in <italic>rrd1</italic> and <italic>rrd2</italic>.

These results indicate that, in <italic>rrd2</italic>, cyt <italic>c</italic> maturation activity was affected to a greater extent at higher temperatures, at least in callus, which possesses root-tissue-like properties, possibly explaining the temperature-dependent nature of its phenotype. The data reported above demonstrated that, in both <italic>rrd2</italic> and <italic>rid4</italic>, the production of certain components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is hampered by defective mRNA editing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effects of defective mitochondrial respiration on LR formation</title><p>Based on the results obtained for <italic>rrd1</italic>, <italic>rrd2</italic>, and <italic>rid4</italic>, we speculated that there might be a relationship between mitochondrial electron transport and cell division control during LR morphogenesis. In fact, the induction of LRs from wild-type explants in the presence of rotenone (complex I inhibitor), antimycin A (complex III inhibitor), or oligomycin (complex V inhibitor) led to LR fasciation, providing evidence that electron transport chain defects are the cause of the TDF LR phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, A–D). In addition, we found that the effect of antimycin A was stronger at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further investigate the underlying molecular pathway, we next asked whether either reduced ATP synthesis, or ROS generation, phenomena that are commonly associated with defective mitochondrial respiration might be involved. We found that the respiratory uncoupler carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) did not increase LR width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), although LR growth inhibition was observed in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), whereas the ROS inducer paraquat (PQ) triggered a significant fasciation of LRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, G and H). Furthermore, the application of the ROS scavenger ascorbate resulted in a reversal of the LR broadening induced by PQ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, G and H). The same effect was observed against the <italic>rid4-2</italic> mutation.

By measuring the cell number and primordium width, we found that fasciation of LRs is caused by the excess number of basal cells, which can be detected as early as stage II of LR development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The lack of increase in LR density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) suggested that LR fasciation is caused by the expansion of individual primordia, rather than the fusion of multiple primordia, which is the case in some other mutants that form abnormally broadened LRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Smet et al., 2008</xref>). The data are in agreement with the previous result of the temperature-shift experiment, which demonstrated that the first 48 hr following LR induction are critical for LR fasciation in the TDF mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsuka and Sugiyama, 2012</xref>), as stage II to early stage III primordia are formed within this time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohtani et al., 2010</xref>).

A recent study revealed that the area of SHR expression is first established during stage II, where it is confined to the inner layer of the two-cell layered primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh et al., 2016</xref>). In subsequent stages, SHR is expressed in cell files derived from the inner layer, which develop into the stele of the LR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that differentiation into two cell layers at stage II occurs normally in the TDF mutants, and that the increase in the number of cells observed at stage II consequently leads to the expansion of the area of SHR expression in the inner cell layer during LR fasciation.</p><p>There are two possibilities that can account for the excess basal cells in LR primordia of TDF mutants: one in which LR founder cells undergo extra rounds of cell division and the other in which extra pericycle cells adjacent to the founder cells are activated to divide.

In plant mitochondria, immature 3´ extremities of mRNA, together with irregular RNAs, such as 3´ misprocessed mRNAs, rRNA maturation by-products, and cryptic transcripts, are known to be polyadenylated before they are degraded by mitochondrial polynucleotide phosphorylase (mtPNPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holec et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, down-regulation of mtPNPase in Arabidopsis results in the accumulation of long preprocessed mRNAs, as well as irregular RNAs, the majority of which are polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holec et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>rrd1</italic>, unusually long preprocessed mRNAs do not seem to accumulate, as the size of RACE-PAT assay products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) corresponded to that of previously reported mature transcript 3´ ends.

Our study revealed some differences in the origin of temperature sensitivity among the TDF mutants. The <italic>rrd1</italic> mutation causes a truncation of the C-terminal domain of the RRD1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This finding, together with the enhancement of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> mitochondrial mRNA accumulation at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), implies that, in <italic>rrd1,</italic> RRD1 is partially functional at least at the permissive temperature, and that its activity is more severely affected at the non-permissive temperature. In contrast, the <italic>rrd2</italic> and <italic>rid4-1</italic> mutations introduce a stop codon close to the N-terminus of RRD2 and RID4, respectively, likely resulting in the total loss of their functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, in <italic>rrd2</italic>, deficient cyt <italic>c</italic> biogenesis was observed only at high temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, C and D). This might be accounted for by the temperature sensitivity of the function of either <italic>ccb2</italic> or <italic>ccb3</italic>, which exhibit alteration of the amino acid sequence in <italic>rrd2</italic>, because of impaired RNA editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>rid4-1</italic>, a huge reduction in complex V biosynthesis was observed both at permissive and non-permissive temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that mitochondrial impairment and elevated temperature both contribute to LR fasciation in the TDF mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Impaired mitochondrial electron transport causes LR fasciation likely via ROS production</title><p>The phenocopy of the LR fasciation phenotype of the TDF mutants by treatment with respiratory inhibitors demonstrated the causal relationship between defective mitochondrial electron transport and extra cell division during early LR development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, A–D). Mitochondrial electron transport is best known for its role in driving ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. Given the lack of LR fasciation after treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, E and F), reduced ATP production seems unlikely to be the cause of LR fasciation. The fact that the huge reduction in complex V levels observed in <italic>rid4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) does not lead to LR fasciation at the permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsuka and Sugiyama, 2012</xref>) is also supportive of this idea. Experiments using the ROS inducer PQ and the antioxidant ascorbate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, G and H) pointed to mitochondrial ROS generation as the potential trigger of LR fasciation. A previous study also observed enhanced cell division after the application of another ROS inducer, alloxan, during auxin-induced LR formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pasternak et al., 2005</xref>). In agreement with this ‘ROS hypothesis’, all three respiratory inhibitors used in our study (rotenone, antimycin A, and oligomycin) are potent inducers of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Willems et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>ROS have been implicated in stress-induced morphogenic responses (SIMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Potters et al., 2009</xref>). Several studies have shown the involvement of phytohormonal regulation in ROS-triggered SIMR.

Several recent studies have found antagonistic interactions between auxin signaling and mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Auxin is a critical factor in LR development, and the centripetal auxin-gradient formation in early-stage LR primordia is thought to contribute to the organization of the LR primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benková et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geldner et al., 2004</xref>).

Further studies of LR fasciation caused by oxidative stress will elucidate novel aspects of the control of cell proliferation during plant organogenesis.</p><p>Apart from its role in stress response, ROS has recently emerged as a potential signal in and of itself that is required for plant physiology and development under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mittler, 2017</xref>). In the primary root, a regulatory mechanism of meristem size involving spatial zoning of different types of apoplastic ROS has been proposed, whereby O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> promotes cell proliferation in the meristematic zone, while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induces cell differentiation in the elongation zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsukagoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).

Interestingly, during LR formation, factors involved in apoplastic ROS regulation, UPB1 and another transcription factor MYB36, as well as some members of the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG (RBOH) family, are expressed in the periphery of the LR primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernández-Marcos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manzano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orman-Ligeza et al., 2016</xref>); however, the role of apoplastic ROS in controlling the proliferation-to-differentiation transition in the LR boundary remains largely speculative. Whether mitochondrial disorders caused by the TDF mutations have an impact on apoplastic ROS also remains to be investigated. In addition, reactive carbonyl species (RCS), which are lipid peroxidation products generated by ROS, were found to mediate auxin signaling in a feed-forward manner during LR formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mano et al., 2019</xref>); however, no apparent morphological LR phenotype has been observed in RCS-treated plants.

connect mitochondrial RNA processing to control of lateral root morphogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joseph G Dubrovsky (Reviewer #1); Steffen Vanneste (Reviewer #2); Alexis Maizel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The reviewers were very enthusiastic about your work. They identified some shortcomings, but most of it could be addressed by text edits. The reviewers were less convinced about the envisioned link to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ideally, you should consolidate this aspect by depicting the mis-regulated ROS in the mutant, and its restoration in the suppressor double mutants (e.g. by staining). However, the reviewers did not assume that these experiments are essential for acceptance. Alternatively, the discussion on this matter should be carefully revised.</p><p>Please, see the detailed comments of the reviewers below, which may guide you to further improve your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study continues research started by professor Munetaka Sugiyama and his laboratory who identified about 20 years ago, or so, very interesting temperature-dependent fasciation (TDF) mutants affected in lateral root primordium (LRP) morphogenesis. The authors identified and report in this study genes responsible for the mutant phenotype of the root redifferentiation defective 1 (<italic>rrd1</italic>), <italic>rrd2</italic>, and <italic>root initiation defective 4</italic> (<italic>rid4</italic>). Intriguingly, all the genes are involved in RNA processing. Detailed analysis of the role of RRD2 and RID4 in mitochondrial mRNA editing and RRD1 in poly(A) degradation of mitochondrial mRNA make this work a solid and substantial study. The fact that pharmacological treatments of wild type seedlings by mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors can phenocopy the fasciated LRP phenotype is really fine. Similarly, the experiments with paraquat and ascorbate are very interesting. The main conclusion of the work (that LRP morphogenesis is linked to mitochondrial RNA processing and mitochondrion-mediated ROS generation) is novel and significant. I think this is an important step forward in our understanding the LRP morphogenesis.</p><p>I see only one main conceptual or interpretation problem.</p><p>The authors conclude that &quot;that mitochondrial RNA processing is required for limiting cell division during early lateral root (LR) organogenesis&quot;. A similar statement appears where the authors postulate that TDF encode &quot;negative regulators of proliferation that are important for the size restriction of the central zone during the formation of early stage LR primordia&quot;. Again, similar statements appear the Results, and in section of Discussion &quot;Mitochondrial RNA processing is linked to the control of cell proliferation&quot;, especially where the authors say about &quot;the control of cell proliferation at the early stage&quot;</p><p>To my opinion, the above conclusions are arguable and cannot be accepted. To conclude about excessive cells division, the number of anticlinal divisions must be estimated per founder cell. This analysis has not been performed. The fact that at early stages LRPs are wider in the TDF mutants suggests that a greater number of FCs in the longitudinal plane participate in LRP formation. So, if this is correct, the mutations apparently affect control of lateral inhibition, and TDF genes are negative regulators of lateral inhibition. This question should be further investigated, but currently a more careful interpretation of the results is required. Also, if TDF genes encode &quot;negative regulators of proliferation&quot; then more frequent divisions would occur in the mutant. This question was not addressed either. If more frequent cell division is expected in early stage LRPs, this should result in formation of smaller cells. In accordance with Figure 1D of this study and Figures 1B and 3A of Otsuka and Sugiyama, 2012, this is not the case. Contrary, it seems that at the same developmental stage there are lower number of cells per unit of volume in the mutants compared to wild type. Another, possible explanation of the TDF mutant phenotype, in addition to lateral inhibition, is abnormal establishment of stem cell identity or affected stem cell function. Therefore, the mechanistic explanation of the link between TDF gene action and the respective mutant phenotype is not satisfactory. The interpretation given can be corrected and carefully rephrased throughout the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Otsuka and co-workers, describes the mapping of the mutations in <italic>rrd1</italic>, <italic>rrd2</italic> and <italic>rid4</italic> causing the temperature sensitive lateral root morphogenesis defects (fascinated LR meristem). Interestingly, the respective mutated genes all map to genes involved in mitrochondrial mRNA processing, mRNA deadenylation, and mRNA editing. The authors propose that defective ROS homeostasis is causal to excessive cell proliferation in the lateral root primordia, and associated fasciation phenotype. Overall the manuscript is well-written, and is overall convincing with respect to characterization and mapping of the mutants, and the importance of RNA editing in mitochondria for the mutant phenotypes. I am not yet entirely convinced about the link to ROS production and the lateral root morphogenesis defects.</p><p>1) The fascinated LR phenotype is reminiscent of mutants defective in coordination of LR emergence, such as CASP:shy2 (Vermeer et al). Suggesting that defective signaling in LR overlaying layers, could be causal to the observed phenotype. However, the phenotyping presented in this manuscript does not allow to assess this. A detailed staging of LRPs would be required, and/or an analysis of the LRP developmental dynamics using a root bending assay.</p><p>2) Furthermore the expression domain analysis, shows clear expression in LRPs. However, I suspect expression of at least RID4-GFP in LRP overlaying layers. However, the resolution of the picture, and interference of the bright π counterstaining in Figure 2B preclude a thorough assessment of this.</p><p>3) The colocalization analysis in Figure 2D and E is not very clear. The mitotracker signal is set a bit too weak, making it difficult to assess the distinction between the GFP signal and the overlapping (yellow) signal). This could be amended by using different LUTs (also green/reds are not great for colorblind readers). Of note is the presence of relatively large structure labeled by RDD1-GFP, that is not colocalizing with mitotracker, suggesting it also localized to another subcellular compartment. Therefore, colocalization should be addressed more quantitatively, also using additional organellar markers. Additionally, the mitochondrial localization could be further supported by western blot on purified mitochondria.</p><p>4) The accumulation of polyadenylated transcripts in Figure 3D, seems to display also a temperature sensitivity in the WT. Why was this assay not done using a quantitative PCR, that will allow appreciating better the temperature component.</p><p>5) In contrast to the LR phenotyping as displayed in Figure 1, the LR phenotyping in Figure 4 is done in a completely different way. Why not use a uniform way to quantify. As it was done now, the suppression of rdd1 by ags1 mutation, is not very convincing, as the <italic>rrd1</italic> phenotype is nearly abolished in the Col-0 introgressed line (Figure 4 B), suggesting that the <italic>rrd1</italic> phenotype is sensitized in the Ler background.</p><p>6) While the authors focus on the LR morphology phenotype in the mutants, there is also a prominent effect on primary root growth that is not described. However, this phenotype does not seem to be very ecotype-specific, and is rescued in the ags1 background. A small phenotypic characterization of the primary root phenotype could thus be beneficial for the manuscript, and it wider relevance for development.</p><p>7) Figure 5. -&gt; explain arrowheads in B, in the legend. Bar charts using mean + and – SD should be avoided when you do not have many data points, as in D and F (N=3 and 2). Better to show the raw data. Loading controls are missing for Figure 5 C and E.</p><p>8) The section about ROS is all based on ROS related pharmacology. However, ROS levels in the mutants were not assessed, making it difficult to use the pharmacological treatments to interpret the origin of the mutant phenotypes.</p><p>9) What is the link to the temperature sensitivity. Are these mutants hypersensitive to ROS inducing treatments?</p><p>10) While the role of ROS in LR development is key to the proposed model, the authors did not introduce what is the state of the art about ROS in lateral and primary root development.</p><p>11) In their model the authors might need to discuss whether or not ROS from the LRP could act as an intercellular coordinative developmental signal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Otsuka et al. report the characterisation of three temperature sensitive alleles of genes which prominently lead to overproliferation of cells in lateral root primordia. Interestingly this phenotype which is not underpinned by alteration of the auxin pattern, can be phenocopied by treatment with ROS and by interfering with the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This reveal that ROS modulate cell proliferation in the LR. The cloning and biochemical characterisation of the genes affected, reveal that all three encode enzyme involved in mt RNA processing, that perturb the production of certain components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.</p><p>This is an excellent manuscript that points to a new and very interesting link between primary metabolism and cell proliferation in lateral roots. It is remarkably well written and presented. The conclusion are fully supported by the data. As it is the case for exciting new discoveries, they raise a lot of questions and this manuscript is no exception. It would be very interesting for future work to uncover the nature of the molecular link between ROS and cell proliferation and why are LR so sensitive to this. It'd be eventually interesting to speculate whether the reported existence of an hypoxic environment in the centre of the LRP has to do with this.</p><p>The one point, I would like to hear some comments from the authors about relates to the growth conditions used to reveal the phenotype at restrictive temperature. They mention that they use explant culture on RIM (characterised by high glucose and high 2.5µM IBA). What's the penetrance of the phenotype in standard (1/2 MS, 1% sucrose, no additional auxin/IBA)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61611.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I see only one main conceptual or interpretation problem.</p><p>The authors conclude that &quot;that mitochondrial RNA processing is required for limiting cell division during early lateral root (LR) organogenesis&quot;.

We intended to use the phrase “excessive cell division” to refer to the increase in lateral root primordium cell number observed in the TDF mutants (Figure 1C to E), regardless of whether it is due to increased rounds of cell division of the founder cells (1) or participation of increased number of neighboring pericycle cells as founder cells to primordium formation (2). However, as you have pointed out, “excessive cell division” could be interpreted solely as (1). To avoid this confusion, we have replaced “excessive” with “extra” and also added a paragraph that states the two types of extra cell divisions ((1) and (2)) as a potential cause of LR fasciation to the Discussion section (sub-section “Extra cell division during early primordium development leads to LR fasciation”). With this correction, we believe that the statements made in our manuscript are now reasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Otsuka and co-workers, describes the mapping of the mutations in rrd1, rrd2 and rid4 causing the temperature sensitive lateral root morphogenesis defects (fascinated LR meristem).

As you have suggested, defective signaling in the LR overlaying tissues is one of the possible mechanisms that cause LR fasciation. However, given the current state of our research, it is beyond this work to determine the point of action of the TDF mutations. We would like to address this issue in future research by more detailed analysis of LRP development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore the expression domain analysis, shows clear expression in LRPs.

We had mentioned weak expression of the GFP markers in tissues overlaying the LR primordium in the original manuscript; however, as you have pointed out, the quality of the original micrograph was not satisfactory to make a clear assessment. We have redone the microscopy with some technical improvements, such as the use of a 60X oil emulsion objective lens instead of a 40X water emulsion objective lens and weaker π counterstaining. The new micrographs (Figure 2B) provide better resolution of the GFP expression patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The colocalization analysis in Figure 2D and E is not very clear.

We have adjusted the mitotracker signal level and also converted the red channel to magenta.

Throughout this study, we have used the measurement of LR width at the 6<sup>th</sup> day of culture as the standard method to assess the LR phenotype. In the cytological characterization of LR fasciation in the TDF mutants shown in Figure 1, we employed a different observation protocol in order to measure the cell number of the outermost layer of MOL and the widths of MOL and MTL at particular stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) While the authors focus on the LR morphology phenotype in the mutants, there is also a prominent effect on primary root growth that is not described.

In each experiment, the accuracy of the protein quantification by XL-Bradford was additionally checked by observation of CBB stained electrophoresis gels (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> for Figure 5C); however, for Figure 5E, we unfortunately failed to obtain a digital image data of the stained gel, due to physical damage to the gel.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61611-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The section about ROS is all based on ROS related pharmacology.

We agree with you opinion that it is highly important to quantify ROS levels in the TDF mutants; however, we found it very difficult to accurately assess mitochondrial ROS in the LR primordium, due to issues such as the impermeability of the root endodermis to the fluorescent probes and the lack of adequate techniques to distinguish mitochondrial ROS from apoplastic ROS when using colorimetric methods. Further efforts would be required to improve the situation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What is the link to the temperature sensitivity.

They mention that they use explant culture on RIM (characterised by high glucose and high 2.5µM IBA). What's the penetrance of the phenotype in standard (1/2 MS, 1% sucrose, no additional auxin/IBA)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. In order to examine the effects of the TDF mutations on mophogenesis of new LR primordia, we used the semi-synchronous induction system throughout this study. When seedlings of the TDF mutants were grown in the standard condition at the restrictive temperature, it was difficult to see the direct effects of the mutations on LR development because primary root growth was severely affected as shown in our previous papers and also in Figure 4C and Figure 2—figure supplement 3B of this work. When seedling grown in the standard condition at the permissive temperature were exposed to the restrictive temperature by a simple temperature-shift protocol, we occasionally observed formation of abnormal LRs including fasciated ones. However, we did not evaluate quantitatively this phenotype because we could not determine which LRs were newly formed and which LRs were developed from the existing primordia. Examination of LRs induced via gravistimulated root bending in a temperature-shift experiment could be suitable for answering your question, since the LR primordia that have experienced the temperature-shift are expected to be easily identifiable. Preliminary experiments using <italic>rid4-2</italic> have suggested that fasciation also occurs in root bending-induced LRs, but further refining of the experimental system is required.</p></body></sub-article></article>
