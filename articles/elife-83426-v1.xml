Yet, studying color pattern evolution has been historically difficult owing to differences in perceptual ability of humans and analytical challenges with studying how complex color patterns evolve. Island systems provide a natural laboratory for testing hypotheses about the direction and magnitude of phenotypic change. A recent study found that plumage colors of island species are darker and less complex than continental species. Whether such shifts in plumage complexity are associated with increased rates of color evolution remains unknown. Here, we use geometric morphometric techniques to test the hypothesis that plumage complexity and insularity interact to influence color diversity in a species-rich clade of colorful birds—kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae). In particular, we test three predictions: (1) plumage complexity enhances interspecific rates of color evolution, (2) plumage complexity is lower on islands, and (3) rates of plumage color evolution are higher on islands. Our results show that more complex plumages result in more diverse colors among species and that island species have higher rates of color evolution. Importantly, we found that island species did not have more complex plumages than their continental relatives. Thus, complexity may be a key innovation that facilitates evolutionary response of individual color patches to distinct selection pressures on islands, rather than being a direct target of selection itself. This study demonstrates how a truly multivariate treatment of color data can reveal evolutionary patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Birds are among the most colorful animals on Earth. The different patterns and colors displayed on their feathers help them to identify their own species, attract mates or hide from predators.</p><p>The bright plumages of birds are achieved through either pigments (such as reds and yellows) or structures (such as blues, greens or ultraviolet) inside feathers, or through a combination of both pigments and structures. Variation in the diversity of color patterns over time can give a helpful insight into the rate of evolution of a species. For example, structural colors evolve more quickly than pigment-based ones and can therefore be a key feature involved in species recognition or mate attraction.</p><p>Studying the evolution of plumage patterns has been challenging due to differences in the vision of humans and birds. However, recent advances in technology have enabled researchers to map the exact wavelengths of the colors that make up the patterns, allowing for rigorous comparison of plumage color patterns across different individuals and species.</p><p>To gain a greater understanding of how plumage color patterns evolve in birds, Eliason et al. studied kingfishers, a group of birds known for their complex and variable color patterns, and their worldwide distribution. The experiments analyzed the plumage color patterns of 72 kingfisher species (142 individual museum specimens) from both mainland and island populations by quantifying the amount of different wavelengths of light reflecting from a feather and accounting for relationships among species and among feather patches.</p><p>The analyzes showed that having more complex patterns leads to a greater accumulation of plumage colors over time, supporting the idea that complex plumages provide more traits for natural or sexual selection to act upon.</p><p>Moreover, in upper parts of the bodies, such as the back, the plumage varied more across the different species and evolved faster than in ventral parts, such as the belly or throat. This indicates that sexual selection may be the evolutionary force driving variation in more visible areas, such as the back, while patterns in the ventral part of the body are more important for kin recognition.</p><p>Eliason et al. further found no differences in plumage complexity between kingfishers located in island or mainland habitats, suggesting that the isolation of the island and the different selection pressures this may bring does not impact the complexity of color patterns. However, kingfisher species located on islands did display higher rates of color evolution. This indicates that, regardless of the complexity of the plumage, island-specific pressures are driving rapid color diversification.</p><p>Using a new multivariate approach, Eliason et al. have unearthed a pattern in plumage complexity that may otherwise have been missed and, for the first time, have linked differences in color pattern on individual birds with evolutionary differences across species. In doing so, they have provided a framework for future studies of color evolution. The next steps in this research would be to better understand why the island species are evolving more rapidly even though they do not have more complex plumage patterns and how the observed color differences relate to rapid rates of speciation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sexual selection</kwd><kwd>biogeography</kwd><kwd>island rule</kwd><kwd>evolutionary rate</kwd><kwd>multivariate comparative methods</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Aves</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP-2112468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eliason</surname><given-names>Chad M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP-2112467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1557051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Treating color patterns in a geometric morphometrics framework reveals rapid rates of color evolution that are explained by a combination of intrinsic organismal features (color variation among patches) and geography within a cosmopolitan radiation of birds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding spatial and temporal trends in phenotypic diversity continues to be an important challenge in evolutionary biology. Colorful signals in birds are a good case study for a rapidly evolving phenotype that shows variation at broad spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooney et al., 2022</xref>) and phylogenetic scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooney et al., 2019</xref>). Birds produce colorful plumage patterns with a combination of two mechanisms: light absorption by pigments and light scattering by feather nanostructures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shawkey and D’Alba, 2017</xref>). Whereas melanin- and carotenoid-based coloration are produced by chemical pigments and absorb light waves, structural colors are produced by the physical interaction of light waves and nanometer-scale variations in the feather integument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prum, 2006</xref>). Within birds, structural colors produce a wide array of color, including blue-green colors, glossy blacks, and iridescence. Because structural colors are more evolutionarily labile than pigment-based colors, they have faster evolutionary rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Eliason et al., 2015</xref>) and are considered key innovations in some clades (e.g., African starlings; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maia et al., 2013b</xref>). In addition to how color is produced, birds also vary in where they deploy colors in their plumage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stoddard and Prum, 2011</xref>). Yet, studying color pattern evolution has been historically difficult due to our inability to perceive UV color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eaton, 2005</xref>) and challenges with quantifying and analyzing complex color patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mason and Bowie, 2020</xref>).</p><p>While the color of individual patches can be influenced in different directions by multiple selective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cuthill et al., 2017</xref>), the deployment of color in distinct patterns appears to be constrained developmentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hidalgo et al., 2022</xref>). Since selection can only act on existing variability, such as distinct plumage patches across a bird’s body, ancestrally shared developmental bases of plumage patterns might act as a brake on color evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Price and Pavelka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hidalgo et al., 2022</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Felice et al., 2018</xref>). For example, in a hypothetical, uniformly colored species with strong developmental constraints that limit independent variation in color among patches, selection on the color of any single patch would cause the whole plumage to change in tandem. By contrast, if a species is variably colored (i.e., patchy, and therefore has a more complex plumage) with few constraints on the direction of color variation for different patches, selection can act on different aspects of coloration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks and Couldridge, 1999</xref>). On a macroevolutionary scale, we would predict greater color divergence in a clade with an ancestrally complex plumage pattern because there is more standing color variation among patches upon which selection can act. On a more microevolutionary scale, however, intraspecific plumage complexity (i.e., the degree of variably colored patches across a bird’s body) could be a key innovation that drives rates of color evolution in birds and should be considered alongside ecological and geographic hypotheses.</p><p>Islands have been considered natural laboratories for studying evolution because they often lack natural predators and competitors due to their geographic isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Losos and Ricklefs, 2009</xref>). Compared to life history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Covas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Losos et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Novosolov et al., 2013</xref>), behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buglione et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roff, 1994</xref>), and morphological traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clegg and Owens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wright et al., 2016</xref>), signals used in mating and social contexts have been less commonly explored in the context of island evolution. Yet, previous work has shown increased color polymorphism in island snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellido et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ożgo, 2011</xref>) and lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corl et al., 2010</xref>). Within birds, island species tend to be less sexually dimorphic and have simpler songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Price, 2008</xref>). Island birds have also been shown to have darker colors and simpler plumage patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bliard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doutrelant et al., 2016</xref>). Under a species-recognition hypothesis, these shifts are thought to be driven by reduced competition on islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doutrelant et al., 2016</xref>), as fewer competitors would lower the risk of hybridization and cause a reduction in signal distinctiveness on islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">West-Eberhard, 1983</xref>). Despite these advances, we lack a detailed understanding of color evolution within, rather than between, island and mainland clades. For example, are changes in plumage color on islands also accompanied by bursts in phenotypic evolutionary rates, as has been shown for morphological traits in other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Millien, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woods et al., 2020</xref>)?</p><p>Two hallmarks of kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae) are their complex plumage patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eliason et al., 2019</xref>) and their island distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McCullough et al., 2019</xref>). Kingfishers encompass a wide variety of colors—from the aquamarine-colored back of the common kingfisher (<italic>Alcedo atthis</italic>) to the brilliant silver back of the southern silvery-kingfisher (<italic>Ceyx argentatus</italic>), as well as the purple rump of the ultramarine kingfisher (<italic>Todiramphus leucopygius</italic>). They also run the gamut of plumage complexity, including intricate scalloped plumage of the spotted kingfisher (<italic>Actenoides lindsayi</italic>) and the contrasting hues of the black-backed dwarf-kingfisher (<italic>Ceyx erithaca</italic>). The family is widely distributed across the globe, but their center of diversity is the Indo-Pacific, including island clades in Wallacea and Melanesia that have recently been highlighted for their high diversification rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>). These same island clades, specifically within the woodland kingfisher genus <italic>Todiramphus</italic> and <italic>Ceyx</italic> pygmy-kingfishers, also have elevated color diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eliason et al., 2019</xref>) and complex geographic histories. These genera include many allopatric, island-endemic taxa, as well as harboring a high degree of sympatry on islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). For example, there are 10 species of kingfishers that occur on the Indonesian island Halmahera, 5 of which are in the genus <italic>Todiramphus</italic>. There are also multiple instances of sympatry in <italic>Ceyx</italic>, including on New Guinea, the Philippines, and the Solomon Islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>). Smaller population sizes, isolation, and genetic drift could potentially explain high rates of color evolution in island kingfishers, making them an ideal system to investigate the interplay between key innovations (complex plumages) and geographic isolation (i.e., spatial opportunity) in driving rapid color evolution.</p><p>In this study, we implement geometric morphometric techniques to investigate complex plumage pattern evolution across kingfishers. We hypothesized that potential constraints limiting where and how color is produced on a bird’s body should also limit evolutionary changes between species. Specifically, if complex plumages are a key innovation enabling rapid rates of color evolution (Prediction 1), and if plumage complexity is lower on islands (Prediction 2), then insularity and plumage complexity should both influence the direction and rate of change of plumage coloration (Prediction 3; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We tested these predictions using UV–vis reflectance spectrophotometry of museum specimens and multivariate comparative methods. Our study of the interplay between the arrangement of color patches, interspecific competition, and geography sheds light more broadly on the role of spatial opportunity in phenotypic evolution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustrative guide to methods used to study kingfisher plumage coloration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow chart depicting our process: (1) spectrophotometry of 22 plumage patches on closed-wing museum specimens, (2) conversion of data to tetrahedral colorspace coordinates, and (3) different ways we analyzed these data across the kingfisher phylogeny. We analyzed how individual patch colors evolved using multivariate comparative methods (3a). To estimate complexity at the intraspecific level (3b), we calculated three different metrics for each tip in the phylogeny: average pairwise distance among color patches (metric c1); the color volume (i.e., range) of all plumage patches in colorspace (metric c2); and the number of contiguous color patches that would be perceived as the same color by a bird (metric c3). We calculated interspecific rates of overall plumage color evolution using multivariate rate tests (3c). (<bold>B</bold>) We predicted faster rates of color evolution on islands (blue line) and in species with more complex plumages. Yet, there are examples of cases in which this relationship may be reversed (e.g., see insets showing species pairs with simple plumages and diverse colors, left, as well as complex plumages and similar colors, right).

To visualize trends in these data, we conducted a partitioning of variance analysis that revealed two distinct modes of color variation within kingfishers: (1) clades with complex color patterns that partition color variance more among patches than among species or individuals (e.g., <italic>Corythornis,</italic> Alcedininae) and (2) clades that vary more among species (e.g., <italic>Todiramphus</italic>, Cerylininae; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Chromatic variation among sexes was negligible for most clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Evolutionary rates of color were unevenly distributed across the body, with dorsal regions evolving faster than ventral ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This differs from several previous studies illustrating rapid rates of ventral plumage evolution in tanagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shultz and Burns, 2017</xref>), manakins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doucet et al., 2007</xref>), fairy-wrens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Friedman and Remeš, 2015</xref>), and antbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marcondes and Brumfield, 2019</xref>). This could indicate that dorsal plumage patches are under stronger sexual selection in kingfishers, as rapid rates of display trait evolution are thought to be associated with more intense sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Irwin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seddon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Merwin et al., 2020</xref>). Rump, cheek, and throat patches showed the highest levels of phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that these patches are more taxonomically informative than crown or wing plumage coloration. To visualize major axes of variation in overall plumage color patterning, we used a phylogenetic principal components analysis (pPCA), with per-patch color coordinates as variables (<italic>N</italic> = 66). We plotted the first two pPC scores that together accounted for &gt;50% of color variation in the clade, revealing extensive color pattern variation in the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for non-phylogenetic PCA results).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Perceptually uniform colorspace and color variation in kingfishers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Color data, with points being the average of three plumage patch measurements for each individual (<italic>N</italic> = 3101).

For each species, we calculated plumage complexity for both chromatic (i.e., hue and saturation) and achromatic components (i.e., lightness) of plumage patches in three ways: (1) as the mean pairwise distance among all patches in colorspace; (2) as the color volume (or lightness range for achromatic plumage components; see Methods) enclosing all points for a species, and (3) as the number of uniquely colored contiguous patches on the body, assessed using just noticeable differences (JNDs &gt;1 threshold) for a folded-wing plumage configuration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, section 3b). The latter two metrics are similar to a recent method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eliason et al., 2019</xref>) of calculating color complexity of plumages as the number of contiguous body regions sharing the same color mechanism (e.g., melanin-based or structural coloration), but they are based on continuous reflectance values instead of discrete color data (i.e., presence or absence of a given color mechanism). With this metric, higher differences between adjacent patches yielded higher plumage complexity scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, section 3b). Estimates of plumage complexity were strongly correlated among different complexity metrics for chromatic components of plumage coloration, but less so for achromatic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Species with complex plumages have higher rates of color evolution</title><p>Plumage complexity of an individual bird and interspecific differences in coloration are typically thought of as distinct axes of color diversity. Yet, species that have evolved several patches have more degrees of freedom to vary, potentially leading to faster rates of color evolution among species. However, this is not necessarily the case, as there are examples within kingfishers that show simple plumages yet high color divergence, as well as complex plumages with little evolutionary divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Here, we attempt to link plumage complexity with interspecific rates of color variation using multivariate approaches typically only applied in the field of geometric morphometrics. To determine rates of overall plumage evolution, we used a recent time-calibrated phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McCullough et al., 2019</xref>) that incorporated thousands of ultraconserved elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faircloth et al., 2012</xref>) and fully sampled the avian order Coraciiformes (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, and allies). Next, using multivariate color data, we estimated species-specific multivariate rates of evolution using the R package RRphylo v. 2.6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castiglione et al., 2018</xref>). Because we predicted that insularity results in faster rates of plumage color evolution, we included insularity as a covariate in our phylogenetic analyses. Comparing species-specific rates of plumage color evolution with intraspecific complexity metrics, we found that rates of color evolution were higher in species with more complex plumages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> for sex-specific results).

However, recent work in wolf spiders has revealed that signal complexity per se can be a direct target of sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). Another possibility in kingfishers is that body size is driving the evolution of plumage complexity, as signal complexity has been shown to decrease with body size in iguanian lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ord and Blumstein, 2002</xref>) and in passerine birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooney et al., 2022</xref>).

This supports the idea that plumage complexity, rather than uniformity, provides more phenotypic traits for natural selection to act upon.

In birds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doutrelant et al., 2016</xref> measured coloration in 4448 patches of 232 species (including eight kingfisher species) and found that island-dwelling species have darker colors and fewer color patches (i.e., less complex plumages) than mainland species. This differs from the results of our study, as we found no difference in achromatic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) or chromatic plumage complexity between mainland and island species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Rather, it is the rates of evolution that increase once kingfishers colonize islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests decoupling between the effects of complexity and insularity on color evolution rates, and is consistent with previous work showing elevated rates of morphological evolution being independent of the acquisition of a key innovation, such as gecko toepads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garcia-Porta and Ord, 2013</xref>). However, this does not answer the question of why plumage color among island lineages would differ more than among mainland lineages.</p><p>Contrary to the prevailing view that island species should have reduced diversity of mate recognition signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">West-Eberhard, 1983</xref>), island kingfishers have more variable plumages than their continental relatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Historical explanations for why colors might evolve include increased conspicuousness for mating displays and more efficient species recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andersson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doucet et al., 2007</xref>). The species-recognition hypothesis predicts reduced signal distinctiveness (i.e., low amounts of plumage variation) on islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">West-Eberhard, 1983</xref>). This is because of the lack of potential competitors and conspecifics on islands that would otherwise put selective pressures on color patterns, for example through reproductive character displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Drury et al., 2018</xref>). However, we found no support for this idea, as evolutionary rates of coloration were not significantly associated with the number of sympatric species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Another mechanism that could explain the observed rapid color evolution on islands is divergence in abiotic factors among islands. Structural coloration, responsible for vivid blues, greens, and purples, is salient in kingfishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stavenga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eliason et al., 2019</xref>). Compared to pigment-based colors, structural colors exhibit some of the fastest rates of color evolution known in birds (e.g., hummingbirds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eliason et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Venable et al., 2022</xref>). Structural and melanin-based forms of coloration may have thermal benefits to birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rogalla et al., 2022</xref>), and both molt speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Griggio et al., 2009</xref>) and dietary protein availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meadows et al., 2012</xref>) have been shown to influence structurally colored signals. Thus, divergence in food availability or climate among island populations could be driving rapid shifts in coloration. Future work will be needed to tease apart the relative roles of genetic drift, competition, and abiotic factors in driving color evolution on islands. The kingfisher genus <italic>Todiramphus</italic> harbors several ‘superspecies’—monophyletic groups of allopatric and morphologically distinct taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayr, 1963</xref>)—and therefore could be an ideal study system for clarifying the roles of ecology and constraint in driving color diversity on within and between islands.</p><p>Studying color pattern evolution has been historically difficult, due, in part, to an inability of humans to perceive UV color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eaton, 2005</xref>) and difficulties with measuring and analyzing complex color patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mason and Bowie, 2020</xref>). Recent work has showed that changes in plumage complexity are associated with shifts in light environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shultz and Burns, 2013</xref>). Here, plumage complexity was treated as a response variable rather than as a predictor of overall color divergence between lineages. Our results therefore provide a contrast to previous work in looking at a potential developmental constraint—how plumage patches are arranged on the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Price and Pavelka, 1996</xref>)—and its causal influence on evolutionary trends of color divergence. A caveat with our approach is that it does not consider color patterning within feathers. For example, the species with the least complex plumage according to the mean interpatch color distance (metric c1) is the pied kingfisher (<italic>Ceryle rudis</italic>), despite its conspicuous black and white barring/spotting across its body and even within individual feathers. We hope that researchers will consider the morphometrics approach we take here, as well as assess its potential strengths and weaknesses, in future studies on the evolution of complex color patterns in nature.</p><p>In this study, we collected a large amount of spectral data (9362 measurements of 142 individuals in 72 species) in a diverse family of birds notable for their complex plumages and rapid speciation on islands. The major finding of our study is that complex plumage patterns enable faster rates of color evolution compared to simpler, uniform plumages. Colonization of islands, independent of plumage complexity, resulted in further divergence of coloration among species. More broadly, these results highlight the interplay between a potential key innovation (i.e., plumage complexity) and geographical opportunity for allopatric speciation in birds. It also highlights the need for incorporating multidimensional aspects of plumage patterns in such analyses. Further research is needed to test whether complex plumages are more common in clades that are speciating rapidly and if complexity is itself a direct target of sexual selection (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Measuring feather color</title><p>Using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics) operating in bird-visible wavelengths (300–700 nm), we measured reflectance spectra at normal incidence in triplicate for 22 patches (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) in 72 species, including both males and females, from museum specimens. In total, we obtained 9303 spectra for 142 individuals (available on Dryad). We averaged three spectra per patch per specimen and converted values into avian tetrahedral colorspace (u, s, m, and l channels) using the vismodel function in pavo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maia et al., 2013a</xref>), based on a UV-sensitive visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parrish et al., 1984</xref>). We converted quantum catches into perceptually uniform <italic>XYZ</italic> coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pike, 2012</xref>) for use in downstream comparative analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The distance between pairs of coordinates in this colorspace is proportional to the just noticeable difference (JND). As these data only capture variation in chromatic aspects of coloration, we also assessed achromatic variation by calculating luminance as the quantum catch for the double cone. We used photosensitivity data for the blue tit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hart et al., 2000</xref>) due to the limited availability of sensitivity data for other avian species, and we further accounted for receptor noise following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olsson et al., 2018</xref>. We converted luminance values into a scale where distances between pairs of measurements are equivalent to JND values by subtracting ln(0.01) from the ln luminance values and dividing this by the Weber fraction (<italic>ω </italic>= 0.1), following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pike, 2012</xref>. Although it is possible, in theory, to combine chromatic and achromatic channels of plumage variation in a single analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pike, 2012</xref>), we opted to analyze them separately because they are likely under different selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Osorio and Vorobyev, 2005</xref>) and we wanted to be able to compare our results with previous work on island bird coloration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doutrelant et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Assessing color variation</title><p>To gain an understanding of how color varies across different levels of organization (e.g., plumage patches), we performed a taxonomic analysis of variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Derrickson and Ricklefs, 1988</xref>). Briefly, we fit a linear mixed model in MCMCglmm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hadfield and Nakagawa, 2010</xref>) using colorspace <italic>XYZ</italic> coordinates as amultivariate response, with random effects for plumage patch, sex, and species. We set rather uninformative priors (<italic>ν</italic> = 2 for random effects, <italic>ν</italic> = 0.002 for residual covariance) and ran the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains for 10<sup>6</sup> generations, discarding 25% as burn-in. We ran two chains and assessed convergence by plotting the Gelman–Rubin diagnostic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gelman and Rubin, 1992</xref>) using gelman.plot in the R package coda 0.19.4. From the fitted models, we calculated the sum of mean posterior variances for each colorspace coordinate and estimated the proportional amount of variation explained at each level of organization by dividing each variance by the total variance (see Dryad for R code). To visualize color pattern diversity, we used pPCA to reduce the dimensionality of our color data set. We performed pPCA using the phyl.pca_pl function in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clavel et al., 2019</xref>) based on the covariance matrix. Phylogenetic PCA has been criticized because of the influence of component selection bias when used in downstream comparative analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uyeda et al., 2015</xref>), therefore we also performed an ordinary PCA with the prcomp function in R, with similar parameters as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantifying plumage complexity</title><p>To estimate plumage complexity at the individual level, we obtained pairwise perceptual distances (proportional to just noticeable differences, JNDs) using the coldist function in pavo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maia et al., 2013b</xref>). Since we measured color of 22 patches, this resulted in a 22 × 22 matrix for each individual. Next, using these chromatic and achromatic distances, we calculated plumage complexity in three ways (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, section 3b). First, we averaged these distance matrices by species and calculated mean interpatch distances (metric c1) using the R dist function. Second, we calculated the total colorspace volume occupied by an individual’s plumage (metric c3) as a 3D volume for <italic>XYZ</italic> colorspace coordinates. We used the convhulln function in the R package geometry v. 0.4.6.1 to calculate this metric, which can also be described as the range of luminance values for achromatic variables. Third, we calculated complexity as the number of distinct contiguous patches in folded-wing body configuration (metric c3). To do so, we converted species color distance matrices to binary scores indicating whether pairs of patches are perceptibly distinct (JND &gt;1) or not (JND &lt;1), resulting in a pairwise color distance matrix (<italic>M</italic><sub>JND</sub>), with 0 indicating patches that are distinct and 1 indicating patches that would be perceived as the same by a bird. For each individual, we multiplied <italic>M</italic><sub>JND</sub> by the adjacency matrix <italic>M</italic><sub>adj</sub>. In <italic>M</italic><sub>adj</sub>, 1 indicates patches that are adjacent on a bird’s body and 0 indicates non-adjacent patches. Multiplying <italic>M</italic><sub>JND</sub> by <italic>M</italic><sub>adj</sub> results in a matrix with 1 if patches are both adjacent and indistinguishable in colorspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Finally, we converted these final matrices into igraph objects using graph_from_adjacency_matrix and determined the number of distinct plumage regions using the components function in igraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>). We only considered a folded-wing plumage configuration because this is how a bird would be typically seen by a conspecific and because folded-wing complexity scores were highly correlated with spread-wing complexity (<italic>r</italic> = 0.98).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Understanding the tempo and mode of color evolution</title><p>To understand evolutionary trends on a per-patch basis, we compared phylogenetic signal and rates of color evolution within each individual plumage patch (<italic>N</italic> = 22, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>) using distance-based comparative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Denton and Adams, 2015</xref>). Next, to account for phylogenetic signal at the overall plumage level, we fit multivariate Brownian motion and Pagel’s <italic>λ</italic> models for all color traits (i.e., 22 lightness variables, 66 color variables) using the fit_t_pl function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clavel et al., 2019</xref>) in RPANDA v. 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morlon et al., 2016</xref>). We compared models using generalized information criteria. The best-fitting model was a Pagel’s <italic>λ</italic> model for both achromatic and chromatic plumage components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), thus we used these <italic>λ</italic> estimates to transform branch lengths of the phylogeny prior to running multivariate comparative analyses. Although variance tests revealed some color variation attributable to sex differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), multivariate phylogenetic integration tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams et al., 2014c</xref>) revealed significant correlations between male and female plumage coloration for both plumage color (r-PLS = 0.88, p &lt; 0.01, <italic>N</italic> = 57) and lightness (r-PLS = 0.93, p &lt; 0.01, <italic>N</italic> = 57). Therefore, for primary analyses, we used a combined data set with male and female color data averaged together for each species. However, we also included results for the males-only (<italic>N</italic> = 63) and females-only data sets (<italic>N</italic> = 68; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a–e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Testing ecological predictors of plumage color variation</title><p>To the prediction that species on islands have less complex plumages, as predicted by the species-recognition hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">West-Eberhard, 1983</xref>), we used phylogenetic linear models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ho and Ané, 2014</xref>). For the models, complexity metric was set as the response variable and the predictors were insularity and the number of sympatric species (additional parameters: method = &quot;lambda&quot;, lower.bound = 1e−10; see Dryad for R code). Body mass has recently been shown to explain variation plumage complexity of passerine birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooney et al., 2022</xref>), therefore we also included ln body mass (in grams) as a covariate in our regression models (species averages obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dunning, 2007</xref>). We removed non-important variables from the models using a bidirectional AIC-based stepwise procedure in phylostep. To further test whether species on islands are convergent in their overall plumage color patterns, we used a multivariate d-PGLS approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams, 2014b</xref>) implemented in the prodD.pgls function of geomorph v. 4.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2013</xref>).

We ran PGLS models with species-specific rates as the response and complexity metrics (c1, c2, and c3), ln body mass, insularity, and the number of sympatric species as predictors. We included several complexity metrics in the same analyses since these metrics are likely capturing somewhat different aspects of plumage complexity. As an example, a hypothetical bird with a mostly black plumage and a single red patch would result in a high color volume despite a low mean interpatch distance. We fit models for both plumage variable types (chromatic and achromatic) and sexes (males and females) using the options method = &quot;lambda&quot; and lower.bound = 1e−10 and determined the best-fitting model using a stepwise AIC-based procedure with phylostep (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f and g</xref> for results of all models tested). Because some complexity metrics were correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we assessed multicollinearity with VIFs. Briefly, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mundry, 2014</xref>, we (1) re-formulated the best-fitting PGLS model with each complexity metric set as the response variable rather than a predictor, (2) estimated <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values for each model with the R2.lik function in rr2 v. 1.0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ives, 2019</xref>), and (3) calculated VIFs as 1/(1<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>). To further test the sensitivity of PGLS estimates to potential multicollinearity, we re-fit the best-fitting models after dropping each complexity metric in turn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for results). All variables were scaled prior to PGLS analysis to make coefficients comparable across models (i.e., as effect sizes).</p><p>In addition to this PGLS approach, we also used a well-established method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Denton and Adams, 2015</xref>) for comparing rates among groups with high and low plumage complexity scores.

We used the permutation option with 999 iterations to assess significance of the relationship between predictors (complexity or insularity) and rates of color evolution.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Kaspar Delhey as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The two main topics linked to evolutionary rates of plumage colour, island-dwelling, and plumage complexity need to be better introduced and linked in the introduction. This is a point that was made in one form or another by the three reviewers.</p><p>2) The concept of plumage complexity, which is central to the paper, requires a more comprehensive explanation. In particular, how it differs from evolutionary divergence to avoid any potential circularity.</p><p>3) The methods used to analyse differences in colour evolutionary rates constitute some of the most novel aspects of the paper. However, these are difficult to follow. The authors need to cater for two different types of readers here:</p><p>(a) Those that only want to broadly understand the methods used and</p><p>(b) those that will want to adapt the methods to their own study system.</p><p>To deal with (a) Rev 4 suggestion of a flowchart figure illustrating the methods provides an elegant way to summarise the approach used. For (b) much more detail is needed regarding the multiple ways in which analyses can vary, this ranges from information regarding arguments used within specific functions to better explanations as to why certain methodological decisions were taken.</p><p>4) There are many statistical analyses in the paper. Some may be better suited than others (e.g. the pitfalls of using PCA suggest that maybe they are less well suited) and some seem somewhat redundant. The authors should try to streamline this as much as possible, potentially discarding ancillary analyses that do not deal with the main questions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments (ln refer to line numbers)</p><p>Ln 112-128 Is the PCA needed to describe colour variation? It does not seem to add much and PCA has been recently criticised in the context of comparative analyses and other multivariate approaches (some of which are implemented in the paper) are preferred (Uyeda et al., 2015; Adams and Collyer, 2018).</p><p>Ln 139 high phylogenetic signal == species diagnostic traits. I am not sure that this should be the case, the high phylogenetic signal would indicate that closely related species have similar colours, and hence such species groups would share rather than differ in these traits. Thus, species identity among closely related species would not be easily signalled by such colours.</p><p>Ln 179-180 and in passerine birds see (Cooney et al., 2022).</p><p>Ln 140-187 Why did you not try to use geomorph::compare.evol.rates to compare multivariate evolutionary rates between species with low and high plumage complexity? I know this approach only deals with tips and not nodes, but it is a bit unsatisfactory to use one approach for one question and another one for the other given that the procedures are quite different.</p><p>Ln 225 why intra-specific competition?</p><p>Ln 236 p=0.08 should not be interpreted as no support (see (Muff et al., 2021)), and it would be good to state the direction of this effect in the text as well (does it lean towards convergence or away from it?) as most readers will not be familiar with this particular statistic.</p><p>Ln 238 with 'drabber' do you mean darker (less light)? I would be careful with using terms such as drab or bright (dark and light would be better) without a clear definition first.</p><p>Ln 239 I am not sure that these results add much, the comparison between structural and pigmentary colours is a bit redundant (mechanisms were largely identified due to properties of the reflectance spectrum). I think that including these results detracts from the main message, similarly, I am not sure about the relevance of sex differences. Differences in mean colour between island and mainland species -if included- should come earlier in the more descriptive part of the results. Why did you not use geomorph::procD.pgls for this analysis? As an aside, how did you deal with sex differences in the other analyses? I might have missed it but, do they represent both males and females or only one sex? Please clarify.</p><p>Ln 280 &quot;… competition between individuals of the same species is driving color diversity…&quot; this needs further explanation, what would the mechanism be?</p><p>Ln 307-310 Why is your node+tips approach inherently better than a tips-only approach, other than by being more conservative? It could also be that including nodes increases type II error rates simply due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the estimation of ancestral traits (which often end up being an average of the tips). I think that a bit more justification is needed here.</p><p>Ln 312 nor achromatic variation.</p><p>Ln 332 you averaged three spectra per patch per specimen, right?</p><p>Ln 344-46 PCA using a covariance or correlation matrix? Covariance would be the appropriate choice here as all variables are measured in the same units. This is not clear from the R code provided (at least to me). For the non-phylogenetic PCA probably the covariance matrix was used as this seems the default option for function prcomp, but I am not sure what the case is for the phylogenetic PCA function used. Nevertheless, this should be clear in the text.</p><p>Ln 346 pPCA has been criticised before see (Uyeda et al., 2015; Adams and Collyer, 2018), and this is particularly relevant when choosing to discard some PCs from subsequent analyses.</p><p>More information on the MCMCglmm priors is needed, from the code I get the impression that default priors were used (i.e. I see no prior argument specified in the code, or am I misunderstanding something)? Such default priors are usually not good for random effects. Also, it would be good to state that models converged and how this was assessed. Also, the multivariate Wald tests used in these MCMCglmm models should be better explained in the text.</p><p>The function geomorph::compare.evol.rates has two methods to establish whether evolutionary rate ratios between two regimes differ significantly from 1, the default (&quot;simulation&quot;) and an alternative (&quot;permutation&quot;). In my experience using this function to analyse evolutionary rates of colour, &quot;simulation&quot; yields much lower p-values than &quot;permutation&quot; (unpubl. data). Based on reading (Adams and Collyer, 2018) and on direct communication with the main author of the geomorph package (Dean Adams) it seems that &quot;permutation&quot; is a better alternative to achieve an appropriate level of type I errors. Based on the R code provided it seems that the authors have used the default option &quot;simulation&quot;. I think that the analyses using this function should be re-run with the alternative &quot;permutation&quot;. I suspect that the evolutionary rate ratio will not differ significantly from 1 in that case. This should not matter, the result in itself is interesting regardless of the outcome, although it could mean that some key conclusions of the paper will have to be changed.</p><p>Figure 1. This figure could be deleted or moved to the suppl material, it does not add much to the general story.</p><p>Figure 3C It would be good to label data points that correspond to nodes vs tips in the figure to illustrate differences in results. Would it be possible to also include island/mainland dwellings in this analysis? It should be doable to reconstruct ancestral states for this trait as well right?</p><p>Figure 7 I am not sure this figure should be included in the main text, it is hard to visualize the patterns.</p><p>References</p><p>Adams, D.C. and Collyer, M.L. 2018.

By phenotypic, you mean increased rates of change per speciation event, correct? Whereas by species diversification you just mean increased speciation rates, correct? Make this clearer.</p><p>Line 25: I'm immediately wondering how plumage complexity is calculated and whether it de facto will tend to correlate with color diversity.</p><p>Lines 38-40: I'm not sure this is how the island rule is phrased. Isn't it more that organisms tend to shift notably in body size? Otherwise, how do we define a large-bodied colonist vs. a small-bodied colonist? Suggest making this sentence more general.</p><p>Line 58-59: I'm not sure what you mean here. If a color variant for a species with uniform coloration had higher fitness then yes, the whole plumage would change in tandem, but if the mutation involved a patch changing color, then the whole plumage wouldn't change in tandem. The way this is worded makes it sound like a uniformly colored species will be unable to evolve plumage complexity.</p><p>Line 63: are the authors going to define plumage complexity as the number of plumage patches that are different from one another? Because, if so, this will QED correlate with color variation. Revisiting this point after a few reads of the manuscript, I realize the authors are working across intraspecific and interspecific scales in this sentence. This needs revision here.</p><p>Lines 96-98: a lot of this feels really circular. Some attention is needed here. Cutting some words, this sentence says, &quot;promote color divergence…contributing to high rates of color evolution and disparity&quot;. How color divergence differs from rates of color evolution differs from color disparity is not clear.</p><p>Line 122: change to &quot;sex&quot; in Figure 2, not &quot;individual&quot;.</p><p>Line 127: I'm confused. Isn't Tanysiptera monomorphic?</p><p>Lines 124-128: this immediately makes me wonder whether type (i) tends to be allopatric more often than does type (iii). I think the answer is yes.</p><p>Line 137: This is in line with a recent Merwin et al. study on parrots (https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-020-1577-y).</p><p>Lines 138-139: High phylogenetic signal in X vs Y does not mean that X is &quot;more diagnostic of species&quot; than Y. Re-word to clarify.</p><p>Lines 152-157: Ok, it does seem like the authors define plumage complexity as the number of uniquely colored patches.</p><p>Lines 180-187: I think there are a few key results here that deserve more space.</p><p>Line 206: the result is not that they are de novo evolving new colors, correct? Rather, they are shifting around in color space more quickly. Clarify.</p><p>Lines 209-225: There are four substantial issues in this paragraph. First, anytime I hear about creating two separate trees from one to run a test I get leery. I'm not sure what the justification is here. Second, how many island species occur with a sympatric relative? I believe that the answer is not many, so we wouldn't expect interspecific competition to be relevant, correct? Third, I'm fairly sure these RPANDA functions can take a geography object to account for this varying sympatry/allopatry. No mention is made of whether this was done or, if so, how. Fourth, RPANDA isn't cited. I may be missing something, but I also believe the last sentence here is not warranted. It could also mean that drift on islands best explains the observed pattern.</p><p>Line 237: in what taxon?</p><p>Line 247: I'm confused. Earlier you said this author DID find predictable patterns towards duller plumage. You also say it again in the discussion below.</p><p>Line 289: What island is this? Does New Guinea count as an island?</p><p>Lines 273-293: I am not following the logic in this paragraph. I see no reason why not finding evidence for interspecific competition influencing plumage patterns makes any statement about the relevance of intraspecific competition. This is further confused by the first discussion in the manuscript of sympatry and allopatry, which is then not actually tied into the mechanisms of interest (competition and character displacement). This is a weak point of the paper as it stands.</p><p>Lines 300-309: I'm still a little confused about the differences between plumage complexity and evolutionary rates (it would be helpful to keep reminding the reader that one is within a species, and one is between species), but I think some of what the authors are saying here can be attributed to differences between a phylogenetic independent contrasts-esque approach (what the authors use), and a phylogenetic generalized least squares approach (what others tend to have used). The former tends to be more conservative in my experience. Per a comment above, I'm withholding too many thoughts about alternative tests until I get a clearer picture of what the authors want to test, but I suspect this could be done as a phylogenetic t-test, where the test is whether plumage complexity differs between island taxa or not.</p><p>Figure 7: very challenging to see. It might be clearer with a white background.</p><p>Figure S6: &quot;Effect of data analysis on rate-complexity correlations&quot;. Data analysis is too vague. Can you come up with a more specific figure legend?</p><p>Line 43: errant parentheses.</p><p>Lines 92-94: run-on sentence, passive voice. Revise.</p><p>Line 103: missing a word after color.</p><p>Line 291: are-&gt;is</p><p>Line 411: the website for this paper incorrectly lists Ian PF Owens as just PF Owens. If you check the original manuscript, it correctly lists it as IPF Owens.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My line-by-line suggestions follow, I hope are helpful:</p><p>Line 15: This is entirely pedantic, but children typically leave the cradle, whereas oceanic island lineages often remain confined there until extinction or replacement (as in Wilson's taxon cycle). Maybe there's a better analogy out there.</p><p>Lines 57-58: Constraints on morphospace need not constrain evolutionary rates, see Goswami et al. 2014.</p><p>Line 60: Defining complexity can be a difficult topic to agree on in evolutionary biology and I think that considering the centrality of pattern complexity to the study, this would benefit from being discussed in more detail. Complexity at one level (phenotype) may not match with complexity at others (biochemistry, development, genome). I could see a working definition in the methods, as well as a supporting citation or two as a way to resolve this issue.</p><p>Lines 66-84: Can this paragraph be condensed and combined with the one below? I'm not seeing how it's relevant enough to the paper's key ideas to merit this much-lit review text. I don't want to hold this against the authors though, because I'm getting a subtle impression that a previous reviewer might have requested it, and nothing is more infuriating than having reviewers from different journals disagree with each other.</p><p>Line 82-84: I don't disagree with this outright – it does seem to be the case in starlings – but I would consider this to be a hypothesis that is actively being researched rather than something that can be asserted. In many avian taxa, structural color seems to be static as white, but maybe that's also pedantic.</p><p>Color Ordination and Comparison: I'm fond of the authors' approach of summarizing color as a multivariate trait. However, I'm not altogether certain I understand it precisely because different parts of it are described in different places throughout the manuscript. Perhaps a figure panel with a simple flow chart connecting the color and comparative analyses performed would be helpful to readers.</p><p>Lines 125-128, Figure 2B: I had some difficulty placing this analysis in the context of the study's design or tying it to any of the main hypotheses or questions. If the interpretation is that this highlights which clades tend to be the most complex, maybe a sentence about that could go in the figure legend?</p><p>Lines 213-222: I found this part of the paperless more convincing than the rest due to issues described in Uyeda et al. (2016, Syst Biol). Even with a phylogenetic PCA, we should expect biases in model fit when individual principal components are used, particularly around OU models (also see Adams and Collyer 2018, Syst Biol). So while I would interpret Figure 5B in the same way as the authors and have no reason to disagree with them, I am skeptical it allows us to really reject competition as an explanatory mechanism here.</p><p>Lines 253-254: This is really interesting and I'd love to see more written about this idea!</p><p>Lines 273-293: This is tangentially related to the previous comment, reading the discussion it felt like we dive into adaptive explanations of color without much space to discuss drift or liability/availability of different color mechanisms (these are however discussed in great detail in the introduction).</p><p>Figure 1: This is a great figure, I really enjoyed it.</p><p>Figure 3: When I see an ancestral state reconstruction like this where nearly all change is independently derived, it makes me skeptical of the model. Highly complex patterns seem to be prevalent in the Alcedininae, but I couldn't find any ancestral nodes with complexity scores half as high as extant species. Since these ancestral states are used as data in downstream analyses, it might be worth testing the robustness of those analyses to uncertainty in those states, or at least describing that uncertainty.</p><p>Figure 4: The tip colors seem to refer to a legend that is no longer in Figure 3, but in Figure 6.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article entitled &quot;Complex plumages spur rapid color diversification in kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae)&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your revised article has been evaluated by Christian Rutz (Senior Editor) and Kaspar Delhey (Guest Reviewing Editor). The article has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Ln 23 &quot;island insularity&quot; revise.</p><p>Ln 29-31 &quot;Importantly, we found that island species did not have more complex plumages than their continental relatives. Thus, complexity may be a key innovation that facilitates response to relaxed (or divergent) selection pressures on islands.&quot; We cannot see how the second sentence follows the first, if island bids do not have higher plumage complexity, how can complexity be a key innovation that facilitates island living?</p><p>Ln 145 chromatic variation includes hue and saturation.</p><p>Ln 145 &quot;achromatic color&quot; does not make much sense; suggest referring to chromatic and achromatic variation throughout the paper rather than chromatic and achromatic color.</p><p>Ln 146 similarly &quot;brightness&quot; tends to be used in a multitude of ways, maybe replace with lightness or light-to-dark variation.</p><p>Ln 166-169 &quot;To determine rates of overall plumage evolution, we used a phylogeny by McCullough et al. (2019), which incorporated thousands of ultraconserved elements (Faircloth et al., 2012) for a fully sampled, time-calibrated phylogeny of the avian order Coraciiformes (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, and allies).&quot; Revise sentence, &quot;…we used a phylogeny…for a phylogeny…&quot; something is off here, verb lacking.</p><p>Ln 230 maybe &quot;theory&quot; is too strong here, replace it with &quot;idea&quot;?</p><p>Ln 253 Is this the case? You mention Table 3 which refers to rates of colour evolution, not plumage complexity. This needs some clarification, as in Table 2 you do show that island species do not have more complex plumages. As a matter of fact, some sentences in this paragraph contradict the previous one.</p><p>Ln 390 some justification for the inclusion of body mass here may be good.</p><p>Ln 400 typo &quot;drivers&quot;.</p><p>Table 3 We do have some concerns with multicollinearity here. As shown in Figure S1, different estimates of plumage complexity seem strongly intercorrelated. Thus, when your best model for chromatic variation identifies c1 and c3 as important predictors, the effects that your model quantifies constitute the effects of one predictor controlling for variation in the other. Now, if both are strongly correlated there is not that much independent variation that is relevant to explain. We think that it would be important to fit models with each predictor separately in order to check that results follow the same pattern. Moreover, this would mean reporting more complete results independent of whether the model is the &quot;best&quot; model identified by AIC. Potential future meta-analysts will need this information regardless of statistical significance or AIC. Please present the results from all models tested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83426.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The two main topics linked to evolutionary rates of plumage colour, island-dwelling, and plumage complexity need to be better introduced and linked in the introduction.

The authors need to cater for two different types of readers here: (a) Those that only want to broadly understand the methods used and (b) those that will want to adapt the methods to their own study system. To deal with (a) Rev 4 suggestion of a flowchart figure illustrating the methods provides an elegant way to summarise the approach used. For (b) much more detail is needed regarding the multiple ways in which analyses can vary, this ranges from information regarding arguments used within specific functions to better explanations as to why certain methodological decisions were taken.</p></disp-quote><p>Following these suggests, we have now added a new workflow figure (Figure 1) that we hope will clarify any questions the reader may have of our approach.

Based on the R code provided it seems that the authors have used the default option &quot;simulation&quot;. I think that the analyses using this function should be re-run with the alternative &quot;permutation&quot;.

As shown in Figure S1, different estimates of plumage complexity seem strongly intercorrelated. Thus, when your best model for chromatic variation identifies c1 and c3 as important predictors, the effects that your model quantifies constitute the effects of one predictor controlling for variation in the other. Now, if both are strongly correlated there is not that much independent variation that is relevant to explain. We think that it would be important to fit models with each predictor separately in order to check that results follow the same pattern. Moreover, this would mean reporting more complete results independent of whether the model is the &quot;best&quot; model identified by AIC. Potential future meta-analysts will need this information regardless of statistical significance or AIC. Please present the results from all models tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. We now calculate variance inflation factors (which we not are mostly rather low, which a max of ~4) and present results after removing each complexity metric in turn. As suggested, we also include the full regression results. We describe our approach in Methods L409-415 and included new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (showing the &quot;full&quot; model results and sub-models with complexity metrics dropped in turn) and Supplementary files 1f and 1g (results for all models tested). Effect sizes were ~stable under these alternative model formulations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), suggesting our results are robust to the observed levels of multicollinearity.</p><p>We would like to point out that the new Supplementary files 1f and 1g are rather unwieldy (63 models tested in each table). As such, we would ask the editor(s) to consider whether the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 is sufficient for addressing this important point about potential multicollinearity influencing our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
