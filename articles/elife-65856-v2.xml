ranging from antitumor and antiviral immunity to host-microbe communication at mucosal surfaces. It remains difficult, however, to genetically manipulate human DCs, limiting our ability to probe how DCs elicit specific immune responses. Here, we develop a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method for human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that mediates knockouts with a median efficiency of &gt;94% across &gt;300 genes. Using this method, we perform genetic screens in moDCs, identifying mechanisms by which DCs tune responses to lipopolysaccharides from the human microbiome. In addition, we reveal donor-specific responses to lipopolysaccharides, underscoring the importance of assessing immune phenotypes in donor-derived cells, and identify candidate genes that control this specificity, highlighting the potential of our method to pinpoint determinants of inter-individual variation in immunity. Our work sets the stage for a systematic dissection of the immune signaling at the host-microbiome interface and for targeted engineering of DCs for neoantigen vaccination.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) play an outsized role in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity: they act as sentinels, detecting invaders and initiating innate immune responses to clear them, and as antigen-presenting cells, initiating adaptive immune responses that are antigen-specific and tailored to the context in which the antigen was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). In this fashion, DCs mediate pathogen clearance, tumor cell killing, and tolerance to microbiome bacteria or dietary antigens. DCs thus play fundamental roles in shaping host-pathogen and host-microbiome interactions and in the etiology of autoimmune disorders and are a major target for efforts to develop new generations of immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wculek et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Dissecting the pathways by which human DCs respond to innate immune stimuli and relay them into adaptive responses, however, has been challenging, due in large part to difficulties in genetically manipulating human DCs. Although approaches for gene repression in human DCs by RNAi have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song, 2014</xref>), RNAi suffers from limited efficacy and specificity, precluding broader implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaelin, 2012</xref>). As a consequence, DC biology is generally studied in mouse models, but mice and humans differ in many aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity, including innate immune receptor repertoires, responses to immune ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and developmental pathways of adaptive immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pulendran and Davis, 2020</xref>). One way to address this challenge is to knock out genes in DC precursor populations such as monocytes or stem cells, followed by differentiation into DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freund et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiatt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laustsen et al., 2018</xref>). These methods, however, require independent differentiation of each knockout population and as a result are susceptible to batch effects and poorly suited for genetic screens. Moreover, they do not permit probing the functions of genes required for DC differentiation and culture. More broadly, both animal and stem cell models fail to capture inter-individual variation in immune phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanz et al., 2018</xref>), which has been observed for example in innate immune responses, autoimmunity, and pathogen susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodin and Davis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ye et al., 2014</xref>) and has gained further salience during the Covid-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). Such variation results from a combination of genetic factors and lifelong environmental exposures (e.g., from the microbiome) but it remains challenging to define the causal determinants in the absence of genetic tools for patient-derived immune cells such as DCs.</p><p>To address these limitations, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9 strategy to construct targeted knockouts directly in human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which are readily derived from donor blood and are widely used for research and clinical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garg et al., 2017</xref>). Using this strategy, we conducted a genetic screen for factors that recognize an innate immune ligand from the human microbiome, LPS from the gut commensal <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> (<italic>B. theta</italic>), recapitulating known LPS signaling pathways and revealing candidate genes that mediate species-specific LPS recognition and give rise to inter-individual variation in the response to LPS. These results highlight the potential of our strategy for identifying receptors for innate immune ligands, such as those from the human microbiome, and for pinpointing the genetic bases of inter-individual variation in human immunity. More broadly, our work now provides a general blueprint for functional genomics in human DCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A CRISPR-Cas9 strategy for functional genomics in human moDCs</title><p>To enable introduction of specific knockouts in human moDCs, we developed a non-viral genome editing strategy based on electroporation of in vitro-assembled Cas9-sgRNA complexes (Cas9 ribonucleoprotein particles, RNPs), an approach that has been validated in other immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freund et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiatt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riggan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schumann et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, our strategy entails isolating monocytes from human donor blood, differentiating them into moDCs in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4, and electroporating these moDCs with Cas9 RNPs to induce double-strand breaks at the targeted locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Such double-strand breaks trigger error-prone DNA repair and subsequent formation of insertions or deletions (indels) that, with a certain frequency, cause frameshift mutations and thus knockout of the targeted gene. We monitor the efficiency of this process by genotyping using next-generation sequencing and by phenotyping using functional assays.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy for gene knockout in human moDCs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic outline of the strategy.

Because such large deletions generate smaller amplicons in our genotyping approach, which may be overrepresented in sequencing counts due to length biases in PCR amplification and the sequencing reaction itself, we devised a scheme to correct sequencing counts for length differences to the WT locus to accurately quantify editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, Materials and methods). Testing the multi-sgRNA approach across three loci revealed a shift in indel profiles toward large deletions and multiple indels with deletions of sequences between sgRNA cut sites as well as a modest increase in editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>). Cas9 RNPs assembled with sgRNAs rather than with crRNA:tracrRNA duplexes mediated higher editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Both knockout and unedited moDCs from 96-well plates had mildly elevated levels of HLA-DR and B2M compared to unedited moDCs that had been cultured in flasks, indicating that culture conditions can affect DC state independent of editing. Although our antibody panel was not designed for precise measurements of B2M levels, B2M staining was reduced 72% and 65% in <italic>B2M</italic> knockout moDCs for the two donors, consistent with protein depletion.

Second, some loci contain separate indels at each sgRNA cut site that together restore the reading frame, but the intervening, frameshifted regions may contain stop codons. We did not give special treatment to such cases.

Knockouts in the TLR4 signaling pathway strongly reduced TNF-α secretion, including <italic>TLR4</italic> and its co-receptor MD2 (<italic>LY96</italic>), <italic>CD14</italic> (which delivers LPS to TLR4 and initiates TLR4 endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zanoni et al., 2011</xref>]), as well as genes involved in MYD88 signaling, the branch of TRIF signaling involved in NF-κB activation, and the NF-κB factor <italic>RELA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Indeed, 6 and 7 of the 10 targeted genes in MYD88 signaling reduced TNF-α secretion in the two donors, with knockout of most of the remaining genes causing a less substantial reduction in TNF-α secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Other knockouts also caused expected phenotypes; for example, moDCs with knockout of A20 (<italic>TNFAIP3</italic>), which inhibits LPS- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling, secreted more TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5c</xref>). Thus, our genetic screen accurately captured the genetic requirements for the response to <italic>B. theta</italic> LPS.</p><p>Although the results for the two donors were similar overall, we noticed several key differences. Most prominently, knockouts of <italic>PTPN6</italic> (SHP-1) and to a lesser extent <italic>IL10</italic> increased TNF-α secretion in response to <italic>B. theta</italic> WT LPS in one donor (‘donor i’) but not the other (‘donor h’), suggesting that these factors can suppress TNF-α secretion in response to LPS stimulation in a manner that differs among individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Indeed, unedited moDCs from donor i secreted less TNF-α in response to both <italic>B. theta</italic> WT LPS and <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS than those from donor h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Second, MYD88 signaling contributed particularly strongly to the response to <italic>B. theta</italic> WT LPS for donor h: knockout of <italic>TIRAP</italic>, the TLR4-proximal adapter for MYD88 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzgerald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitzgerald and Kagan, 2020</xref>), induced the strongest decrease in TNF-α secretion other than <italic>TNF</italic> itself. For donor i, <italic>TLR4</italic> and the TRIF pathway contributed more strongly to the response, as evidenced by strong decreases in TNF-α secretion upon knockout of <italic>TLR4</italic> alone, TRAM (<italic>TICAM2</italic>), and TRIF (<italic>TICAM1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). These differences account for many of the donor-specific hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5c</xref>). A separate 40-gene validation experiment with cells from two additional, independent donors recapitulated these results, with results from each of the two validation donors aligning more closely with those from one of the initial donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>We further investigated two specific observations. First, because <italic>TIRAP</italic> knockout caused a larger decrease in TNF-α secretion than <italic>TLR4</italic> knockout in donor h, we wondered if other TLRs contributed to the response to <italic>B. theta</italic> WT LPS. We focused on TLR2, canonically known as a receptor for lipopeptides and teichoic acids, because <italic>TLR2</italic> knockout caused the next-strongest decrease in TNF-α secretion among TLRs and because TLR2 has been implicated in the response to non-proteobacterial LPSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Lorenzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Werts et al., 2001</xref>), although these claims remain controversial. Indeed, moDCs with simultaneous knockout of <italic>TLR4</italic> and <italic>TLR2</italic> exhibited the strongest decreases in TNF-α secretion among all samples for both donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4d</xref>). In addition, knockout of <italic>TLR2</italic> alone reduced the response to <italic>B. theta</italic> WT LPS but not to <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS in a donor in our validation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6b</xref>). These results are consistent with the possibility that TLR2 contributes to the response to <italic>B. theta</italic> LPS, although we cannot rule out the presence of contaminating lipopeptides in our LPS preparation.</p><p>Second, to analyze the interplay between PTPN6 and IL-10 in suppressing TNF-α secretion in moDCs from donor i, we measured IL-10 levels in the same samples. The effects of knockouts on TNF-α and IL-10 secretion were well correlated, suggesting that TLR4 signaling via the TRIF and MYD88 branches accounts for secretion of both TNF-α and IL-10. PTPN6 stood out as an exception: whereas <italic>PTPN6</italic> knockout strongly increased TNF-α secretion, it moderately decreased IL-10 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>), suggesting either that IL-10 acts upstream of PTPN6 in suppressing TNF-α secretion or that PTPN6 specifically inhibits production of TNF-α and not IL-10. More broadly, these results demonstrate how combining our moDC editing strategy with multiple readouts can increase the resolution in evaluating immune response pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we describe a CRISPR strategy to introduce knockouts and conduct genetic screens in DCs derived from human donors. Our strategy has four main strengths. First, our strategy is efficient and consistent, with median knockout efficiencies of &gt;94% across &gt;300 genes in two independent donors and comparable efficiencies at smaller scales across &gt;10 further donors. Second, the knockouts are introduced directly in differentiated DCs, reducing the potential for batch effects that may occur when introducing knockouts in precursor populations prior to differentiation. As a corollary, any gene is in principle targetable in our strategy, including for example genes required for DC differentiation. Third, our strategy is compatible with a variety of readouts to interrogate the phenotypes of knockout moDCs, including cytokine profiling, RNA-seq, flow cytometry, microscopy, and co-culture assays, enabling dissection of DC biology at high resolution. Fourth, as a result of the high efficiency and elimination of batch effects, our strategy enables genetic screens at previously intractable scales of hundreds of genes and would readily scale further with access to automation.</p><p>Like any method, our strategy also bears limitations. First, because human DCs do not divide in culture, our strategy relies on degradation to deplete protein molecules produced before genome editing. We observe strong phenotypes after targeting immune receptors and few false negatives in the MYD88 pathway in our screen, suggesting that most proteins are depleted during the 5-day period after electroporation. Nonetheless, depleting exceptionally long-lived proteins would require prolonged culture, which may not be experimentally feasible. Second, as an RNP-based strategy, our strategy is not readily compatible with pooled screening because no sgRNA barcodes are inserted into the genome. This limitation has been circumvented in T-cells by combining lentiviral sgRNA delivery and Cas9 electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shifrut et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ting et al., 2018</xref>). Implementation of such a strategy in DCs is hampered by the recalcitrance of DCs to lentivirus infection and the tendency of DCs to undergo maturation when infection is forced, such as by co-transduction of Vpx, but may become feasible with the development of transduction strategies for DCs. Third, as for any CRISPR method, it is difficult to knock out highly homologous genes, such as some C-type lectin receptors, because of challenges in designing sgRNAs that are both active and specific. These limitations are important to consider in experimental design, and we demonstrate that in doing so the impacts of these limitations can be minimized.</p><p>Indeed, our genetic screen broadly recapitulates known LPS signaling pathways and further reveals two specific hypotheses regarding the recognition of <italic>B. theta</italic> LPS. First, we observe a potential contribution of TLR2 to signaling by <italic>B. theta</italic> LPS, as has also been proposed for <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Lorenzo et al., 2020</xref>). This observation could result from either an intrinsic ability of <italic>B. theta</italic> LPS to bind both TLR4 and TLR2 or the presence of contaminating TLR2 ligands in our <italic>B. theta</italic> LPS preparation, which we have not ruled out. Second, we identify <italic>PTPN6</italic>/SHP-1 as a potential contributor to inter-individual variation in the response to LPS. Activation of <italic>PTPN6</italic>/SHP-1, in addition to regulating innate immunity, suppresses antigen cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), which some pathogens exploit to subvert adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khouili et al., 2020</xref>). Further support for our finding of inter-individual variation in <italic>PTPN6</italic>/SHP-1 activity thus would have immediate implications both for understanding variations in pathogen susceptibility and for personalizing DC vaccines aimed at initiating CD8 T-cell responses.</p><p>Our observations of inter-individual variation in immune responses, alongside many previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodin and Davis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ye et al., 2014</xref>), further underscore the importance of probing immune responses directly in donor-derived cells. For example, moDCs from different donors have distinct responses – both in magnitude and apparent affinity – to identical preparations of LPS. Such variation likely results from a combination of genetic factors and environmental exposures that together determine immune cell state, with contributions from <italic>PTPN6</italic>/SHP-1 activity emerging as a hypothesis from our data. Longitudinal studies with larger cohorts of donors will be required to dissect the relative contributions of these factors and to more clearly define genetic drivers of inter-individual variation, and our work now provides enabling tools for such studies.</p><p>Finally, we find that human DCs initiate specific responses to LPS from commensal Bacteroidetes: <italic>B. theta</italic> LPS induces an inflammatory response that is weaker in both magnitude and apparent EC<sub>50</sub> than the response induced by <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS and can be further dampened by rational modifications to the LPS lipid A portion. Despite donor-to-donor variation in the LPS response, these trends hold across all donors we examined. Our findings challenge the notion that <italic>Bacteroides</italic> LPSs are innocuous components of the human gut microbiota, as further evidenced by a recent report that homeostatic, TLR4-dependent induction of IFN-β by <italic>B. fragilis</italic> LPS contributes to antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>). Variations in LPS structure across gut commensals instead alter capacity to activate TLR4 and may allow for engagement of new receptors altogether, with the potential for neomorphic activities as well as further complexity arising from combinatorial perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antebi et al., 2017</xref>). In this fashion, commensal LPSs likely contribute to shaping immune responses at the host-microbiome interface. Indeed, activation of TLRs by commensal immune ligands including LPS contributes to intestinal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004</xref>). Understanding the underlying mechanisms, using for example the genetic approaches we describe, may in turn enable efforts to engineer LPSs with defined immunomodulatory capacities, akin to our <italic>B. theta</italic> 4PP LPS mutant.</p><p>Beyond LPS recognition, the availability of functional genomics tools for human DCs now opens the door to a range of applications including systematic functional genomics studies to dissect the roles of DC receptors and signaling pathways in mounting immune responses to commensals, pathogens, or tumor cells and targeted engineering of moDCs for therapeutic interventions such as neoantigen vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic>)</td><td valign="top">VPI-5482 Δtdk ΔCPS</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogers et al., 2013</xref></td><td valign="top">Referred to as ‘<italic>B. theta</italic>’ in the text</td><td valign="top">Acapsular mutant provided by Eric Martens’s lab</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic>)</td><td valign="top">VPI-5482 Δtdk ΔBT1854 ΔBT2152</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top">Referred to as ‘<italic>B. theta</italic> 4PP’ in the text</td><td valign="top">Mutant producing tetra-acylated, di-phosphorylated lipid A in a capsule-producing background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (human)</td><td valign="top">PBMCs</td><td valign="top">AllCells</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated from de-identified healthy individuals and shipped overnight</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-human CD14 (clone HCD14, mouse monoclonal), PE, PerCP-Cy5.5, or BV421</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">PE: Cat#: 325605;

The authors did not obtain identifiable private information on donors. The commercial vendor obtained informed consent from all donors covering all experiments and data reported in this manuscript. Monocytes were isolated from PBMCs by negative magnetic selection using the EasySep human monocyte enrichment kit without CD16 depletion (StemCell) following the manufacturer’s instructions and using a Big Easy magnet or Easy 50 magnet (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Enriched monocytes were generally &gt;80% CD14-positive, as assessed by flow cytometry on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD BioSciences) or an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

For each experiment, absorbance measurements from wells containing a twofold dilution series of purified TNF-α (31.25 pg/mL to 2000 pg/mL, in duplicate) were used to calculate a calibration curve using a four-parameter logistic fit, which in turn was used to calculate TNF-α concentrations in all sample wells. Concentrations of CXCL10 and IL-10 were determined equivalently using SimpleStep human IP-10 ELISA kit (Abcam) and the SimpleStep human IL-10 ELISA kit (Abcam), respectively, following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Briefly, replicate aliquots of cells were transferred into an opaque flat-bottom 96-well plate, diluted to 100 µL, and incubated at 25°C for 15–30 min. After addition of an equal volume of CellTiterGlo solution to each well, the plates were placed on an orbital shaker for 2 min and then incubated at 25°C for 10 min. Finally, luminescence in each well was recorded using a GloMax Multi + luminescence plate reader (Promega). For some experiments, luminescence measurements from wells containing known numbers of unedited moDCs, as determined using a Countess II automated hemocytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), were used to calculate cell numbers for each sample. TNF-α secretion for each sample was then normalized to cell numbers. For other experiments, TNF-α secretion was simply normalized to background-subtracted luminescence readings. In benchmark experiments, cell counts were also determined by flow cytometry on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 96-well autosampler. Cell counts determined by flow cytometry and luminescence were well correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) and all further cell counts were determined by luminescence.</p><p>To isolate genomic DNA from each sample for genotyping, aliquots of harvested moDCs were transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate, centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in 50 µL QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (LuciGen, Middleton, WI). The suspensions were transferred to 96-well PCR plates and incubated at 65°C for 20 min and then at 98°C for 5 min using a thermocycler. The extracted genomic DNA was stored at –30°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Flow cytometry of edited moDCs</title><p>DCs were differentiated and edited as described above. For each condition, moDCs electroporated in 3 wells of a 16-well cuvette (each well containing 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells at the time of electroporation) were harvested as described above and combined. After setting aside cells for genomic DNA extraction, the remaining cells were used for antibody staining. In parallel, moDCs from the same donors that had not been subjected to the electroporation procedure and had instead been cultured in T-25 flasks were also harvested and stained. Stains were performed in 96-well V-bottom plates. Aliquots of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well were first stained with the amine-reactive viability dye Ghost Dye Violet 510 (Tonbo) by washing the cells twice in PBS (without protein additives) followed by incubation with 0.1 µL dye in 100 µL PBS on ice for 30 min in the dark. The cells were then washed twice in PBS containing 10% FBS, resuspended in PBS containing 10% FBS, and stained in a total volume of 100 µL with an antibody mix containing the following antibodies at the indicated final concentrations: anti-CD11c (Pacific Blue-labeled, clone Bu15, 20 µg/mL), anti-HLA-DR (FITC-labeled, clone L243, 6 µg/mL), anti-CD83 (APC-Cy7-labeled, clone HB15e, 8 µg/mL), anti-B2M (PE-labeled, clone 2M2, 1 µg/mL), anti-TLR4 (APC-labeled, clone HTA125, 8 µg/mL). Fluorescence-minus-one controls for each of the five antibodies were included for unedited cells from each donor. Cells were incubated with the antibody mixes on ice for 30 min in the dark, washed three times in PBS containing 10% FBS, and finally resuspended in 200 µL PBS containing 10% FBS. To set compensation, an aliquot of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> heat-killed moDCs (incubated at 65°C for 15 min) was stained with Ghost Dye Violet 510 in the same fashion and then mixed with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> live moDCs and washed as described above, and 1:1 mixtures of CompBead anti-mouse Ig, κ beads (BD Biosciences) and CompBead negative control beads (BD Biosciences) were stained with each individual antibody at the same concentrations and washed as described above.

Briefly, primer pairs were designed for each cut site using Primer-BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ye et al., 2012</xref>) to amplify a 200- to 450-base pair region, ensuring that all cut sites targeted by the pooled sgRNAs as well as a 50-base pair flanking region on each side of the cut sites were included, with a targeted T<sub>m</sub> of 60°C.

First-round PCRs of targeted sites were performed in 96-well format using at least 4000 genomic copies for each sample, 0.5 µM of each primer, and Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X master mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and the following protocol: 98°C for 30 s; 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and a final extension at 72°C for 2 min. Products from the first PCR were diluted 1:100 in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and subjected to a second round of PCR using the constant adapters as annealing sites, appending Illumina P5 and P7 adapters and two eight-base barcodes on both ends that together uniquely identified each sample. Twelve cycles of PCR were performed using the same conditions described above. After the second PCR, all samples were pooled and the combined samples were purified using a 0.8× AMPure XP purification (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Final libraries were validated and quantified using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent) and sequenced in a 600-cycle paired-end run on a MiSeq Instrument (Illumina) using MiSeq v3 Reagent kits.</p><p>Sequencing data of editing outcomes were analyzed and quantified using knock-knock v0.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jeffhussmann/knock-knock">https://github.com/jeffhussmann/knock-knock</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canaj et al., 2019</xref>).

Forward and reverse primers contained overhangs (identical for all reverse primers) to create annealing sites for sequencing library preparation. Following the PCR, each individual amplicon was gel-purified and quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The five amplicons were then mixed into pools at 11 different molar ratios. For increased accuracy, the abundance of each fragment in these pools was measured using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent). Each pool was then diluted to 33 fM (about 20,000 template molecules per µL, equivalent to genomic DNA isolated from 10,000 cells) and 1 µL of diluted pool was used as template for the first-round PCR as described above, using a primer pair complementary to the constant overhangs on each fragment, designed with the same criteria as our other amplicon primers. The PCRs additionally contained 4 µL of genomic DNA from unedited DCs as excess non-productive template. The remainder of the sequencing library preparation was carried out as described above, with unique sequencing indices appended to each pool in the second-round PCR. The final libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina) and counts for each fragment were determined by aligning reads to the expected amplicons.</p><p>To infer observation efficiency (amplification + sequencing) for each fragment, we reasoned that the starting and the final composition of the pool should be related by the specific observation efficiency of each amplicon, which should shift the abundance of each fragment based on its specific observation efficiency:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic> is the measured fractional abundance, <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic> the starting abundance, and <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic> the fragment-specific observation efficiency.

We then assembled a list of all genes encoding relevant signaling proteins downstream of these PRRs, including immediate adaptor proteins, kinases and ubiquitin ligases, the downstream transcription factors, as well as a limited subset of effector cytokines and cytokine receptors. Finally, we completed the gene list with additional genes of interest by surveying our RNA-seq data from human moDCs for expressed potential pattern recognition receptors such as predicted surface/membrane proteins, carbohydrate-binding proteins, and proteins containing a V-set domain using searches for Pfam domains, and by browsing the list of genes with the GO term ‘innate immune response’ that we had not yet included. This process ultimately resulted in a list of &gt;400 genes. To narrow the list down to ~300 genes to enable screening in four 96-well plates, we first eliminated pseudogenes and a few PRR-like genes with well-established functions. We then eliminated many genes involved in linear signaling pathways while ensuring that each pathway was targeted at multiple nodes in the final library.

A first round of amplification primers was designed using PrimerServer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), which uses a combination of primer3 and BLAST to predict amplification primers. Design criteria were: (1) amplification of a 200- to 450-base pair region, (2) inclusion of all cut sites targeted by the sgRNAs as well as a 35-base pair flanking region on each side of the cut sites was included, and (3) ideal T<sub>m</sub> of 60°C. Design criteria were successively relaxed if no primers matching these criteria were found, up to a maximum amplicon size of 500 base pairs and a minimum flanking distance of 25 base pairs. Primers containing overhangs as described above were ordered in 96-well format matching the sgRNA layout and tested for efficient amplification of the targeted locus by amplifying genomic DNA from unedited moDCs and sequencing the resulting amplicons on a MiSeq (Illumina), as described above. For loci with inefficient amplification or a high fraction of off-target amplicons, as assessed using knock-knock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canaj et al., 2019</xref>), primers were designed using PrimerBLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ye et al., 2012</xref>) as described above, and efficient amplification confirmed by sequencing. For some highly homologous locus pairs, such as <italic>SFTPA1</italic>/<italic>SFTPA2</italic> and <italic>LGALS7</italic>/<italic>LGALS7B</italic>, no primers could be designed that ensured completely unique amplification of each individual locus; the primers with the best discriminating power that fit all other design criteria (amplicon size, T<sub>m</sub>, distance from cut site) were chosen. All primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Amplicon PCRs and sequencing sequencing library preparation were performed largely as described above, with the following modifications: (1) PCRs were performed in 384-well format; (2) first-round PCRs were set up using a Biomek FX liquid handling system with a 96-well head (Beckman Coulter); (3) first-round PCR products were diluted into Echo Qualified 384-Well Polypropylene Microplates using the Biomek FX; (4) PCR mastermix for the second-round PCR was dispensed into 384-well PCR plates using the Biomek FX; and (5) diluted first-round PCR products and indexing PCR primers were dispensed into the 384-well PCR plate using an Echo 525 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte, San Jose, CA). Purification and validation of sequencing libraries, sequencing, classification of sequencing outcomes, and correction for amplicon size were performed as described above. For donor h, a small set of samples did not produce aligning sequencing reads in a first PCR attempt. These samples were repeated manually as described above, after which all but one sample produced aligning sequencing reads. Only successfully prepared samples were included for analysis. For donor i, the sequencing library preparation was repeated independently for &gt;200 loci, which produced near-identical results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4c</xref>), validating that the sequencing library preparation strategy is robust and reproducible and that size-dependent amplification efficiency is consistent across PCRs. Samples with &gt;100 size-corrected on-target reads (generally corresponding to &gt;500 raw on-target reads) were included to estimate editing efficiencies. For some pairs of highly homologous loci (e.g. <italic>SFTPA1</italic> and <italic>SFTPA2</italic>), amplicons for both loci were detected with primer pairs designed to amplify each individual locus because it was impossible to design completely specific primer pairs with the criteria used.

colleagues have developed a robust non-viral CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing methodology that enables to directly edit differentiated moDCs. This will open the possibility for functional genomics screening with DCs as well as targeted mechanistic studies that will enhance our biological understanding on the role of DCs for innate and adaptive immunity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CRISPR-based functional genomics in human dendritic cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Klio Maratou (Reviewer #1); Carla V Rothlin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As this manuscript comes under the category of &quot;tools and resources article&quot;, it is important that the authors demonstrate that the editing is not changing the function of dendritic cells for the readers to have more confidence that the methodology is sound and will enable future studies on dendritic cells biology. Since the authors have already collected RNAseq data, they should capitalised on this dataset and conduct a more thorough analysis of this data. They need to compare the neutral control RPE65 KO vs. PBS samples to show that the editing does not significantly alter the transcriptomic profile of the dendritic cells. Can they see statistically significant differential expression changes between the two samples. Do these changes relate to pathways that are important for dendritic cell function? If so, what are these? Are any of the dendritic cell maturation or cell signalling pathways affected? Finally, it could be possible to perform immunophenotyping of the cells using fluorescent‐based flow cytometry with a panel of DC markers and other myeloid cell lineage markers to show that the process of editing does not de-differentiate/activate the cells or change their morphology.</p><p>2. To validate and apply this strategy, the authors conducted a genetic screen for factors relevant to the response to LPS from different species as well as drivers of interindividual variation. The study is by and large is carefully designed and includes appropriate controls such as for example editing of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 which is not involved in the response to LPS and therefore serves as a negative control. However, weaknesses are noted in the application of the strategy to identify receptors for LPS or drivers of interindividual variability. The authors claim that their genetic screen allows them to identify receptors for LPS derived from B. theta as well as drivers of interindividual variation. Unfortunately, at this stage, the data does not fully support the authors conclusions. The authors should validate the potential role of TLR2 in an independent setting, for example making use of a TLR2 reporter assay. This is of particular importance for concluding that TLR2 is a receptor for LPS derived from B. theta.</p><p>3. The response to B. theta varies in magnitude between donors even in non-edited cells. Is donor to donor variability too high to enable us to draw any biological conclusions when moDCs are used in screening? How many donors should be tested for biological phenotypic data to be meaningful?</p><p>As noted by the authors the maximal response to LPS in terms of TNF production is different between the donors. Also, it appears that EC50s are different. In order to establish drivers of interindividual variation, the authors should compare the effect of knocking out gene X in cells from individual A and B when stimulated with EC50 concentrations of LPS.</p><p>The authors emphasize differences in the effect of knocking out PTPN6 or IL-10 in the TNF secretion induced by LPS from B. theta. The authors go on to say (line 230) &quot;Most prominently, knockouts of PTPN6 (SHP-1) and to a lesser extent IL10 increased TNF-α secretion in response to B. theta LPS in one donor (&quot;donor i&quot;) but not the other (&quot;donor h&quot;), suggesting that these factors can constitutively suppress TNF-α secretion in a manner that differs among individuals (Figure 3d). Indeed, unedited moDCs from donor i secreted less TNF-α in response to both B. theta LPS and <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS than those from donor h (Figure 3e).&quot; The fact that unedited moDCs from donor i secrete less TNF-α in response to LPS is not sufficient support that PTPN6 and IL-10 constitutively suppress TNF-α secretion. The authors should test if moDCs spontaneously secrete TNF if knocked out for PTPN6 or IL-10?</p><p>In various instances, the authors should consider discussing the limitations of the approach and temper their conclusions: In this regard, the authors should revise their biological conclusions and stress that this only a proof-of-concept study as the screen was conducted with limited number of donors. The authors should be very careful with the interpretation on whether the genes that are hits from the screen are true drivers of interindividual variability. The authors clearly demonstrate that moDC responses to LPSs vary across individuals. This point highlights the importance of assessing immune phenotypes in donor-derived cells, but also raises the necessity to use multiple donors for meaningful and reliable conclusions to be drawn from the data. The number of biological donor replicates (2-3) used in this study is sufficient to show proof of concept, but subsequent studies using moDCs will require much larger number of donors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65856.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We now include additional data to support this point.</p><p>First, we characterized edited and unedited DCs from two independent donors by flow cytometry, measuring levels of CD11c (a DC marker), HLA-DR and CD83 (two markers whose expression increases during DC maturation), TLR4 (expression of which decreases during DC maturation), and B2M (which we targeted for knockout, see below). We did not include additional markers because we already occupied 6 colors (including a viability stain) and we wanted to balance the ability to quantify marker levels against the breadth of the panel. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 5A, the staining patterns are qualitatively indistinguishable in knockout DCs and in unedited DCs (no electroporation control DCs or DCs electroporated with a non-targeting control sgRNA). We observed small differences between expression profiles of edited DCs and unedited DCs that were grown in flasks, pointing to changes in DC state as a consequence of culture conditions; such changes can be controlled by comparing knockout DCs to identically cultured unedited DCs or to DCs with knockout of a neutral gene, as we did throughout the manuscript. Overall, these results suggest that moDCs do not undergo de-differentiation or maturation as a consequence of the editing procedure.</p><p>We also stained for B2M, but we designed the panel for maximal resolution in the other channels, precluding accurate quantification of reductions in B2M levels upon knockout. We can place a conservative lower bound of &gt;70% depletion for B2M. More broadly, our functional assays clearly demonstrate a reduction in protein levels in knockout cells.</p><p>The flow cytometry data are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 in the revised manuscript and described in a new paragraph in the Results section. We also included details of the experimental strategy in the methods section.</p><p>To compare the transcriptional states of edited and unedited DCs, we compared RNA-seq data from mock-treated edited cells (donors p and q; data from Figure 2—figure supplement 2e) and from mock-treated unedited cells (donors r and s; data from Figure 2b). Clustering of the transcriptional profiles revealed that transcriptional states of edited DCs can be more similar to those of unedited DCs than those of unedited DCs from different donors to each other, suggesting that any changes induced by the editing procedure are smaller than any natural variation in DC state. In addition, the expression levels of a panel of DC markers are comparable between edited and unedited DCs. These analyses provide further evidence that the editing procedure does not substantially alter DC state. These data are included in the revised manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and are described in the Results section.</p><p>We realize that this analysis may not be the one the reviewers had in mind. We could not perform the suggested direct comparison between unedited and RPE65 KO DCs because we did not include unedited DCs from the same donors in the RNA-seq experiment on knockout DCs. Indeed, throughout the manuscript we used DC populations with knockout of a neutral gene (generally RPE65) as the control populations to which we compared all other data. In our view this is the most robust way to ensure that the comparisons isolate the effect of the knockout.</p><p>Together with our data demonstrating that edited moDCs retain the ability to respond to diverse innate immune ligands (Figure 1f, Figure 1—figure supplement 3), the flow cytometry data and the additional analyses of the RNA-seq data provide strong support that our editing procedure does not perturb DC state and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, as the reviewers pointed out in the first and last main comments, the main innovation in our manuscript is the method to introduce knockouts in DCs. The genetic screen recapitulated known LPS signaling pathways and thus provided proof-of-principle for the utility and scalability of our method. The additional hypotheses emerging from the screen data, such as the potential roles of TLR2 in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>theta</italic> LPS recognition and of PTPN6 in mediating inter-individual variation, were intriguing but not essential to establish the utility. We therefore re-framed the manuscript to more clearly emphasize the methods development and proof-of-principle nature of the screen, while presenting the additional points as hypotheses for further exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The response to B. theta varies in magnitude between donors even in non-edited cells. Is donor to donor variability too high to enable us to draw any biological conclusions when moDCs are used in screening? How many donors should be tested for biological phenotypic data to be meaningful?</p></disp-quote><p>First, although we observe that the magnitudes of the LPS response varies across DCs from different donors, many other core aspects of biology are consistent across donors. For example, the patterns of activity across different LPSs are consistent: <italic>B</italic>. <italic>theta</italic> WT LPS is a weaker agonist than <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>theta</italic> 4PP LPS has further reduced activity in all donors. In addition, our genetic screen identifies many core factors that are important for LPS recognition across donors. Thus, many biological conclusions can be drawn from moDCs by interrogating cells from 2-4 different donors, as we did throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Second and perhaps more broadly, inter-individual variability is an interesting biological phenomenon in itself, but how it arises from environmental and genetic factors has long been difficult to study. In this context, the ability to conduct genetics in moDCs from different individuals will be essential to pick apart these contributions, for example through longitudinally sampling cells from the same donor to disentangle genetic and environmental contributions. We provide first glimpses of how we can begin understanding the drivers of such variation by comparing cells from 2-4 different donors. We agree that to definitively pinpoint drivers, studies in larger numbers of donors will be needed, as further discussed below. Importantly, we observed high knockout efficiency across all donors (~15 total), suggesting that the utility of our method is not limited by inter-individual variation and will be applicable to studies involving large numbers of donors.</p><p>We touch upon these points in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As noted by the authors the maximal response to LPS in terms of TNF production is different between the donors.

We do not think we would be able to learn more about the drivers of inter-individual variation by stimulating at exactly EC50.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors emphasize differences in the effect of knocking out PTPN6 or IL-10 in the TNF secretion induced by LPS from B. theta.

The authors should test if moDCs spontaneously secrete TNF if knocked out for PTPN6 or IL-10?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not clearly state our model. Our hypothesis is that PTPN6 and IL-10 suppress TNF-α secretion upon stimulation of the cells, such that knockout of <italic>PTPN6</italic> or <italic>IL10</italic> increases TNF- α secretion upon stimulation. We re-phrased the corresponding section to clarify. More broadly, we now more clearly emphasize that this hypothesis requires further exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In various instances, the authors should consider discussing the limitations of the approach and temper their conclusions: In this regard, the authors should revise their biological conclusions and stress that this only a proof-of-concept study as the screen was conducted with limited number of donors. The authors should be very careful with the interpretation on whether the genes that are hits from the screen are true drivers of interindividual variability. The authors clearly demonstrate that moDC responses to LPSs vary across individuals. This point highlights the importance of assessing immune phenotypes in donor-derived cells, but also raises the necessity to use multiple donors for meaningful and reliable conclusions to be drawn from the data. The number of biological donor replicates (2-3) used in this study is sufficient to show proof of concept, but subsequent studies using moDCs will require much larger number of donors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the approach was missing from the manuscript and have included such a discussion in the revised manuscript at the beginning of the Discussion section.</p><p>We also agree that studies in larger numbers of donors will be needed to definitively establish the roles of putative drivers of inter-individual variation, which we also note in the revised Discussion. More broadly, we now emphasize that our study provides proof-of-principle, suggests exciting hypotheses to be explored further, and provides enabling tools for such explorations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
