Kinetochores are formed every cell cycle via a highly regulated process that requires coordinated assembly of multiple subcomplexes on specialized chromatin. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we developed an assay to assemble kinetochores de novo using centromeric DNA and budding yeast extracts. Assembly is enhanced by mitotic phosphorylation of the Dsn1 kinetochore protein and generates kinetochores capable of binding microtubules. We used this assay to investigate why kinetochores recruit the microtubule-binding Ndc80 complex via two receptors: the Mis12 complex and CENP-T. Although the CENP-T pathway is non-essential in yeast, we demonstrate that it becomes essential for viability and Ndc80c recruitment when the Mis12 pathway is crippled by defects in Dsn1 phosphorylation. Assembling kinetochores de novo in yeast extracts provides a powerful and genetically tractable method to elucidate critical regulatory events in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>budding yeast</kwd><kwd>assembly assay</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>CENP-T</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM064386-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biggins</surname><given-names>Sue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biggins</surname><given-names>Sue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chromosome metabolism training grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Jackie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An assay to assemble kinetochores de novo was developed and used to identify the role of the CENP-T pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomes must be accurately segregated to daughter cells during cell division to avoid aneuploidy, a hallmark of birth defects and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfau and Amon, 2012</xref>).

To carry out these many functions, the kinetochore is a highly regulated, megadalton protein structure composed of many subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Most eukaryotes have complex ‘regional’ centromeres composed of repetitive DNA stretches with interspersed CENP-A- and H3-containing nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blower et al., 2002</xref>). The <underline>c</underline>onstitutive <underline>c</underline>entromere-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>n</underline>etwork (CCAN) binds to centromeric chromatin to form the inner kinetochore and serve as the scaffold for outer kinetochore assembly, which mediates microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>). The Ndc80 complex (‘Ndc80c’) is a key microtubule-binding site within the kinetochore, because it directly mediates attachment and recruits additional attachment factors, such as the Ska complex in vertebrates and its functional ortholog Dam1 in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLuca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maure et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lampert et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, there are two parallel kinetochore receptors for Ndc80c: the Mis12 complex (‘Mis12c’) and CENP-T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maskell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>). Mis12c interacts with the KNL1 and Ndc80 complexes to create a larger network called KMN (KNL1-Mis12-Ndc80) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>). CENP-T, a histone-fold domain containing protein, recruits Ndc80c via the same interaction surface on the Ndc80 complex that binds Mis12c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimitrova et al., 2016</xref>). Although Mis12c and CENP-T each contribute to Ndc80c recruitment in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>), it has been unclear why cells employ two competing receptors for Ndc80c and whether the CENP-T protein functions as a histone at centromeres.</p><p>Substantial progress in understanding kinetochore assembly has been made using reconstitution systems in vitro. For example, pre-formed nucleosomal arrays incubated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts assemble microtubule-binding elements that allowed the identification of events required to initiate kinetochore assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guse et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the binding selectivity of some kinetochore proteins for CENP-A nucleosomes (over H3 nucleosomes) was recently determined by reconstituting the entire linkage between the CENP-A nucleosome and KMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weir et al., 2016</xref>). To identify additional events that regulate kinetochore assembly, we set out to develop a reconstitution system that combines the strengths of these previously developed methods with the added ability to genetically manipulate the system and maintain post-translational modifications. To do this, we used budding yeast because they have a simple ‘point’ centromere that is defined by a ~ 125 bp specific DNA sequence and a single microtubule attachment site per chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winey et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biggins, 2013</xref>). The kinetochore subcomplexes and functions are largely conserved, including the specialized chromatin structure containing CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> that serves as the platform for kinetochore assembly. Additionally, dual pathways for Ndc80 recruitment are used in yeast, although the CENP-T ortholog, Cnn1, is not essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2012</xref>). However, CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> contributes to kinetochore function because mutants display increased chromosome loss, and the tethering of CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> imparts partial stability to acentric minichromosomes via Ndc80 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2012</xref>). In yeast, CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> localization to kinetochores peaks in mitosis as a result of phosphoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2012</xref>), but it is unclear why its recruitment is cell cycle regulated and whether this affects the Mis12 pathway of Ndc80 recruitment.</p><p>Here, we develop a cell-free method to assemble complete kinetochores de novo using centromeric DNA and yeast extracts. We demonstrate that this assay has the same basic requirements as kinetochore assembly in vivo, including the need for the CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> chaperone HJURP<sup>Scm3</sup>, suggesting the formation of a centromeric nucleosome. Conserved mitotic phosphorylation events of the Mis12 complex enhance kinetochore assembly, revealing that the assay is sensitive to key post-translational modifications. Furthermore, this method generates kinetochores that exhibit microtubule-binding activity and employ both Ndc80 recruitment pathways. We applied this assay to identify the requirements for CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> assembly and find that it requires all other inner kinetochore subcomplexes, suggesting it does not have independent DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, we discovered that the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway is required for Ndc80 recruitment and cell viability when the Mis12 pathway is impaired by defects in conserved mitotic phosphoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, we have established a kinetochore assembly assay that identifies a critical function for the yeast CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway and that provides a powerful method to identify other key regulatory events required for kinetochore assembly and function in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of a method to assemble kinetochores de novo</title><p>Because we had previously identified conditions to purify functional kinetochores from yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>), we reasoned that these extracts might be permissive for de novo kinetochore assembly. To test this, we linked the chromosome III centromere (117 bp) and ~70 bp of pericentromeric DNA on each side (referred to as ‘<italic>CEN3</italic>’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to beads via a biotin tag and incubated it in whole cell yeast extracts in the presence of excess non-specific competitive DNA. As negative controls, we used a template (<italic>CEN3<sup>mut</sup></italic>) with mutations in the <underline>c</underline>entromere <underline>d</underline>etermining <underline>e</underline>lement III (CDEIII) region of DNA that abolishes kinetochore assembly in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sorger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lechner and Carbon, 1991</xref>) as well as a 500 bp DNA template from within the <italic>E. coli ampC</italic> gene. We optimized the extract conditions for assembly in vitro by altering the lysis buffer and method, most notably switching from potassium chloride to potassium glutamate, a salt utilized in other reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seki and Diffley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heller et al., 2011</xref>). The assembly reaction was initially performed using an extract prepared from asynchronously growing wildtype (WT) cells and analyzed by immunoblotting against representative components of most kinetochore subcomplexes. Within 30 min of assembly, every protein assayed bound specifically to centromeric DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Inner kinetochore components are generally saturated within 30 min, while outer kinetochore proteins require longer to reach saturation. To compare the efficiency of assembly in various mutants and conditions, we analyzed assembly on <italic>CEN3</italic> DNA at two time points hereafter.</p><p>To further analyze the composition of the assembled particles, we performed mass spectrometry. We detected 39 out of 49 core kinetochore proteins at higher coverage levels on <italic>CEN3</italic> DNA relative to either <italic>ampC</italic> DNA or <italic>CEN3<sup>mut</sup></italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In support of centromeric nucleosome assembly, CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> was specifically enriched on <italic>CEN3</italic> DNA. Importantly, we detected components from all known kinetochore subcomplexes on <italic>CEN3</italic> DNA, including the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> protein. The only proteins that were not detected are small proteins that are components of subcomplexes that were otherwise detected in the MS (for example, Dad2 in the Dam1 complex). Together, these data suggest that all kinetochore complexes assemble on centromeric DNA under the conditions we developed.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37819.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Components from each of the core subcomplexes are detected on assembled kinetochores.</title><p>Kinetochores were assembled on <italic>ampC, CEN3<sup>mut</sup>, or CEN3</italic> DNA from an asynchronous WT <italic>DSN1-3Flag</italic> (SBY14441) extract and analyzed by LC/MS/MS mass spectrometry.

Kinetochore assembly is initiated by the binding of the CBF3 complex to CDEIII, which facilitates the deposition of CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poddar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>). All kinetochore proteins except Cbf1, which binds directly to CDEI, require the Ndc10 component of the CBF3 complex for their localization in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore tested the requirement for CBF3 by performing the assembly assay with extracts prepared from WT cells and an <italic>ndc10-1</italic> temperature sensitive mutant. Similar to the negative controls, the assembly reaction was completely inhibited on the <italic>CEN3</italic> DNA in the <italic>ndc10-1</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

As expected, the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway is noticeably enhanced in kinetochores assembled from mitotic extracts. The cellular levels of some proteins, particularly CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> and CENP-C<sup>Mif2</sup>, are different in the various arrests and it is not clear whether this is due to changes in expression level or solubility. We also note that there appears to be a preference for the assembly of slower-migrating forms of CENP-C<sup>Mif2</sup> during S phase and mitosis, which may reflect post-translational modifications.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37819.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Kinetochore assembly in vitro is regulated by the cell cycle and phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Assembly in vitro is most efficient in extracts made from mitotically arrested cells.

Although the qMS data does not allow us to analyze the stoichiometry of components within one sample, we were able to compare relative protein levels between WT and <italic>dsn1-2D</italic> assembled kinetochores. Similar to the immunoblot analysis, there was a strong enrichment of outer kinetochore proteins (3- to 7-fold enrichment) in the <italic>dsn1-2D</italic> assembled kinetochores while the CCAN levels were similar to WT assembled kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Together, these data indicate that our assembly assay in vitro reflects requirements known for assembly in vivo and is sensitive to critical post-translational modifications.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37819.012</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Outer kinetochore assembly is enhanced by Dsn1 phosphorylation.</title><p>Kinetochores were assembled on the indicated DNA templates from an asynchronous <italic>dsn1-2D-3Flag</italic> (SBY14151) extract and analyzed by mass spectrometry as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

The mechanism of CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> recruitment to the kinetochore has been controversial. CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> and its partner CENP-W have histone fold domains (HFD) and can tetramerize with two additional HFD proteins, CENP-S/X, to form a nucleosome-like structure in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>).

Because we expected the double mutant to be deficient for Ndc80 recruitment, we reasoned that the mitotic checkpoint might be compromised and therefore arrested cells in S phase rather than mitosis. As expected, the <italic>dsn1-3A</italic> extracts showed a considerable decrease in Ndc80 assembly as well as the other KMN components, Dsn1 and KNL1<sup>Spc105</sup>, and that Ndc80 recruitment was further reduced in the <italic>dsn1-3A mcm22-AID</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).

By altering the extract conditions, we were able to assemble all known kinetochore subcomplexes on a centromeric DNA template.

In the future, it will be important to fully characterize the microtubule binding mode of the assembled kinetochores using biophysical assays.</p><p>A number of criteria indicate that the assay we developed reflects kinetochore assembly de novo. First, the assembly of all kinetochore proteins depends on the CBF3 complex, which is required to initiate assembly in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poddar et al., 2004</xref>). Second, CENP-A association with the template requires its chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shivaraju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>). Histone H2A, H2B, and H4 are also present, suggesting that a centromeric nucleosome forms on the DNA. We found that DNA templates capable of wrapping a single centromeric nucleosome efficiently assemble kinetochores, consistent with recent work showing that KMN can link to a single centromeric nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weir et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, these data demonstrate that pericentromeric chromatin is not required for kinetochore assembly in vitro, although it contributes to kinetochore function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom, 2014</xref>). Third, outer kinetochore protein recruitment depends on the inner kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gascoigne and Cheeseman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hara and Fukagawa, 2018</xref>). Fourth, kinetochore assembly is more efficient in extracts made from cells arrested in S phase or mitosis. Although it was previously shown that yeast kinetochores assemble during S phase, it was not clear if assembly required DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pearson et al., 2004</xref>). Because replication cannot occur in extracts without sequential kinase treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heller et al., 2011</xref>), our assay also shows that active DNA replication is not a strict requirement for kinetochore assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> localization to kinetochores requires the CCAN</title><p>Kinetochores recruit the microtubule-binding complex Ndc80 through both the Mis12 complex and CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hori et al., 2008</xref>). The position of CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> within the kinetochore has been unclear because it can form a nucleosome-like structure with CENP-W/S/X in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>). However, the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> and CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> DNA-binding sites overlap in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pekgöz Altunkaya et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> may not directly contact the centromere. We found that all CCAN subcomplexes analyzed are required for CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> kinetochore localization in vitro, which is generally consistent with work analyzing its localization in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samejima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pekgöz Altunkaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Logsdon et al., 2015</xref>). However, an OA mutant that is defective in the recruitment of other CCAN components does retain some CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup><italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> localization requirements in vivo may be more complex than revealed by our assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thapa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmitzberger et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless, these data are consistent with the conclusion that CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> does not have intrinsic DNA binding activity under our assay conditions. In addition, we did not detect CENP-S/X<sup>Mhf1/2</sup> specifically binding to centromeric DNA, suggesting they are not yeast kinetochore components.</p><p>It was previously known that CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> recruits CENP-C<sup>Mif2</sup> and OA, but the relative order of CCAN components downstream of these complexes was unclear. We therefore combined our data with known physical interactions of each subcomplex to map the order of the pathway from CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> to CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pekgöz Altunkaya et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that the OA complex is the bifurcation point of the Mis12c and CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> assembly pathways, because the CENP-Q<sup>Okp1</sup> mutant perturbed the assembly of both KMN and CENP-PO<sup>Ctf19-Mcm21</sup>, while the CCAN subcomplexes downstream of CENP-C<sup>Mif2</sup> and OA specifically altered only the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway. The CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> recruitment pathway is therefore comprised of the CENP-PO (CM complex), CENP-HIK, and CENP-LN complexes. We note that all of the non-essential, conserved yeast kinetochore proteins are specific to the CENP-T pathway, providing an explanation for why the yeast kinetochore contains both essential and non-essential proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functions of the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway in budding yeast</title><p>In human cells, the CENP-T pathway recruits Ndc80 both directly and indirectly. The CENP-T protein directly binds to two Ndc80 complexes and recruits a third via a phospho-regulated interaction with a Mis12 complex that is also bound to an Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huis In 't Veld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rago et al., 2015</xref>). CENP-T knockdown in human cells results in severely decreased Mis12 and KNL1 complexes at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>). In contrast, we did not find evidence for the recruitment of KMN by CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> in budding yeast, consistent with data showing that recombinant CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> does not interact with recombinant Mis12 complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>). The CCAN mutants we assayed that specifically inhibit the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway did not alter Mis12 or KNL1<sup>Spc105</sup> assembly. A lack of linkage between CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> and the Mis12 complex in yeast may also explain why CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> is non-essential and does not contribute to spindle checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2012</xref>). It will be important to further analyze the relationship between the yeast Mis12 complex and CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> in the future.</p><p>The Mis12 pathway is responsible for the majority of Ndc80 recruitment in yeast, so it is surprising that yeast cells are viable when the conserved phosphorylation sites that promote Mis12c localization are mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimitrova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petrovic et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we discovered these cells are viable because they use the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway to assemble a functional kinetochore. When the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway is eliminated in cells lacking Dsn1 phosphorylation, Ndc80 levels are significantly reduced and kinetochores are defective in making normal attachments to microtubules in vivo. A deletion of CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> has synthetic phenotypes with two other mutants that cripple Mis12c assembly: a CENP-C<sup>Mif2</sup> truncation lacking its Mis12c binding site and a temperature sensitive allele of <italic>NNF1</italic> in the Mis12 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> assembly pathway is required to recruit critical levels of Ndc80 when the function of the Mis12c pathway is reduced. CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> kinetochore levels peak at anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhatchinamoorthy et al., 2017</xref>), which is the time when Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins is reversed by phosphatase activity. Therefore, the anaphase enrichment of CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> might not only increase the load-bearing potential of kinetochore-microtubule attachments by recruiting more Ndc80, but also reinforce kinetochore stability when Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of Dsn1 is removed. In addition, switching to an Ndc80-recruiting pathway that does not recruit KMN may also help silence the spindle assembly checkpoint, as KNL1 is the critical scaffold for the SAC.</p><p>The development of a kinetochore assembly assay de novo has helped to define the two pathways that assemble Ndc80 at kinetochores. Our assay is complementary to a previously developed assembly method using preassembled chromatin templates and frog egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guse et al., 2011</xref>), but provides the advantage of being genetically tractable. In the future, our assembly assay will be useful for directly examining the role of other post-translational modifications in kinetochore assembly. In addition, it will provide a method to assess the biophysical and structural properties of each Ndc80 recruitment pathway to better understand how cells maintain kinetochore-microtubule attachments to ultimately ensure accurate chromosome segregation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Stefan Westermann (Reviewer #1); Hongtao Yu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors employ a new variation of the classic &quot;bead assay&quot; that has been previously used in the yeast kinetochore field. They couple a short piece of centromeric DNA to beads and incubate the beads in soluble extracts prepared from yeast cells. As controls, beads coupled to either mutated CEN DNA or unrelated DNA are used. Using Western-Blotting and mass spectrometry, the authors demonstrate association of essentially all known core kinetochore proteins specifically to CEN beads. Taking advantage of existing yeast mutants they show that kinetochore assembly in this assay is abrograted in an <italic>ndc10</italic> mutant and requires Scm3-mediated loading of the CEN nucleosome onto the short CEN DNA stretch. They go on to use this assay to demonstrate the contribution of the Ndc80 receptor Cnn1/CENP-T to outer kinetochore assembly. In particular they demonstrate that combining a <italic>cnn1</italic> deletion with mutants that prevent Ipl1 mediated enhancement of Mis12 recruitment to kinetochores, abolishes Ndc80 recruitment, clarifying the contributions of these different &quot;pathways&quot;. The major advance in this manuscript is the development of the reconstitution assay and its rigorous validation. This study, along with findings from others, establish the existence of two parallel pathways for outer kinetochore assembly: the CENP-C-Mis12c pathway regulated by Aurora B and the CENP-T-Ndc80c pathway regulated by Cdk1. The technical quality of the experiments is high. The results are convincing and compelling, even if they primarily validate findings derived from work in other systems and from recent reconstitutions with recombinant human complexes. The novelty of the work would improve if the following revisions could be implemented.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should complement Figure 7 with quantitative analysis of Ndc80 localization using microscopy or chromatin immunoprecipitations to demonstrated the prediction that there is an additive effect on Ndc80 localization in metaphase cells in vivo.</p><p>2) The assembly assay on beads suggests Ndc80 reduction but this could be more persuasive (e.g. there is no quantification). Also, CENP-T itself is not analyzed (possibly because this requires crossing in the tagged gene). This would be a condition that would greatly benefit from the quantitative mass spec analysis used for the <italic>dsn1-3D</italic> mutant – specifically, a comparison of <italic>dsn1-3A</italic> to <italic>dsn1-3A;mcm22-AID</italic> by quantitative mass spec, or at least from a quantification of the signal of Ndc80 from multiple experiments.</p><p>3) The characterization of the kinetochore-microtubule binding can be strengthened. Is it possible to release the assembled kinetochore from beads and perform negative-stain EM studies on that alone or bound to microtubules? Low-resolution images would suffice. A mutant kinetochore lacking Ndc80c can be used as the negative control. We realize that this may not be straightforward, so should the authors be unable to perform this experiment, it will not be held against them. In this case, however, the authors need to add a statement clearly stating the lack of biophysical characterization of the microtubule-binding mode of the reconstituted kinetochore.</p><p>4) Subsection “Functions of the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway in budding yeast”, the Kim et al. (2015) study showed that depletion of CENP-T alone did not affect the spindle checkpoint in human cells. Only CENP-T-depleted cells treated with an Aurora kinase inhibitor exhibited checkpoint defect. That finding is actually in broad agreement with the current work, although the mechanism in human cells might involve Mis12c.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37819.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should complement Figure 7 with quantitative analysis of Ndc80 localization using microscopy or chromatin immunoprecipitations to demonstrated the prediction that there is an additive effect on Ndc80 localization in metaphase cells in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We are technically limited in our ability to quantify Ndc80 localization in vivo. While we have antibodies that work well for immunoblotting, we were not able to get them to work reliably for immunofluorescence or chromatin immunoprecipitations. While this issue could normally be resolved by epitope-tagging the Ndc80 protein, we were not able to obtain viable <italic>mcm22-AID dsn1-3A</italic> strains when Ndc80 was also tagged. Because we were not able to carry out the requested experiments, we further substantiated our findings in Figure 7 regarding Ndc80 levels. We have now quantified the level of Ndc80 in the assembly assay in each of the four strains reported (Figure 7—figure supplement 3) and confirmed that the double mutant strain has even lower levels of Ndc80 than the single mutant strains. Because we had difficulty directly analyzing Ndc80 levels in cells, we performed experiments to assay the phenotypes of the <italic>mcm22-AID dsn1-3A</italic> cells (Figure 7D). We found a significant defect in the clustering of kinetochores at the poles, consistent with defects in kinetochore function in vivo. This data is now presented in Figure 7D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The assembly assay on beads suggests Ndc80 reduction but this could be more persuasive (e.g. there is no quantification).

However, we have not yet been able to obtain EM images of the assembled kinetochores because it takes a substantial amount of time and it is not our expertise so requires additional collaborators. We have visualized the isolated kinetochores bound to microtubules by TIRF microscopy. However, we have not yet carefully determined the contributions of Ndc80 due to the amount of work involved in TIRF assays, so we did not add this to the paper. Because the single molecule studies are labor intensive, our plan is that they will be part of a future publication. As requested, we have clearly stated that this is a critical goal for the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Functions of the CENP-T<sup>Cnn1</sup> pathway in budding yeast”, the Kim et al.
