(Hif) pathway is functionally conserved across metazoans in modulating cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, the functions of this pathway under aerobic physiological conditions are rarely investigated. Here, we show that Hif-1α2, a locust Hif-1α isoform, does not induce canonical hypoxic responses but functions as a specific regulator of locust flight, which is a completely aerobic physiological process. Two Hif-1α splice variants were identified in locusts, a ubiquitously expressed Hif-1α1 and a muscle-predominantly expressed Hif-1α2. Hif-1α1 that induces typical hypoxic responses upon hypoxia exposure remains inactive during flight. By contrast, the expression of Hif-1α2, which lacks C-terminal transactivation domain, is less sensitive to oxygen tension but induced extensively by flying. Hif-1α2 regulates physiological processes involved in glucose metabolism and antioxidation during flight and sustains flight endurance by maintaining redox homeostasis through upregulating the production of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) quencher, DJ-1. Overall, this study reveals a novel Hif-mediated mechanism underlying prolonged aerobic physiological activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>animal flight</kwd><kwd>hypoxia inducible factor</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>Dj-1</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>redox homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32000332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32088102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019QNRC001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The long-distance flight of locusts is greatly facilitated by a muscle-abundantly expressed Hif-1α splice variant, which remains active in normoxia and scavenges flight-induced reactive oxygen species by upregulating the expression of DJ-1 (PARK 7).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flight is a key adaptive strategy for many animals but also poses physiological challenges. Animal flight is the most energetically expensive form of locomotion that relies heavily on mitochondrial aerobic activity. The oxygen consumption rates during flight are approximately 30–150 times higher than those at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Mordue, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartholomew and Casey, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snelling et al., 2012</xref>). However, the high aerobic performance of flight muscles can produce excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause oxidative damage to the myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher-Wellman and Bloomer, 2009</xref>). The flight activity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is associated with reduced life span and increased levels of oxidative damage, but oxidative-induced muscle fatigue is rarely observed in flying animals during long-distance migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liechti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magwere et al., 2006</xref>). Flight muscles of a long-distance flying moth use the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in a way that appears to reduce oxidative damage caused by flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levin et al., 2017</xref>). However, under flight conditions, especially during prolonged and continuous flight, the molecular signaling by which flying animals minimize oxidative damage in their muscle systems remains unknown.</p><p>The hypoxia inducible factor (Hif) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved oxygen sensing pathway that modulates cellular oxygen level and promotes metabolic responses upon hypoxic induction in animals. This pathway controls hundreds of downstream gene expressions and is an important therapeutic target for many hypoxia-associated diseases in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Kaelin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masoud and Li, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selak et al., 2005</xref>). The key components of this pathway are Hifs, which comprise an oxygen-sensitive α subunit and a stable β subunit. Under hypoxia, stabilized α subunits heterodimerize with β subunits in the nucleus and induce expression of multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wenger et al., 2005</xref>). In skeletal muscles of mammals, acute exercises lead to reduced myocellular oxygen partial pressure (<italic>P</italic>O<sub>2</sub>) and thus stabilize Hif-1α protein, which in turn attenuates ROS production by reducing mitochondrial activity and cellular oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ameln et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mason et al., 2004</xref>). However, flying animals are able to satisfy the high oxygen demand by the myocytes during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Komai, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meir et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, owing to invagination of the tracheoles into the cells, flying insects conduct oxygen directly into flight muscle cells and exhibit the highest aerobic activity among animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison and Roberts, 2000</xref>). Therefore, whether or not the Hif pathway is also involved in flight, a constant physical activity that heavily depends on mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, and how the Hif pathway provides protection against oxidative damage and satisfies the extremely high demands of oxygen consumption are unknown.</p><p>In mammals, three Hif-α paralogs (Hif-1α, Hif-2α, and Hif-3α) have been identified; they are derived from genome duplication and encoded by three separated genes, namely, <italic>HIF1A, EPAS1</italic>, and <italic>HIF3A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008</xref>). Hif-1α is present in all tissues, whereas Hif-2α and Hif-3α are limited to specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertout et al., 2008</xref>). Hif-1α enhances oxygen delivery and regulates cellular metabolic adaptation to hypoxia, while Hif-2α promotes vascular endothelial growth by erythropoietin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iyer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rankin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Due to alternative splicing and different promoters, Hif-3α produces a large number of mRNA variants. The most studied Hif-3α truncated isoform is an inhibitor of Hif-1α and Hif-2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maynard et al., 2005</xref>). Invertebrates possess only one Hif-α gene (Hif-1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loenarz et al., 2011</xref>). But flybase indicates four alternative transcripts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and there is further evidence for splice variants in the transcriptomes of other insect species. In insects, the Hif pathway participates in a series of hypoxia-associated biological processes, including tracheal development, diapause, and larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Centanin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valzania et al., 2018</xref>). In Glanville Fritillary butterfly (<italic>Melitaea cinxia</italic>), a genetic variation of <italic>Sdhd</italic>, which is a regulator of Hif-1α, is associated with altered tracheal volume and flight performance; this association suggests the possible involvement of Hif signaling in flight adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pekny et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The migratory locust (<italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>) is a worldwide agricultural pest capable of long-distance flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Swarming locusts can migrate hundreds of kilometers per day and invade areas covering millions of square kilometers to an extent, with the help of thermal currents and tail winds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, migratory locusts can metabolically adapt to hypoxic environments and make migratory flights on the Tibetan Plateau at altitudes over 3700 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). As a model for animal flight studies, this species has been employed to reveal many aspects and processes pivotal to the understanding of hormonal regulation of energy material mobilization during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van der Horst and Rodenburg, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, two alternatively spliced Hif-1α isoforms, namely, Hif-1α1 and Hif-1α2, were identified in migratory locusts. The stabilization of Hif-1α1 requires hypoxic induction, whereas, owing to the lack of C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD), Hif-1α2 is less sensitive to oxygen and remains stable in normoxia. In vivo, Hif-1α1 plays a classical role in mediating cellular responses to hypoxia. However, Hif-1α2 is an essential regulator of prolonged flight in locusts. Mechanistically, Hif-1α2 is upregulated extensively during flight and modulates glucose oxidation and redox homeostasis in flight muscles. Hif-1α2 is able to transactivate the expression of Dj-1, which is an important ROS quencher, and scavenges flight-induced ROS directly. These findings reveal a regulatory mechanism by which hypoxia signaling balances high aerobic metabolism and the risk of overloaded peroxidation under highly aerobic physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Hif-1α isoforms in locusts</title><p>The full-length coding sequences (CDs) of <italic>Hif-1α</italic> (3309 bp) were cloned from locusts. Similar to any other invertebrates, there is only one <italic>Hif-α</italic> paralog in locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The predicted protein of locust Hif-1α contained basic helix–loop–helix-PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) domains and two transactivation domains (N-terminal TAD and C-terminal TAD). Sequence alignment analysis revealed that the locust Hif-1α protein shared 51.79%, 51.83%, and 48.3% identity with human Hif-1α (AAC68568.1), Hif-2α (Q99814.3), and Hif-3α (AAH80551.1), respectively. In addition, the locust Hif-1α was conserved at proline and asparagine residues, which are the targets of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and factor-inhibiting Hif (FIH), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the basis of full-length transcriptome, two transcripts of <italic>Hif-1α</italic> were observed. The full and short length were named as <italic>Hif-1α1</italic> and <italic>Hif-1α2</italic>, respectively. These transcripts were both derived from the alternative 3′ splice site coupled to the alternative polyA site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and further determined by 3′ RACE (GeneBank access numbers MW349109 for <italic>Hif-1α1</italic> and MW349110 for <italic>Hif-1α2</italic>). The CDs of <italic>Hif-1α2</italic> were 201 bp shorter than those of <italic>Hif-1α1</italic> and the encoded protein lacked the C-TAD, which is required for the transitivity of Hif-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Evolutionary analysis revealed that such Hif-1α splice form also exists in other Orthoptera (Accession no. ON137898 and ON137899 for <italic>Deracantha onos</italic>), some birds (e.g., XP_025006307.1 for <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> and XP_013038471.1 for <italic>Anser cygnoides domesticus</italic>), and human (NP_851397.1). Additionally, the TADs of Hif-α have varied distributions among insects. In incomplete metamorphosis insects and beetles, the Hif-α protein possesses two TADs (N-TAD and C-TAD), but in flies and moths the C-TAD and its inhibitor FIH are completely missing at the genomic level. Therefore, C-TAD-lacking Hif-1α transcripts, with distinct origins, seem to commonly exist in different insect taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The protein of overexpressed Hif-1α1 was detectable only under hypoxic conditions (1% O<sub>2</sub>), while the protein of Hif-1α2 was detectable in normoxia and upregulated significantly in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, the protein of Hif-1α2 was observed in the nucleus of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In adult locusts, <italic>Hif-1α1</italic> mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues, but <italic>Hif-1α2</italic> showed the highest expression in flight muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In addition, the mRNA levels of <italic>Hif-1α2</italic> were elevated with the maturation of the flight muscles and reached the highest level at the adult stage 12 days post eclosion, while <italic>Hif-1α1</italic> exhibited stable expression at all developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results suggest a possible functional division between Hif-1α1 and Hif-1α2 in locusts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An oxygen-insensitive Hif-1α isoform is identified in locusts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree construction of Hif-α.

Hif-1α2, a newly identified Hif-1α isoform, was stably expressed in flight muscles of locusts regardless of oxygen tension. Hif-1α2 controlled the flight performance by facilitating glucose oxidation and providing redox homeostasis. However, the other isoform Hif-1α1 played a conserved role in response to induction of hypoxia but was not activated by flight treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In general, the activity of Hif-α is strictly controlled by oxygen-tension and the aberrant activation of Hif pathway under normoxia is usually disease‐associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koyasu et al., 2018</xref>). But in some specific cell types or physiological conditions, Hif pathway remains active in normoxia. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> crystal cells, the Hif-α protein is stably expressed in normoxia and acts as an activator of Notch signaling to promote the survival of hemocyte during hematopoietic development and hypoxic stress. In these crystal cells, Hif-α is stabilized by NO and does not interact with Hif-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>). Vertebrate myeloid cells have shown a similar upregulation of Hif-1a protein in well-oxygenated environments. But myeloid cells have few mitochondria and rely on glycolysis to produce ATP under all conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cramer et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, the stabilization of locust Hif-1α2 in normoxia was possibly due to the alternatively spliced C-TAD. Additionally, unlike vertebrate myeloid cells, the metabolic profile of flight muscle, which Hif-1α2 was highly expressed, is strictly aerobic. Therefore, the finding of this study greatly extends the functional scope of Hif pathway.</p><p>There is an obvious functional differentiation between Hif-1α1 and Hif-1α2 in locusts. Under normoxia, Hif-1α2 displayed a considerably higher expression than the full-length Hif-1α1. Although the protein level and activity of Hif-1α2 were induced by hypoxic treatment or <italic>PHD</italic> knockdown, Hif-1α2 failed to upregulate the gene expression of <italic>PDK</italic> and <italic>BNIP3</italic> and induce hypoxic responses under hypoxia. Therefore, Hif-1α2 had different oxygen sensitivity, being less inhibited by normoxia, and increasing to high levels in low oxygen. Additionally, Hif-1α2 regulated target genes different from those of Hif-1α1. Structurally, Hif-1α1 contains two TADs (N-TAD and C-TAD), but Hif-1α2 only possesses an N-TAD. The Hif-1α splice form without C-TAD was also reported in human as Hif-1α<sup>736</sup>. In line with the locust Hif-1α2, the protein of Hif-1α<sup>736</sup> was detectible in normoxia and was upregulated by the knockdown of PHD2. Meanwhile, Hif-1α<sup>736</sup> could transactivate the promoter of <italic>VEGF</italic> under normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gothié et al., 2000</xref>). The functions of TADs in Hif-α are regulating transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1996</xref>). Each TAD can act independently and is regulated by different mechanisms. An oxygen-dependent degradation domain overlaps with N-TAD and mediates the PHD-dependent degradation of Hif-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruick and McKnight, 2001</xref>). The transactivation of C-TAD is regulated by FIH-1, a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase (similar to PHDs). FIH-1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of an asparagine residue in the C-TAD in normoxia, thereby preventing interaction of Hif-α with the p300/CBP co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahon et al., 2001</xref>). A previous study has shown that, the C-TAD and N-TAD can regulate distinct Hif-dependent gene expression along the oxygen gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dayan et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we speculate that due to the lack of C-TAD, locust Hif-1α2 exhibits a reduced oxygen sensitivity and an impaired ability in transactivating gene expressions of <italic>PDK</italic> and <italic>BNIP3</italic>, which are regulated by Hif-1α1.</p><p>Hif-1α2 is a transcriptional regulator that modulates glucose metabolism in the flight muscle of locusts. Flight is one of the most energetically expensive forms of locomotion, and carbohydrates and fats are the main fuel types used by animals for flying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wegener, 1996</xref>). Locusts use carbohydrates to initiate flight and shift to lipid oxidation for prolonged migratory flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pflüger and Duch, 2011</xref>). Studies on the metabolic regulations of flight mainly focused on neural and hormonal levels thus far. In migratory locusts, octopamine and adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) take part in modulating energy material mobilization during aggregation and flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayali and Pener, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). Octopamine stimulates the oxidation of carbohydrates at the initial stage of flight by increasing the content of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wegener, 1996</xref>). AKHs, which are generated from the corpora cardiac, modulate fat body lipid mobilization through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and finally activate triacylglycerol lipase, which catalyze triacylglycerol into the transport form 1,2-diacylglycerol during prolonged flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van der Horst, 2003</xref>). A recent study reported that the AKH/corazonin-related peptide can facilitate muscle lipid utilization through promoting fatty-acid-binding protein production in flight muscles of locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hou et al., 2021</xref>). In the current study, the reduction in Hif-1α2 extensively repressed the gene expression levels of glycolytic enzymes even in normoxia. Moreover, the flight-induced upregulation of glycolysis was dependent on Hif-1α2. Therefore, Hif-1α2 is possibly located downstream of octopamine or AKH and works as a direct regulator of carbohydrate metabolism during flight. But as mentioned above, utilization of carbohydrate mainly takes place at the initial stage of flight in locusts. That’s why repressing glycolysis hardly produced any negative effect on long-term flight.</p><p>A prolonged physical activity requires not only a sufficient energy supplement but also a better maintained redox homeostasis in myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leeuwenburgh and Heinecke, 2001</xref>). Intense or prolonged physical activity is normally associated with increased ROS production. If this production is not adequately balanced by antioxidants, oxidative damage to biomolecules occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher-Wellman and Bloomer, 2009</xref>). The overloaded ROS attacks the cell membrane fatty acids and activates a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, finally leading to severe damage to the cellular bilayers or other lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaschler and Stockwell, 2017</xref>). Additionally, oxidative damage caused by flight in insects differs depending on their flight physiology, behavior, and life history. A sustained flight throughout life can cause a higher mortality rate to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magwere et al., 2006</xref>). Flight activity of honeybees directly leads to increased oxidative damage, which in turn detrimentally affects their flight performance and foraging ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Margotta et al., 2018</xref>). Insects have evolved a series of adaptive strategies to cope with intermittent and migratory flight-induced oxidative stress. Glanville Fritillary butterflies carrying <italic>Sdhd M</italic> allele are associated with the activated Hif signaling, reduced metabolic rate, and larger tracheal volume in larvae, and these associations contribute to less oxidative injury in flight muscle and better flight performance during intermittent flight in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pekny et al., 2018</xref>). Nectar feeding hawkmoths use their antioxidant stores during migratory flight and through PPP to produce an antioxidant potential to recover from oxidative damage during rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levin et al., 2017</xref>). While the utilization of PPP was reported to be positively correlated with the activation of Hif pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadiku and Walmsley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tokuda et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, at the molecular level, the Hif pathway likely plays a central role in regulating redox homeostasis during insect flight.</p><p>In this study, Hif-1α2 participated in antioxidative processes by upregulating Dj-1 expression during flight. Dj-1 was highly expressed in the flight muscles, and the reduction in Dj-1 significantly impaired the flight performance of locusts and led to accumulated flight-induced oxidative stress in the myocytes of the flight muscles. Dj-1 is a highly conserved protein involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and detoxification. In human, Dj-1 participates in antioxidation by directly quenching ROS upon oxidative modification of a conserved cysteine residue (Cys-106) or by stabilizing Nrf2, which is a master transcriptional regulator of antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taira et al., 2004</xref>). Dj-1 also prevents the formation of a toxic glycolytic intermediate which can cause damages to metabolites and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heremans et al., 2022</xref>). Deletion or point mutation (L166P) of Dj-1 is associated with the onset of the familial Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonifati et al., 2003</xref>). The Dj-1 mutant fruit fly exhibits phenotypes such as male sterility, shortened life span, and reduced climbing ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hao et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Hif-1α2 confers locusts with a superior ability in modulating redox homeostasis during a prolonged flight while maintaining efficient aerobic performance. In this study, the locust Hif-1α1 regulated the metabolic reprogramming upon hypoxic induction, including promoting lactate production and repressing mitochondrial aerobic activity. However, no such cellular hypoxia-adaptive responses were detected in the flight muscle during flight treatment on flight mills; instead, the redox homeostasis was maintained by Hif-1α2-regulated Dj-1 production. Muscle-specific inactivation of hypoxic responses during flight is speculated to be an adaptive strategy for endurance flight. In mammals, Hif-1α and Hif-2α could maintain skeletal muscle redox homeostasis by attenuating aerobic performance. Hif-1α represses mitochondrial activities by directly regulating the expression of <italic>PDK1</italic> and <italic>BNIP3,</italic> which are both negative regulators of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Hif-2α can reprogram glucose metabolism from oxidative form to anaerobic form through the activation of the PPAR-α pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragonés et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, in the skeletal muscle of mammals, the activation of the Hif pathways provides oxidative stress tolerance to the myocytes, but impairs aerobic performance as a side effect. However, flight relies more heavily on aerobic metabolism than running of mammals; in particular, flight metabolism is completely aerobic for insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison and Lighton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison and Roberts, 2000</xref>). Thus, maintaining an efficient aerobic activity is important for flying adaptation. Functional differentiation of Hif-1α isoforms provides locusts a fine balance between the production of ROS and activity of aerobic metabolism during flight.</p><p>Alternative splicing may be a source of functional innovation for Hif-α in locusts. In this study, we found that Hif-1α in locust species generates two transcripts, that is, the full-length <italic>Hif-1α1</italic> and the short-length <italic>Hif-1α2</italic> that lacks the C-TAD domain. The C-TAD of Hif-α is under strong selective pressure in invertebrates; it first appears in non-bilaterians (<italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>) and has a varied distribution among invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham and Presnell, 2017</xref>). This domain and its inhibitor FIH are completely absent at the genomic level in some newly emerged insect species, including wasps (Hymenoptera), true flies (Diptera), moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), all of which are outstanding flyers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham and Presnell, 2017</xref>). Genetic variations in the Hif pathway can affect the tracheal volume and flight performance of lowland butterfly populations under well-oxygenated environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marden et al., 2013</xref>). This evidence combined with our findings implies that the emergence of C-TAD-lacking Hif-1α transcripts is likely to be a substrate for flight adaptation in some insect species.</p><p>Insects were the first animals capable of flying , and their respiratory system is the tracheal system. The tracheal supply to flight muscles is divided into three parts: the primary tracheal supply, the secondary tracheal supply and the tertiary tracheal supply. The tertiary tracheal supply is constituted by terminal tracheoles, which conveying oxygen to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wigglesworth and Lee, 1982</xref>). During flight, the tracheal system reaches its maximum functional requirements with little reserve capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Snelling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snelling et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the tracheal conductance for oxygen and flight performance of insects are closely associated. In the larval stages, the tracheal system becomes oxygen-sensitive, and Hif pathway controls the growth of tracheal terminal branches toward oxygen-starved areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Centanin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henry and Harrison, 2004</xref>). The canonical role of the Hif pathway contributes to the ecological adaptation of Glanville Fritillary butterflies from genetically distinct clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pekny et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The two Hif-1α splices may coordinate their roles in long-lasting flight tasks. In locusts, the canonical role of Hif pathway is modulated by Hif-1α1, which regulates metabolic reprogramming and possibly controls tracheal growth under low oxygen tension. However, the high oxygen conductance of the tracheal system of the locust flight muscle may keep the intracellular oxygen tension above the low level that triggers Hif-1α1 stability. Meanwhile, the relatively easy task of flying with weight support on a flight mill in the present study may render the role of Hif-1α1 in flight muscle undetectable. Nevertheless, when it comes to highly active tissue, Hif-1α1 may provide protective effects too late to prevent oxidative damage. Instead, Hif-1α2, which is expressed in normoxia and has a graded activity with decreasing oxygen, provides continuously variable expression of antioxidant genes so that protection is in place before the damage occurs. This is different from the way Hif-1α1 is typically activated only at very low oxygen tension. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, the similar transcript form of locust Hif-1α2 also exists in some other insect species and birds. Therefore, the Hif-1α2-mediated protective mechanism is possibly applicable to other flying animals, with the locust in this study as the first glimpse.</p><p>The regulatory mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal expression of Hif-1α2 remains elusive. Alternative splicing is one of the main sources of spatiotemporally specific mRNA expression and proteomic diversity in eukaryotes. The diverse expression of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms is usually attributed to alternative promoters or regulatory splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Russcher et al., 2007</xref>). Alternative promoters can produce a wide variety of transcripts at transcription initiation sites or even affect the splicing patterns of downstream exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zavolan et al., 2003</xref>). The regulatory splicing factors with cell-type-specific expression can bind specifically to enhancers or silencers of a premature mRNA to promote or repress splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). Therefore, alternative usage of promoters or regulatory splicing factors could contribute to the age- and tissue-specific expression of the locust Hif-1α transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, detailed mechanism requires further elucidation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Locust maintenance</title><p>Locusts were maintained in the laboratory at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.

Similar carousel technique for locust flight measurement was firstly reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krogh and Weis-fogh, 1952</xref>. A fan on the top of each flight mill was used to induce flight with a wind speed at 1.5 m/s. The total flight distance, flight duration, and average flight speed were used to represent the flight abilities of the tested locusts. The total flight distance and flight duration were recorded by a computer and the average flight speed was calculated via dividing distance by duration. For flight ability testing, male locusts were harnessed on flight mills for 60, 120, or 180 min at 12 days after eclosion. Individuals with the initial bout of flight over 50 m were seen as flyers. Most of the locust individuals cannot fly continuously during 120 and 180 min of tests, instead they performed intermittent bouts of flight.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James Marden (Reviewer #1); Jiwon Shim (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide a taxonomic view of the presence of Hif-1a splice variants in locusts and other insects.</p><p>2. Include a detailed supplementary figure and text to support Figure 6F showing a hypothesis that summarizes both the upstream and downstream regulatory details would help readers form a mechanistic understanding.</p><p>3. State clearly the hypothesis of the role of Hif-1a2 in putting anti-oxidant protection in place before the damage occurs.</p><p>4. Strengthen the discussion by considering other findings regarding oxidative damage caused by flight in insects that differ in their flight physiology, behavior and life history.</p><p>5. Ensure that the entire paper is corrected for and free of errors in citing the literature.</p><p>6. Include an account of statistical analysis performed in the Methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>L. 32: Omit &quot;constructing&quot;.</p><p>L. 36-38: This sentence discusses birds, but one of the two cited papers is about sphingid moths (Levin and Davidowitz 2017) and the other (Skrip et al., 2015) has no detailed physiological analysis and is not informative here. Hence, omit the tangential mention of birds, cite only the Levin paper and say something like &quot;flight muscles of a long-distance flying moth use the pentose phosphate shunt in a way that appears to reduce oxidative damage&quot;.</p><p>L. 39: Given the Levin paper, which identifies a particular carbon atom within glucose as important for maintaining redox homeostasis during flight, the sentence in L. 39 seems unjustified. The present paper is more about signaling pathways that regulate processes that minimize oxidative damage during flight, so craft this sentence to say something highlighting the general lack of information in that realm.</p><p>L. 44-45: The Rytkonen and Storz 2011 paper is about evolutionary origins of oxygen sensing. It's not a primary reference for hypoxia-associated diseases in humans. Better citations would be https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15611513/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15652751/</p><p>L. 44: &quot;an important therapeutic target&quot; The cited Gonzalez et al., 2018 paper discusses the potential of this pathway for therapies, but other than one VEGF treatment cited in that paper, it is not a reference you can use to support this statement.</p><p>L. 61-63: &quot;Hif-1α enhances oxygen delivery and regulates cellular metabolic adaptation to hypoxia, while Hif-2α promotes vascular endothelial growth by erythropoietin (Semenza, 1999, Zhao et al., 2015).&quot; These papers do not support this statement. The Semenza paper discusses the role of Hif-1a in regulation of EPO; the Zhao et al., paper has a very nice overview of Hif-2a function but never mentions erythropoietin. At this point I’ve only made it to line 63 and I’ve found multiple instances of the references not aligning with the text. I don’t have time to fact check all of your references, so I’m not going to do that anymore, but the editor should firmly instruct you to go through the entire paper and make sure that you are correctly citing the literature.</p><p>L. 66: &quot;Invertebrates have only one Hif-α paralog (Hif-1α).” I think you should finish the thought stimulated by the prior sentence about splice variants in the Hif family genes of vertebrates. This sentence might say “Invertebrates have only one Hif-1α gene, but flybase indicates four alternative transcripts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and there is further evidence for splice variants in the transcriptomes of other insect species.” You could revisit this in the discussion, and in so doing cover what for me is a weak point of the manuscript: is this splice variant unique to migratory locusts, orthoptera in general, or is it more broadly present in insects but heretofore overlooked? You show that in a supplementary figure but don’t discuss it.</p><p>L 69: &quot;associated with altered flight performance; this association suggests the possible involvement of Hif signaling in flight adaptation (Marden et al., 2013).” I think you should cite two followup studies (https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/221/6/jeb171009/246/Enzyme-polymorphism-oxygen-and-injury-a-lipidomic; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32895932/) that discuss oxidative damage, larval development, and additional aspects of flight in that species. Doing so will point readers to a broadly relevant set of studies that examine intermittent flight and ischemia reperfusion injury caused by repeatedly flying to fatigue. Making a distinction between migratory vs. intermittent fliers may stimulate important insights as work in this area progresses.</p><p>L. 76: &quot;make migratory flights on the Tibetan Plateau”. Please indicate an approximate or range of altitudes where this occurs.</p><p>L. 80-90: I like this preview summary of the results, but if editors insist on a length reduction, you could save this for the Results or Conclusion sections and instead say something brief, e.g. “Here we characterize two alternative splice variants of locust Hif-1a and test the hypothesis that they perform different roles in flight physiology and migratory ability.”</p><p>L. 101: &quot;On the basis of full-length transcriptome, two transcripts of Hif-1α were observed.” It is not obvious at this point or in the methods how this transcriptome was made (whole body? Flight muscle?) and if/where it is accessible by others.</p><p>L. 106: &quot;encoded protein lacked the C-TAD”. Extend this sentence by explaining what this domain does. This will inform the hypothesis that these isoforms have different functions.</p><p>L 106-109: You highlight the presence of similar splice variants in vertebrates but don’t mention other insects. Your supplementary figure showing this diversity is very nice and provides an overview of the diversity of Hif-1a splice variation, along with boxes that I think show presence/absence of Hif regulatory genes in the genome (figure legend show define those boxes unambiguously). Spend a sentence or two describing what you see across insects, and perhaps in the discussion, how well you think insects have been carefully surveyed for splice variants, and what your findings may imply for insects other than locusts.</p><p>L. 263: Not clear if &quot;In vertebrate&quot; is a typo referring to Invertebrates or is something that occurs &quot;in vertebrates&quot;.</p><p>L. 274: &quot;Therefore, Hif-1α2 was less sensitive to oxygen tension than Hif-1α1&quot;. Figure 1E indicates that Hif1a2 reaches higher levels in hypoxia, so it is arguably more sensitive to low oxygen tension (whereas your point is based on it starting from a higher baseline). To make this easier to understand, just say that“&quot;Hif1a2 had different oxygen sensitivity, being less inhibited by normoxia, and increasing to high levels in low oxygen&quot;</p><p>L 335-336: &quot;However, no such cellular hypoxia-adaptive responses were detected in the flight muscle during flight.&quot; Somewhere you should introduce the idea that the abundant tracheal system of locust flight muscle, and the relatively easy task of flying with weight support on a flight mill, may have kept the intracellular oxygen tension above the low level that triggers Hif-1a1 stability and canonical activation of hypoxia responsive genes. If you introduce that concept, it recognizes that there may be a role for Hif-1a1 in flight muscle that your experiments did not reveal, and helps form the hypothesis that Hif-1a2 has an earlier and graded activity, from a low level at normoxia and increasing as oxygen decreases, thereby protecting against oxidative damage at all levels of exertion rather than as an emergency response that may lag behind the damage.</p><p>L 355-356: &quot;On the other hand, our study provides a potential insecticide target for locust plague control.&quot; This is presented as an afterthought. Either omit, or if you think it is an important point, begin a new paragraph and develop the argument a bit more. For instance, do you envision this as an RNAi treatment? What would be the major challenges in targeting and minimizing off-target effects, both within locusts and in other insects that one would not want to damage.</p><p>Figure 5A: The oxidized DHE appears to be elevated in spaces between cells or groups of cells (myofibers). To my eye, those look like tracheae, and the red dots within fibers might be cross sections of tracheoles where they penetrate into cells. The authors may be stimulated to consider a coupled role of tracheae and muscle cells in sensing falling O2 concentration and functioning together to protect both cell types against oxidative damage. Due to their thin-walled and membranous nature, it seems possible that tracheae may be more sensitive to oxidative damage than muscle, or that muscle has high basal expression of a number of anti-oxidants but tracheae do not. The authors may wish to discuss such a scenario, and testable hypotheses that may emerge from this notion. Also, my copy has fairly low resolution images of these micrographs. The authors should make sure that their highest resolution images are published.</p><p>Figure 6 C: Competitor is misspelled.</p><p>Figure 6: Panels B: why are the these Hif genes labeled PC (which could be confused for &quot;positive control&quot;)?</p><p>Panel C: What are the SH and UB bands in panel C, and where in the figure is a shift evident?</p><p>Please provide a bit more information for people like me who aren’t familiar with the details of this type of gel shift assay.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although I am not a molecular biologist, I was impressed with the comprehensiveness of the work. My only main source of confusion was the link between Hif-1alpha2, the upregulation of glucose oxidation, and its role in facilitating prolonged flight. As you state later in the paper, locust flight is only initially powered by carbohydrate catabolism, and sustained locust flight is instead powered by lipid catabolism. I could be wrong, but I suspect that upregulation of glucose oxidation may rather help to augment the power output of initial flight, when locust metabolic requirements are greatest as they must power the requirements of ascent. Thereafter, locusts switch to lipid catabolism and more prolonged flight is also facilitated by the use of thermal currents and tail winds.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Despite the relatively high levels of Hif-1a2 in resting flight muscles, the authors have shown that Hif-1a2 is further induced after the long flight (30-60min), which would elevate the levels of Hif-1a2 target genes (Figure 2D). And given that loss of Hif-1a2 does not cause any flight defects in early time points (Figure 2E), it is assumed that an increase in the level of Hif-1a2 upon long flight is critical for its function and target genes. Thus, it would have been more appropriate to perform the transcriptome analysis (Figure 3A) after the long flight to better understand transcriptional targets of elevated Hif-1a2 during the flight. Current data may not reflect complete transcriptomic changes of flight muscles after the Hif-1a2 induction and would indicate targets of Hif-1a2 in resting states. As a minimum, the 12 differentially expressed genes need to be validated before and after the long flight and in the presence and absence of Hif-1a2 to better verify the expression and function of glucose metabolism genes and DJ-1.</p><p>2. In the same vein, 0-hour controls for dsHif-1a1 or dsHif-1a2 are missing in Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure 4, and Figure 6A. The authors need to clarify whether Hif-1a2 activates downstream targets in resting conditions compared to the long-term flight.</p><p>3. For the flight measurements in Figure 2E, the authors observed flight distance, duration, and speed up to 180 minutes for flight abilities, from which loss of Hif-1a2 showed phenotypes after 120 minutes. In Figure 4D and Figure 6E, the authors also measured the flight performance, but experiments do not seem to be identical to what is shown in Figure 2E, according to methods. The evaluation of flight performance in dsPyk or dsDJ-1 backgrounds needs to be identical to what is shown in Figure 2E as lack of energy would likely impact long flight behaviors. If it is a matter of graph formatting, the same format needs to be presented to directly compare phenotypes of different genotypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74554.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

A sustained flight throughout life can cause a higher mortality rate to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Magwere et al., 2006). Flight activity of honey bees directly leads to increased oxidative damage, which in turn detrimentally affects their flight performance and foraging ability (Margotta et al., 2018). Insects have evolved a series of adaptive strategies to cope with intermittent and migratory flight-induced oxidative stress. Glanville Fritillary butterflies carrying Sdhd M allele are associated with the activated Hif signalling, reduced metabolic rate, and larger tracheal volume in larvae, and these associations contribute to less oxidative injury in flight muscle and better flight performance during intermittent flight in adults (Marden et al., 2021; Pekny et al., 2018). Nectar feeding hawkmoths use their antioxidant stores during migratory flight and through PPP to produce an antioxidant potential to recover from oxidative damage during rest (Levin et al., 2017). While, the utilization of PPP was reported to be positively correlated with the activation of Hif pathway (Sadiku and Walmsley, 2019; Tokuda et al., 2019). Therefore, at the molecular level, the Hif pathway likely plays a central role in regulating redox homeostasis during insect flight.” (Line 321-335)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L. 76: &quot;make migratory flights on the Tibetan Plateau&quot;.

Spend a sentence or two describing what you see across insects, and perhaps in the discussion, how well you think insects have been carefully surveyed for splice variants, and what your findings may imply for insects other than locusts.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added definition of these HIF regulatory proteins in the figure legend. We’d like to follow the reviewer’s suggestion and added a description of this Figure as follows:</p><p>“Evolutionary analysis revealed that such Hif-1α splice form also exists in other Orthoptera (Accession no. ON137898 and ON137899 for Deracantha onos), some birds (e.g., XP_025006307.1 for Gallus gallus and XP_013038471.1 for Anser cygnoides domesticus), and human (NP_851397.1). Additionally, the TADs of Hif-α have varied distributions among insects. In incomplete metamorphosis insects and beetles, the Hif-α protein possesses two TADs (N-TAD and C-TAD), but in flies and moths the C-TAD and its inhibitor FIH are completely missing at the genomic level. Therefore, C-TAD-lacking Hif-1α transcripts, with distinct origins, seem to commonly exist in different insect taxa (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).” (Line 108-116)</p><p>We also added a discussion on this issue in Line 321-335.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L. 263: Not clear if &quot;In vertebrate&quot; is a typo referring to invertebrates or is something that occurs &quot;in vertebrates&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusing description.

If you introduce that concept, it recognizes that there may be a role for Hif-1a1 in flight muscle that your experiments did not reveal, and helps form the hypothesis that Hif-1a2 has an earlier and graded activity, from a low level at normoxia and increasing as oxygen decreases, thereby protecting against oxidative damage at all levels of exertion rather than as an emergency response that may lag behind the damage.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the insightful comments. Follow the reviewer’s suggestion, we have modified the statement in line 350 and discussed the effect of tracheal system on insect flight and compared the canonical and non-canonical role of Hif signalling in flight regulation:</p><p>“The two Hif-1α splices may coordinate their roles in long-lasting flight tasks. In locusts, the canonical role of Hif pathway is modulated by Hif-1α1, which regulates metabolic reprogramming and possibly controls tracheal growth under low oxygen tension. However, the abundant tracheal system of the locust flight muscle may keep the intracellular oxygen tension above the low level that triggers Hif-1α1 stability. Meanwhile, the relatively easy task of flying with weight support on a flight mill in the present study may render the role of Hif-1α1 in flight muscle undetectable. Nevertheless, when it comes to highly active tissue, Hif-1α1 may provide protective effects too late to prevent oxidative damage. Instead, Hif-1α2, which is expressed in normoxia and has a graded activity with decreasing oxygen, provides continuously variable expression of antioxidant genes so that protection is in place before the damage occurs. This is different from the way Hif-1α1 is typically activated only at very low oxygen tension. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, the similar transcript form of locust Hif-1α2 also exists in some other insect species and birds. Therefore, the Hif-1α2-mediated protective mechanism is possibly applicable to other flying animals, with the locust in this study as the first glimpse.” (Line 390-403)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L 355-356: &quot;On the other hand, our study provides a potential insecticide target for locust plague control.&quot; This is presented as an afterthought. Either omit, or if you think it is an important point, begin a new paragraph and develop the argument a bit more. For instance, do you envision this as an RNAi treatment?

To my eye, those look like tracheae, and the red dots within fibers might be cross sections of tracheoles where they penetrate into cells. The authors may be stimulated to consider a coupled role of tracheae and muscle cells in sensing falling O2 concentration and functioning together to protect both cell types against oxidative damage. Due to their thin-walled and membranous nature, it seems possible that tracheae may be more sensitive to oxidative damage than muscle, or that muscle has high basal expression of a number of anti-oxidants but tracheae do not. The authors may wish to discuss such a scenario, and testable hypotheses that may emerge from this notion. Also, my copy has fairly low resolution images of these micrographs. The authors should make sure that their highest resolution images are published.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s invaluable comments. DHE can cross intracellular membranes directly and, upon oxidation, becomes positively charged and accumulates in cells by intercalating into nucleus DNA. Muscle cells are the fusion of hundreds of myoblasts and their nuclei are pushed aside to the periphery of the myofiber below the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is more likely that in this figure the DHE signals are located in the nuclei and reflecting the ROS level of muscle cells. Here, the reviewer provided us an important information about the roles of tracheae in sensing O2 tension and protecting against oxidative damage. We have added a discussion on this issue in Line 378-389 as follows:</p><p>“Insects were the first animals capable of flying on the planet, and their respiratory system is the tracheal system. The tracheal supply to flight muscles is divided into three parts: primary tracheae, flattened tracheae and terminal tracheoles, among which the terminal tracheoles apply to the surfaces of the mitochondria and convey oxygen directly into the mitochondria (Wigglesworth and Lee, 1982). During flight, the tracheal system reaches its maximum functional requirements with little reserve capacity (Snelling et al., 2017; Snelling et al., 2012). Therefore, the tracheal volume and flight performance of insects are closely associated. In the larval stages, the tracheal system becomes oxygen-sensitive, and Hif pathway controls the growth of tracheal terminal branches toward oxygen-starved areas (Centanin et al., 2010; Henry and Harrison, 2004). The canonical role of the Hif pathway contributes to the ecological adaptation of Glanville Fritillary butterflies from genetically distinct clades (Marden et al., 2013; Marden et al., 2021; Pekny et al., 2018).”</p><p>Additionally, we have provided the high-resolution image of this figure in Figure 4A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 C: Competitor is misspelled.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, it has been revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: Panels B: why are the these Hif genes labeled PC (which could be confused for &quot;positive control&quot;)?</p><p>Panel C: What are the SH and UB bands in panel C, and where in the figure is a shift evident?</p><p>Please provide a bit more information for people like me who aren't familiar with the details of this type of gel shift assay.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments.

My only main source of confusion was the link between Hif-1alpha2, the upregulation of glucose oxidation, and its role in facilitating prolonged flight. As you state later in the paper, locust flight is only initially powered by carbohydrate catabolism, and sustained locust flight is instead powered by lipid catabolism. I could be wrong, but I suspect that upregulation of glucose oxidation may rather help to augment the power output of initial flight, when locust metabolic requirements are greatest as they must power the requirements of ascent. Thereafter, locusts switch to lipid catabolism and more prolonged flight is also facilitated by the use of thermal currents and tail winds.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s invaluable comments. We agree with the reviewer that upregulation of glucose oxidation mainly helps to augment the power output of initial flight and the prolonged flight of locusts is supported by lipid oxidation, thermal currents and tail winds. And our results are in line with the reviewer’s opinion. Actually the long distance migration of locust swarms is contributed by multiple environmental and physiological factors. In the aspect of physiological level, which this study mainly focused on, a prolonged flight requires not only a sufficient energy supplement but also a maintained redox homeostasis in myocytes. Hif-1α2 regulates expression of target genes involved in glucose metabolism and anti-oxidation, and we further found that regulatory role of Hif-1α2 on anti-oxidation, but not glucose metabolism, contributes to the sustained flight of locusts. To avoid any misunderstanding on this aspect, we have revised the description in Line 21 to read:</p><p>“Hif-1α2 regulates physiological processes involved in glucose metabolism and anti-oxidation during flight and sustains flight endurance by maintaining redox homeostasis through upregulating the production of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) quencher, DJ-1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Despite the relatively high levels of Hif-1a2 in resting flight muscles, the authors have shown that Hif-1a2 is further induced after the long flight (30-60min), which would elevate the levels of Hif-1a2 target genes (Figure 2D). And given that loss of Hif-1a2 does not cause any flight defects in early time points (Figure 2E), it is assumed that an increase in the level of Hif-1a2 upon long flight is critical for its function and target genes. Thus, it would have been more appropriate to perform the transcriptome analysis (Figure 3A) after the long flight to better understand transcriptional targets of elevated Hif-1a2 during the flight. Current data may not reflect complete transcriptomic changes of flight muscles after the Hif-1a2 induction and would indicate targets of Hif-1a2 in resting states. As a minimum, the 12 differentially expressed genes need to be validated before and after the long flight and in the presence and absence of Hif-1a2 to better verify the expression and function of glucose metabolism genes and DJ-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s invaluable comments. We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and added the experiments. We tested the 11 differentially expressed genes before and after the long flight, in which locusts were forced to fly for 60 min with the presence and absence of Hif-1α2. We have replaced the Figure 4B with a new one. Meanwhile, we deleted Supplementary Figure 4 and replaced Figure 6A with a new one because of result duplication in these figures. We have revised the results to read:</p><p>“Then the glycolytic gene expression was examined when the locusts were forced to fly for 60 min after the knockdown of <italic>Hif-1α1</italic> and <italic>Hif-1α2</italic>.

In the same vein, 0-hour controls for dsHif-1a1 or dsHif-1a2 are missing in Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure 4, and Figure 6A.

To avoid providing any misleading information again, we replaced them with new figures, i.e., Figure 4B and Figure 6A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For the flight measurements in Figure 2E, the authors observed flight distance, duration, and speed up to 180 minutes for flight abilities, from which loss of Hif-1a2 showed phenotypes after 120 minutes. In Figure 4D and Figure 6E, the authors also measured the flight performance, but experiments do not seem to be identical to what is shown in Figure 2E, according to methods. The evaluation of flight performance in dsPyk or dsDJ-1 backgrounds needs to be identical to what is shown in Figure 2E as lack of energy would likely impact long flight behaviors. If it is a matter of graph formatting, the same format needs to be presented to directly compare phenotypes of different genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments.
