Dynein meets a unique challenge in meiosis by moving chromosomes tethered to the nuclear envelope to facilitate homolog pairing essential for gametogenesis. Though processive dynein motility requires binding to an activating adaptor, the identity of the activating adaptor required for dynein to move meiotic chromosomes is unknown. We show that the meiosis-specific nuclear-envelope protein KASH5 is a dynein activating adaptor: KASH5 directly binds dynein using a mechanism conserved among activating adaptors and converts dynein into a processive motor. We map the dynein-binding surface of KASH5, identifying mutations that abrogate dynein binding in vitro and disrupt recruitment of the dynein machinery to the nuclear envelope in cultured cells and mouse spermatocytes in vivo. Our study identifies KASH5 as the first transmembrane dynein activating adaptor and provides molecular insights into how it activates dynein during meiosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic dynein 1</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>KASH5</kwd><kwd>EF-hand</kwd><kwd>LINC complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-GM127757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeSantis</surname><given-names>Morgan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM120094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandakumar</surname><given-names>Jayakrishnan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-17-037-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandakumar</surname><given-names>Jayakrishnan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StG-801659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shibuya</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-03426</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shibuya</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAW2019.0180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shibuya</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agrawal</surname><given-names>Ritvija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2142670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeSantis</surname><given-names>Morgan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KASH5 uses an EF-hand domain to directly interact with the light intermediate chain of dynein, promotes processive dynein motility, and facilitates dynein recruitment to the nuclear envelope during prophase I of meiosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is the primary retrograde, microtubule-associated molecular motor in most eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cianfrocco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schroer et al., 1989</xref>).

How cargo specificity is defined in different biological contexts and for myriad cargo is not well understood, but dynein activating adaptors likely play an important role in this regard. Perhaps some of the most unique cargos trafficked by dynein are chromosomes in prophase I of meiosis. Meiosis involves one round of DNA replication followed by two rounds of cell division to generate haploid gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). Crossover, which is the product of homologous recombination between homologous chromosomes in prophase I, ensures proper segregation of chromosomes and promotes genetic diversity. Dynein drives chromosomal movements to facilitate homolog pairing and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wynne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). These dynein-driven chromosomal movements increase the search space that homologous chromosomes explore in the nucleus to untangle mispaired nonhomologous chromosomes and facilitate proper pairing between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shibuya and Watanabe, 2014c</xref>).</p><p>The nuclear envelope (NE) is intact during prophase I, implying that dynein is separated from its cargo by two lipid bilayers (the inner nuclear membrane [INM] and outer nuclear membrane [ONM]) and the perinuclear space between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this context, dynein tethers to chromosomes via the highly conserved linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex at the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meier, 2016</xref>). The LINC complex consists of a SUN protein and a KASH protein that span the INM and ONM, respectively and bind each other in the perinuclear space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hieda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mammals encode multiple SUN and KASH proteins that bind to their LINC partner using highly conserved SUN and KASH domains, respectively. Cytosolic dynein immunoprecipitates with KASH5, a KASH protein that is expressed exclusively in prophase I of meiosis and essential for mouse fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2013</xref>). A short ~20 amino acid KASH peptide at the very C-terminus of KASH5 interacts with the SUN protein, SUN1, in the perinuclear space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and domain diagram of KASH5-FL in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Inside the nucleus, SUN1 binds telomeres at the ends of chromosomes, completing the attachment between dynein and the chromosomal cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2007</xref>). Despite being a process essential to meiosis progression and fertility, how dynein is activated to drive these movements across the NE remains unknown.</p><p>KASH5 protein consists of an N-terminal EF-hand pair followed by a CC domain, reminiscent of the domain architecture of EF-hand pair-containing dynein activating adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Here, we tested the hypothesis that KASH5 is a dynein activating adaptor that activates dynein specifically during prophase I of meiosis. We show that KASH5 binds dynein LIC in a manner comparable to other known dynein activating adaptors. Using human cell lysates and purified recombinant protein, we demonstrate that KASH5 is a bona fide activating adaptor that converts dynein and dynactin into a processive motile complex. We identify specific residues in the KASH5 EF-hand pair that mediate the interaction with dynein LIC and demonstrate that disruption of the KASH5-LIC interaction impairs dynein recruitment to the NE of both KASH5-transfected HeLa cells and mouse spermatocytes undergoing meiosis. Our findings establish KASH5 as a novel EF-hand pair-type activating adaptor, the first identified transmembrane (TM) dynein activating adaptor, and the dynein activator responsible for moving chromosomes in meiotic prophase I.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KASH5 binds dyneinâs LIC using a mechanism conserved in other activating adaptors</title><p>To determine the regions of KASH5 that promote binding to dynein and dynactin, we generated 3Ã-FLAG-tagged KASH5-FL (wild type [WT]) and domain deletion constructs lacking one or more of its domains, namely the TM domain, EF-hand pair-containing N-terminal domain (N), CC domain, and the unstructured region between its CC and TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and Methods).

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) data strongly suggest a direct interaction between KASH5 and dynein, but this has not been demonstrated with purified components.

We performed glutathione (GSH) bead pull-down of purified GST-fusions of human KASH5 N, CC, and NCC with full-length, untagged human dynein LIC1 (hereafter referred to as LIC). Consistent with co-IP analysis, KASH5 N and NCC, but not CC, bind directly to LIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To further explore the role that KASH5 dimerization plays in LIC binding, we performed SEC-MALS with two different constructs of KASH5-N: GST-KASH5-N and untagged KASH5-N. Both constructs contain KASH5âs EF-hand pair, but only GST-KASH5-N would dimerize through its GST tag. SEC-MALS confirmed that GST-KASH5-N is a dimer and untagged KASH5-N is a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Next, we incubated each construct with purified LIC. Both GST-KASH5-N and KASH5-N were capable of binding LIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The experimentally determined mass of the complex formed between KASH5-N and LIC was ~10 kDa lower than the theoretical mass for a 1:1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This lower apparent molecular weight could indicate either partial dissociation of the complex during SEC analysis or partial overlap between the peak of the 1:1 complex and excess LIC in the mixture. To ensure that the observed stoichiometry was not limited by the concentration of the proteins, we repeated the SEC-MALS analysis of the LIC-KASH5-N mixture at threefold higher concentration of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Increased protein concentration did not alter the ~1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast to KASH5-N and consistent with what we observed with KASH5-NCC, GST-KASH5-N bound with 2:1 stoichiometry, confirming that dimerization of an EF-hand is not accompanied by association of a second LIC polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

Finally, we used ITC to test if the EF-hand pair of KASH5 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Observed processive motility would indicate that KASH5 co-precipitated the activated dynein complex. Robust motility was observed with the positive control (GFP-BicD2-FLAG), while very little motility was observed with the negative control (GFP-FLAG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref>).

Dynein associated with GFP-KASH5-ÎTM-FLAG, GFP-KASH5-NCC-FLAG, and GFP-BicD2-FLAG all moved at velocities ~0.5 Âµm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, BicD2 immunoprecipitates displayed slightly enhanced run lengths, processivity, and landing rate compared to either KASH5 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Although the significance of the differences between BicD2- and KASH5-dependent dynein motility is unclear, it may reflect the different biological contexts the two proteins function in.

Dynein was labeled with either tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) or Alexa-647 via the SNAP tag in all experiments. In experiments where dynein was labeled with Alexa-647, we labeled KASH5 with TMR via the Halo tag.

We reasoned that the reconstitutions with purified proteins were missing a dynein regulatory factor that promotes activity. Lis1 increases the velocity of dynein-dynactin-activating adaptor motility by promoting dynein conformations that drive association with dynactin and an activating adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumbach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>).

We transfected these cells with vehicle, SUN1-myc only, or SUN1-myc plus various FLAG-KASH5 constructs to assess if KASH5 can relocalize dynein to the NE. Importantly, there is no endogenous KASH5 in HeLa cells because its expression is limited to prophase I of meiosis. Though there is endogenous SUN1 in HeLa cells, we observed more robust localization of transfected FLAG-KASH5-FL to the nuclear periphery when we co-transfected SUN1-myc (data not shown). We reason that the extent of KASH5 localization at the NE is limited by the SUN1 level, which is sub-stoichiometric to FLAG-KASH5-FL unless co-transfected with it.</p><p>As expected, GFP-dynein was relatively diffuse throughout the cytoplasm with no distinct nuclear signal in cells when neither SUN1 nor KASH5 was transiently transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We hypothesized that exogenous expression of dynein-binding-deficient mutants of KASH5 would outcompete endogenous KASH5 at the NE to reduce dynein recruitment to telomeres in mouse spermatocytes. To test this, we electroporated mouse KASH5 mutant proteins, L147D, F167D, and M171D (corresponding to L77D, F97D, and M101D in human KASH5, respectively) as GFP fusions into WT murine spermatocytes. Full-length KASH5 and all three mutants localize to meiotic telomeres, confirming that the mutations do not perturb binding of KASH5 to SUN1 or SUN1 to the telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the staining of endogenous dynactin subunit p150 at telomeres was significantly decreased in spermatocytes expressing GFP-KASH5<sup>L147D</sup> (the telomere-localized p150 signal intensity in the mutant-expressing cells was 73% that of cells not expressing any GFP-tagged protein), suggesting that a single mutation in the KASH5-dynein interface is sufficient to disrupt the localization of the dynein transport machinery in a dominant fashion in WT spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The GFP-KASH5<sup>F167D</sup> and GFP-KASH5<sup>M171D</sup> mutants did not cause dominant phenotypes, although they are expressed (as assessed by western blot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and enriched at telomeres (as assessed by GFP foci intensity at telomeres; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) to the same extent at GFP-tagged KASH5 WT and L147D proteins. The severity of the mutations in vivo is consistent with human KASH5-FL<sup>L77D</sup> being the only mutant that reduced dynein and enriched KASH5 localization at the NE in HeLa cells in a statistically significant manner. To ask if the in vivo phenotypes could be enhanced by combining mutations, we generated a double mutant F167D-M171D and a triple mutant L147D-F167D-M171D. Both constructs are expressed at similar levels to GFP-KASH5 and localize to telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

The milder phenotype in vivo may be attributed to the presence of endogenous KASH5 that could homodimerize with itself or with exogenous mutant KASH5 to confer dynein binding (see Discussion for other possibilities).

We tested the hypothesis that KASH5 is a novel dynein activating adaptor based on its domain composition and ability to co-immunoprecipitate with dynein. Our data show that not only does KASH5âs EF-hand pair bind to dynein like other activating adaptors via binding to LICâs helix 1 but also KASH5 is a bona fide activating adaptor that converts dynein and dynactin into a processive complex. We show that the interaction with KASH5 promotes dynein localization to the NE in cell culture and mouse spermatocytes. Single mutations at the KASH-dynein interface abrogate this process, highlighting the importance of this binding event in vivo. Together, our data firmly place KASH5 within the family of dynein activating adaptors and highlight how dynein is localized and activated during prophase I of meiosis.</p><p>KASH5 is unique among known activating adaptors for several reasons. First, it is the first known TM domain-containing activating adaptor. Other activating adaptors that link dynein to membranous cargos do so via a receptor protein (e.g. Rabs) associated with the cargo lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horgan and McCaffrey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordens et al., 2005</xref>). Second, KASH5 is the first known activating adaptor in the KASH (or Nesprin) family of SUN-binding proteins. Other KASH proteins, like KASH2 (also called Nesprin-2), promote dynein localization to the nucleus during nuclear migration by engaging activating adaptors like BicD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GonÃ§alves et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). KASH5 directly binds dynein to form an activated dynein complex at the NE. Third, KASH5 is the only known meiosis-specific activating adaptor, consistent with the unique cargo it moves. Mammalian telomeres are generally dispersed in the nucleoplasm at steady-state in all somatic and germ cells, except in spermatocytes (or oocytes) undergoing meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shibuya and Watanabe, 2014c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). Homologous chromosome pairing in prophase I of meiosis requires the relocalization of all telomeres to the NE of spermatocytes to connect chromosomes to cytosolic dynein. Although much is known about how prophase I-specific telomere-NE attachment is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pendlebury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shibuya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shibuya et al., 2014a</xref>), how dynein is activated to move dynein-tethered chromosomes was not well understood. Our findings fill this gap by revealing KASH5 as the activating adaptor for chromosome motility in prophase I.</p><p>Our data show that KASH5 and other known dynein activating adaptors share a structural mechanism for recognizing dynein LIC. Interestingly, our SEC-MALS data support a model where the two copies of KASH5 EF-hand pairs from one KASH5 homodimer interact with one LIC polypeptide. We reproduced this result at higher protein concentrations (~10-fold above the K<sub>d</sub> of the KASH5 NCC-LIC complex) and in the presence of an excess in LIC, suggesting that the sub-stoichiometric amount of LIC in the complex is not a result of incomplete binding. This stoichiometry is different than what has been captured in LIC helix 1 peptide-bound crystal structures of LIC-binding domains of HOOK3 and CRACR2A, which reveal a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). However, the HOOK3 HOOK-LIC helix 1 (PDB: 6BPH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) and the CRACR2A EF-hand pair-LIC helix 1(PDB: 6PSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) structures were solved in the context of the N-terminal activating adaptor domains that lack the downstream CC responsible for homodimerization. It is possible that the absence of dimerization may have prevented the capture of the 2:1 stoichiometry of the activator-LIC helix complex in these structures. Interestingly, BicD2 uses a dimeric N-terminal CC-box to bind LIC. The structure of the BicD2 N-terminal CC with the LIC helix 1 (PDB: 6PSE) shows binding of two BicD2 CC helices to a single LIC helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>); however, it was suggested that crystal packing may have prevented the binding of the second LIC helix to the BicD2 dimer. Indeed, a 2:2 BicD2-LIC helix interaction was inferred from ITC experiments in the same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). A major difference between these binding analyses and our SEC-MALS experiments is the use of the LIC helix-1 peptide versus full-length LIC, respectively. In this regard, a recent preprint describes a cryo-EM reconstitution of the dynein-dynactin complex including full-length LIC with another BicD family activator, BICDR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaaban and Carter, 2022</xref>). This study captured two BICDR1 homodimers bound to the dimeric dynein complex. While evidence from the EM maps for binding of the first LIC molecule was clear, density for the second LIC was either less resolved (for BICDR-A homodimer) or absent (for BICDR-B homodimer). Together, these results suggest that although there are two binding sites for a standalone LIC helix on dimeric activating adaptors, binding of the first full-length LIC could affect the affinity/accessibility of the second LIC polypeptide for its binding site on an activating adaptor. High-resolution structures that capture full-length LIC (and the remainder of dynein-dynactin) and dimeric activating adaptors will likely resolve these apparent differences and help determine the native stoichiometries of dynein and its activating adaptors. Determining these quaternary structural states will bear important implications for dynein velocity and force generation.</p><p>While the dimeric structure of KASH5 is consistent with its role as a dynein activating adaptor, it raises interesting questions about SUN1-KASH5 quaternary structure and its implications for chromosome motility. SUN proteins are known to trimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). This creates a potential stoichiometry mismatch between SUN1 and KASH5 that can promote higher-order quaternary structures. A recent study demonstrated that binding to KASH peptides (from KASH1, KASH4, and KASH5) induces two SUN1 trimers to bind head-to-head to form a 6:6 SUN-KASH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gurusaran and Davies, 2021</xref>). As the KASH peptide is a short (~20 aa long) monomeric region, it remains to be determined how the SUN1-KASH5 stoichiometry is affected by KASH5 dimerization. It is possible that the 6:6 geometry is retained in the native (i.e. full length) SUN1-KASH5 complex at the NE or that other higher-order structures containing multiples of SUN1 trimers and KASH5 dimers are formed in vivo. These higher-order structures might facilitate the recruitment of multiple dynein motors and the generation of large forces needed to move chromosomes across the NE.</p><p>IP-motility experiments revealed that KASH5 generated activated dynein complexes with a velocity comparable to the well-characterized activating adaptor, BicD2. However, when we reconstituted dynein-dynactin-KASH5 motility in vitro, the activated dynein complex formed less robustly and generated complexes that moved with a significantly slower velocity unless Lis1 was present. This result suggests that Lis1 is key to forming the activated dynein-dynactin-KASH5 complexes. Furthermore, our studies suggest that Lis1 is involved in dyneinâs meiosis-specific function, providing new insights into an understudied area of dynein research.</p><p>We engineered nine mutations in KASH5 at the putative binding interface for helix 1 of dynein LIC. These mutants had varying effects on dynein binding with some only moderately affecting the binding between KASH5 and dynein, while others nearly abolished binding. Surprisingly, we found that the velocity of the immunoprecipitated dynein-dynactin-KASH5 complexes was comparable for all the mutants tested, regardless of their ability to bind KASH5. This result suggests that binding between activating adaptors and dynein LIC promotes the formation of the dynein-dynactin-activator complex but does not affect the velocity of the activated complex. These observations could imply that the interaction between activating adaptors and LIC might not have a role in dynein function after the activated dynein complex is formed, although this needs to be explored further for KASH5 and other known activating adaptors.</p><p>Our results confirm that KASH5âs TM domain is required for robust nuclear localization of KASH5 and recruitment of dynein there, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, KASH5 localization at the NE is dependent on SUN1 but independent of dynein binding, suggesting that it could occur before, or concomitant with, dynein recruitment to the NE in meiotic prophase I. It will be important to determine how KASH5 competes with other cytosolic dynein activators such as BicD2 in prophase I. This may be established with either downregulation of other activating adaptors in prophase I or involvement of germline-specific dynein subunit modifications that bias specificity toward KASH5. Finally, it is impressive that a single mutation at the interface between KASH5âs EF-hand domain and dyneinâs LIC is sufficient to prevent dynein localization to the outer nuclear membrane both in HeLa cells and mouse spermatocytes transiently expressing KASH5 protein. The milder phenotype in mouse spermatocytes may be ascribed to the presence of endogenous KASH5 in these cells that can mask the mutant phenotype as already mentioned. Alternatively, or in addition, meiosis-specific proteins, protein isoforms, and post-translational modifications in dynein may partly compensate for the weakened NCC-LIC interaction. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that contributions of the EF-hand residues may be different in human versus mouse cells, potentially underlying a previously uncharacterized species-specificity for dynein activation in meiosis. In this regard, mouse KASH5 harbors a 70 amino acid N-terminal extension absent in other mammalian homologs, including human KASH5, and whose significance remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, our data underline the importance of the KASH5-dynein interaction for coupling telomeres to the cytoskeletal machinery in prophase I of meiosis, a prerequisite for meiotic progression and mammalian fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, plasmid construction, and mutagenesis</title><p>KASH5 constructs used in this study: FL encoded full-length human KASH5, aa 1â562; ÎTM substitutes the TM domain aa 522â542 with a six aa gly-ser linker; ÎNÎTM deletes aa 1â155 in the context of ÎTM; NCC encodes aa 1â349; CC encodes aa 156â349; and N encodes aa 1â155.

Dynein-dynactin-KASH5 complexes were then incubated with Lis1 or GF150 supplemented with 10% glycerol (to buffer match for experiments without Lis1) for 10 min on ice. The mixtures of dynein, dynactin, KASH5, and Lis1 were then mixed with energy buffer and an oxygen scavenger system and flowed into the flow chamber assembled with taxol-stabilized microtubules. The final imaging buffer consisted of 28.75 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 37.5 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.75 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 15 ÂµM Taxol, 0.75 mg/ml casein, 71.5 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mg/ml glucose catalase, 1.2 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.4% glucose, and 2.5 mM Mg-ATP. The final concentration of dynein in the flow chamber was 0.5â1 pM. The final concentration of Lis1 was 50 nM. Microtubules were imaged first by taking a single-frame snapshot. Dynein and/or KASH5-labeled with fluorophores (TMR, Alexa647, or Alexa488) were imaged every 300ms for 3 min. At the end of acquisition, microtubules another snapshot was taken of the microtubule channel to assess stage drift. Movies showing significant drift were not analyzed. Each sample was imaged for less than 10 min. Two biological replicates were performed, defined as two different dynein purifications. Three technical replicates were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Single-molecule motility assay analysis</title><p>Kymographs were generated from motility movies, and dynein velocity and run length were calculated from kymographs using custom ImageJ macros as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). Only runs longer than four frames (1.2 s) were included in the analysis. Bright protein aggregates, which were less than 5% of the population, were excluded. Velocity was reported for individual dynein complexes. The landing rate was reported per field of view by dividing the total number of events analyzed for that field of view by the sum of the length of microtubules analyzed in the field of view multiplied by the length of the movie in minutes and the concentration of dynein used in that experimental condition (only for the TIRF experiments with purified components). Percent processive events was reported per field of view by dividing the number of processive events on the microtubules analyzed per field of view by the total number of processive, diffusive, and immotile events. Data plotting and statistical analyses were performed in Prism9 (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>IF assay in HeLa cells</title><p>HeLa cells containing a stably integrated copy of dynein HC with a C-terminal GFP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poser et al., 2008</xref>) were seeded in 6-well dishes at 10% confluency. After overnight incubation, DMEM media was removed and replaced with pre-warmed DMEM transfection media (with 10% FBS, but no Pen/Strep). Cells at ~20% confluency were then transfected with 0.5 Âµg of the SUN1-myc and FLAG-KASH5 (FL, ÎTM, or mutant FL) constructs using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Gibco). Coverslips were washed in 100% ethanol, dried under UV light, and coated with 1Ã Poly-D-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 25 min at 37Â°C. 24 hr post-transfection, the transfected HeLa cells were recovered from the 6-well dishes with trypsin (Gibco), centrifuged, resuspended, and replated on prepared coverslips at 15% confluency, which were then allowed to acclimate overnight at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 15 min at RT and washed twice with 1Ã PBS. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in a blocking/permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton X-100% and 5% normal goat serum [Fisher Scientific] in 1Ã PBS) for 1 hr at RT and washed quickly with 1Ã PBS. Primary antibodies, chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam #ab13970), mouse anti-myc (1:500, Cell Signaling Technologies #9811), and rabbit anti-FLAG (1:166, ECS, Bethyl #A190-102A), were diluted in an antibody dilution buffer (0.1% Triton X-100% and 0.5% BSA, Sigma-Aldrich in 1Ã PBS). 60 Âµl of the diluted antibodies were placed on a sheet of parafilm, and the coverslips were gently flipped onto the drops and left to incubate for 2 hr at RT. The coverslips were returned to the 6-well dish and washed three times with 1Ã PBS before incubating them with secondary antibodies diluted in the antibody dilution buffer for 1 hr at RT in the dark. The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-chicken 488 (1:1000, Abcam #ab150173), anti-mouse 555 (1:500, Invitrogen #A11004), and anti-rabbit 647 (1:500, Invitrogen #A21244). After a 1Ã PBS wash step, the cells were then incubated with DAPI (1 Âµg/ml, Thermo Fisher) for 5 min to stain for the nucleus and washed four times with 1Ã PBS. Finally, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Prolong Gold antifade mounting media (Thermo Cat# P36934) and cured in the dark for at least 24 hr. Slides were imaged with an inverted microscope (Nikon, Ti2-E) with a 60 Ã 1.49 objective (Nikon, Apo) and an X1 Spinning Disk (Yokogawa). The microscope had a LUNF-XL laser launch (Nikon), with a 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm laser lines, and a Piezo stage (Prior). The excitation path was filtered using an appropriate quad bandpass filter cube (Chroma). The emission path was filtered through appropriate filters located in a high-speed filter wheel (Finger Lakes Instrumentation). Emitted signals were detected on a Prime 95B CMOS camera (Photometrics). Image acquisition was controlled by NIS Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon). The top and bottom of each field of view were determined by the DAPI signal, and 0.2 Âµm thick slices were acquired to image the entire volume. All images were acquired quantitatively with the same laser settings across experiments. Two biological replicates were performed, defined as two separate transfections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>IF analysis in HeLa</title><p>Analysis was performed in FIJI using custom macros. Max projections of all channels were created, and the nuclei channel threshold was set to create regions of interest (ROI) around the nucleus. Only cells that were almost entirely in the field of view were analyzed. Cell boundaries were traced manually using the dynein channel as a marker for the cytoplasmic area. The nuclear values of dynein and KASH5 were defined as the mean gray value for a band of 1 Âµm on either side of the nuclear ROI in the respective channel. The cytoplasmic values were defined by mean gray value for the cell boundary minus the nuclear ROI expanded by 1 Âµm. Cells were not considered if the KASH5 mean gray value was less than 250 for cells expressing a nuclear-targeted KASH5, or if the mean gray value of SUN1 was less than 200 for cells expressing only SUN1 or KASH5-ÎTM. Cells that were transfected with KASH5-ÎTM were also only considered if they had KASH5 mean gray values for the whole cell of at least 220. All of these values were determined empirically. Data plotting and statistical analyses were performed in Prism9 (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mice</title><p>WT mice were congenic with the C57BL/6 J background.

After 10 min, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in a 1:2 mixture of PBS and 100 mM sucrose. A total of 20 Âµl of fixation buffer (1% paraformaldehyde, 0.15% Triton X-100, and 1 mM sodium borate [pH 9.2 adjusted by NaOH]) was applied to a glass slide, and 3 Âµl of the cell suspension was added to the drop, allowed to fix for 1 hr at room temperature, and air-dried. For immunostaining, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS containing 5% BSA for 2 hr and then with Alexa Fluor 488-, 594-, or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution, Invitrogen) for 1 hr at room temperature. The slides were washed with PBS and mounted with VECTASHIELD medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Exogenous protein expression in the testis</title><p>Plasmid DNA was electroporated into live mouse testes by in vivo electroporation technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shibuya et al., 2014b</xref>). Briefly, male mice at PD16â30 were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and the testes were pulled from the abdominal cavity. Plasmid DNA (10 Âµl of 5 Âµg/Âµl solution) was injected into each testis using glass capillaries under a stereomicroscope (M165C; Leica). Testes were held between a pair of tweezers-type electrodes (CUY21; BEX), and electric pulses were applied four times and again four times in the reverse direction at 35 V for 50 ms for each pulse. The testes were then returned to the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal wall and skin were closed with sutures. The testes were removed 24 hr after the electroporation, and immunostaining was performed. Z-stacks of each image were acquired with a 0.45 Âµm step size. Signal quantifications were performed with projections of Z-stack images. Signal intensities were measured using the softWoRx Data Inspector tool (Delta Vision). Telomeric regions were defined as the end of the SYCP3 signals. The neighboring background signals were measured for each data point and subtracted before quantification of intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Antibodies for mouse spermatocyte studies</title><p>The following antibodies were used: mouse antibodies against Î²-actin (Sigma; A2228-100UL), rabbit antibodies against GFP (Invitrogen; A11122), goat antibodies against p150 (abcam; ab11806), and chicken antibody against SYCP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Homology modeling</title><p>The close conservation of the EF-hand pair sequences of CRACR2A and KASH5 allowed us to build a homology model of the KASH5 EF-hand pair-dynein LIC helix 1 complex.

dynein-1 transport machinery at the nuclear envelope. In prophase I of meiosis, dynein moves chromosomes tethered to the nuclear envelope to expedite the search and pairing between homologous chromosomes. Previous studies have shown that dynein tethers to chromosomes via the LINC complex, which consists of a SUN protein and transmembrane KASH protein. KASH5 comprises all the known features of bona fide cargo adaptors of dynein, and this manuscript demonstrated that KASH5 directly binds dynein and activates its processive motility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78201.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01an7q238</institution-id><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01an7q238</institution-id><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>McKenney</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05rrcem69</institution-id><institution>University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.11.483947">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.11.483947v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ahmet Yildiz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard J McKenney (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness of the paper is the somewhat mild phenotype observed in mouse spermatocytes expressing KASH5 mutants. As is, conclusions drawn from these experiments are not well justified and require additional experiments. While these same mutants had stronger phenotypes in non-meiotic cells, it is unclear why the phenotypes are milder in the biologically relevant cell type. The authors' explanation of endogenous wild-type KASH5 blunting these effects seems plausible, but this needs to be tested with siRNA knockdown of endogenous KASH5 while expressing the mutant protein with missense mutations. The panel also recommends the authors try combining point mutations into a single construct, which may have stronger effects on dynein binding or titration of expression to higher levels to outcompete the endogenous KASH5 protein.</p><p>2) The authors should quantify the motor run lengths, run frequencies, and the fraction of processive vs. diffusive motors in single-molecule motility assays. A visual inspection of the kymographs implies that the run lengths are substantially longer in the purified reconstituted system compared to the assays performed in cell extracts. Is this the case? The authors also claim that mutant versions exhibit very few processive runs, but the subsequent motility has the same velocity as WT. The analysis of the run frequency (the number of processive runs per micron length of a microtubule per second per Î¼M motor/adaptor) would be needed to support this conclusion.</p><p>3) The authors should expand their discussion on the 2:1 stoichiometry of the KASH5-LIC complex. The SUN-Nesprin complexes are typically represented as trimers, and it is unclear how a trimeric complex of SUN1-KASH5 might interact with the dimeric dynein complex. The authors mention a prior study that found a similar stoichiometry in the crystal structure for the well-studied adapter proteins BicD2 and LIC1 (Lee et al. Nat. Comm. 2020). However, that study presented evidence that the 2:1 stoichiometry observed in the crystal was likely a crystal packing artifact and that BicD2 bound to two LIC1 peptides in solution. This is something the authors of the current manuscript should mention and clarify in their discussion of these results. More recently, Chaaban et al. biorXiv 2021 has shown cryo-EM evidence that the dynein dynactin complex recruits two BicDR1 adaptors. This new result might also be relevant in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors perform a series of biochemical, biophysical, and cell biology assays to establish that KASH6 is an activator adaptor of dynein and it directly recruits dynein to the nuclear envelope. They showed that the N-terminal EF-hand domain interacts with the Light Intermediate Chain of dynein 1 at 2:1 stoichiometry and mutagenesis of the well-conserved phenylalanine residues in LIC disrupts this interaction. in vitro motility assays using cell extracts or purified proteins conclusively revealed that KASH5 is an activator adaptor of dynein. Importantly, the mutations that disrupt EF-LIC interactions reduce the frequency of processive runs, but not the speed, indicating that this interaction is important for the assembly and activation of the complex, but not required for subsequent motility. Studies in cells showed that mutations that disrupt EF-LIC interactions also reduced the recruitment of dynein to the nuclear envelope of HeLa cells, and the localization of the dynein transport machinery to telomeres across the nuclear envelope in murine spermatocytes.</p><p>Overall, the work is well done, straightforward and convincing. KASH5 is the first transmembrane dynein activating adaptor verified by in vitro motility assays. While the results are not particularly surprising, the work will be important to the researchers who study dynein, cargo transport, and meiosis, and broadly interesting to the cell biology and biophysics readership in general. I support the publication of this work in <italic>eLife</italic> provided that the authors can address the concerns I list below.</p><p>As is, the results presented in Figure 6 do not present a strong case of reduced localization of dynein to telomeres across the nuclear envelope when a point mutant is introduced to the EF-hand of KASH5. The authors list several reasonable possibilities to explain why they do not see a major dominant-negative effect when mutated KASH5 is overexpressed in these cells. Is it possible to knock down endogenous KASH5 with siRNA and overexpress KASH5 mutants that carry missense mutations to avoid RNAi silencing? The authors can also introduce double or triple mutants into the EF-hand to aim for a more significant effect as a single mutation may not be sufficient to fully disrupt EF-LIC interaction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very nice paper! I would recommend dropping the &quot;gold standard&quot; language from your work. This language has been pushed by Sam Reck-Peterson's lab for a few years, but I am unaware of anyone else in the field using it. Further, it is unclear to me why recombinant dynein should represent any type of &quot;gold standard&quot; for assays in the field. I understand that recombinant dynein seems more 'pure' than proteins pulled out of lysates, but have the authors considered if recombinant dynein is appropriately post translationally modified, as similar endogenous dynein? More importantly, the &quot;gold standard&quot; language implies that other assays that don't use recombinant dynein do not meet such a standard. Is this the case? Can the authors provide any examples from the literature whereby an assay that did not meet the &quot;gold standard&quot; provided inaccurate results to the field? Should labs that do not have the resources to produce recombinant dynein be dissuaded from experimentation in the field since they would not meet this arbitrary &quot;gold standard&quot;? I think the label is whimsical and exclusionary for the field and suggest the authors reconsider including it.</p><p>It is particularly ironic to use in this case, since the authors provide direct evidence here that the &quot;gold standard&quot; assay does NOT result in the same performance as that of motor complexes pulled out of lysates until they also include another component in the assay: LIS1. The take-home here is that &quot;gold standard&quot; assays comprised of purified components are only golden until future researchers realize which component(s) may have been missing from the assay. I recall when the &quot;gold standard&quot; force production for dynein was 1 pN, until everyone finally realized that they were assaying autoinhibited dynein.

In Figure 6, we employ a highly specialized in vivo electroporation technique for introducing recombinant DNA into the testes of live mice that we have previously described (Shibuya et al., <italic>PLoS Genet,</italic> 2014 and Shibuya and Watanabe, <italic>Methods Cell. Biol,</italic> 2018). The technique is applicable for the overexpression of exogenous proteins (using cDNA) in live mice testes but not suitable for gene knockdown. The knockdown experiment in mammalian meiotic prophase cells is technically challenging because the long-term in vitro culture of mammalian meiocytes is not feasible and experiments need to be conducted within the tissue context in live mice. To our knowledge, there is only one paper where authors performed siRNA injection into live mouse testes to achieve knockdown (Dai et al., <italic>Cell Rep</italic>, 2017). However, the method has not been used in any follow-up study and we have not had success with it either, suggesting that it is not a practical avenue for knock down of genes in meiotic cells. Instead, and as described later, we believe a full gene knockout is more feasible.</p><p>As suggested by the Reviewers, we have overexpressed the double (F167D/M171D) and triple (L147D/F167D/M171D) mutants in WT testis by in vivo electroporation (new Figure 6- supplement). The mutant proteins were comparably expressed as the WT protein seen by the Western blot (Figure 6- supplement A). The expression of double (F167D/M171D) mutant did not affect the localization of endogenous p150, while the expression of the triple mutant dominantly impaired the localization of p150 to the same extent as the L147D single mutant (Figure 6-supplement B,C). These data suggest that L147, but not F157 or M171, is critical for the dynein interaction in a mouse meiosis-context, at least in our experimental system. The difference in the extent of the in vitro (using human KASH5 protein) and in vivo (using mouse KASH5 protein) phenotypes could be caused by multiple factors. First, key residues that mediate interaction between LIC and KASH5 may be species specific. While these residues are conserved in mice, mouse KASH5 has an extended N-terminus compared to the human (or other mammalian) KASH5 homologs. Additionally, as mentioned in the manuscript, the presence of endogenous KASH5 may hinder the dominant negative effects of F157D, M171D, or their double mutant.</p><p>To further explore the physiological significance of KASH5-dynein binding, we will perform the gene-complementation analysis of the KASH5 mutant proteins in <italic>Kash5</italic> knockout mouse testes, where the endogenous KASH5 is absent. Further, the generation of knock-in mice harboring the L147D, F157D, and M171D point mutations in the endogenous <italic>Kash5</italic> locus will be most informative to address the significance of these mutations in vivo. While we do not have these necessary mouse models (KASH5 knock out or knock-in mice) at this point, we are generating these mice for follow-up studies that are beyond the timeframe and the overall scope of the current manuscript. Finally, we would like to point out that human KASH5 L77D/mouse KASH5 L147D was the only mutation that showed statistically significant phenotypes in both HeLa cell localization assays and in mouse spermatocytes. Specifically, KASH5 L77D was more enriched at the nuclear envelope and recruited less dynein there compared to the wild type protein; the other two mutants showed statistically significant effects in either dynein or KASH5 localization at the nuclear envelope, but not both (Figure 5B and C). Thus, although all three mutations seem to impact dynein binding in vitro, only human KASH5 L77D/mouse KASH5 L147D showed robust localization phenotypes inside human and mouse cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should quantify the motor run lengths, run frequencies, and the fraction of processive vs. diffusive motors in single-molecule motility assays.

The analysis of the run frequency (the number of processive runs per micron length of a microtubule per second per Î¼M motor/adaptor) would be needed to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Editor and Reviewers for the suggestion to perform further analysis of our dynein motility data. We have now included run length, percent processivity, and run frequency (i.e. landing rate) analysis for all of the single molecule data in Figures 3 and 4 (now shown in Figure 3, 4 and Figure 3-supplement 1 and Figure 4-supplement). The additional analysis has helped further contrast the three defective mutations of KASH5 from the remaining mutants and wild type.</p><p>Depending on the comparison made, the run lengths are not necessarily longer in the pure protein TIRF experiments compared to the IP motility experiments. For example, the pure protein dynein-dynactin-KASH5-ÎTM had a median run length of 3.562 Âµm, while the IP-TIRF for KASH5-ÎTM had a median run length of 3.2 Âµm. The run length for the pure protein experiment with Lis1 included did have a longer run length than the IP-TIRF, with a median value of 4.431 Âµm. It is difficult to make a meaningful comparison in run lengths between these two types of experiments because they are performed in different buffers. Notably, IP-motility is performed in a final buffer that contains 0.0025% Triton X-100 and 12.5 mM KOAc, while pure protein motility is performed in a buffer containing 37.5 mM KCl and no Triton X-100.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should expand their discussion on the 2:1 stoichiometry of the KASH5-LIC complex. The SUN-Nesprin complexes are typically represented as trimers, and it is unclear how a trimeric complex of SUN1-KASH5 might interact with the dimeric dynein complex.

This new result might also be relevant in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewerâs comment about the need to place our stoichiometry findings in the context of what is known for dynein and SUN-KASH complexes and detail what the physiological implications of our observations are. First, we repeated our SEC-MALS experiment with KASH5 NCC and LIC at a high concentration (~100 Î¼M; limit of loading capacity of size-exclusion column), far above that of the K<sub>d</sub> of their interaction (new data shown in Figure 2- supplement). Despite have a stoichiometric excess of LIC in the mixture analyzed, we observed a stoichiometry of 2:1, as we reported in the first submission. Thus, at least under the conditions of our SEC-MALS experiments, the ratio of KASH5 NCC:LIC is 2:1. In response to the reviewerâs request to expand on the discussion of dynein-adaptor stoichiometry as well as SUN1-KASH5 stoichiometry, we have added the following paragraphs to our revised manuscript, starting at line 376:</p><p>âOur data show that KASH5 and other known dynein activating adaptors share a structural mechanism for recognizing dynein LIC. Interestingly, our SEC-MALS data support a model where the two copies of KASH5 EF-hand pairs from one KASH5 homodimer interact with one LIC helix. We reproduced this result at higher protein concentrations (~10-fold above the Kd of the KASH5 NCC-LIC complex) and in the presence of an excess in LIC, suggesting that the sub-stoichiometric amount of LIC in the complex is not a result of incomplete binding. This stoichiometry is different than what has been captured in LIC helix 1 peptide-bound crystal structures of LIC-binding domains of HOOK3 and CRACR2A, which reveal a 1:1 stoichiometry (15,16). However, the HOOK3 HOOK-LIC helix 1 (PDB: 6BPH)(15) and the CRACR2A EF-hand pair-LIC helix 1(PDB: 6PSD) (16) structures were solved in the context of the N-terminal activating adaptor domains that lack the downstream CC responsible for homodimerization. It is possible that the absence of dimerization may have prevented the capture of the 2:1 stoichiometry of the activator-LIC helix complex in these structures. Interestingly, BicD2 uses a dimeric N-terminal CC-box to bind LIC. The structure of the BicD2 N-terminal CC with the LIC helix 1 (PDB: 6PSE) shows binding of two BicD2 CC helices to a single LIC helix(16), however, it was suggested that crystal packing may have prevented the binding of the second LIC helix to the BicD2 dimer. Indeed, a 2:2 BicD2-LIC helix interaction was inferred from ITC experiments in the same study(16). A major difference between these binding analyses and our SEC-MALS experiments is the use of the LIC helix-1 peptide versus full-length LIC, respectively. In this regard, a recent preprint describes a cryo-EM reconstitution of the dynein-dynactin complex including full-length LIC with another BicD family activator, BICDR1(50). This study captured two BICDR1 homodimers bound to the dimeric dynein complex. While evidence from the EM maps for binding of the first LIC molecule was clear, density for the second LIC was either less resolved (for BICDR-A homodimer) or absent (for BICDR-B homodimer). Together, these results suggest that although there are two binding sites for a standalone LIC helix on dimeric activating adaptors, binding of the first full-length LIC could affect the affinity/accessibility of the second LIC polypeptide for its binding site on an activating adaptor. High-resolution structures that capture full-length LIC (and the remainder of dynein-dynactin) and dimeric activating adaptors will likely resolve these apparent differences and help determine the native stoichiometries of dynein and its activating adaptors. Determining these quaternary structural states will bear important implications for dynein velocity and force generation.</p><p>While the dimeric structure of KASH5 is consistent with its role as a dynein activating adaptor, it raises interesting questions about SUN1-KASH5 quaternary structure and its implications for chromosome motility. SUN proteins are known to trimerize(51,52). This creates a potential stoichiometry mismatch between SUN1 and KASH5 that can promote higher-order quaternary structures. A recent study demonstrated that binding to KASH peptides (from KASH1, KASH4, and KASH5) induces two SUN1 trimers to bind head-to-head to form a 6:6 SUN-KASH complex(53). As the KASH peptide is a short (~20 aa long) monomeric region, it remains to be determined how the SUN1-KASH5 stoichiometry is affected by KASH5 dimerization. It is possible that the 6:6 geometry is retained in the native (i.e., full-length) SUN1-KASH5 complex at the nuclear envelope or that other higher-order structures containing multiples of SUN1 trimers and KASH5 dimers are formed in vivo. These higher-order structures might facilitate the recruitment of multiple dynein motors and the generation of large forces needed to move chromosomes across the nuclear envelope.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors perform a series of biochemical, biophysical, and cell biology assays to establish that KASH6 is an activator adaptor of dynein and it directly recruits dynein to the nuclear envelope.

We conclude that the truncated bands are representative of truncations occurring at the C-terminus based on the following arguments. First, we performed LC-MS on the purified KASH5-ÎTM protein to confirm that almost all the trypsin-digested peptides identified mapped to the KASH5 polypeptide (data not shown). This result rules out the shorter bands coming from other proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Second, we did not observe such truncation products with KASH5-N or KASH5-NCC, which share their N-terminus with KASH5-ÎTM. This suggests that the truncations products are likely arising due to the sequences C-terminal to the CC in KASH5-ÎTM. Finally, secondary structure prediction (JPRED) and Alphafold prediction suggest that the sequence between the putative Spindly motif (which is immediately downstream of the CC; see discussion of Spindly motif below) and the TM domain of KASH5 is unstructured, consistent with the proteolytic susceptibility of this region during protein expression and purification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Does KASH5 have a Spindly motif?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question. Yes, KASH5 does harbor a putative Spindly motif. We have included a short description of this in the text (beginning at line 200) and provided a new supplementary figure (Figure 3- supplement 2) to make this point. The presence and importance of the putative Spindly motif is also consistent with the NCC construct, which is truncated shortly upstream of the Spindly motif, showing slightly slower velocity, lower run frequency, and lower percent processivity than the KASH5- ÎTM (contains all soluble domains of KASH5, including the putative Spindly motif).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure presentation comments</p><p>Figure 1A, C The different striped patterns to identify the different domains look too similar.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the colors in Figure 1A and C to be more distinct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C Hard to see the mean and SD on the large dark-colored individual data points.

We also increased the size of Figure 3C to increase clarity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
