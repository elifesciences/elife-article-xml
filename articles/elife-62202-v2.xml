protection of the genome against transposable elements and transcriptional regulation in other taxonomic groups, the diversity in both levels and patterns of DNA methylation in the insects raises questions about its function and evolution. We show that the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, affects meiosis and is essential to fertility in milkweed bugs, <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>, while DNA methylation is not required in somatic cells. Our results support the hypothesis that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is required for the transition of germ cells to gametes in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> and that this function is conserved in male and female gametogenesis. They further suggest that DNMT1 has a function independent of DNA methylation in germ cells. Our results raise thequestion as to how a gene that is so critical to fitness across multiple insect species is able to diverge widely across the insect tree of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>Dnmt1</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>germ cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>O. fasciatus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 is required for the transition of spermatogonia to spermatocytes both during larval testis development and adult sperm replenishment in the insect <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the apparent ubiquity of DNA methylation across the eukaryotic tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schmitz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>), in the insects there is considerable variation both in the presence and extent of DNA methylation and even the presence and number of the DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bewick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lyko, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glastad et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the functional role of DNA methylation and its associated DNA methyltransferases in the insects is unclear. While some studies have associated levels of methylation with gene expression, most studies in the insects find no functional association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bewick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glastad et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One role emerging from knockdown and silencing studies across several insect species is that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is required for oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bewick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glastad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gegner et al., 2020</xref>). For example, <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is required for maintenance of DNA methylation following cell division in the milkweed bug, <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bewick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>), the downregulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> using RNAi results in a reduction in methylation and also the cessation of oogenesis. However, it is unclear whether the effect on oogenesis is mediated by the reduction in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>). While the expected reduction in DNA methylation is seen throughout the organism following <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown, the only phenotypic consequence is to the germ cells. Evidence from other species supports a function independent of DNA methylation. <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is also essential to egg production in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>), a beetle that has no DNA methylation at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> can have a function specific to germ cells in insects that is independent of its function in maintaining DNA methylation. This led us to hypothesize that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> plays a role in meiosis in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is essential to gametogenesis in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>. Furthermore, if <italic>Dnmt1</italic> has a role in gametogenesis, including meiosis, it should be conserved across the sexes. Testing the function of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in males allows us to capitalize on the well-characterized process of spermatogenesis in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>, specifically (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Economopoulos and Gordon, 1971</xref>), and the conserved features of insect spermatogenesis, generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dallai, 2014</xref>). In <italic>O. fasciatus,</italic> as in many insects, there are two points in development where meiosis can occur. The first stage where meiosis will occur is during the larval stages. Testis development and spermatogenesis are initiated during larval development in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Economopoulos and Gordon, 1971</xref>). During the first three instars the testes consist of seven globular follicles that will develop into the testis tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmidt et al., 2002</xref>). Meiosis is initiated in the fourth instar, and by the end of the fourth instar, cysts containing spermatids are present. Differentiation of the spermatids commences in the fifth instar, and males emerge with up to 250,000 spermatids that continue to differentiate during sexual maturation. Thus, we can target the developmental time point at which meiosis occurs. In addition, <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> males can produce gametes throughout their adult lives and therefore meiosis can occur in the adult testis. If <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is required for meiosis and gametogenesis we predicted that it will be required both during larval development and as adult males replenish sperm stores following mating. We therefore compared the testis phenotypes of adults developing from nymphs in which <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression was downregulated either before or after the major wave of meiosis that occurs in testis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Economopoulos and Gordon, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmidt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ewen-Campen et al., 2013</xref>). We also treated sexually mature adults and examined fertility in males following sperm depletion, testing for the ability of knockdown males to replenish sperm stores following multiple matings. Our results demonstrated that expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is required for the development of sperm both during larval and adult spermatogenesis and that the impact of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown was greatest if it occurred prior to the onset of meiotic divisions in the developing testes. These results establish that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> plays a critical conserved function across the sexes during gametogenesis in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> and that it is required for germ cell development.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Progression of spermatogenesis in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>.</title><p>In <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> spermatogenesis progresses from the tip of the testis tubule.

The rosette is not typically visible in confocal images of testis tubules and markers for the rosette have not been identified yet.

In region II, spermatogonia undergo mitotic transit amplification divisions to form spermatocysts containing 64 spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Economopoulos and Gordon, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ewen-Campen et al., 2013</xref>).

This evolutionary pattern is particularly intriguing given that in two species on divergent branches of the insect phylogeny the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 is essential to gametogenesis, and thus is tightly tied to fitness, even in a species where DNA methylation itself is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>). While functional studies have not been done in other species, a summary of expression studies on the DNA methyltransferases across a diversity of insects suggest that these enzymes could be involved in gametogenesis across a number of species, ranging from fire ants, <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kay et al., 2018</xref>), to jewel wasps, <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zwier et al., 2012</xref>), to migratory locusts, <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>), and the brown plant hopper, <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Here we showed that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression affects germ cell development. The effect of downregulating <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in males, as in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>), was specific to the germ cells. The downregulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> did result in reduction of DNA methylation, but there were no obvious morphological impacts to the RNAi-treated individuals. Our results show that the function of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in germ cells is conserved across the sexes within a species, and other results document that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression is required for oogenesis among species. This raises a conundrum when we look across the insect tree of life. How can a gene required for such a fundamental fitness activity in examples from such a diverse group of insects also be so evolutionarily labile? This suggests that the function <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in germ cell development is easily lost or replaced.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown causes inhibition of spermatogenesis consistent with a role in meiosis</title><p>If our hypothesis on the role of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in meiosis is correct, then spermatogenesis should be affected by <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression as well as oogenesis, as it is a shared process across gametogenesis during sexual reproduction. In the testes <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> males, we observed both spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes that stain positively for phosphorylation of the serine 10 residue of histone protein H3. While the pattern of histone H3 phosphorylation across meiosis has not been specifically studied in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>, phosphorylation of the serine 10 is typically associated with chromosome condensation during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hans and Dimitrov, 2001</xref>) and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Prigent and Dimitrov, 2003</xref>). Moreover, the pattern of α-pHH3 staining along the axis of the testis tubule is consistent with this histone modification occurring in both mitosis and meiosis. We observed α-pHH3 positive cells both within spermatocysts containing the mitotically dividing spermatogonia and also at the boundary between primary and secondary spermatocytes. We have confirmed this landmark using <italic>Boule</italic> knockdown males. In Drosophila, <italic>Boule</italic> is required for progression of spermatocytes through meiosis. Germ cells lacking functional <italic>Boule</italic> become arrested at meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eberhart et al., 1996</xref>). In the testes of <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> males treated with ds-<italic>Boule</italic>, the affected cells were all posterior to the band of synchronous α-pHH3 positive spermatocytes. Thus, α-pHH3 staining provided a landmark for entry into meiosis.</p><p>We did not see the band of α-pHH3 positive spermatocysts at the border between primary and secondary spermatocytes in the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown males treated at the third instar stage of development. This could be interpreted as the primary spermatocytes have not initiated chromosome condensation. However, we did observe individual α-pHH3 positive nuclei in the posterior testis tubule. So there could have been arrest after chromatin condensation with a breakdown in spermatocyst structure. Interestingly, the testis phenotype of our <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown males resembled the phenotypic effect of <italic>Vasa</italic> knockdown reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ewen-Campen et al., 2013</xref>. <italic>Vasa</italic> RNAi results in defects in cyst integrity and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ewen-Campen et al., 2013</xref> propose that <italic>Vasa</italic> plays a specific role in the onset or synchrony of meiosis. <italic>Vasa</italic> has also been proposed to be required for the correct progression through meiosis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Medrano et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the phenotypic similarity between <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown and <italic>Vasa</italic> knockdown testes in <italic>O. faciatus</italic> supports the hypothesis that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> may be required for the successful initiation and completion of meiosis in spermatocytes. More work remains to determine exactly what stage of sperm development is impacted by the decrease in <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression.</p><p>The phenotype of knockdown of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is exacerbated when knockdown occurs prior to the stage of testis development when meiosis occurs. This result is consistent with what was observed in female <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>) in which knockdown of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression prior to the stage of oocyte development inhibited all oocyte formation. One interpretation of this result is that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is required for successful progression through meiosis. However, it is clear that reducing <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression had an impact beyond simply reducing the ability to enter or complete meiosis. A block to progression through meiosis, as demonstrated by the <italic>Boule</italic> knockdown, spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes would continue to be born but remain viable after a failure to complete meiosis. In the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdowns, however, there were fewer germ cells of any type, and those that remained in the testis tubule often appeared to have abnormal and condensed nuclei. It remains to be determined if <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is required for meiosis or if the association with meiosis is a correlation; <italic>Dnmt1</italic> could be required for viability of germ cells and act at the stage of development at which they would be undergoing meiosis.</p><p>Previous studies on the function of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in insect spermatogenesis have not documented any effect on male fertility. Knockdown of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in the red flour beetle, <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>) had no effect on the fecundity of female mating partners in the first 9 days post mating and the authors conclude that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is not required for spermatogenesis in <italic>T. castaneum</italic>. We suspect that the function of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in spermatogenesis is not unique to <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>, given the expression patterns of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kay et al., 2018</xref>). In the <italic>T. castaneum</italic> study, the authors did not examine testis structure or design a mating strategy that would exhaust the sperm stores of the males and so may have missed a fertility effect. In holometabolous insects, including beetles, spermatocytes are typically formed by the end of larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Economopoulos and Gordon, 1971</xref>), thus males treated as pupae would still emerge with large numbers of sperm in their testes. Here we showed that male <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> treated with ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic> RNA as sexually mature adults become sperm limited more rapidly than control males. There is a potential alternative explanation that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown males could continue to produce sperm but that sperm was of low quality and unable to support development. Given that the testes of ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic> treated males were significantly smaller than control males and had altered testis tubule structure, which indicated that spermatogenesis was significantly impacted, we concluded that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown males are unable to replenish sperm supplies. The functional role of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in testes across other species remains to be tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DNA methylation and germ cell development</title><p>The knockdown of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> resulted in a reduction of DNA methylation within the testes, as predicted. The effect was greater in the nymphs that were treated in an earlier stage of development, as would be expected given the greater number of cell divisions that would occur between treatment and collection of the testes between the third and fifth instar treatments. The more extreme phenotype in the third instar treated males could be explained by the greater reduction in methylated CpG. However, the percent methylation seen in the testes of the fifth instar ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic> treated males was similar to that seen in females treated at the fourth instar stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>), greater than a twofold reduction in the percent methylated CpG residues. In <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown females, there was a compete loss of oocyte production when DNA methylation was reduced to this level while in males the phenotype of the fifth instar <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdowns was close to normal. This disconnect between reduction of DNA methylation and phenotypic effects mirrors what has been seen in the beetle, <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>). In this species, the reduction of DNA methylation is an evolved difference rather than an experimental effect, but the results are similar to what we have observed in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>; DNA methylation is not required for function of somatic cells, but downregulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression leads to specific germ cell effects. The lack of correlation between extent of methylation and function in germ cells strengthens our hypothesis that there may be a pleiotropic function for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in germ cells that acts independently of DNA methylation levels. Alternatively, DNA methylation may have a specific role in the germ cells that it does not play in somatic cells. Perhaps DNA methylation is required for proper gene expression in germ cells or it may be required for transposon silencing only in germ cells. However, demethylation of ovarian tissue in <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> showed little relationship between methylation levels and gene expression, with few differentially transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bewick et al., 2019</xref>). Another possibility is that DNA methylation state may be a prerequisite for successful completion of meiosis and not mitosis. For example, <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> has holocentric chromosomes and undergoes inverted meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Viera et al., 2009</xref>). During mitosis chromosomes have a kinetocore that extends across the majority of the chromosome, but in meiosis the kinetochore plate is missing and microtubules extend into the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comings and Okada, 1972</xref>). One could imagine that DNA methylation might be required for this interaction. However, the complete lack of methylation but a functional role of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in <italic>T. casteneum</italic> oogenesis alongside our results argues for a pleiotropic function for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in gametogenesis that is independent of its role in DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression is required for germ cell development in both male and female <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>. The block to germ cell development in <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdowns appeared to be associated with meiosis, although it was not a simple block to progression through meiosis as germ cells are lost from the testes. Thus, <italic>Dnmt1</italic> may be required for germ cell viability. It still remains to be determined if the block in gametogenesis depends on DNA methylation or an alternative function of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, as suggested by the requirement for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> during gametogenesis in an insect with a non-methylated genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>). Whatever the specific function of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in gametogenesis, the requirement for this enzyme in such a critical fitness function as the production of gametes in representatives of different groups of insects raises important questions as to how this enzyme and the entire methylation toolkit has evolved across the insect tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lyko, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Provataris et al., 2018</xref>).

Gene expression was standardized per individual to account for different numbers of individuals within each group at each developmental stage. Differences in expression levels were analyzed using ANOVA in JMP Pro v14. If there was a significant overall effect, we compared means using Tukey–Kramer HSD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNAi preparation</title><p>Double-stranded RNAs were prepared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>. Briefly, DNA templates were prepared by PCR using gene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>). Sense and anti-sense RNA were transcribed together with an Ambion MEGAscript kit (ThermoFisher Sci, Waltham, MA) and allowed to anneal to form a 404 bp ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic> RNA. The concentration of dsRNA was adjusted to 3 μg/μL in injection buffer (5 mM KCl, 0.1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Nymph injections, testis size, and morphology</title><p>To examine the effect of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown prior to or following the wave of meiosis initiated in the fourth instar stage, nymphs were injected with ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic> or control ds-RED injections at either the third instar or fifth instar stage of development. For further information on controls and testing for potential off-target effects please see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amukamara et al., 2020</xref>. Nymphs were anaesthetized at 4°C for 20 min prior to injection. Nymphs were injected in the abdomen using pulled glass capillary needles (Sutter Instrument Company micropipette puller model P-97, Novato, CA) between the third and fourth abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chesebro et al., 2009</xref>). Nymphs were injected with 2 μL volume for all injections. Following injections, nymphs were placed in individual petri dishes and monitored for development. Date of adult emergence was recorded. We did not do a power analysis, but based on preliminary data on the strength of the effect we aimed for 25 individual males for each treatment. Males were randomly assigned to a treatment group. Not all males survived to age of dissection, resulting in final sample sizes of 22 and 19 for third instar males injected with buffer and ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic>, respectively and 25 and 20 for fifth instar males injected with buffer and ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic>, respectively.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Testis size</title><p>At 7–10 days post-adult emergence, virgin males were dissected and their testes were removed. Whole testes were allowed to settle into 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and were imaged with a Leica M60 Stereomicroscope with Leica Application Suite software (LAS v4). Testis area was measured on one of the pair from each male with the LAS by outlining the whole testis with all seven testis tubules.

Individual testis tubules were removed from the outer membranous sheath for fixation and staining. Males from each treatment were dissected across four dissection days. Testis tubules from individual males within a treatment were pooled for staining. Thus each day one tube was a replicate with tubules from several individual males. Tubules were fixed for 30 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS plus 0.1% Triton-X100 (PBT) and stained for evidence of cell division using an α-phosphohistone H3 Ser10 (pHH3) primary antibody (Millipore antibody 06–570, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). α-phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) stains for chromosome condensation in preparation for mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hans and Dimitrov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Prigent and Dimitrov, 2003</xref>). The secondary antibody was an Alexa Fluor goat-anti-rabbit 647 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Following antibody staining the tubules were stained with DAPI (0.5 μg/mL PBT) to visualize nucleic acids. Stained tubules were mounted in Mowiol 4–88 mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and visualized with an Olympus BX51 Fluorescent microscope.

Males were randomly assigned to a treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Male fecundity</title><p>Preliminary experiments had shown that two previous matings were required to deplete sperm stores. Therefore, in order to allow males to deplete sperm stores acquired during nymphal development and sexual maturation, males were placed in mating trials with three 7- to 10-day-old virgin females, one provided each week. The first female was placed in the male’s petri on the day of injection with cotton wool as an oviposition substrate. The female and all eggs were removed at the end of the week (7 days post-injection) and discarded and replaced with a second 7- to 10-day-old virgin female and fresh cotton wool. Again, at the end of the week (14 days post-injection), the female and all resulting eggs were discarded. A third, focal, 7- to 10-day-old virgin female was placed with the male with fresh cotton wool. The third female and experimental male were given 1 week to mate before the male was removed from the petri dish for analysis of testis size and structure. The female was maintained for her lifetime, provided with ad libitum food and water. The eggs produced by the third female were collected from the petri dish twice a week at 3–4-day intervals and the oviposition substrate replaced with fresh cotton wool. The eggs collected were placed in a separate container and allowed to develop to hatching (approximately 7–10 days following collection) and then frozen at −20° C until assayed. We recorded the first collection date for which no eggs hatched. We analyzed the time to end of fertilized eggs due to sperm depletion relative to treatment using a survival analysis (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test) using JMP Pro v14.1. Not all males survived to date of dissection, or their mates died during the course of egg collection, requiring these males to be removed from the analysis, resulting in a sample size of 21 control and 20 ds-<italic>Dnmt1</italic>-treated males in the final fecundity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Testis size</title><p> At the end of the 1-week mating trial with the third female (21 days post-injection), males were dissected and their testes removed into 1 mL PBS.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Eisen as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This paper examines the role of Dmnt1 in Oncopeltus, an emerging insect model. The manuscript is very thorough and well written. The analyses are generally well performed. The questions here are interesting and important, and the authors have developed a good system in which to examine these questions. This includes effective RNAi knockdown to probe Dmnt1 function.</p><p>However, it is our judgment that significant additional experiments are required to support the claims, and that the findings are overly generalized to other insects without sufficient data to support such claims. If you choose to submit a revision, it must successfully address the points raised below.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1. The authors predict that &quot;if Dnmt1 is required during gametogenesis, particularly meiosis, then its expression should mirror those of two genes known to be involved in germ cell development, Boule and Vasa.&quot; This may or may not be the case, but either way, the outcome has no predictive value as to function because expression was examined in whole animals. The expression of genes that are tissue-specific might be expected to follow the profile of other genes specific to that tissue, but genes expressed in multiple tissues could show any expression profile in whole animals depending on timing and level of expression in each tissue.</p><p>Therefore, Figure 1 does not speak clearly to the claims paper. Rather, tissue-specific expression (RT-PCR and/or in situ) would be required to show that Dmnt1 is expressed in the male germline. Similarly, &quot;Expression of Dnmt1 in whole body samples was lower in sexually mature adult males than sexually mature adult females, but male and female nymphs had the same 84 expression levels&quot; is not informative, since many aspects of physiology and development vary between adult males and females (e.g., many genes expressed in the brain are sexually dimporphic).</p><p>2. The authors appear to have effectively used RNAi to knock down Dmnt1 in the testis (Figure 2) but it is generally accepted that a control using an unrelated dsRNA should be done for such experiment. The methods section statement that previous studies showed no difference between buffer and non-specific dsRNA as controls is not relevant here because those experiments did not test the same parameters (i.e., testis) as this current study.</p><p>3. RNAi knockdown in 3rd nymphal stage but not fifth resulted in reduced testis size. However, the injection per se reduced testis size – I assume likely due to the site at which the needle is injected. The effect of the specific dsRNA does show statistical significance but the experimental design is problematic in that the injection itself is causing the same phenotype as is being scored for the dsRNA effect.</p><p>4. The data presented in Figure 4 and 6 are intriguing. However the images are difficult to interpret for those not familiar with looking at Oncopeltus testis. The PI's website has an image that is much clearer – one can view individual cells, stained with the same markers – than Figure 4 and 6. We suggest that the imaging be improved here and I suspect they will more strongly support the conclusions made. It would also be helpful to include schematic drawings of the structures/cell types to help guide the viewers.</p><p>5. In the discussion: It is an overstatement to say things like &quot;without any obvious phenotypic effects in somatic tissue&quot; and nymphs &quot;develop normally and are indistinguishable from control adult.&quot; No tissue other than the testis were described in enough detail to say there were no other effects. If such observations were done, they should be reported here.</p><p>6. The claim that &quot;Our results raise the question of how a gene so critical in fitness across multiple insect species can have diverged widely across the insect tree of life.&quot;</p><p>This question has been raised already before as the authors acknowledge by citing some of the key studies (e.g. Lyko 2018, Bewick et al. 2019, Glastad et al. 2019). However, that the gene is critical for fitness is only shown for one species, so this is too generalized a claim.</p><p>Additional comments/questions:</p><p>1. Introduction, page 4: &quot;Testing the function of Dnmt1 in males allows us to capitalize on the well-characteristized process of spermatogenesis&quot;</p><p>I am far of an expert on spermatogenesis and to me this process is not entirely clear. I suggest to give a reference if the authors mean O. fasciatus or insects in general and to make clear if the study really allows claims about 'insects in general'.</p><p>2. page 4: &quot;Our results demonstrated that Dnmt1 is required…&quot;. I wondered at this point if the gene expression of Dnmt1 is meant or if there was also a study of impact on DNA methylation. Please clarify.</p><p>3. Discussion, page 12, line 206: &quot;number of insect groups the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 is essential to spermatogenesis&quot;. Please reference which insect groups and give a reference.</p><p>4. Discussion, page 15, line 268: &quot;However, we do not think that the function of Dnmt1 in spermatogenesis is unique to <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>.&quot; What is the reasoning for this claim? What is the evidence besides personal opinion?</p><p>5. Conclusion, lines 325-327. I certainly agree that functional analysis on different functions for Dnmt1 would be relevant, the question itself is not new (e.g. Lyko 2018, Provataris et al. 2018).</p><p>6. Page 13, 221: &quot;..spermatogenesis should be affected by Dnmt1 expression as well as oogenesis.&quot; Do I understand correctly that in this study there was tested for spermatogenesis only? Please clarify and write clearly.</p><p>7. Page 14, line 252: &quot;The phenotype of knockdown of Dnmt1 is exacerbated when knockdown occurs prior to the stage of testis development when meiosis occurs, as was observed in female <italic>O. fasciatus</italic>.&quot; I assume in female O. fasciatus there was also an exacerbation of phenotype of knockdown, but it reads as there was also worse when knockdown occurred prior to the stage of testis development in females – which does not make sense.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62202.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1.

The methods section statement that previous studies showed no difference between buffer and non-specific dsRNA as controls is not relevant here because those experiments did not test the same parameters (i.e., testis) as this current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated a number of the experiments using a non-specific dsRNA control. There was no significant difference in buffer injected and dsRED injected treatments. We have shown that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is knocked down in ds<italic>Dnmt1</italic> treated males relative to dsRED treated males (Figure 3). In the revision we are clear where we used dsRED and the one experiment (male fecundity, Figure 6) where we were unable to redo the experiment due to limitations in time and personnel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. RNAi knockdown in 3rd nymphal stage but not fifth resulted in reduced testis size. However, the injection per se reduced testis size – I assume likely due to the site at which the needle is injected. The effect of the specific dsRNA does show statistical significance but the experimental design is problematic in that the injection itself is causing the same phenotype as is being scored for the dsRNA effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this concern. However, in repeating this experiment with dsRED, we also included uninjected and buffer injected controls. We saw no effect on testis size in any treatment other than the ds<italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockdown. We are confident that this reflects our increased expertise in injecting the 3<sup>rd</sup> instar nymphs and change in injection site over the past year. We have revised Figure 3 (now Figure 4) and the text (lines 142-143) to reflect this result. In addition, we have included the uninjected control on the graph and in the analysis to document that the dsRED treatment has no effect on the phenotype under study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The data presented in Figure 4 and 6 are intriguing. However the images are difficult to interpret for those not familiar with looking at Oncopeltus testis. The PI's website has an image that is much clearer – one can view individual cells, stained with the same markers – than Figure 4 and 6. We suggest that the imaging be improved here and I suspect they will more strongly support the conclusions made. It would also be helpful to include schematic drawings of the structures/cell types to help guide the viewers.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have included an introductory figure (now Figure 1) that shows both a simple confocal image of an <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> testis tubule alongside a schematic drawing showing the regions of interest within the testis tubule. We hope that this will help guide the readers through the developmental processes that we are discussing in the manuscript.</p><p>We apologize for the initial images not being to our normal high standard. Unfortunately, while we were preparing the manuscript the confocal facility was closed due to the pandemic and we were not sure when it would be available. With the reopening of the facility we were able to collect confocal images on the ds<italic>Dnmt1</italic> treated testes and dsRED control testes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the discussion: It is an overstatement to say things like &quot;without any obvious phenotypic effects in somatic tissue&quot; and nymphs &quot;develop normally and are indistinguishable from control adult.&quot; No tissue other than the testis were described in enough detail to say there were no other effects. If such observations were done, they should be reported here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed both these statements (Lines 241-242).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The claim that &quot;Our results raise the question of how a gene so critical in fitness across multiple insect species can have diverged widely across the insect tree of life.&quot;</p><p>This question has been raised already before as the authors acknowledge by citing some of the key studies (e.g. Lyko 2018, Bewick et al. 2019, Glastad et al. 2019). However, that the gene is critical for fitness is only shown for one species, so this is too generalized a claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that this claim has only been functionally tested in two species (Line 235 and 321) and have bolstered our reasoning for suspecting that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> may have a function in spermatogenesis and gametogenesis more generally through our response to other comments (Additional Comment 3, Lines 235-240; Additional Comment 4, Lines 308-310).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments/questions:</p><p>1.
