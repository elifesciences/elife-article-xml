Information travels from neuron to neuron via synaptic connections, which are typically formed on dendrites. These extensive branching processes of a neuron actively shape and transform synaptic inputs on their way to the soma, endowing neurons with a wide range of input-output transformations. Since Rall’s pioneering work on signal propagation within dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rall, 1959</xref>), our understanding of dendritic dynamics has expanded with the discovery of local regenerative events, such as Na<sup>+</sup> dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spencer and Kandel, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>), and NMDA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schiller and Schiller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Llinas and Nicholson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llinás and Hess, 1976</xref>). These active properties of dendrites largely depend on the interaction between their branching morphology and ion channel composition. Multicompartmental biophysical models with active dendrites have been instrumental in exploring this relationship. However, the large number of parameters in such models complicates their interpretability, making them challenging to build, examine, and validate. In addition, the lack of standardization, along with their high computational complexity, makes these models less attractive for use in large-scale network simulations. As a result, state-of-the-art network models still consider dendrites as passive cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billeh et al., 2020</xref>), greatly underestimating their computational power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015</xref>). At the same time, with the advent of new techniques like genetic tracking of ion channels and high-resolution imaging of neuronal activity using voltage-sensitive dyes, multicompartmental biophysical modeling is experiencing its renaissance. Detailed biophysical models, although mathematically complex and computationally inefficient, are ideal for capturing and explaining data produced, for example, through simultaneous voltage and synaptic input imaging in vivo.</p><p>These challenges and demands highlight the growing need to make biophysical neuronal models more accessible. Model accessibility can be considered on two complementary levels. First, there is <italic>conceptual</italic> accessibility, which refers to how well we can understand the system being modeled (e.g. <italic>If I change parameter A, will outcome X follow?</italic>). Second, there is <italic>implementational</italic> accessibility, which concerns the model as a computational artifact (e.g. <italic>Can I easily change parameter A and measure X?</italic>). Accessibility at the conceptual level can be improved through interactive hypothesis testing. This approach implies converting complex models into interactive visualizations that provide real-time feedback on how changes in morpho-electric parameters affect neuronal behavior. In particular, such functionality would help clarify how the ion channel kinetics and distribution shape dendritic events and somatic output. To our understanding, this is one of the biggest gaps in current neuronal modeling software. Interactive visualizations would also enhance model validation, shifting the focus from somatic spiking to activity throughout the cell. Finally, this approach would help identify which dendritic properties are essential for neuronal function and which can be discarded, enabling the simplification of single-cell models and their integration into faster, more interpretable networks. Accessibility at the implementational level can be improved by developing high-level, simulator-agnostic model representations that are capable of capturing complex dendritic properties. Such representations should be modular, enabling users to easily switch between stimulation protocols, morphologies, or parameter sets. In addition, accessibility at this level involves adopting best practices for data management and standardization. Together, these approaches result in more reusable, easier-to-understand models that are customizable according to users’ needs.</p><p>In this work, we introduce <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>, a toolbox designed to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more accessible at both conceptual and implementational levels. Building on existing methods, we have developed a comprehensive workflow for developing single-cell models, including tuning their morphological and biophysical parameters, running stimulations, and analyzing the results. <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> is implemented as a Python package with an intuitive web-based graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows users to visually explore and fine-tune any parameter of the model, providing real-time feedback through interactive plots. The toolbox helps users build high-level, modular model representations that effectively capture the complex properties of active dendrites. Additionally, it includes a rich set of tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats, facilitating interoperability with other neuronal modeling software. With <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>, users can better understand and control their models while exploring how dendritic properties shape neuronal activity. By making complex models more interpretable and interactive, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> will advance research on the role of dendrites in brain function and deepen our understanding of these remarkable structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Implementation and user interface</title><p><italic>DendroTweaks</italic> is a Python toolbox designed for developing single-cell detailed biophysical models with active dendrites. It is inspired by the exploratory data analysis approach and allows any user, from naive to expert, to gain an in-depth understanding of the model through interactive visualization. The GUI uses the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture to present a single-cell neuronal model through a web-based interface built with the Bokeh library for data visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bokeh Development Team, 2025</xref>). The model provides a high-level simulator-agnostic representation of a cell, whereas the numerical simulation is delegated to an external simulator such as NEURON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hines and Carnevale, 2001</xref>) or Jaxley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deistler et al., 2025</xref>). The toolbox is available as both a standalone Python package and a web-based application. The application GUI can be accessed via the online platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr">https://dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr</ext-link>) or a locally hosted Bokeh server. The Python package for direct interaction with the software’s core functionality is distributed via the Python Package Index (PyPI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/dendrotweaks">https://pypi.org/project/dendrotweaks</ext-link>).</p><p>The GUI is organized into three main components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): (1) the left menu for file import and export operations, simulation control, and application settings, (2) the main workspace with interactive plots, and (3) the right menu with widgets and auxiliary plots. The main workspace contains top panels representing the cell and bottom panels representing monitors for the cell’s activity. In the upper left corner, there is a morphology plot, where the uploaded morphology is rendered as a 2D projection of the cell. To the right of it, there is a graph representation of the cell’s computational segments, where different parameters, such as channel density or synapse placement, can be visualized using a color code. The bottom panel can display time-dependent variables such as voltage, current, and input spike times. The right menu features widgets to manipulate cell morphology, spatial distributions, and kinetics of ion channels and synapses, as well as the placement and parameters of virtual recording and stimulating electrodes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Graphical user interface (GUI).</title><p>A screenshot of the web-based GUI accessed via the Chrome browser.

It accepts neuronal morphologies in SWC format and ion channel models as MOD files. Biophysical properties of the cell are stored in JSON format, while stimulation protocols are defined through a combination of JSON and CSV files. Model configurations can be exported to this modular format at any stage and reloaded later for further use. Additionally, models developed with <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> can be automatically converted into plain simulator code, enabling their smooth integration into larger network simulations.</p><p>The following sections will illustrate a potential workflow and provide a detailed description of the GUI elements and their functionality. We will begin by exploring and refining dendritic morphology and choosing the spatial discretization of the model. Next, we will explore the kinetics of ion channels and propose an automatic algorithm for standardizing such models. We will also demonstrate how different distributions of these channels across the dendritic tree can be used to reproduce dendritic phenomena, such as sodium and calcium spikes. Then, we will demonstrate how synapses can be added to our models and explore how the kinetics and placement of synapses can affect input integration within dendrites. Next, we will use an automatic morphology reduction algorithm in order to obtain a simpler model while retaining the activity close to the original one. Finally, we will present a set of experimental protocols that have been integrated into <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> to facilitate model validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Exploring dendritic morphology</title><p>Developing a detailed biophysical neuronal model typically begins with the experimental reconstruction of a neuron’s morphology. Our toolbox accepts morphology reconstructions in the widely used SWC file format, which represents a cell as a collection of connected 3D points (nodes), where each node is defined by its <monospace>XYZ</monospace> spatial coordinates and a radius. A rich database of these files is readily available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuromorpho.org">https://neuromorpho.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ascoli et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, online conversion from all reconstruction formats to SWC and standardization of existing SWC files is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mehta et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> employs tree graphs as a universal representation of neuronal morphology across different levels of abstraction: geometry, topology, and spatial discretization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At the geometric level, nodes represent individual points in the reconstructed morphology. At the topological level, these nodes are grouped into sections, that is the parts between bifurcation points. Each section is further divided into segments, which are used in numerical simulations. These representations are linked together: each section contains pointers to its constituent points and segments, and vice versa. The toolbox features a custom module for working with such structures, enabling efficient manipulation of morphologies through operations such as insertion, removal, and translation of nodes and subtrees. Another level of abstraction is domains, that is collections of sections. A domain is a region of a neuron distinguished by its anatomical or functional properties. For example, a typical pyramidal cell has several domains: soma, axon, basal dendrites, and an apical dendrite. The apical dendrite can be further subdivided into trunk, oblique, and tuft dendrites.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dendritic morphology and segmentation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustration of a neuronal morphology as three interconnected tree graphs.

This panel includes a slider for rotating the model around the Y-axis. For illustration, we use a realistic morphology of a Layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neuron of the mouse primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Users can navigate through the cell by selecting a section to visually inspect its parameters. This can be done by simply clicking on a section on the interactive plot or via a dropdown widget to select a specific section by its name. Navigation buttons are also available to select a parent, sibling, or child section. The parameters of the currently selected section are visualized in the right menu under the <monospace>Morphology/Section</monospace> tab with two plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The upper plot displays the geometry of the section, i.e., the diameter as a function of the section’s length. The lower plot shows a morphological or biophysical parameter selected by the user.</p><p>Computer simulations always involve approximating a continuous system as one that is discrete in space and time, which is also applied in neuronal modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carnevale and Hines, 2006</xref>). Discretization in time is regulated by the simulation time step, <monospace>dt</monospace>. Spatial discretization is achieved through segmentation. Each segment can be considered as an equivalent RC circuit representing a part of the membrane, with an associated set of differential equations to calculate voltage dynamics at a given point in space and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, middle). In our example section, the centers of each segment are shown as three circles (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$\rm nseg=3$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>), equally distributed along the section’s length according to the formula <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$(2i-1)/2\times\rm{nseg}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft3">\begin{document}$i$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> is an integer in the range <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:math><tex-math id="inft4">\begin{document}$[1,\rm{nseg}]$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>. The bottom panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, bottom) features a bar plot showing the value for a chosen parameter (i.e. a NEURON range variable) for each segment. We also introduce a <monospace>Graph</monospace> view with a tree graph representing all the segments of the given cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This view serves three main purposes: (1) to visualize the distribution of different parameters along the dendritic tree using color code, (2) to select specific segments and update their parameters, and (3) to calculate statistics for a selected group of segments. By default, the graph plot uses color code to show the morphological domain to which a segment belongs (same colors as in the <monospace>Cell</monospace> plot). Rendering other parameters on the graph is discussed in the following sections. Since all parameters are ultimately set at the segment level, the segment graph offers the most detailed and accurate representation of the model. The granularity of the graph depends on the number of segments. In addition to defining the number of segments (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft5">\begin{document}$\rm nseg$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) for each individual section, it is possible to select the <monospace>d_lambda</monospace> parameter in the left menu that automatically assigns the number of segments for each section based on the fraction of the electrical length constant computed at the frequency of 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hines and Carnevale, 2001</xref>).

Ion channels are crucial in shaping dendritic and somatic voltage dynamics, which are essential for neuronal communication and information processing. Since Hodgkin and Huxley’s seminal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>), mathematical models have been vital in understanding channel kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petousakis et al., 2023a</xref>). The most widely used ion channel models today are written in the NMODL domain-specific language developed for the NEURON simulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hines and Carnevale, 2000</xref>). <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> features a comprehensive NMODL-to-Python converter with a custom parser written in PyParsing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io">https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io</ext-link>) and automatic Python code generation using Jinja templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Upon importing a MOD file using the GUI, the kinetics of the corresponding channel can be visualized in the <monospace>Biophys/Parameters</monospace> tab of the right menu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The top plot shows the voltage-dependent steady-state values of the channel’s gating variables, while the bottom plot shows the corresponding voltage-dependent time constants. When a channel is selected, interactive widgets for each parameter of the channel model appear in the right menu, allowing for the dynamic update of the plots.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Standardization of ion channel models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of parsing and standardizing ion channel models from MOD files.

However, it does not overcome the limitations of existing models. While valid and proven useful for exploring neuronal biophysics, many existing channel models exhibit inconsistencies and deviations from theoretical formulations, limiting their interpretability and reusability. Common issues include ambiguous variable names, inconsistent equations, hardcoded parameters, lack of units, incompatibility with the latest NEURON versions (such as problems with <monospace>VERBATIM</monospace> statements and <monospace>dt</monospace>), and potential overfitting to experimental data. These issues result in a steep learning curve for inexperienced modelers and significant hurdles for experienced ones, often resulting in a lack of proper exploratory analysis, laborious manual tuning of models, and simulation errors.</p><p>Several efforts have been made to ensure more efficient and consistent channel models. In 2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gleeson et al., 2010</xref> proposed standardizing models through NeuroML, an XML-based neuronal model description language, and manually converted models of voltage- and ligand-gated conductances using the ChannelML module. In 2017, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Podlaski et al., 2017</xref> created a framework for the automated large-scale classification of ion channels, leading to the ICGenealogy web database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://icg.neurotheory.ox.ac.uk">https://icg.neurotheory.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>), which categorizes new and existing models and experimental recordings. In 2020, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumbhar et al., 2020</xref> introduced a framework that parses existing MOD files to generate optimized code, significantly improving simulation speeds. Recently, a comprehensive database of the voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv) family has been made available through Channelpedia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://channelpedia.epfl.ch">https://channelpedia.epfl.ch</ext-link>) and extended to include other channel types in the Channelome project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ranjan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ranjan et al., 2024</xref>). However, none of these approaches offered an automatic, visual-guided standardization of existing MOD files through the standardization of model equations. Here, we utilize a standardization approach for MOD files using a set of equations grounded in transition state theory (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>To demonstrate the standardization procedure, we parsed and inserted voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels and a leak channel into the cell’s membrane. We then ran a simulation for 300 ms with a step current injection (amplitude 0.15 nA, delay 100 ms, duration 100 ms, temperature 37 °C). Note that the parameters of the step-and-hold stimulation protocol (i.e. amplitude, delay, duration) can be adjusted using widgets in the <monospace>Recordings</monospace><monospace> and </monospace><monospace>Stimuli/IClamps</monospace> tab. For standardization, we selected the sodium channel, which has activation (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft6">\begin{document}$m$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) and inactivation (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft7">\begin{document}$h$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) state variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as the potassium channel, which has an activation (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft8">\begin{document}$n$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) state variable (not shown). The standardization algorithm produces plots of the original (solid) and fitted (dashed) curves for steady-state values and time constants of the state variables. Each state variable in the standardized model has five parameters: <monospace>v_half</monospace>, <monospace>sigma</monospace>, <monospace>k</monospace>, <monospace>delta</monospace>, and <monospace>tau_0</monospace> (see Materials and methods for details). Besides the activation curves, users can compare cell activity before and after standardization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To achieve this, there is an option to ‘freeze’ the original current and voltage traces for comparison before running the standardization algorithm.</p><p>Although NEURON is the default simulator used in <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> and it was employed throughout this study, the toolbox is designed to be adaptable to other simulators. As a demonstration, we applied the same modeling interface to the recently introduced Jaxley simulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deistler et al., 2025</xref>). A key advantage of this process was that <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>’s NMODL-to-Python converter significantly reduced the need to manually re-implement existing ion channel models for Jaxley. By modifying the Jinja template, we were able to generate Jaxley-compatible classes that supported full numerical simulations, in addition to visualization of the channel’s kinetic properties. <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> is capable of running simulations of multicompartmental models with multiple ion channels in Jaxley. To validate this, we ran simulations of the same simplified multicompartmental model, with sodium, potassium, and leak channels, in both NEURON and Jaxley (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results highlight that <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> offers a unified modeling interface that can be integrated with simulators beyond NEURON in order to benefit from the additional functionality they provide.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distributing ion channels</title><p>Having explored and refined the neuronal morphology and individual ion channels, a user can proceed to set up the biophysical properties of their neuronal model, including the densities and distributions of the various ion channel conductances. Dendrites of most neuron types are known to express some types of active ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnston and Narayanan, 2008</xref>), including major ion channel families such as Nav, Cav, Kv, KCa, and HCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). The distribution of each channel type is cell type-specific and is often non-uniform. For example, CaV1.x channels, also known as high-voltage-activated L-type channels, are densely populated in proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reuveni et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Westenbroek et al., 1990</xref>). In contrast, CaV3.x channels, or low-voltage activated T-type channels, increase in density with distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Magee and Johnston, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magee et al., 1995</xref>), forming ‘hot-spots’ for dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in the apical dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reuveni et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yuste et al., 1994</xref>). Another compelling example is the hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation current (Ih), mediated by HCN channels, which are higher in density in distal apical dendrites of CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magee, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lörincz et al., 2002</xref>) and cortical Layer 5 (L5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kole et al., 2006</xref>) pyramidal neurons. Even passive conductances in dendrites can show non-uniform distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stuart and Spruston, 1998</xref>). Additionally, certain kinetic properties of channels, such as half-maximal voltage, can also vary with distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Migliore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poolos et al., 2002</xref>). While the distribution of dendritic ion channels has been the subject of significant research, there is still much to learn about their role in neuronal integrative function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Migliore and Shepherd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnston and Narayanan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nusser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shah et al., 2010</xref>). Towards this goal, it is crucial to develop convenient tools for organizing ion channel distribution when designing software for studying neurons.</p><p>To make the process of exploring and adjusting the distributions of membrane mechanisms more user-friendly and intuitive, we utilize the graph view introduced earlier. Every membrane mechanism (distributed mechanism in NEURON) can be visualized on the graph, such that its value for a given segment is color-coded. To distribute parameters across the cell, users need to specify <italic>where</italic> and <italic>how</italic> a given parameter will be distributed. To select the segments <italic>where</italic> a given distribution will be applied, one needs to use segment groups. A segment group is a collection of segments that meet certain criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To create a new <monospace>SegmentGroup</monospace>, one must specify both a criterion and the domains where to search for matching segments. The criterion can be one of the following types: diameter, absolute distance (to the root of the tree), or relative distance within a domain. To define <italic>how</italic> the parameter will be distributed, one must use distribution functions. A distribution function takes a segment’s distance from the soma as input and returns the parameter value at that distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). There are several built-in types of distributions (i.e. constant, linear, exponential, sigmoidal, etc.) which, when combined, can cover most of the existing models. Parameters of a given distribution are controlled by the widgets on the <monospace>Biophys/Parameters</monospace> tab. Note that, unlike domains, segment groups can overlap, allowing segments to belong to multiple groups simultaneously and therefore can be thought of as layers. In other words, the order of groups is important: the parameters will be assigned only from the top-most group that the segment belongs to. Moreover, a segment group can encompass multiple domains or divide sections, such that different segments within the same section may belong to different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Distributions of ion channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing a segment group in a ball-and-stick model, satisfying specific distance criteria.

To keep the representation both compact and capable of representing complex spatial distributions, model parameters are stored using a unified, domain-based approach, where each distribution can be described with only a few coefficients (see Materials and methods for details). As a result, the same biophysical configuration can be easily applied across multiple morphologies that have the same domains.</p><p>To illustrate the effectiveness of this interface in distributing dendritic mechanisms and investigating their impact on neuronal activity, we replicated several established models. First, we reproduced the L2/3 pyramidal neuronal model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, to show dendritic sodium-driven backpropagation-activated action potentials (BAPs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and J</xref>, left). Using this model, we were able to demonstrate that the distribution of sodium channels affects dendritic BAPs, as removing sodium channels from a specific branch prevented spike generation in that branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, right). Next, we replicated the CA1 pyramidal neuronal model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref> to demonstrate the effect of the experimentally observed exponential distribution of HCN channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and H</xref>). As observed in the original study, we noted a significant depolarizing voltage sag, which was eliminated by blocking HCN channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Finally, we replicated the model of an L5 pyramidal neuron from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay et al., 2011</xref> to demonstrate dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. We were able to evoke a dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau potential by providing coincident inputs at the soma and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ‘hot-spot’ of the apical dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and I</xref>). This plateau potential then propagated to the soma, resulting in somatic burst firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). Overall, by replicating these models and respective simulations, we demonstrate how <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> can aid in investigating the role of ion channels in generating dendritic events through interactive parameter adjustment and visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Distributing synapses</title><p>All previous examples used simple stimuli such as somatic and dendritic step current injections to demonstrate the functionalities of <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>. In this section, we describe how more realistic synaptic stimulation protocols can be implemented. Synaptic placement and timing play an important role in the integration of synaptic inputs. For example, neocortical pyramidal neurons respond supralinearly to spatially clustered inputs and sublinearly to randomly distributed ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015</xref>). Another layer of complexity to synaptic integration is added by the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, connections from different types of inhibitory interneurons target different dendritic domains of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van Versendaal and Levelt, 2016</xref>), allowing for the selective regulation of information streams within a neuron. In light of the above, the ability to reproduce various synaptic input patterns is crucial for understanding dendritic integration.</p><p>As we do for ion channels, we use the graph view to visualize and allocate groups of synaptic inputs. While the pre-synaptic inputs are not modeled explicitly, we can create populations of ‘virtual’ neurons projecting to our model. To create a <monospace>Population</monospace> in the GUI, users must select segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and define population parameters using the dedicated widgets in the right menu. The creation of a population requires users to select a synapse type and specify the number of synapses to be uniformly distributed randomly within the selected segments. <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> offers three built-in synapse types: AMPA, NMDA, and GABA<sub>A</sub>, with an additional option for a combined AMPA-NMDA synapse. Users can create as many populations as necessary. Each population can have unique kinetic parameters for the synapses (maximal conductance, <monospace>g_max</monospace>, equilibrium potential, <monospace>e</monospace>, time constants <monospace>tau_rise</monospace>, <monospace>tau_decay</monospace>) as well as parameters for incoming inputs (input rate, randomness/noise, onset, duration).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Kinetics and distribution of synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of distributing synaptic inputs.

First, we examined the effect of input synchronicity and NMDA synapses on generating NMDA spikes. Using the graph view, we distributed 20 excitatory AMPA-NMDA synapses within a single section of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay et al., 2011</xref> passive model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We observed that simultaneous activation of synapses or activation with a Poisson spike train produced distinct dendritic voltage responses. Additionally, by blocking NMDA conductances, we were able to eliminate NMDA spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Second, we replicated the effect of inhibition on dendritic NMDA spike generation, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doron et al., 2017</xref>. We added one inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> synapse in the same section and varied its activation time or location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with the original study, NMDA spikes could not be recovered if inhibition occurred 20 ms after excitation. Moreover, proximal inhibition had little effect on NMDA spikes, whereas distal inhibition significantly reduced them. Finally, we conducted an experiment similar to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref>, using the CA1 pyramidal neuronal model with active dendritic mechanisms. Using the graph view, we distributed 40 excitatory AMPA-NMDA synapses in two scenarios: either spread across multiple terminal branches of the apical dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) or clustered within five randomly selected branches of the apical dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). As in the original study, we found that distributed synapses failed to evoke high-frequency somatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), whereas clustering synapses made high-frequency somatic activity possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

With this knowledge, one can then proceed to simplify models using a built-in morphology reduction algorithm and export them for further use in faster and more interpretable neuronal networks.</p><p>Here, we follow the analytical impedance-based approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amsalem et al., 2020</xref> (<monospace>neuron_reduce</monospace>). This method maps a detailed dendritic tree to an equivalent cylinder with the same passive properties (i.e. specific membrane resistivity, capacitance, and axial resistivity). The transfer impedance from the distal, sealed end to the soma in the simplified model matches the transfer impedance from the most distal dendritic tip to the soma in the detailed model. Additionally, the input impedance at the proximal end matches that of the respective detailed dendrite when decoupled from the soma. In the original implementation, the entire subtree of each stem dendrite (e.g. the entire apical subtree) is mapped to a single corresponding cylinder. This, however, can impose some limitations on accurately capturing the complex branching patterns and electrotonic properties of the dendritic tree, potentially affecting the precision of simulations of synaptic integration and signal propagation.</p><p>In <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>, we extended the functionality of <monospace>neuron_reduce</monospace> to allow for a continuum of morphology reduction levels, bridging detailed and ‘ball-and-stick’-like models. Users can select any section of the cell and reduce its subtree, which allows for any intermediate level of detail to be achieved. As an example, we start with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay et al., 2011</xref> model used in the original study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We reduce its morphology using the original algorithm to the ‘ball-and-stick’ level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and to an intermediate level where some apical oblique and tuft dendrites are preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, the response of the partially reduced model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) is closer to the original model’s response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) in terms of the number of spikes compared to the response of the fully reduced model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The reduction algorithm operates on passive morphologies and assigns active channel distributions <italic>post hoc</italic> by averaging the values of all original segments that map to a given segment of the reduced model. To enable the export of reduced models in <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>’s modular format, as well as in plain simulator code, we employed fitting the parameters of a distribution function to the resulting distribution of values. This approach provided a compact representation, requiring only a few parameters to be stored in order to reproduce a distribution. To demonstrate how these exported models can be integrated into larger simulations, we implemented a ‘toy’ network model outside the toolbox using the reduced neurons (available in the examples directory of the package).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Morphology reduction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Original morphology of L5 pyramidal neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay et al., 2011</xref>) and its segmentation graph showing the distribution of calcium channels.

In addition to these functionalities, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> also offers some built-in validation protocols that allow users to ensure the resulting models align with experimental observations. This approach is semi-automated, requiring users to manually implement a stimulation protocol by setting the stimulation parameters. For example, to validate somatic action potentials, a user must apply a positive step current injection at the soma to produce somatic firing. On the <monospace>Recordings and Stimuli/Analysis</monospace> tab of the right menu, selecting the <monospace>Somatic spikes</monospace> command will automatically detect action potentials and measure their properties, such as firing rate, amplitude, and half-width.

Next, we stimulated the soma with a positive step current (0.793 nA) and detected somatic action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). From the same trace, we measured the peaks, amplitudes, and half-widths of individual action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We then constructed a somatic f-I curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) by applying current steps of increasing amplitude (0.1 nA step). After validating the somatic activity, we evaluated dendritic integration nonlinearity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, left) by comparing measured individual waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, right) to the expected linear summation of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). Note that protocols for both the somatic f-I curve and dendritic integration curve require multiple simulation runs with varying stimulus intensity, which are done automatically after the user specifies the initial stimulation parameters. Finally, since the model has HCN channels, we measured the voltage sag ratio (0.14) and the steady-state input resistance (40 MΩ) by applying a negative step current injection (–0.05 nA) at the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

developed <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more accessible at the conceptual and implementational levels. At the conceptual level, our main motivation was to illuminate how morpho-electric properties of dendrites shape neuronal activity and computations. We deliberately focused on single-cell models to provide comprehensive functionality for tuning subcellular properties, including dendritic morphology, ion channel kinetics and distributions, as well as synaptic inputs. With <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>’ interactive interface, users can better understand how these subcellular properties influence dendritic activity and neuronal output in their models. We equip neuronal models with widgets and interactive plots, making every parameter visually accessible and interactively tunable. Importantly, for simple models, plots respond to user actions in real time, ensuring a smooth model exploration and tuning process. Interactive plots illustrating neuronal morphology significantly simplify the process of navigating through various sections and segments of the model. We enhance the interactivity of ion channel models by providing visualization of channel kinetics based on MOD files. Furthermore, by representing a cell as a graph with computational segments as nodes, we simplify and visually enhance the process of distributing ion channels and synapses throughout the cell. Finally, we extend the <monospace>neuron_reduce</monospace> approach for morphology reduction to encompass all potential reduction levels from full morphology to ‘ball-and-stick’-like models and incorporate this method into our graphical interface, thereby taking advantage of inherent visualization and validation capabilities.</p><p>At the implementational level, our goal was to provide a high-level modeling framework that abstracts away technical implementation details and produces structured, transparent, and interoperable model representations. We provide users with a unified modeling interface that allows them to construct high-level simulator-independent model representations while automatically generating simulator-specific model instances. The underlying model structure is designed to be modular, clearly separating morphology, biophysical configurations, and stimulation protocols. To comprehensively capture complex dendritic properties, we introduced a custom format for biophysical parameters, capable of capturing non-uniform ion channel distributions across different dendritic domains. To enhance data management, we introduced versatile tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats. In particular, we developed rich functionality for processing ion channel models written in the NMODL language, making them more comprehensible and reusable. To ensure seamless integration into broader modeling workflows, we implemented a range of export options, allowing users to reuse individual model components or entire models across different modeling software. Through this combination of advanced model construction capabilities, comprehensive data handling, and broad interoperability, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> complements existing tools and fills an important niche within the neuronal modeling ecosystem. An integrated modeling workflow might include multiple steps and platforms. For example, users can first set up a model in <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> by removing morphological artifacts and standardizing ion channel models. They can then establish meaningful initial parameters and use external tools for automated parameter optimization. Subsequently, users can re-import the model for visual exploration, validation, or morphology reduction. Finally, they can export these refined models and use specialized software to scale them up into larger network simulations. In the following paragraphs, we compare <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> with various modeling software to specify its place in the neuronal modeling landscape.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison to existing modeling software</title><p>Single-cell modeling encompasses a diverse range of practices, from refining morphological data and optimizing biophysical properties to visualizing and analyzing neuronal dynamics. Over the years, numerous tools have been developed to aid in the creation, visualization, and optimization of neuronal models. Primary simulation environments like NEURON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hines and Carnevale, 2001</xref>), NEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gewaltig and Diesmann, 2007</xref>), and Brian 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stimberg et al., 2019</xref> have been complemented by a variety of auxiliary software tools designed to enhance interaction with model parameters.</p><p>Several tools have been developed to assist in visualizing and editing morphological reconstructions of real neurons, such as neuTube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2015</xref>), REMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozelos et al., 2015</xref>), HBP MORPHOLOGY VIEWER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakker et al., 2017</xref>), and HUGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliaga Maraver et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> includes a simulator-independent tree graph construction module, enabling efficient morphology manipulation through operations such as inserting, removing, and translating nodes or subtrees. Its graphical interface offers the functionality for inspecting and refining morphological parameters to identify reconstruction artifacts and ‘bugs’ through visual exploration and statistical analysis. Nevertheless, the toolbox lacks advanced tools, such as 3D mesh editing and neuronal growth modeling capabilities. For more extensive morphology-focused needs, users are directed to specialized software like the TREES toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuntz et al., 2011</xref>), Neuronize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brito et al., 2013</xref>), NeuroEditor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Velasco et al., 2024</xref>), and NETMORTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koene et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>With a growing number of models available online from repositories like <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://modeldb.science">https://modeldb.science</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McDougal et al., 2017</xref>), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuromorpho.org">https://neuromorpho.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ascoli et al., 2007</xref>), and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://celltypes.brain-map.org">https://celltypes.brain-map.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gouwens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>), standardization is crucial for ensuring reproducibility and reusability in neuronal modeling. Existing standards like SONATA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2020</xref>), NeuroML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gleeson et al., 2010</xref>), and NineML (the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gorchetchnikov, 2010</xref>) provide frameworks for model description. However, manual standardization can be laborious and prone to errors. Importantly, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> is not presented as a new standard but as a tool that conforms to a given standard to automatically standardize a model. Future releases might include an automatic export to an expanded range of formats, such as ChannelML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gleeson et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, to our knowledge, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> is the only tool that can simultaneously parse existing ion channel model files, allow for visual exploration and fine-tuning of their kinetics and distributions via a GUI, and offer automatic standardization.</p><p>Another critical aspect of neuronal modeling is optimization of biophysical parameters. Evolutionary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Van Geit et al., 2016</xref>), Bayesian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>), and gradient-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones and Kording, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deistler et al., 2025</xref>) have been proposed to offer data-driven model parameter optimization. While the recent advent of such automated optimizers opens new possibilities for large-scale modeling, we argue that manual exploration remains a valuable and complementary approach. Human oversight provides both initial parameters before optimization and essential sanity checks after, making intuitive understanding a must when validating model behavior. <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> perfectly complements black-box optimization by providing an intuitive environment for hands-on parameter tuning and model refinement. Incorporating automatic optimization algorithms into <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> alongside interactive visualizations presents a promising future direction, combining the strengths of both approaches.</p><p>A range of validation frameworks has been developed to ensure that optimized parameter sets remain biophysically plausible. These approaches typically perform systematic searches across the parameter space and explicitly quantify heterogeneity, that is populations of models that reproduce experimental observations while capturing biological variability, and degeneracy, that is the ability of different parameter combinations to yield similar outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Migliore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roy and Narayanan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roy and Narayanan, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reva et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> approaches heterogeneity and degeneracy differently. Rather than generating model populations, it enables users to interactively navigate the parameter space, visualizing neuronal activity and applying built-in validation protocols to assess whether individual model configurations fall within biologically realistic regimes. While population-based frameworks excel at systematic large-scale exploration, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> complements them by supporting hypothesis-driven interrogation of how specific parameters influence neuronal function.</p><p>Visualization and the development of intuitive graphical user interfaces have been crucial in neuronal modeling. One of the most successful examples is NetPyNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dura-Bernal et al., 2019</xref>), which offers a graphical interface for data-driven multiscale network modeling in NEURON. Meanwhile, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> focuses on the subcellular level, providing a more explicit single-cell model interface. It facilitates an interactive approach to visualize and modify morphological parameters, ion channel kinetics and distributions, as well as to observe activity in different compartments. This capability is particularly important for models with active dendrites. We envision as a good practice exporting fine-tuned single-cell models from <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> and incorporating them into complex networks in NetPyNE.</p><p>Indeed, the ultimate goal of creating single-cell models is often to integrate them into a network. In this context, simplifying models becomes another crucial aspect of neuronal modeling. Morphology reduction is a common simplification technique with a long history. Pioneering works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stratford et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bush and Sejnowski, 1993</xref>) aimed to conserve axial resistance, reducing multicompartmental models to 8–9 compartments. Later approaches focused on preserving voltage attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Destexhe, 2001</xref>) or surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hendrickson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marasco et al., 2013</xref>). The most recent methods such as <monospace>neuron_reduce</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amsalem et al., 2020</xref>) and NEAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wybo et al., 2021</xref>) provide analytical solutions to the reduction problem by preserving the impedances of the original model. In <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>, we adopted the <monospace>neuron_reduce</monospace> approach and extended it to support a continuum of reduction levels, allowing users to gradually reduce dendritic subtrees. This added flexibility is important because dendritic trees rely on semi-independent subunit integration, which enhances localized processing and computational complexity. Spatial organization of inputs plays a crucial role in their integration, with clustered inputs being more likely to drive somatic firing in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>). When multiple synaptic inputs from otherwise isolated branches are remapped to a reduced cylinder, clustering can occur, substantially altering the integration process. Therefore, the intermediate levels of reduction we added to <monospace>neuron_reduce</monospace> could potentially allow for more accurate implementation of independent input integration within dendritic subunits. A compelling example of when this might be needed is recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Otor et al., 2022</xref>), which showed that early bifurcating L5 pyramidal neurons exhibit pronounced functional compartmentalization of the apical dendrite, correlating with behavioral variables.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations and further directions</title><p><italic>DendroTweaks</italic> addresses a broad spectrum of single-cell modeling needs. However, it is important to acknowledge its limitations and outline promising future directions. The key feature of <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>, its real-time interactivity, is constrained by the performance of the underlying simulator. When running hyper-detailed simulations with numerous segments over extended periods of time, the simulation can become slow, reducing the interface’s responsiveness and real-time update capabilities. To enhance performance, future versions of <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> should consider integrating faster simulation methods or developing a custom single-cell simulator. A promising approach is to run simulations using the optimized CoreNEURON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumbhar et al., 2019</xref>) and Dendritic Hierarchical Scheduling (DHS) algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), which have been shown to greatly speed up NEURON simulations, or leverage Jaxley’s built-in functionality for JIT compilation and GPU usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deistler et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>While the current implementation of <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> is based on the NEURON simulator, the approach is essentially simulator-agnostic. As we have demonstrated for Jaxley, its functionality can be further extended to include other simulators. While our proof of concept shows that a multicompartmental model with multiple ion channels can be simulated using Jaxley as an alternative to NEURON, fully preserving the programming interface, this implementation is not optimized to leverage the full range of Jaxley capabilities and still lacks some of the features that will be added in future releases. Another promising future direction is to introduce an automated conversion of simplified biophysical models to integrate-and-fire few-compartmental models implemented in Brian 2 using Dendrify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pagkalos et al., 2023</xref>). This would allow for the extension of the proposed workflow by automatically simplifying not only the morphology but also the biophysics of a neuron, spanning any level of conceptual granularity.</p><p>While <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> models rely on specific parameters for ion channel kinetics and spatial distributions, experimental measurements of these properties reflect substantial variability across cells. Averaging kinetic data or conductance gradients across multiple cells can create the misleading impression of fixed parameter values, whereas in reality, each neuron may exhibit a distinct profile. Degeneracy further complicates modeling, as multiple, widely different combinations of kinetic and distribution parameters can produce nearly identical neuronal responses, making it difficult to infer unique underlying mechanisms. While <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> does not resolve these issues inherent to most neuronal models, it allows users to better understand them by interactively adjusting parameters and immediately observing their effects on model outputs.</p><p>Another limitation of the current <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> implementation is the range of ion channel models that can be standardized. As of now, only voltage-gated channels using the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) formalism can be standardized. Even though Markov chain state-based kinetic models might offer a more accurate representation of ion channel kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lampert and Korngreen, 2014</xref>), they are not supported by <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>. Nevertheless, it is important to note that most models use the HH formalism, as Markov models can be more complex and slower to run. Additionally, our parsing and automated standardization algorithm relies on specific heuristics and cannot handle significant deviations in MOD file code patterns. For example, the parser assumes that variable names for the time constant will include ‘tau’ (case insensitive). Therefore, for some files, the algorithm may require some minor preprocessing and manual tuning by the user.</p><p>In its current implementation, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> offers relatively limited capabilities for representing synaptic inputs. Synaptic parameters are defined at the population level, and setting per-synapse properties is not yet supported. Synapse placement within a user-specified region follows a uniform random distribution. In addition, activation properties are specified abstractly in terms of rates, noise levels, and durations, without support for user-defined input sequences. Extending the toolbox to include per-synapse control, synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>), plasticity mechanisms, and more flexible connectivity definitions would substantially broaden the range of research questions that can be addressed using <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>.</p><p>The extended functionality of the morphology reduction algorithm in <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> provides a continuum of reduction levels that better preserve properties of the original model. However, even intermediate reduction levels inevitably alter integrative properties and eventually lead to the loss of dendritic computations. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that assessing how exactly morphology reduction affects integrative properties is one of the key use cases for <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>, thanks to its exploratory capabilities. Importantly, we don’t view reduction as an ultimate goal for any model but rather encourage approaches where the same system can be studied at different levels of granularity, as elegantly shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billeh et al., 2020</xref>. Beyond optimizing simulation speed, morphology reduction serves as a valuable technique to explore the importance of dendritic compartmentalization. The question of whether the computational unit of a neuron is a single spine, a branch, or an entire domain remains open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Häusser and Mel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francioni and Harnett, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stuyt et al., 2022</xref>). Using morphology reduction at multiple levels in in silico experiments can help address this question by revealing how dendritic morphology shapes compartmentalization, which in turn determines the neuron’s input-output transformation properties.</p><p>Finally, there is further potential for interoperability of <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> with other neuronal modeling software. <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> is designed to read and write the most popular formats for representing neuronal morphology (SWC) as well as ion channel models (MOD). It is possible to automatically generate plain NEURON (Python) code to export a refined model and use it outside the toolbox. Having the same option for other simulators, such as Jaxley, would also be beneficial. To enhance compatibility with existing models and the reusability of standardized models, support for more file formats and standards needs to be incorporated. The SONATA data format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2020</xref>), designed to efficiently represent network models and simulation data, plays an important role in this regard. Integration with this format is currently under development, and support for exporting models in SONATA is planned for future releases. Another notable example is NeuroML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gleeson et al., 2010</xref>), an XML-based neuronal model description language that provides a standardized notation for both morphological and biophysical parameters. By supporting such widely adopted standards, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> can be more seamlessly integrated into a larger ecosystem of interoperable, open-source software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sinha et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We believe that <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> will be appealing to a wide range of researchers.

This format builds on widely used file types. Neuronal morphology is represented in SWC files, which <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> can read, modify, and export using a custom graph-processing module. Ion channel models and other membrane mechanisms are described in MOD files (see the following section for details). The biophysical configuration of a cell is specified in JSON files, adapted from the Allen Cell Types Database schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gouwens et al., 2018</xref>) and extended to support non-uniform parameter distributions. Each JSON file contains three main sections: (1) the mapping of domains to inserted membrane mechanisms, (2) the definition of segment groups, and (3) the mapping of segment groups to distribution functions for each model parameter. This structure enables concise and unified representation of complex distributions for any biophysical parameter, including passive and kinetic ones. Simulation, recording, and stimulation parameters are also stored in JSON files, while element-wise parameters, such as spatial locations of recordings and stimuli, are stored in CSV files. Each model is organized within a dedicated folder containing <monospace>morphology</monospace>, <monospace>biophys</monospace>, and <monospace>stimuli</monospace> subfolders. User-defined MOD files must be placed in the <monospace>biophys/mod</monospace> folder.

Each model is represented by interconnected tree graphs capturing the morphology at three abstraction levels: point tree, section tree, and segment tree. This structure allows users to build the model incrementally, starting from the point tree, for more precise control over morphology refinement. Each tree encapsulates level-specific properties and provides methods for common operations, such as sorting, inserting, and removing nodes or subtrees. Nodes maintain references to their children and parent, as well as attributes describing level-specific properties. Sections have access to their points and segments, and vice versa, linking all levels together. Additional methods are available for computing path distances, which are used when assigning parameter distributions. In parallel, <italic>DendroTweaks</italic> automatically generates corresponding sections and segments within the selected simulator, either NEURON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hines et al., 2009</xref>) or Jaxley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deistler et al., 2025</xref>), and maintains the references from its own sections and segments to the simulator objects.

form of activation (inactivation) curves derived from the original MOD files for membrane potentials in the range from –100 to 100 mV. The fitting process is implemented in the symfit Python library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://symfit.readthedocs.io">https://symfit.readthedocs.io</ext-link>) to fit both curves for the steady state and the time constant simultaneously. The temperature is set to the original temperature before getting data to fit. We noticed that, while accurate for both curves, simultaneous fitting results in significant changes in the voltage and current dynamics. Therefore, we introduced a second additional fit for the steady state alone, sacrificing fitting accuracy for the time constant but preserving voltage and current dynamics. Finally, a new MOD file is created from a JINJA template and is immediately available to replace the original mechanism in the neuronal model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Morphology reduction</title><p>We extended the analytical impedance-based <monospace>neuron_reduce</monospace> approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amsalem et al., 2020</xref> and integrated it into our GUI.

In the original implementation, the entire subtree of each stem dendrite (e.g. the entire apical subtree) is mapped to a single corresponding cylinder. We extended this approach to allow a user to select any section they want and map the inclusive subtree of this section (including the section itself) to a single cylinder. When the user selects the desired section using the GUI and clicks the button ’Reduce subtree’ the inclusive subtree is disconnected from the cell and parameters for its equivalent cylinder are calculated. The exclusive subtree of the section is then removed, and the section’s length and diameter are updated with the new calculated values before reconnecting it to its original parent. As in the original method, the reduced model is compartmentalized into segments (typically with a spatial resolution of 0.1λ), and channel conductances are adjusted according to the mapping between the original and the reduced segments. In order to introduce a more general workflow, where synapses can be allocated on the already reduced model, we removed the step from the original algorithm that mapped synapses to the corresponding cylinder. To enable export of reduced models in <italic>DendroTweaks</italic>’s modular format and plain simulator code, we implemented a fitting procedure that approximates spatial parameter distributions using analytical functions (e.g., polynomials or step-like). Candidate models were fit to parameter values as a function of distance from the soma, and the optimal model was chosen by minimizing mean squared error, with model complexity as a secondary criterion. This approach provides a compact representation, independent of the original segmentation, requiring only a few coefficients to be stored to reproduce a distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Validation</title><p>We utilized a semi-automated approach for model validation.

Depending on the protocol, one or multiple simulation runs are performed, and the simulated voltage values are used for further calculations. Input resistance is calculated according to the formula: <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mtext>in</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mtext>offset</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mtext>onset</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mtext>ext</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft93">\begin{document}$R_{\text{in}}=\dfrac{V_{\text{offset}}-V_{\text{onset}}}{I_{\text{ext}}}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>.

Voltage attenuation is calculated for a user-specified set of segments by measuring the voltage response at different points along the dendrite. For each segment, the voltage attenuation is computed as the ratio of the voltage change at the segment (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf95"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mtext>seg</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft95">\begin{document}$\Delta V_{\text{seg}}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) to the voltage change at the stimulation site (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mtext>stim</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft96">\begin{document}$\Delta V_{\text{stim}}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>). The distances from the soma to each segment are also recorded, and the attenuation is plotted against these distances. For detecting somatic action potentials and measuring their amplitude and half-width, we used the SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>) Python library for peak detection in a signal. This involves identifying the peaks in the voltage trace and calculating the time difference between the points where the voltage is half of the peak amplitude. The somatic f-I curve is built by injecting a range of current amplitudes (e.g. 0–1 nA in steps of 0.1 nA) into the soma and recording the number of action potentials generated at each current level. The firing rate is plotted as a function of the injected current amplitude. Dendritic nonlinearities are derived by measuring the voltage response in a dendrite to increasing synaptic input weights of a single synapse. The unitary voltage response (EPSP) is determined, and the actual voltage responses for increasing synaptic weights are compared to the expected linear sum of unitary responses.

It offers extensive capabilities for working with very complex distributed biophysical neuronal models and should be a useful addition to the growing ecosystem of tools for neuronal modeling.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>• This Python-based tool allows for visualization of a neuronal model's compartments.</p><p>• The tool works with morphology reconstructions in the widely used .swc and .asc formats.</p><p>• It can support many neuronal models using the NMODL language, which is widely used for neuronal modeling.</p><p>• It permits one to plot the properties of linear and non-linear conductances in every compartment of a neuronal model, facilitating examination of model's details.</p><p>• DendroTweaks supports manipulation of the model parameters and morphological details, which is important for exploration of the relations of the model composition and parameters with its electrophysiological activity.</p><p>• The paper is very well written - everything is clear, and the capabilities of the tool are described and illustrated with great attention to details.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>• Not a really big weakness, but it would be really helpful if the authors showed how the performance of their tool scales. This can be done for an increasing number of compartments - how long does it take to carry out typical procedures in DendroTweaks, on a given hardware, for a cell model with 100 compartments, 200, 300, and so on? This information will be quite useful to understand the applicability of the software.</p><p>Let me also add here a few suggestions (not weaknesses, but something that can be useful, and if the authors can easily add some of these for publication, that would strongly increase the value of the paper).</p><p>• It would be very helpful to add functionality to read major formats in the field, such as NeuroML and SONATA.</p><p>• Visualization is available as a static 2D projection of the cell's morphology. It would be nice to implement 3D interactive visualization.</p><p>• It is nice that DendroTweaks can modify the models, such as revising the radii of the morphological segments or ionic conductances. It would be really useful then to have the functionality for writing the resulting models into files for subsequent reuse.</p><p>• If I didn't miss something, it seems that DendroTweaks supports allocation of groups of synapses, where all synapses in a group receive the same type of Poisson spike train. It would be very useful to provide more flexibility. One option is to leverage the SONATA format, which has ample functionality for specifying such diverse inputs.</p><p>• &quot;Each session can be saved as a .json file and reuploaded when needed&quot; - do these files contain the whole history of the session or the exact snapshot of what is visualized when the file is saved? If the latter, which variables are saved, and which are not? Please clarify.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>In this revised version of the paper, the authors addressed all my comments. While many of the suggestions were addressed by textual changes in the manuscript or an explanation in the response to the reviewers (rather than adding substantial new functionality to the tool), DendroTweaks in its current updated state does represent an advanced and useful tool. Further extensions can be added as the development of the tool continues, in interaction with the community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103324.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Makarov</surname><given-names>Roman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>FORTH Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Heraklion</named-content></addr-line><country>Greece</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chavlis</surname><given-names>Spyridon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03bndpq63</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH)</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Heraklion, Crete</named-content></addr-line><country>Greece</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Poirazi</surname><given-names>Panayiota</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>FORTH Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Heraklion</named-content></addr-line><country>Greece</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dendrotweaks provides its users with a solid tool to implement, visualize, tune, validate, understand, and reduce single-neuron models that incorporate complex dendritic arbors with differential distribution of biophysical mechanisms.

The core approach of DendroTweaks, and its strongest aspect, is the interactive exploration of how morpho-electric parameters affect neuronal activity. In light of this, variability can be achieved through the interactive updating of the model parameters with widgets. In a sense, by adjusting a widget (e.g., channel distribution or kinetics), a user ends up with a new instance of a cell in the parameter space and receives almost real-time feedback on how this change affected neuronal activity. This approach is much simpler than implementing complex optimization protocols for different parameter sets, which would detract from the interactivity aspect of the GUI. In its revised version, DendroTweaks also accounts for neuron-to-neuron morphological variability, as channel distributions are now based on morphological domains (rather than the previous segment-specific approach). This makes it possible to apply the same biophysical configuration across various morphologies. Overall, both biophysical and morphological variability can be explored within DendroTweaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Inability to account for the many-to-many mapping between ion channels and physiological outcomes. Reliance on hand-tuning provides a single biased model that does not respect pronounced neuron-to-neuron variability observed in electrophysiological measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the challenge of accounting for degeneracy in the relation between ion channels and physiological outcomes and the importance of capturing neuron-to-neuron variability. One possible way to address this, as we mention in the Discussion, is to integrate automated parameter optimization algorithms alongside the existing interactive hand-tuning with widgets. In its revised version, DendroTweaks can integrate with Jaxley (Deistler et al., 2024) in addition to NEURON. The models created in DendroTweaks can now be run with Jaxley (although not all types of models, see the limitations in the Discussion), and their parameters can be optimized via automated and fast gradient-based parameter optimization, including optimization of heterogeneous channel distributions. In particular, a key advantage of integrating Jaxley with DendroTweaks was its NMODL-to-Python converter, which significantly reduced the need to manually re-implement existing ion channel models for Jaxley (see here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dendrotweaks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/convert_to_jaxley.html">https://dendrotweaks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/convert_to_jaxley.html</ext-link>).</p><p>(1) Michael Deistler, Kyra L.

DendroTweaks is designed for single-cell modeling, aiming to cover its various aspects in great detail. Of course, we expect refined single-cell models, both detailed and simplified, to be further integrated into networks. But this does not need to occur within DendroTweaks. We believe this network-building step is best handled by dedicated network simulation platforms. To facilitate the network-building process, we extended the exporting capabilities of DendroTweaks. To enable the export of reduced models in DendroTweaks’s modular format, as well as in plain simulator code, we implemented a method to fit the resulting parameter distributions to analytical functions (e.g., polynomials). This approach provided a compact representation, requiring a few coefficients to be stored in order to reproduce a distribution, independently of the original segmentation. The reduced morphologies can be exported as SWC files, standardized ion channel models as MOD files, and channel distributions as JSON files. Moreover, plain NEURON code (Python) to instantiate a cell class can be automatically generated for any model, including the reduced ones. Finally, to demonstrate how these exported models can be integrated into larger simulations, we implemented a &quot;toy&quot; network model in a Jupyter notebook included as an example in the GitHub repository. We believe that these changes greatly facilitate the integration of DendroTweaks-produced models into networks while also allowing users to run these networks on their favorite platforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Lack of a set of tutorials, which is common across many &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; papers, that would be helpful in users getting acquainted with the toolbox.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we believe has been addressed fully in the revised version of the tool and manuscript. As previously mentioned, the lack of documentation was due to the software's early stage. We have now added comprehensive documentation, which is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dendrotweaks.readthedocs.io">https://dendrotweaks.readthedocs.io</ext-link>. This extensive material includes API references, 12 tutorials, 4 interactive Jupyter notebooks, and a series of video tutorials, and it is regularly updated with new content. Moreover, the toolbox's GUI with example models is available through our online platform at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr">https://dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr</ext-link>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The paper by Makarov et al. describes the software tool called DendroTweaks, intended for the examination of multi-compartmental biophysically detailed neuron models. It offers extensive capabilities for working with very complex distributed biophysical neuronal models and should be a useful addition to the growing ecosystem of tools for neuronal modeling.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>(1) This Python-based tool allows for visualization of a neuronal model's compartments.</p><p>(2) The tool works with morphology reconstructions in the widely used .swc and .asc formats.</p><p>(3) It can support many neuronal models using the NMODL language, which is widely used for neuronal modeling.</p><p>(4) It permits one to plot the properties of linear and non-linear conductances in every compartment of a neuronal model, facilitating examination of the model's details.</p><p>(5) DendroTweaks supports manipulation of the model parameters and morphological details, which is important for the exploration of the relations of the model composition and parameters with its electrophysiological activity.</p><p>(6) The paper is very well written - everything is clear, and the capabilities of the tool are described and illustrated with great attention to detail.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>(1) Not a really big weakness, but it would be really helpful if the authors showed how the performance of their tool scales. This can be done for an increasing number of compartments - how long does it take to carry out typical procedures in DendroTweaks, on a given hardware, for a cell model with 100 compartments, 200, 300, and so on? This information will be quite useful to understand the applicability of the software.</p></disp-quote><p>DendroTweaks functions as a layer on top of a simulator. As a result, its performance scales in the same way as for a given simulator. The GUI currently displays the time taken to run a simulation (e.g., in NEURON) at the bottom of the Simulation tab in the left menu. While Bokeh-related processing and rendering also consume time, this is not as straightforward to measure. It is worth noting, however, that this time is short and approximately equivalent to rendering the corresponding plots elsewhere (e.g., in a Jupyter notebook), and thus adds negligible overhead to the total simulation time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Let me also add here a few suggestions (not weaknesses, but something that can be useful, and if the authors can easily add some of these for publication, that would strongly increase the value of the paper).</p><p>(3) It would be very helpful to add functionality to read major formats in the field, such as NeuroML and SONATA.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that support for major formats will substantially improve the toolbox, ensuring the reproducibility and reusability of the models. While integration with these formats has not been fully implemented, we have taken several steps to ensure elegant and reproducible model representation. Specifically, we have increased the modularity of model components and developed a custom compact data format tailored to single-cell modeling needs. We used a JSON representation inspired by the Allen Cell Types Database schema, modified to account for non-constant distributions of the model parameters. We have transitioned from a representation of parameter distributions dependent on specific segmentation graphs and sections to a more generalized domain-based distribution approach. In this revised methodology, segment groups are no longer explicitly defined by segment identifiers, but rather by specification of anatomical domains and conditional expressions (e.g., “select all segments in the apical domain with the maximum diameter &lt; 0.8 µm”). Additionally, we have implemented the export of experimental protocols into CSV and JSON files, where the JSON files contain information about the stimuli (e.g., synaptic conductance, time constants), and the CSV files store locations of recording sites and stimuli. These features contribute toward a higher-level, structured representation of models, which we view as an important step toward eventual compatibility with standard formats such as NeuroML and SONATA. We have also initiated a two-way integration between DendroTweaks and SONATA. We developed a converter from DendroTweaks to SONATA that automatically generates SONATA files to reproduce models created in DendroTweaks. Additionally, support for the DendroTweaks JSON representation of biophysical properties will be added to the SONATA data format ecosystem, enabling models with complex dendritic distributions of channels. This integration is still in progress and will be included in the next version of DendroTweaks. While full integration with these formats is a goal for future releases, we believe the current enhancements to modularity and exportability represent a significant step forward, providing immediate value to the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Visualization is available as a static 2D projection of the cell's morphology. It would be nice to implement 3D interactive visualization.</p></disp-quote><p>We offer an option to rotate a cell around the Y axis using a slider under the plot. This is a workaround, as implementing a true 3D visualization in Bokeh would require custom Bokeh elements, along with external JavaScript libraries. It's worth noting that there are already specialized tools available for 3D morphology visualization. In light of this, while a 3D approach is technically feasible, we advocate for a different method. The core idea of DendroTweaks’ morphology exploration is that each section is “clickable”, allowing its geometric properties to be examined in a 2D &quot;Section&quot; view. Furthermore, we believe the &quot;Graph&quot; view presents the overall cell topology and distribution of channels and synapses more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is nice that DendroTweaks can modify the models, such as revising the radii of the morphological segments or ionic conductances. It would be really useful then to have the functionality for writing the resulting models into files for subsequent reuse.</p></disp-quote><p>This functionality is fully available in local installations. Users can export JSON files with channel distributions and SWC files after morphology reduction through the GUI. Please note that for resource management purposes, file import/export is disabled on the public online demo. However, it can be enabled upon local installation by modifying the configuration file (app/default_config.json). In addition, it is now possible to generate plain NEURON (Python) code to reproduce a given model outside the toolbox (e.g., for network simulations). Moreover, it is now possible to export the simulation protocols as CSV files for locations of stimuli and recordings and JSON files for stimuli parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) If I didn't miss something, it seems that DendroTweaks supports the allocation of groups of synapses, where all synapses in a group receive the same type of Poisson spike train. It would be very useful to provide more flexibility. One option is to leverage the SONATA format, which has ample functionality for specifying such diverse inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>Currently, each population of “virtual” neurons that form synapses on the detailed cell shares the same set of parameters for both biophysical properties of synapses (e.g., reversal potential, time constants) and presynaptic &quot;population&quot; activity (e.g., rate, onset). The parameter that controls an incoming Poisson spike train is the rate, which is indeed shared across all synapses in a population. Unfortunately, the current implementation lacks the capability to simulate complex synaptic inputs with heterogeneous parameters across individual synapses or those following non-uniform statistical distributions (the present implementation is limited to random uniform distributions). We have added this information in the Discussion (3. Discussion - 3.2 Limitations and future directions - ¶.5) to make users aware of the limitations. As it requires a substantial amount of additional work, we plan to address such limitations in future versions of the toolbox.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) &quot;Each session can be saved as a .json file and reuploaded when needed&quot; - do these files contain the whole history of the session or the exact snapshot of what is visualized when the file is saved? If the latter, which variables are saved, and which are not? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous implementation, these files captured the exact snapshot of the model's latest state. In the new version, we adopted a modular approach where the biophysical configuration (e.g., channel distributions) and stimulation protocols are exported to separate files. This allows the user to easily load and switch the stimulation protocols for a given model. In addition, the distribution of parameters (e.g., channel conductances) is now based on the morphological domains and is agnostic of the exact morphology (i.e., sections and segments), which allows the same JSON files with biophysical configurations to be reused across multiple similar morphologies. This also allows for easy file exchange between the GUI and the standalone version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Joint recommendations to Authors:</bold></p><p>The reviewers agreed that the paper is well written and that DendroTweaks offers a useful collection of tools to explore models of single-cell biophysics. However, the tooling as provided with this submission has critical limitations in the capabilities, accessibility, and documentation that significantly limit the utility of DendroTweaks. While we recognize that it is under active development and features may have changed already, we can only evaluate the code and documentation available to us here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive evaluation of the manuscript and express our sincere appreciation for their feedback. We acknowledge the limitations they have pointed out and have addressed most of these concerns in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, we would emphasize:</p><p>(1) While the features may be rich, the documentation for either a user of the graphical interface or the library is extremely sparse. A collection of specific tutorials walking a GUI user through simple and complex model examples would be vital for genuine uptake. As one category of the intended user is likely to be new to computational modeling, it would be particularly good if this documentation could also highlight known issues that can arise from the naive use of computational techniques. Similarly, the library aspect needs to be documented in a more standard manner, with docstrings, an API function list, and more didactic tutorials for standard use cases.</p></disp-quote><p>DendroTweaks now features comprehensive documentation. The standalone Python library code is well-documented with thorough docstrings. The overall code modularity and readability have improved. The documentation is created using the widely adopted Sphinx generator, making it accessible for external contributors, and it is available via ReadTheDocs <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dendrotweaks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://dendrotweaks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</ext-link>. The documentation provides a comprehensive set of tutorials (6 basic, 6 advanced) covering all key concepts and workflows offered by the toolbox. Interactive Jupyter notebooks are included in the documentation, along with the quick start guide. All example models also have corresponding notebooks that allow users to build the model from scratch.</p><p>The toolbox has its own online platform, where a quick-start guide for the GUI is available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr/guide.html">https://dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr/guide.html</ext-link>. We have created video tutorials for the GUI covering the basic use cases. Additionally, we have added tips and instructions alongside widgets in the GUI, as well as a status panel that displays application status, warnings, and other information. Finally, we plan to familiarize the community with the toolbox by organizing online and in-person tutorials, as the one recently held at the CNS*2025 conference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cns2025florence.sched.com/event/25kVa/building-intuitive-and-efficient-biophysicalmodels-with-jaxley-and-dendrotweaks">https://cns2025florence.sched.com/event/25kVa/building-intuitive-and-efficient-biophysicalmodels-with-jaxley-and-dendrotweaks</ext-link>). Moreover, the toolbox was already successfully used for training young researchers during the Taiwan NeuroAI 2025 Summer School, founded by Ching-Lung Hsu. The feedback was very positive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The paper describes both a GUI web app and a Python library. However, the code currently mixes these two in a way that largely makes sense for the web app but makes it very difficult to use the library aspect. Refactoring the code to separate apps and libraries would be important for anyone to use the library as well as allowing others to host their own DendroTweak servers. Please see the notes from the reviewing editor below for more details.</p></disp-quote><p>The code in the previous `app/model` folder, responsible for the core functionality of the toolbox, has been extensively refactored and extended, and separated into a standalone library. The library is included in the Python package index (PyPI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/dendrotweaks">https://pypi.org/project/dendrotweaks</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Notes from the Reviewing Editor Comments (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) While one could import morphologies and use a collection of ion channel models, details of synapse groups and stimulation approaches appeared to be only configurable manually in the GUI. The ability to save and load full neuron and simulation states would be extremely useful for reproducibility and sharing data with collaborators or as an interactive data product with a publication. There is a line in the text about saving states as json files (also mentioned by Reviewer #2), but I could see no such feature in the version currently online.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to reserve the online version for demonstration and educational purposes, with more example models being added over time. However, this functionality is available upon local installation of the app (and after specifying it in the ‘default_config.json’ in the root directory of the app). We’ve adopted a modular model representation to store separately morphology, channel models, biophysical parameters, and stimulation protocols.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Relatedly, GUI exploration of complex data is often a precursor to a more automated simulation run. An easy mechanism to go from a user configuration to scripting would be useful to allow the early strength of GUIs to feed into the power of large-scale scripting.</p></disp-quote><p>Any model could be easily exported to a modular DendroTweaks representation and later imported either in the GUI or in the standalone version programmatically. This ensures a seamless transition between the two use cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the paper discusses DendroTweaks as both a GUI and a python library, the zip file of code in the submission is not in good form as a library. Back-end library code is intermingled with front-end web app code, which limits the ability to install the library from a standard python interface like PyPI. API documentation is also lacking. Functions tend to not have docstrings, and the few that do, do not follow typical patterns describing parameters and types.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, all these issues have been resolved in the new version of the toolbox. The library code is now housed in a separate repository <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Poirazi-Lab/DendroTweaks">https://github.com/Poirazi-Lab/DendroTweaks</ext-link> and included in PyPI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/dendrotweaks">https://pypi.org/project/dendrotweaks</ext-link>.

The requirements are currently a lockfile, fully specifying exact versions of all dependencies. This is exactly correct for web app deployment to maintain consistency, but is not feasible in the context of libraries where you want to have minimal impact on a user's environment. Refactoring the library from the web app is critical for making DendroTweaks usable in both forms described in the paper.</p><p>The lockfile makes installation more or less impossible on computer setups other than that of the author. Needless to say, this is not acceptable for a tool, and I would encourage the authors to ask other people to attempt to install their code as they describe in the text. For example, attempting to create a conda environment from the environment.yml file on an M1 MacBook Pro failed because it could not find several requirements. I was able to get it to install within a Linux docker image with the x86 platform specified, but this is not generally viable. To make this be the tool it is described as in text, this must be resolved. A common pattern that would work well here is to have a requirements lockfile and Docker image for the web app that imports a separate, more minimally restrictive library package with that could be hosted on PyPI or, less conveniently, through conda-forge.</p></disp-quote><p>The installation of the standalone library is now straightforward via pip install dendrotweaks.On the Windows platform, however, manual installation of NEURON is required as described in the official NEURON documentation <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/8.2.6/install/install_instructions.html#windows">https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/8.2.6/install/install_instructions.html#windows</ext-link>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) As an aside, to improve potential uptake, the authors might consider an MIT-style license rather than the GNU Public License unless they feel strongly about the GPL. Many organizations are hesitant to build on GPL software because of the wide-ranging demands it places on software derived from or using GPL code.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for this suggestion. We are considering changing the licence to MPL 2.0. It will maintain copyleft restrictions only on the package files while allowing end-users to freely choose their own license for any derived work, including the models, generated data files, and code that simply imports and uses our package.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Abstract: Neurons rely on the interplay between dendritic morphology and ion channels to transform synaptic inputs into a sequence of somatic spikes. Technically, this would have to be morphology, ion channels, pumps, transporters, exchangers, buffers, calcium stores, and other molecules. For instance, if the calcium buffer concentration is large, then there would be less free calcium for activating the calcium-activated potassium channels. If there are different chloride co-transporters - NKCC vs. KCC - expressed in the neuron or different parts of the neuron, that would alter the chloride reversal for all the voltage- or ligand-gated chloride channels in the neuron. So, while morphology and ion channels are two important parts of the transformation, it would be incorrect to ignore the other components that contribute to the transformation. The statement might be revised to make these two components as two critical components.</p></disp-quote><p>The phrase “Two critical components” was added as it was suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Section 2.1 - The overall GUI looks intuitive and simple.</p><p>(3) Section 2.2</p><p>(a) The Graph view of morphology, especially accounting for the specific d_lambda is useful.</p><p>(b) &quot;Note that while microgeometry might not significantly affect the simulation at a low spatial resolution (small number of segments) due to averaging, it can introduce unexpected cell behavior at a higher level of spatial discretization.&quot;</p><p>It might be good to warn the users that the compartmentalization and error analyses are with reference to the electrical lambda. If users have to account for calcium microdomains, these analyses wouldn't hold given the 2 orders of magnitude differences between the electrical and the calcium lambdas (e.g., Zador and Koch, J Neuroscience, 1994). Please sensitize users that the impact of active dendrites in regulating calcium microdomains and signaling is critical when it comes to plasticity models in morphologically realistic structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. We have clarified in the text that our spatial discretization specifically refers to the electrical length constant. We acknowledge that electrical and chemical processes operate on fundamentally different spatial and temporal scales, which requires special consideration when modeling phenomena like synaptic plasticity. We have sensitized users about this distinction. However, we do not address such examples in the manuscript, thus leaving the detailed discussion of non-electrical compartmentalization beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) I am not very sure if the &quot;smooth&quot; tool for diameters that is illustrated is useful. Users shouldn't consider real variability in morphology as artifacts of reconstruction. As mentioned above, while this might not be an issue with electrical compartmentalization, calcium compartmentalization will severely be affected by small changes in morphology. Any model that incorporates calcium-gated channels should appropriately compartmentalize calcium. Without this, the spread of activation of calcium-dependent conductances would be an overestimate. Even small changes in cellular shape and curvature can have large impacts when it comes to signaling in terms of protein aggregation and clustering.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this functionality is still available in the toolbox, we have removed the emphasis from it in the manuscript. Nevertheless, for the purpose of addressing the reviewer’s comment, we provide an example when this “smoothening” might be needed:please see Figure S1 from Tasciotti et al. 2025.</p><p>(2) Simone Tasciotti, Daniel Maxim Iascone, Spyridon Chavlis, Luke Hammond, Yardena Katz, Attila Losonczy, Franck Polleux, Panayiota Poirazi.

Taking the average of the sigmoids or the activation/deactivation/inactivation kinetics provides an illusion that each channel subtype in a given cell type has fixed values of V_1/2, k, delta, and tau, but it is really a range obtained from several experiments. The heterogeneity is real and reflects cell-to-cell variability in channel gating kinetics, not experimental artifacts. Please sensitize the readers that there is not a single value for these channel parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair comment, and it refers to a general problem in neuronal modeling. In DendroTweaks, we follow the approach widely used in the community that indeed doesn't account for heterogeneity. We added a paragraph in the revised manuscript's Discussion (3. Discussion - 3.3 Limitations and future directions - ¶.3) to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Section 2.4</p><p>(a) Same as above: Please sensitize users that the gradients in channel conductances are measured as an average of measurements from several different cells. This gradient need not be present in each neuron, as there could be variability in location-dependent measurements across cells. The average following a sigmoid doesn't necessarily mean that each neuron will have the channel distributed with that specific sigmoid (or even a sigmoid!) with the specific parametric values that the average reported. This is extremely important because there is an illusion that the gradient is fixed across cells and follows a fixed functional form.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this information to our Discussion in the same paragraph mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Please provide an example where the half-maximal voltage of a channel varies as a function of distance (such as Poolos et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2002 or Migliore et al., 1999; Colbert and Johnston, 1997). This might require a step-like function in some scenarios. An illustration would be appropriate because people tend to assume that channel gating kinetics are similar throughout the dendrite. Again, please mention that these shifts are gleaned from the average and don't really imply that each neuron must have that specific gradient, given neuron-to-neuron variability in these measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the provided literature, which we now cite when describing parameter distributions (2. Results - 2.4 Distributing ion channels - ¶.1). Please note that DendroTweaks' programming interface and data format natively support non-linear distribution of kinetic parameters alongside the channel conductances. As for the step-like function, users can either directly apply the built-in step-like distribution function or create it by combining two constant distributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Section 2.5</p><p>(a) It might be useful to provide a mechanism for implementing the normalization of unitary conductances at the cell body, (as in Magee and Cook, 2000; Andrasfalvy et al., J Neuroscience, 2001). Specifically, users should be able to compute AMPAR conductance values at each segment which would provide a somatic EPSP value of 0.2 mV.</p></disp-quote><p>This functionality is indeed useful and will be added in future releases. Currently, it has been mentioned in the list of known limitations when working with synaptic inputs (3. Discussion - 3.3 Limitations and future directions - ¶.5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Users could be sensitized about differences in decay time constants of GABA_A receptors that are associated with parvalbamin vs. somatostatin neurons. As these have been linked to slow and fast gamma oscillations and different somatodendritic locations along different cell types, this might be useful (e.g., 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.11.033;10.1523/jneurosci.0261-20.2020; 10.7554/eLife.95562.1; 10.3389/fncel.2023.1146278).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important biological detail. DendroTweaks enables users to define model parameters specific to their cell type of interest. For practical reasons, we leave the selection of biologically relevant parameters to the users. However, we will consider adding an explicit example in our tutorials to showcase the toolbox's flexibility in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Section 2.6</p><p>While reducing the morphological complexity has its advantages, users of this tool should be sensitized in this section about how the reduction does not capture all the complexity of the dendritic computation. For instance, the segregation/amplification properties of Polsky et al., 2004, Larkum et al., 2009 would not be captured by a fully reduced model. An example across different levels of reductions, implementing simulations in Figure 7F (but for synapses on the same vs. different branches), would be ideal. Demonstrate segregation/amplification in the full model for the same set of synapses - coming on the same branch/different branch (linear integration of synapses on different branches and nonlinear integration of synapses on the same branch). Then, show that with different levels of reduction, this segregation/amplification vanishes in the reduced model. In addition, while impedance-based approaches account for account for electrical computation, calcium-based computation is not something that is accountable with reduced models, given the small lambda_calcium values. Given the importance of calcium-activated conductances in electrical behaviour, this becomes extremely important to account for and sensitize users to. The lack of such sensitization results in presumptuous reductions that assume that all dendritic computation is accounted for by reduced models!</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that reduction leads to a loss in the complexity of dendritic computation. This has been stated in both the original algorithm paper (Amsalem et al., 2020) and in our manuscript (e.g., 3. Discussion - 3.2 Comparison to existing modeling software - ¶.6). In fact, to address this problem, we extended the functionality of neuron_reduce to allow for multiple levels of morphology reduction. Our motivation for integrating morphology reduction in the toolbox was to leverage the exploratory power of DendroTweaks to assess how different degrees of reduction alter cell integrative properties, determining which computations are preserved, which are lost, and at what specific reduction level these changes occur. Nevertheless, to address this comment, we've made it more explicit in the Discussion that reduction inevitably alters integrative properties and, at a certain level, leads to loss of dendritic computations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Section 2.7</p><p>(a) The validation process has two implicit assumptions:</p><p>(i) There is only one value of physiological measurements that neurons and dendrites are endowed with. The heterogeneity in these measurements even within the same cell type is ignored. The users should be allowed to validate each measurement over a range rather than a single value. Users should be sensitized about the heterogeneity of physiological measurements.</p><p>(ii) The validation process is largely akin to hand-tuning models where a one-to-one mapping of channels to measurements is assumed. For instance, input resistance can be altered by passive properties, by Ih, and by any channel that is active under resting conditions. Firing rate and patterns can be changed by pretty much every single ion channel that expresses along the somatodendritic axis.</p><p>An updated validation process that respects physiological heterogeneities in measurements and accounts for global dependencies would be more appropriate. Please update these to account for heterogeneities and many-to-many mappings between channels and measurements. An ideal implementation would be to incorporate randomized search procedures (across channel parameters spanning neuron-to-neuron variability in channel conductances/gating properties) to find a population of models that satisfy all physiological constraints (including neuron-to-neuron variability in each physiological measurement), rather than reliance on procedures that are akin to hand-tuning models. Such population-based approaches are now common across morphologically-realistic models for different cell types (e.g., Rathour and Narayanan, PNAS, 2014; Basak and Narayanan, J Physiology, 2018; Migliore et al., PLoS Computational Biology, 2018; Basak and Narayanan, Brain Structure and Function, 2020; Roy and Narayanan, Neural Networks, 2021; Roy and Narayanan, J Physiology, 2023; Arnaudon et al., iScience, 2023; Reva et al., Patterns, 2023; Kumari and Narayanan, J Neurophysiology, 2024) and do away with the biases introduced by hand-tuning as well as the assumption of one-to-one mapping between channels and measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and the suggested alternatives to our validation process. We have extended the discussion on these alternative approaches (3. Discussion - 2. Comparison to existing modeling software - ¶.5). However, it is important to note that neither one-value nor one-to-one mapping assumption is imposed in our approach. It is true that validation is performed on a given model instance with fixed single-value parameters. However, users can discover heterogeneity and degeneracy in their models via interactive exploration. In the GUI, a given parameter can be changed, and the influence of this change on model output can be observed in real time. Validation can be run after each change to see whether the model output still falls within a biologically plausible regime or not. This is, of course, time-consuming and less efficient than any automated parameter optimization.</p><p>However, and importantly, this is the niche of DendroTweaks. The approach we provide here can indeed be referred to as model hand-tuning. This is intentional: we aim to complement black-box optimization by exposing the relationship between parameters and model outputs. DendroTweaks is not aimed at automated parameter optimization and is not meant to provide the user with parameter ranges automatically. The built-in validation in DendroTweaks is intended as a lightweight, fast feedback tool to guide manual tuning of dendritic model parameters so as to enhance intuitive understanding and assess the plausibility of outputs, not as a substitute for comprehensive model validation or optimization. The latter can be done using existing frameworks, designed for this purpose, as mentioned by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Users could be asked to wait for RMP to reach steady state. For instance, in some of the traces in Figure 7, the current injection is provided before RMP reaches steady-state. In the presence of slow channels (HCN or calcium-activated channels), the RMP can take a while to settle down. Users might be sensitized about this. This would also bring to attention the ability of several resting channels in modulating RMP, and the need to wait for steady-state before measurements are made.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the observation and updated the validation process accordingly. We have added functionality for simulation stabilization, allowing users to pre-run a simulation before the main simulation time. For example, model.run(duration=1000, prerun_time=300) could be used to stabilize the model for a period of 300 ms before running the main simulation for 1 s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Strictly speaking, it is incorrect to obtain membrane time constant by fitting a single exponential to the initial part of the sag response (Figure 7A). This may be confirmed in the model by setting HCN to zero (strictly all active channel conductances to zero), obtaining the voltage-response to a pulse current, fitting a double exponential (as Rall showed, for a finite cable or for a real neuron, a single exponential would yield incorrect values for the tau) to the voltage response, and mapping membrane time constant to the slower of the two time-constants (in the double exponential fit). This value will be very different from what is obtained in Figure 7A. Please correct this, with references to Rall's original papers and to electrophysiological papers that use this process to assess membrane properties of neurons and their dendrites (e.g., Stuart and Spruston, J Neurosci, 1998; Golding and Spruston, J Physiology, 2005).</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the algorithm for calculating the membrane time constant based on the reviewer's suggestions and added the suggested references. The time constant is now obtained in a model with blocked HCN channels (setting maximal conductance to 0) via a double exponential fit, taking the slowest component.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Section 3</p><p>(a) May be good to emphasize the many-to-many mapping between ion channels and neuronal functions here in detail, and on how to explore this within the Dendrotweaks framework.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph in the Discussion that addresses both the problems of heterogeneity and degeneracy in biological neurons and neuronal models (3. Discussion - 3.3 Limitations and future directions - ¶.3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) May be good to have a specific section either here or in results about how the different reduced models can actually be incorporated towards building a network.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned earlier, building a network of reduced models is a promising new direction. However, it is beyond the scope of this manuscript, whose primary goal is to introduce DendroTweaks and highlight its capabilities. DendroTweaks is designed for single-cell modeling and provides export capabilities that allow integrating it into broader workflows, including network modeling. We have added a paragraph in the manuscript (3. Discussion - 3.1 Conceptual and implementational accessibility - ¶.2) that addresses how DendroTweaks could be used alongside other software, in particular for scaling up single-cell models to the network level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Section 4</p><p>(a) Section 4.3: In the second sentence (line 568), the &quot;first Kirchhoff's law&quot; within parentheses immediately after Q=CV gives an illusion that Q=CV is the first Kirchhoff's law! Please state that this is with reference to the algebraic sum of currents at a node.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the equations and apologize for this oversight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Table 1: In the presence of active ion channels, input resistance, membrane time constant, and voltage attenuation are not passive properties. Input resistance is affected by any active channel that is active at rest (HCN, Kir, A-type K+ through the window current, etc). The same holds for membrane time constant and voltage attenuation as well. This could be made clear by stating if these measurements are obtained in the presence or absence of active ion channels. In real neurons, all these measurements are affected by active ion channels; so, ideally, these are also active properties, not passive! Also, please mention that in the presence of resonating channels (e.g., HCN, M-type K+), a single exponential fit won't be appropriate to obtain tau, given the presence of sag.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this ambiguity. What the term “Passive” means in Table 1 (e.g., for the input resistance, R_in) is that the minimal set of parameters needed to validate R_in are the passive ones (i.e., Cm, Ra, and Leak). We have changed the table listing to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 2B and the caption to Figure 2F show and describe the diameter of the sections, whereas the image in Figure 2F shows the radius. Which is the correct one?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for this is that Figure 2B shows the sections' geometry as it is represented in NEURON, i.e., with diameters, while Figure 2F shows the geometry as it is represented in an SWC file (as these changes are made based on the SWC file). Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, we decided to remove panel F from the figure in the new version, to present a more important panel on tree graph representations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) &quot;Each segment can be viewed as an equivalent RC circuit representing a part of the membrane&quot;. The example in Figure 2B is perhaps a relatively simple case. For more complex cases where multiple nonlinear conductances are present in each section, would it be possible to show each of these conductances explicitly? If yes, it would be nice to illustrate that.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that &quot;can be viewed&quot; here was intended to mean &quot;can be considered,&quot; and we have updated the text accordingly. The schematic RC circuits were added to the corresponding figure for illustration purposes only and are not present in the GUI, as this would indeed be impractical for multiple conductances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some extra citations could be added. For example, it is a little strange that BRIAN2 is mentioned, but NEST is not. It might be worth mentioning and citing it. Also, the Allen Cell Types Database is mentioned, but no citation for it is given. It could be useful to add such citations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0417-0">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0417-0</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02718-3">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02718-3</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>Brian 2 is extensively used in our lab on its own and as a foundation of the Dendrify library (Pagkalos et al., 2023). As stated in the discussion, we are considering bridging reduced Hodgkin-Huxley-type models to Dendrify leaky integrate-and-fire type models. For these reasons, Brian 2 is mentioned in the discussion.
