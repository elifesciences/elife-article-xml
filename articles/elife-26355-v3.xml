These channels exhibit a behavior called voltage-dependent potentiation (VDP), which appears to be a specialization to dampen the hyperexitability of neurons. VDP manifests as a potentiation of current amplitude, hyperpolarizing shift in voltage sensitivity, and slowing of deactivation in response to a depolarizing prepulse. Here we show that VDP of <italic>D. rerio</italic> ELK channels involves the structural interaction between the intracellular N-terminal eag domain and C-terminal CNBHD. Combining transition metal ion FRET, patch-clamp fluorometry, and incorporation of a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid, we show that there is a rearrangement in the eag domain-CNBHD interaction with the kinetics, voltage-dependence, and ATP-dependence of VDP. We propose that the activation of ELK channels involves a slow open-state dependent rearrangement of the direct interaction between the eag domain and CNBHD, which stabilizes the opening of the channel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26355.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26355.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26355.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans and other animals, electrical signals trigger the heart to beat and carry information around the brain and nervous system. Particular cells can generate these signals by regulating the flow of ions into and out of the cell via proteins called ion channels. These proteins sit in the membrane that surrounds the cell and will open or close in response to specific signals. For example, an ion channel in humans called hERG allows positively-charged potassium ions to flow out of a heart cell to help the cell return to its “resting” state after producing an electrical signal. Defects in hERG can alter the rhythm at which the heart beats, leading to a serious condition called Long QT syndrome.</p><p>The human hERG channel is part of a family of related channels known as the KCNH channels. These channels are made of four protein subunits that assemble to form a pore that spans the cell membrane. When a cell is resting before producing an electrical signal, KCNH channels are generally closed. However, once an electrical signal starts, the flow of ions through other ion channels in the cell membrane changes an electrical property across the membrane known as the “voltage”. This change in voltage causes KCNH channels to open.</p><p>Dai and Zagotta studied how a KCNH channel known as ELK from zebrafish responds to changes in membrane voltage. The experiments show that the manner in which ELK channels respond to the voltage is due to changes in how the subunits interact in the part of the channel that lies inside the cell. Further experiments using several new techniques reveal in much more detail how the shape of the channel alters as the voltage changes. These new techniques could also be used to observe how other KCNH channels in the heart and brain change shape in response to changes in voltage. This could lead to the design of new drugs to treat heart and neurological diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26355.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26355.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>noncanonical amino acid</kwd><kwd>unnatural amino acid</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp fluorometry</kwd><kwd>ELK</kwd><kwd>Anap</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH102378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY010329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zagotta</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A powerful new fluorescence approach elucidates the structural mechanism for a specialized ion channel behavior important for cardiac and neuronal excitability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ion channels in the KCNH family (EAG, ERG and ELK) are voltage-gated potassium channels important for nervous system function, cardiac physiology, and cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Warmke and Ganetzky, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ganetzky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pardo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morais-Cabral and Robertson, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Genetic deletion of ELK channels was shown to cause hippocampal hyperexcitability and epilepsy in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, EAG channels are also abundantly expressed in many forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camacho, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pardo and StuhmerStühmer, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Like other voltage-gated potassium channels, KCNH channels are composed of four subunits around a centrally located pore, where each subunit contains six transmembrane segments and an intracellular N-terminal and C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the KCNH channels contain a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD) in the C-terminal region, the channels do not bind and are not directly regulated by cyclic nucleotides, including cAMP and cGMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brelidze et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robertson et al., 1996</xref>). Instead, the analogous cyclic nucleotide-binding pocket of the CNBHD is occupied by an ‘intrinsic ligand’ from a short sequence at the C-terminal end of the CNBHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marques-Carvalho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brelidze et al., 2012</xref>). This intrinsic ligand regulates KCNH channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marques-Carvalho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brelidze et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>) and explains, in part, why KCNH channels are not regulated by cyclic nucleotides. Another important structural feature of KCNH channels is the interaction between the N-terminal eag domain (PAS domain and PAS cap) and C-terminal CNBHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gianulis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gustina and Trudeau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haitin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This interaction has been demonstrated to be critical for the proper function of KCNH channels. Mutations in KCNH channels that impair this eag domain-CNBHD interaction lead to alterations in channel trafficking and gating, which are thought to underlie some forms of Long QT Syndrome and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curran et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gustina and Trudeau, 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26355.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VDP of zELK channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Homology model of the structure of the zELK channel illustrating the intersubunit eag domain-CNBHD interaction (side-view parallel to the plasma membrane), based on the cryo-EM structure of the rEAG1 channel (PDB code: 5K7L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>).

This electrical property is characterized by a shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized voltages in response to a depolarizing prepulse. In ERG channels, this mode shift is thought to be responsible for the slowing of deactivation that contributes to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanguinetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trudeau et al., 1995</xref>). This phenomenon, also called prepulse facilitation, has been found in other types of ion channels including N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels and HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoshi et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoshi and Smith, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bean, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Männikkö et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elinder et al., 2006</xref>). We refer to this behavior in KCNH channels as voltage-dependent potentiation (VDP).</p><p>In this paper, we studied the structural mechanism underlying the VDP in ELK channels. Using deletions, mutations, and chimeric constructs we show that VDP involves the interaction between the eag domain and CNBHD. To measure the distance between positions in the eag domain and CNBHD, we used transition metal ion FRET (tmFRET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taraska et al., 2009a</xref>) together with incorporation of a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). By simultaneously measuring channel current and tmFRET using patch-clamp fluorometry (PCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng and Zagotta, 2003</xref>), we showed that the distance between the eag domain and CNBHD decreases with the time course, voltage-dependence, and ATP-dependence of VDP. These results indicate that VDP in ELK channels involves a slow rearrangement of the interaction between the eag domain and the CNBHD that is coupled to channel opening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>VDP of zELK channels</title><p>For this study, we used a vertebrate ELK channel from zebrafish (zELK) which exhibits robust expression in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previously, the basic electrophysiological properties of zELK channels were shown to be similar to the mammalian orthologs, and the structure of the C-linker/CNBD of the channel was solved by X-ray diffraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brelidze et al., 2012</xref>). zELK channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and activated by depolarizing voltage steps from −120 mV to +120 mV in the cell-attached patch-clamp configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As for other KCNH channels, zELK is a K<sup>+</sup>-selective channel activated by membrane depolarization with prominent inward tail currents seen with high concentrations of potassium in the recording electrode.</p><p>VDP of zELK channels manifests in three ways. The first is that the activation of zELK channels at depolarizing voltages exhibits prominent double exponential kinetics, with a fast (~4 ms) and a slow (~200 ms) component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that prolonged depolarization is causing the channel to transition to a second more stable open conformation. The second manifestation of VDP is hysteresis in the steady-state conductance-voltage (G-V) curve. We applied a 500 ms depolarizing prepulse to +60 mV before a family of voltage steps. The depolarizing prepulse caused about a −60 mV shift in the G-V curve to more hyperpolarized voltages as well as a dramatic increase in the peak tail-current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The third manifestation of VDP is apparent by varying the duration of depolarizing voltages (+60 mV) and monitoring the amplitude and time course of the tail current at −100 mV. The tail current amplitude increased 3.5 ± 0.3 fold (n = 11) for depolarizing voltage pulses of longer durations, with a time course that closely matched the slow component of the activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). More interestingly, the time constant of the tail current increased from 8.4 ± 0.4 ms to 16.9 ± 1.5 ms with longer pulses (n = 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggests that channels closed more slowly from a potentiated open state.</p><p>These three manifestations of VDP can be recapitulated in a simple kinetic scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In this scheme the voltage-dependent activation of the channel was modeled as a single voltage-dependent transition followed by a voltage-independent closed-to-open transition. VDP was then modeled as a slow transition to a potentiated mode with an unaltered voltage-dependent transition but a more favorable closed-to-open transition. As required by thermodynamics, the mode shift is more favorable from the open state than from the closed states, and is therefore coupled to activation. This coupling produces a voltage-dependence to the mode shift, and therefore VDP. While clearly oversimplified, this simple gating scheme could quantitatively account for the double exponential activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), the shift in the G-V curve with depolarizing prepulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and the slowing of the tail currents with longer depolarizing pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In the rest of the paper, we determine the molecular mechanism that underlies the mode shift that produces VDP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>VDP is eliminated in the inside-out patch-clamp configuration</title><p>zELK channels exhibit a dramatic run-up in activity after patch excision. Similar to VDP, this run-up manifested as an increase in tail current amplitude (a 2.2 ± 0.3 fold increase compared to the cell-attached configuration, measured after +120 mV depolarization, n = 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and a significant shift of the G-V curve of channel activation to more hyperpolarized voltages (V<sub>1/2</sub> = −52.5 ± 3.5 mV, n = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The shift of the G-V curve happened gradually after excision and reached steady-state after about 20 mins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the VDP was almost completely eliminated in excised patches, with no further shift in the G-V curve with depolarizing prepulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and no slowing of the tail currents with longer depolarizing pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). This suggests that patch excision shifted the channels into the potentiated mode even without a depolarizing prepulse.

The tmFRET efficiency between L-Anap and Co<sup>2+</sup> bound to the dihistidine was measured by the degree of quenching of Anap fluorescence by Co<sup>2+</sup>.

We next measured the tmFRET efficiency between sites in the eag domain and CNBHD in the absence and presence of ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

Using the Förster equation and an R<sub>0</sub> of 12 Å, this corresponds to a distance change of 2.0 Å. These results suggest that, at hyperpolarizing voltages, these two sites within the eag domain and CNBHD are further apart when the channel is not potentiated and closer together when the channel is potentiated.</p><p>We next measured the voltage-dependence of the conformational change between the eag domain and the CNBHD.

This decrease was not present without dihistidine or in the absence of ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). L-Anap is an environmentally sensitive fluorophore whose emission spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths in more hydrophobic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). To determine if the decreased fluorescence was associated with a change of the environment of L-Anap, we measured the emission spectra of Anap fluorescence in patches at −100 mV and +120 mV. We found the wavelength of the L-Anap peak emission was not significantly shifted despite the reduction in the intensity of peak emission produced by the +120 mV voltage pulse in the presence of 1 mM Co<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Together with the absence of a fluorescence change without a dihistidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), these results are consistent with a FRET mechanism for Co<sup>2+</sup> quenching and not a change in environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). These results indicate that, similar to VDP, membrane depolarization causes a ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and voltage-dependent rearrangement between the eag domain and CNBHD. This suggests that the rearrangement between the eag domain and the CNBHD is associated with VDP.</p><p>To further test that the rearrangement between the eag domain and CNBHD is associated with VDP, we measured the kinetics of the change in tmFRET and compared it with kinetics of the development and the recovery of VDP.

Fluorescent images were captured every 100 ms with a 50 ms exposure time.

The time constant for recovery of the Anap fluorescence at −100 mV was 137.5 ± 16 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). To measure the recovery rate of VDP, we used a new voltage protocol applying a −100 mV recovery pulse of variable durations after a +60 mV prepulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). With an increased duration of the −100 mV pulse, the VDP gradually disappeared; a 500 ms recovery pulse shifted the V<sub>1/2</sub> back to the control value without the +60 mV prepulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The recovery of the peak tail-current amplitude happened in a similar but somewhat slower time frame compared to the V<sub>1/2</sub> recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). The time constant of the V<sub>1/2</sub> recovery of wild-type channels was not significantly different from the time constant of the recovery of Anap fluorescence (p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Overall these tmFRET experiments demonstrate that there is a rearrangement between the eag domain and CNBHD that exhibits the same ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependence, voltage-dependence, and kinetics as VDP. Combined with our finding that VDP is altered or eliminated by mutations of the eag domain and CNBHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), these experiments suggest that the VDP is produced partially or fully by a slow open-state dependent rearrangement of the direct interaction between the eag domain and CNBHD, which stabilizes the opening of the channel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we show zELK channels exhibit VDP that results from the channel undergoing a slow state-dependent transition to a mode with a more favorable opening transition. We then show that the VDP transition involves an interaction between the intracellular N-terminal eag domain and C-terminal CNBHD. Combining transition metal ion FRET, patch-clamp fluorometry, and incorporation of a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid, we show a rearrangement between the eag domain and CNBHD that exhibits the same ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependence, voltage-dependence, and kinetics as VDP. We proposed that this rearrangement of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction is coupled to channel opening and underlies VDP in these channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). VDP of mammalian ELK and ERG channels appears to be an adaptation to dampen the hyperexitability of neurons and cardiac tissue.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that hELK1 is downregulated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, we found that excision of the patch causes a run-up of the current that is prevented by the presence of ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This downregulation by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is unusual in ion channels which are generally upregulated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hille et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, for both hELK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and zELK, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> degradation leaves the channels in a potentiated mode that no longer undergoes VDP. These results suggest that VDP could result from a simple mechanism where PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binds with higher affinity to the closed state of the channel than the open state, and unbinds slowly upon depolarization. This mechanism could account for our ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependence and voltage-dependence of VDP. It would suggest that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulation is linked to a rearrangement of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction. However, hERG channels are also thought to undergo VDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodchild et al., 2015</xref>) but are not appreciably regulated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kruse and Hille, 2013</xref>). The precise role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in VDP has yet to be fully understood.</p><p>The interaction between the eag domain and CNBHD has been well studied in ERG and EAG channels. Direct interaction between the eag domain and CNBHD in hERG channels has been demonstrated by multiple approaches including FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gianulis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gustina and Trudeau, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2013</xref>). In hERG channels, the eag domain-CNBHD interaction is necessary to maintain the slow deactivation and normal inactivation of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gianulis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gustina and Trudeau, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2013</xref>). Furthermore, the eag domain-CNBHD interface of ERG channels is altered in some forms of long QT syndrome and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huffaker et al., 2009</xref>). In EAG channels, direct interaction between the EAG domain and CNBHD was demonstrated using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haitin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>). Indeed, the eag domain-CNBHD complex has been shown to adopt two closely related but different conformations in X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haitin et al., 2013</xref>). These two conformations of the complex predict a small change in the distances between the eag domain and CNBHD. Breaking the critical salt bridge between eag domain and CNBHD significantly altered activation gating in EAG channels. Moreover, mutations at this interface of EAG channels have being associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haitin et al., 2013</xref>). For both ERG and EAG channels, the interaction has been shown to be intersubunit rather than intrasubunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gianulis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>). It appears that intersubunit eag domain-CNBHD interactions are a general self-regulatory mechanism among all three subfamilies of KCNH channels, EAG, ERG, and ELK; though the forms of regulation are different for the individual channels.</p><p>Our experiments with zELK suggest that the intracellular domains are responsible for the VDP. We hypothesize that, for KCNH channels, a rearrangement of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction is necessary for VDP. Moreover, we suggest that there is a rearrangement of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction coupled to the opening of the channel. Since the rearrangement is coupled to opening, it occurs preferentially at depolarized voltage and stabilizes channel opening. Indeed, thermodynamics dictates that any open state-dependent transition will stabilize channel opening. Therefore, while the molecular mechanism for VDP might be distinct for different channels, the presence of a slow state-dependent transition might be a general theme that underlies the VDP of all channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>The full length <italic>D. rerio</italic> zELK construct (GI: 159570347) was synthesized (Bio Basic, Amherst, NY) and subcloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector that contained a C-terminal YFP, a T7 promoter and 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions of a Xenopus β-globin gene.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular mechanism of voltage-dependent potentiation of KCNH potassium channels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Baron Chanda (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew Trudeau (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Dai and Zagotta explore the molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie voltage-dependent potentiation (VDP) in KCNH family of potassium channels. Previous studies have shown that VDP is eliminated in excised patches due to hydrolysis of PIP2. Here, the authors find that this potentiation can be maintained if supplemented by ATP and Mg. This ability to study VDP in excised patches allowed the authors to apply techniques such as patch clamp fluorometry to track conformational changes that underlie voltage-dependent potentiation. They find that the transition metal ion-FRET between labeled EAG domain and CNBHD increases upon depolarization and this increase is not observed in absence of ATP. They also show that VDP closely tracks the strength of interaction between these two domains; when an intersubunit salt bridge between EAG and CNBHD is disrupted, VDP is attenuated but it can be restored by charge swapping mutations.</p><p>This is a technical tour de force using a fluorescent non-canonical amino acid (L-ANAP) incorporation, tmFRET with ANAP-containing channels and Co<sup>2+</sup>, and patch-clamp fluorometry to simultaneously detect structural rearrangements and function in ELK channels. Overall, this is an elegant mechanistic study that illustrates at a molecular level how KCNH family of ion channels is potentiated by depolarizing voltage pulses. In addition, this study shines new light on why many disease causing mutations occur at the interface of these two domains which presumably disrupts VDP.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: Even in absence of di-Histidines, ELK channels show some non-specific binding at that site.

Were they observed in other TM-FRET experiments?</italic> </p><p>The small quenching in the absence of dihistidine is not non-specific binding to that same site (which is no longer a possible binding site for Co<sup>2+</sup>), but is instead probably a mixture of collisional quenching, and Co<sup>2+</sup> binding to another site. Therefore this background quenching did not change in a prepulse-dependent manner. We have clarified this in the text. These non-specific effects are common and have been observed in other tmFRET papers (e.g. Taraska et al., 2009). We have also inserted a section describing our FRET efficiency calculation and correction of the non-specific quenching in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>.
