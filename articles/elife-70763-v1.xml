Historically animal models were often selected because they reproduced certain clinical or pathological features of human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hau, 2008</xref>), and their use has often been reinforced when treatments effective in the model were found to be effective in humans. However, this approach has limitations, because the same clinical or pathological features can occur as a result of different biological processes, and mechanisms that may be important in human disease might not be recapitulated or may be redundant in animal models, and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pound and Ritskes-Hoitinga, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Justice and Dhillon, 2016</xref>). A fundamental and largely unresolved question is how best to define or quantify the relevance of any given animal model to the corresponding human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Justice and Dhillon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mice are the most widely used model animals for many diseases, including infectious diseases, and for study of corresponding protective or pathogenic immune responses. Mouse models have significantly broadened our understanding of the function and structure of mammalian immune systems and disease mechanisms. Despite the evolutionary distance between human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>) and the high evolutionary pressure on immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cagliani and Sironi, 2013</xref>), the principles of the immune systems for these species remain remarkably similar. However, there are also numerous differences between mice and humans in terms of their response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is inevitable that mouse models of infection will not recapitulate all features of the human response, and this should be taken into account when using models to make inferences about mechanisms of human disease. Recently, we and others proposed that unbiased approaches to assessment of the host response to infection, such as comparison of transcriptomic responses, might provide a meaningful way to quantify similarities between mouse models and human disease, to assess the relevance of the models, and to aid the selection of the best models for specific hypothesis testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>The relevance of mouse models for translational research on the pathogenesis of severe malaria (SM) has been particularly controversial and has polarized the malaria research community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Craig et al., 2012</xref>). There are many different mouse malaria models, with very different characteristics dependening on the combination of parasite species (and strain) and mouse strain which are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>). Superficially these models can, between them, reproduce almost all the clinical manifestations of human SM, such as coma, seizures, respiratory distress, and severe anemia (SA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zuzarte-Luis et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, there are also notable differences to human disease, such as the lack of the pathognomonic cytoadhesive sequestration of large numbers of parasite-infected red cells in the cerebral microvasculature in mice with cerebral malaria-like illness (experimental cerebral malaria, ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ghazanfari et al., 2018</xref>). In C57BL/6 mice infected with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA, ECM is dependent on recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the brain, a phenomenon that was recently shown to also occur in human cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Riggle et al., 2020</xref>). C57BL/6 mice infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> NK65 develop acute lung injury with similarities to malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS), associated with hemozoin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deroost et al., 2013</xref>), endothelial activation, and alveolar edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zuzarte-Luis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van den Steen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claser et al., 2019</xref>). SA can occur in C57BL/6 mice infected with all of the most commonly used mouse malaria parasite species (<italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS, <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XL, <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XNL, <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA, and <italic>P. berghei</italic> NK65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thawani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niikura et al., 2008</xref>), sharing features with human SM anemia such as hemolysis, hemozoin-, and inflammatory cytokine-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thawani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lamikanra et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Many host-directed treatments for SM have been effective in mice, but none have yet translated into benefit in human studies, which has been considered by some as evidence that mechanisms of disease in mouse models are of little relevance to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">White et al., 2010</xref>). We contend that this polarization of views is unhelpful, and that mouse models are likely to be useful for understanding human malaria, so long as they are used selectively with full recognition of their limitations. Such limitations include: mice are not the natural hosts for the commonly used rodent malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>) natural infection of humans occurs through sporozoite inoculation during mosquito feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rénia and Goh, 2016</xref>), but mice are often infected by injection of blood-stage parasites to ensure a reproducible inoculum of parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Craig et al., 2012</xref>) malaria naïve mice are typically used in experiments, whereas most human malaria infections occur in endemic settings where individuals have had previous malaria infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doolan et al., 2009</xref>) mice often tolerate higher parasitemias than those seen in human infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fontana et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In order to provide a more quantitative framework to understand how well mouse malaria models recapitulate the biological processes occurring in human malaria, and to aid selection of the most appropriate models for study of specific mechanisms of disease, we present an unbiased investigation of the similarities and differences in the host response between human malaria and mouse models using comparative transcriptomics. We demonstrate that this approach allows us to identify mouse models with the greatest similarity of host response to specific human malaria phenotypes, and that models selected in this way do indeed have similar clinical and pathological features to those of the corresponding human phenotype. We propose that this approach should be applied more broadly to the selection of the most relevant animal models for study of malaria and other human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse models of malaria</title><p>The five rodent malaria parasite strains used in this study produce different kinetics of parasitemia, different rates of progression of illness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and different disease manifestations.

Rather than directly comparing the expression of orthologous genes in humans and mice, which would be confounded by species-specific differences in constitutive gene expression, we first identified differentially expressed genes in pairwise within-species comparisons and then used these differentially expressed genes as the basis for between-species comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This also enabled us to conduct within-species adjustment for variation in leukocyte cell mixture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), which is an important confounder in whole blood gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2018b</xref>). Additionally, this allows for the removal of platform-specific effects, which is especially relevant for comparisons between data generated by microarray and RNA-Seq.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of host differential gene expression in human uncomplicated malaria and early stage illness in five mouse malaria models.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustration of the comparative transcriptomic analysis.

In the former situation, changes in gene expression associated with infection per se are best characterized by comparison between healthy and infected states, whereas in the latter situation it may be more appropriate to compare severe and non-severe infection states.</p><p>To investigate concordance of the host response to uncomplicated malaria (UM) in humans and mice, we first focussed on comparisons between subjects with UM and healthy uninfected subjects. To assess changes in gene expression due to naturally acquired <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria, we used two human transcriptomic data sets previously published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Idaghdour et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boldt et al., 2019</xref>, each of which included a healthy uninfected group and an uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). As an additional comparison with infection in malaria naïve humans, we used a previously published data set from controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in malaria-naïve adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Milne et al., 2021</xref>) before infection and on the day of first symptoms. For mice, we identified changes in gene expression occurring between healthy uninfected control mice and infected mice at first onset of visible signs of illness.</p><p>To reduce confounding by infection-induced changes in the relative proportions of different leukocyte populations and large differences in leukocyte proportions between humans and mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), all primary differential expression analyses were performed with adjustment for the proportions of the major leukocyte populations (see Materials and methods; unadjusted results are also available for reference in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3 supp4 supp5">Supplementary files 2-5</xref>). Genes with absolute log-fold change in expression &gt;1 in the human healthy control vs UM comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6 supp7">Supplementary files 6 and 7</xref>) and their mouse orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>) were used for comparison between species.</p><p>First, considering only whether genes were upregulated or downregulated by infection in the mouse models, we found the mouse models varied from 58% to 73% concordance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with the upregulation or downregulation in the human subjects in the study by Idaghdour et al. However, we reasoned that the relative magnitude of changes in gene expression is also important to identify the mouse models which most closely recapitulate the changes in gene expression in human malaria. To assess this, we ranked genes to account for the relative magnitude of change in expression in human malaria, and then performed a principal component analysis (PCA) with rank-weighted changes in expression (see Materials and methods). This revealed variation between the mouse models, but no model was clearly much more representative of the changes in gene expression in human UM than any other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Indeed, when we focused only on the expression of the 20 most differentially expressed genes in human UM, we found that the mouse models showed broadly similar patterns of changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). When we examined the concordance of upregulation and downregulation of gene expression between the mouse models and human malaria in the Boldt et al. data set, we found less overall similarity between species in the direction of changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Despite this, and different genes driving the axes of variation, the PCA plots revealed a remarkably similar pattern to the analysis based on the Idaghdour et al. data set, and none of the mouse models appeared to be clearly more representative of human UM than any other when accounting for the magnitude of changes in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Considering the most differentially expressed genes, there was more heterogeneity in the pattern of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) which may be partly explained by the substantially smaller size, and analysis of pooled samples in the Boldt et al. study. Comparing differential gene expression from the mice with that of malaria naïve humans undergoing CHMI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>) resulted in PCA plots broadly similar to those derived using the naturally acquired UM subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>), yielding similar inferences about concordance between uncomplicated or early stage infections in mice and humans.</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis was used to examine the genes driving the axes of variation between humans and mouse models in the PCA plots. For the Idaghdour et al. data set, we found that PC1 showed enrichment of leukocyte mediated immunity and adaptive immune response, while PC2 showed enrichment for intrinsic apoptotic signaling in response to oxidative stress and regulation of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). For the Boldt et al. data set comparison, we found that that PC1 showed enrichment of cytokine-mediated signaling pathways and hemopoiesis as the top GO terms, while for PC2 the top GO terms included immune system process and myeloid cell development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). These pathways are consistent with well-characterized aspects of the early host response to malaria, in which parasites are sensed by pattern recognition receptors, promoting the production of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gowda and Wu, 2018</xref>), and ensuing mobilization of early myeloid progenitors from bone marrow to establish emergency myelopoiesis in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nahrendorf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belyaev et al., 2013</xref>). Proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines play important roles in shaping T-cell activation and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Urban et al., 2005</xref>). Reactive oxygen species produced by phagocytic cells in response to parasites, and through cell-free heme released during hemolysis, contribute to inflammation and tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vasquez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the Milne et al. CHMI data set, the top GO terms for PC1 were related to bacterial and interferon-γ responses, whilst PC2 was related to viral and interferon-γ responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). These again are consistent with the earliest innate responses to malaria parasites, with timing and duration of IFN-γ production being important determinants of whether its effects are protective or pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">King et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walther et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hermsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Souza et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitchell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Villegas-Mendez et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparative analysis of severe malaria-associated changes in gene expression</title><p>A common approach to identify processes associated with the pathogenesis of severe infection is to compare individuals with severe manifestations against other individuals who have the same infection but have not developed severe illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2018a</xref>). This approach is expected to enrich for genes involved in the pathogenesis of severe illness from amongst the larger set of genes involved in the overall response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2018a</xref>).

The finding that neutrophil degranulation and myeloid leukocyte activation pathway genes account for the greatest variation between human SM phenotypes and the mouse models is consistent with increasing evidence that different aspects of neutrophil function could contribute to pathogenesis or protection from SM in both humans and some mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knackstedt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Georgiadou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feintuch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sercundes et al., 2016</xref>).

Nevertheless, mice are distant evolutionarily and differ substantially from humans in many ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liao and Zhang, 2008</xref>). Disease models in mice often involve artificial induction of disease, which may reduce complexity and aid reproducibility, but might also limit their translational relevance. Therapeutic interventions that work in mice often fail when used in human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bugelski and Martin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hünig, 2012</xref>). As a result, the usefulness of mice in some areas of translational research is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seok et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, concerted efforts have been made to improve both scientific and ethical aspects of the use of animals in biomedical research, with emphasis on the principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement (the “3Rs”), and improving reproducibility through better experimental design and standardized reporting guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>). Despite this, there has been little parallel effort made to assess or improve the relevance of animal models in translational research, and approaches that would improve translation from mice to humans are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Normand et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In malaria research, mouse models are widely used but their relevance to human disease is contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Craig et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we objectively assessed the biological processes occurring in blood in some of the most commonly used mouse models of malaria to examine their similarity to human malaria, using a comparative transcriptomic approach. The five rodent malaria parasites, we used led to the development of distinct disease trajectories and clinical features. Whilst no rodent malaria parasites induced changes in gene expression which fully recapitulated those in human malaria, at an early stage of infection, the rodent malaria parasites induced relatively similar transcriptional host responses to each other, with at least a broad overall similarity to that seen in a large study of UM in African children, and CHMI in malaria naïve adults. However, when we investigated the similarity of the changes in gene expression associated with different SM manifestations, we saw that there was more heterogeneity, and the concordance and discordance of expression of individual genes varied more between each mouse model and each phenotype. One of the greatest sources of variation between the mouse models was in the myeloid cell response, particularly neutrophil response, associated with SM manifestations.</p><p>An important implication of our findings is that the selection of the most appropriate mouse model for investigation of a particular mechanism of interest should not be made solely on the similarity of clinical phenotype in humans and mice. We propose that it should also be based on the degree of concordance of expression of genes associated with the mechanism of interest. Failure to consider the similarities and differences in biological processes indicated by gene expression could lead to experiments targeting pathways that are not involved in the host response to a particular mouse malaria parasite, making the experiments futile, unethical, and potentially leading to erroneous conclusions.</p><p>We identified that the pattern of changes in gene expression between early and late stages of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XL infected mice showed the greatest similarity to the differences in gene expression between human UM and each of HL, CM, CH, and SA, suggesting that this model might be most representative of the profile of changes in host response induced by human SM. This mouse model not only develops a very high parasite load, but our data suggest lethality at 5–7 days post-infection is part of a multisystem disorder, accompanied by extreme hyperlactatemia at levels similar to those seen in human HL and CH. Until now, the lack of a rodent model to study malaria-induced hyperlactatemia has held back understanding of the mechanisms causing such high levels of lactate and how these relate to the increased risk of death in patients with malaria. <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XL infection of C57BL/6J mice is an attractive model for further translational research on this SM phenotype.</p><p>In the brains of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XL infected mice, we identified extravascular fibrinogen leak. This suggests that these mice may be in the process of developing a neurological syndrome at the time they reach the humane endpoint and may explain why this model showed transcriptional similarity to human CM. The transcriptional similarity of Py17XL to the human SA phenotype is consistent with the SA and high parasite load which occurs in this infection.</p><p>Despite Py17XL appearing to have the closest overall transcriptional similarity to human SM syndromes, we identified many genes with discordant expression, and Py17XL infection may not recapitulate all pathophysiological features of human SM. The maximum parasitemia (~80%) seen in Py17XL infection is much higher than that typically seen in human SM (~10%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cunnington et al., 2013</xref>), although the sequestration of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red cells in human SM means that total parasite load may be several fold-higher than indicated by peripheral blood parasitemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cunnington et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our study provides important insights into the translational relevance of commonly used mouse models of malaria, and more generally highlights the importance of considering relevance in addition to the 3Rs and reproducibility when planning any animal experiments. Our data are provided as a resource for researchers to help them to determine the concordance of gene expression between mouse malaria models and human disease, and we have identified an attractive mouse model for further translational studies on malarial hyperlactatemia. A strength of analyzing the blood transcriptome is that it represents the systemic host response to infection, capturing both the direct influence of an infectious agent on blood leukocytes, and the response of blood leukocytes to mediators released into the circulation by cells in other organs. However, the blood transcriptome cannot assess the concordance of processes occurring within specific organs that do not produce changes in gene expression of circulating leukocytes, and our data should not be used to prevent testing of reasonable hypotheses about such tissue-specific interactions. Reassuringly, our findings were broadly consistent when we performed comparisons across independent studies conducted in different locations and using different transcriptomic methods. Stronger and more generalizable conclusions, and more nuanced approaches to analysis may be possible if future studies add to the data we have collected, with larger numbers of mice and greater sequencing depth. Future work should also assess other commonly used mouse malaria models, using additional common mouse strains (including Balb/c and DBA/2) and outbred mice, both sexes, additional parasite strains, and mosquito-transmitted infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Owing to the long-standing controversy regarding the relevance of mouse models to human disease pathogenesis and immune responses, the underlying purpose of the study is valuable.</p><p>1) The authors should more clearly inform readers of fundamental differences between the mouse models and human malaria infections they study that will contribute to differences, including:</p><p>– Humans but not mice are the natural host for their corresponding parasites.</p><p>– Human infection is initiated by sporozoite inoculation vs blood stage in their models.</p><p>– Human Pf densities are far below the values seen in the Py17XL mouse model.</p><p>– Humans here are malaria-experienced while mice are malaria-naïve in this study.</p><p>2) An essential aspect is that the models used need to be extremely well defined (mouse strain (sex and age,.), parasite origins and mode of propagation, etc..) and referenced.</p><p>3) The transcriptomics data should be more carefully analyzed and discussed for all the possible confounding factors. For example, reporting of the analyses should be expanded to better evaluate the inferences, further dataset comparisons are warranted and should not be difficult (Lee vs Boldt human datasets; early mice vs human CHMI; perhaps severe to non-severe mice).</p><p>Provide a better comparison population for UM. For example, please to add a public CHMI dataset in naïve humans. Pre-severe (i.e., early) is not the same as UM. Also, please add some public mouse data.</p><p>4) Much of the signal is an artifact of adding covariates for cell-populations to their models-especially since flow-based vs. inferred abundances are completely confounded with mouse/human. The effect of correcting for cell counts in the mice versus by transcriptomic deconvolution in human datasets should be made clearer in the methods, as the current wording on the human datasets is confusing by stating these &quot;had already been adjusted for variation in leukocyte proportions&quot;.</p><p>5) The top gene lists and PCs (pathway enrichments) are not coherent. The heatmaps of the genes driving the PCA plots/pathways need to be shown as well as the extended list of pathway enrichments.</p><p>6) Outline the existing dogma about which mouse models best represent particular human syndromes, the hypothesized pathogeneses which are or are not seen in mouse models. The pathways/processes in their comparisons should be addressed. This might also help with the concerns about the Py17XL conclusions; while the Py17XL is interesting, these claims should be toned down.</p><p>7) Provide correct labels for supplemental material.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Additional points</p><p>1. Definition of the different mouse models: The authors should describe in more detail their parasites and mouse strain used. This is essential since it has been shown in many studies that different host/parasite combinations may lead to different infections or pathological outcomes. The authors should give more details on the origin of their parasites (provide references); Do consider a PCR or some other method to confirm that the different Plasmodium strains used are correct. This will contribute to the scientific rigor of the manuscript.</p><p>Are these cloned lines? Please state how they were propagated, i.e., through mosquitoes or blood transfer? Were they passaged in the same mouse strain? It has been shown that passaging the parasites through different mouse strains alters their virulence (Amani et al., Infect Immun, 1990).</p><p>Also, there are conflicting reports for P. yoelii 1XNL. Some labs have reported that this parasites strain is not uniformly lethal in B6 mice, contrary to BALB/c mice (Miyakoda et al., Front Immunol, 2018; Azcarate et al., Plos One, 2014). This may also depend on the dose of parasites and the site of injections used to initiate the infections. To add to the discussion, the best comparison should have been done with outbred mice such as Swiss mice, to mimic what happens in humans., and infection through mosquito bites.</p><p>2. The P yoelii 17XL is an interesting model for hyperlactatemia, a pathology that has been understudied. However, the cerebral microvascular pathology in PY17XL is not clearly defined as proposed. There is no evidence that Py17XNL cytoadhere to endothelial cells and sequester (an essential pathway in Human severe malaria and P. berghei ANKA).</p><p>3. Precise if the B6 mice use are B6/J or B6/N.</p><p>4. A missing analysis is with a comparison between the Gambian and the Gabonese. Are they concordant? And if not in which pathways.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Given the points raised above in the public review, the authors should justify (or adjust) their decision to compare malaria-naïve mice to malaria-experienced humans, rather than to malaria-naïve humans for whom numerous transcriptomes have been reported from controlled infection studies-to compare responses to &quot;uncomplicated human malaria&quot; vs &quot;early mouse infection timepoints&quot;. This could contribute the poor concordance by PCA.</p><p>For comparisons of &quot;uncomplicated malaria&quot;/early timepoints, the PCA shows poor concordance for any model, whereas the most differentially expressed human genes show some correspondence to the different mouse models. &quot;Severe malaria&quot; shows the converse: PCA shows strong concordance for Py17XL with some human syndromes, but poor concordance for the 20 most differentially expressed human genes. The authors should better explain this apparent discrepancy in the results, which raises questions about the robustness of their inferences and approach.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Title: &quot;translationally relevant processes&quot; is an awkward construction and will be confusing in a title that includes the word &quot;transcriptomic&quot;.</p><p>L27 &quot;between species and across all models&quot; Please clarify for readers whether species refers to human vs mouse and not &quot;between parasite species&quot;.</p><p>L 52 &quot;Recently it has been proposed&quot; Probably fairer to readers if the authors state &quot;Recently we proposed&quot; or &quot;we and others&quot;.</p><p>L85 &quot;five rodent malaria parasite species&quot;-I think 3 species (Py, Pb, Pc) are studied here, with two lines/strains each representing Py and Pb.</p><p>L 142 &quot;mouse models varied from 58 to 73% concordance&quot; This sounds pretty good, but the authors should make it easier for readers to understand (in the main narrative) how they arrived at the subset of genes included in each analysis, which varied between comparisons (when one digs into File S6, which is labeled &quot;&quot;95442_0_supp_2049414_q3f8vp). Can the authors assign a p value in some way to tell us how likely this may have been due to chance? File S6 has spreadsheets counts/proportions of mouse transcripts aligned to 3 human studies, which indicate that these proportions considered only the genes that were either concordant (&quot;same direction&quot;) and discordant (&quot;different direction&quot;). How were genes with minimal change in the mice counted, and what proportion of these genes that really showed no meaningful change in the mice were nevertheless assigned a count in one direction or the other?</p><p>Lines 165-170 &quot;PC1 showed enrichment…&quot; it's not clear how the authors distilled the long list of GO terms in File S7 to report the few responses they list as driving PC1 and PC2 in their PCA analysis. Authors should clarify this.</p><p>Figure 1-do the authors have data on anemia in their models that can be provided? This is relevant to their comparison of the models to cases of severe anemia. If no data, they could helpfully provide information from the literature where available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– PCA plots of only the first 2 PCs were used to assess similarities and differences. GO enrichments were only performed on the genes driving these first 2 PCs. So, if PC1 in Figure 1B reflects a range of differences in 'enrichment of leukocyte immunity and adaptive immune response', from human on the left, PbNK65 and Py17XL in the middle, and PbANKA/Py17XNL/PcAS on the far right, what does this mean in terms of this GO for each cluster?</p><p>– It's helpful to see the top 20 DE genes in human in a heatmap with mouse, but the PCs are driven by different genes, and it's not clear if only these 10 were used for pathway enrichments, and how they compare across models and species. The largest drivers of variation may actually be less interesting than lower PCs b/c they may just be reflecting cell population corrections.</p><p>– To assess DE in severe disease, the authors compared early vs. late timepoints, citing PMID: 29695497. This review highlights that many changes are already present at early timepoints. This is concerning because DE in the human studies was done by comparing μm vs. SM, which are different disease classes (i.e., μm is not that same as pre-symptomatic).</p><p>– The overarching conclusion seems to be that Py17XL is the best match for all human studies. Much has been published on which mouse models are canonical for specific human syndromes, and where there are similarities and differences between our understanding of pathogenesis. It would add considerable values to this paper to include a summary of the key pathways in these mouse models, where they agree/disagree with human pathogenesis hypotheses, and then highlight these specific pathways in your analyses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70763.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study represents a comparison of transcriptomic changes in malaria-infected mice versus humans to determine whether and which mouse malaria model(s) correspond to human malaria responses.

Interestingly the major inferences about relationships between early stages of infection in mouse models and in human malaria remain very similar to those derived from the uncomplicated malaria subjects in endemic populations.</p><p>We undertook an extensive search of the available literature for public datasets of the mouse blood transcriptome at comparable stages of infection.
