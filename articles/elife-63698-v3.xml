that segregate with the embryonic germline. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos, germ (P) granule assembly requires MEG-3, an intrinsically disordered protein that forms RNA-rich condensates on the surface of PGL condensates at the core of P granules. MEG-3 is related to the GCNA family and contains an N-terminal disordered region (IDR) and a predicted ordered C-terminus featuring an HMG-like motif (HMGL). We find that MEG-3 is a modular protein that uses its IDR to bind RNA and its C-terminus to drive condensation. The HMGL motif mediates binding to PGL-3 and is required for co-assembly of MEG-3 and PGL-3 condensates in vivo. Mutations in HMGL cause MEG-3 and PGL-3 to form separate condensates that no longer co-segregate to the germline or recruit RNA. Our findings highlight the importance of protein-based condensation mechanisms and condensate-condensate interactions in the assembly of RNA-rich germ granules.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA granule</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>germ plasm</kwd><kwd>P granule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R37HD037047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Putnam</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM134630</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Putnam</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name><name><surname>Rasoloson</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>P granule assembly depends in part on protein-protein interactions that drive condensation independent of RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In animals with germ plasm, specification of the germline depends on the segregation of maternal RNAs and proteins (germline determinants) to the primordial germ cells. Germline determinants assemble in germ granules, micron-sized dense assemblies that concentrate RNA and RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jamieson-Lucy and Mullins, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marnik and Updike, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seydoux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trcek and Lehmann, 2019</xref>). Superficially, germ granules resemble RNA-rich condensates that form in the cytoplasm of somatic cells, including P bodies and stress granules. In recent years, much progress has been made in our understanding of stress granule assembly with the realization that stress granules resemble liquid condensates that assemble by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS is a thermodynamic process that causes interacting molecules to dynamically partition between a dense condensed phase and a more dilute phase (e.g., the cytoplasm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016</xref>). Low-affinity-binding interactions, often involving disordered and RNA-binding domains, are sufficient to drive LLPS of proteins and RNA in reconstituted systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zagrovic et al., 2018</xref>). The ability of RNA to phase separate in the absence of proteins in vitro has also been proposed to contribute to RNA granule assembly in vivo, especially in the case of stress granules, whichÂ arise under conditions of general translational arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tauber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van Treeck et al., 2018</xref>). An emerging model is that the combined action of many low-affinity interactions between RNA molecules and multivalent RNA-binding proteins creates RNA-based protein networks that drive LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">GuillÃ©n-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the dynamic condensates assembled by LLPS in vitro, germ granules are not well-mixed, single-phase liquid droplets. High-resolution microscopy has revealed that germ granules are heterogenous assemblies of dynamic and less dynamic condensates that co-assemble but do not fully mix. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ granules contain non-dynamic RNA clusters embedded in dynamic, protein-rich condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Little et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niepielko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>). Germ granules in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> are built on an amyloid-like scaffold that organizes mRNAs in nonoverlapping, transcript-specific zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roovers et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanisms that bring together condensates with different material properties and their contribution to RNA recruitment in germ granules are not well understood.</p><p>In this study, we examine the assembly of P granules, germ granules in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. At the core of P granules are liquid condensates assembled by PGL proteins. PGL-1 and PGL-3 are self-dimerizing, RGG domain proteins that readily form condensates able to recruit other P granule components, such as the VASA-related RNA helicase GLH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Updike et al., 2011</xref>). PGL condensates exist in germ cells throughout oogenesis and are maternallyÂ inherited by the embryo. In newly fertilized zygotes, the surface of PGL condensates becomes covered by smaller condensates assembled by MEG-3 and MEG-4, two homologous intrinsicallyÂ disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike PGL condensates, MEG-3 condensates resist dilution and salt challenge, consistent with a gel-like material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). (In this study, we use the term condensate to refer to concentrated protein assemblies that self-assemble without implying a mechanism for assembly, which could involve aggregation, LLPS, or other mechanisms, and may or may not include RNA.) During zygote polarization, MEG-3 and MEG-4 condensates enrich with other germ plasm components in the posterior cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This relocalization correlates with preferential growth of MEG-coated PGL droplets in the posterior and dissolution of ânakedâ PGL droplets in the anterior side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to PGL and MEG co-assemblies, P granules also concentrate specific maternal transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Parker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seydoux and Fire, 1994</xref>). A survey of mRNAs that immunoprecipitate with PGL-1 and MEG-3 suggests that MEG-3 is most directly responsible for recruiting mRNAs to P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). MEG-3 binds toÂ ~500 maternal mRNAs, including transcripts coding for germline determinants. Recruitment of mRNAs to P granules ensures their preferential segregation to the primordial germ cells. Embryos lacking MEG-3 and MEG-4 do not localize PGL droplets, do not condense P granule-associated mRNAs, and display partially penetrant (30%) sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To understand how MEG-3 coordinates PGL and RNA condensation, we used genome editing of the <italic>meg-3</italic> locus and reconstitution experiments in vitro to define functional domains in MEG-3. We find that MEG-3 is a bifunctional protein with separate domains for RNA recruitment and protein condensation. We identify a predicted ordered motif (HMGL) required for binding to PGL-3 in vitro that is essential to build MEG-3/PGL-3 co-assemblies that recruit RNA in vivo. The MEG-3 IDR binds RNA and enriches MEG-3 in germ plasm but is not sufficient on its own to assemble RNA-rich condensates. Our observations highlight the importance of condensation driven by protein-protein interactions in the assembly of germ granules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MEG-3 C-terminus is the primary driver of MEG-3 condensation in zygotes</title><p>IUPred2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MÃ©szÃ¡ros et al., 2018</xref>) predicts in the MEG-3 sequence a N-terminal domain with high disorder and a C-terminal domain with lower disorder separated by a boundary region with mixed order/disorder (aa544â698)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). The C-terminus contains a predicted ordered 44 amino acid sequence (aa700â744) with homology to the HMG-like-fold found in the GCNA family of intrinsicallyÂ disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Like MEG-3, GCNA family members contain long N-terminal disordered domains, but these do not share sequence homology with the MEG-3 IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmell et al., 2016</xref>). To test the functionality of MEG-3 domains in vivo, we used CRISPR genome editing to create four MEG-3 derivatives at the endogenous locus: MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> (aa545â862); MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> (aa1â544); MEG-3<sub>698</sub>,Â an extended version of MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> terminating right before the HMG-like motif; and MEG-3<sub>HMGL-</sub>, a full-length MEG-3 variant with alanine substitutions in four conserved residues in the HMG-like motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). (We also constructed a MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> (aa545â862) variant with mutations in the HMG-like motif, but this variant was not expressed at sufficiently high levels for analysis.) The MEG-3 variants were created in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> line where the <italic>meg-4</italic> locus was deleted to avoid possible complementation by MEG-4, a close MEG-3 paralog. To allow visualization of MEG-3 protein by immunofluorescence, each variant (and wild-type <italic>meg-3</italic>) was tagged with a C-terminal OLLAS peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Before polarization, MEG-3 was uniformly distributed throughout the zygote. After polarization, MEG-3 in the cytoplasm and in condensates became enriched in the posterior half of the zygote destined for the germline blastomere P<sub>1</sub> (âgerm plasmâ).

The HMGL domain is not required for condensation in vitro but is required for maximal condensation efficiency in vivo. We suggest the HMGL domain enhances condensation indirectly in vivo by concentrating MEG-3 on the surface of PGL droplets, which stimulates condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). Docking of P bodies on stress granules has been proposed to involve RNA:RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tauber et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we find that docking of MEG-3 condensates on PGL condensates does not require RNA in vitro and can occur in the absence of any visible RNA enrichment in vivo. Most strikingly, mutations in the HMGL domain that prevent binding between MEG-3 and PGL-3 molecules in solution prevent docking of MEG-3 and PGL condensates in vivo. Together, these observations suggest that MEG-3 condensation and co-assembly with PGL-3 condensates is driven primarily by protein-protein interactions and does not require RNA.Â We note that the HMGL domain is dispensable for co-assembly of MEG-3 and PGL-3 condensates in vitro, indicating that our condensation assay conditions do not fully reproduce the stringent environment of the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Efficient MEG-3/PGL co-assembly correlates with stabilization of PGL droplets in germ plasm</title><p>We previously reported that enrichment of PGL droplets to the posterior of the zygote requires <italic>meg-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Our new findings suggest that this activity is linked to MEG-3âs ability to associate stably with the PGL interface. MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub>, which is sufficient for MEG-3/PGL co-assembly, is sufficient to localize PGL in zygotes. Conversely, MEG-3<sub>HMGL-</sub> condensates, which do not interact stably with PGL condensates, fail to enrich PGL condensates in the posterior of zygotes. PGL localization involves preferential growth and dissolution of PGL droplets in the anterior and posterior, respectively. One possibility is that tight binding of MEG condensates lowers the surface tension of PGL droplets allowing MEG/PGL co-assemblies in the posterior to grow at the expense of the less stable, ânakedâ PGL droplets in the anterior.</p><p>What enriches MEG-3 condensates in the posterior? We previously hypothesized that MEG-3 asymmetry is driven by a competition for RNA between the MEG-3 IDR and MEX-5, an RNA-binding protein that acts as an RNA sink in the anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, the MEG-3 IDR is sufficient to enrich MEG-3 in posterior cytoplasm. Unexpectedly, however, we found that the MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> condenses preferentially in the zygote posterior despite uniform distribution in the cytoplasm, suggesting that additional mechanisms acting on the MEG-3 C-terminus contribute to MEG-3 regulation in space. Consistent with this view, a recent study examining MEG-3 dynamics by single-molecule imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) found that the slowlyÂ diffusing MEG-3 molecules that populate the MEG-3 gradient in the cytoplasm represent a distinct population of MEG-3 molecules from those that associate with PGL droplets. We propose that MEG-3 asymmetry is sustained by two independent mechanisms: one acting on the MEG-3 C-terminus that biases condensation of MEG-3 in posterior cytoplasm and one acting on the MEG-3 IDR that enriches MEG-3 molecules in posterior cytoplasm. We speculate that the latter may serve to segregate high levels of MEG-3 to P blastomeres needed to support PGL asymmetry through the P<sub>4</sub> stage. Consistent with this view, the MEG-3<sub>Cterm,</sub> which does not enrich in a gradient, is not sufficient to localize PGL condensates in P blastomeres past the four-cell stage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MEG-3 condensation on PGL droplets creates a platform for RNA recruitment</title><p>The MEG-3 IDR binds RNA with high-affinity in vitro but is not sufficient to enrich RNA in vivo despite forming some condensates. RNA recruitment in vivo additionally requires the MEG-3 C-terminus including the HMG-like motif. These observations suggest that maximal MEG-3 condensation is essential to build a protein scaffold that can support stable RNA recruitment in vivo. Separate domains for RNA-binding and protein condensation have also been observed for other germ granule scaffolds. For example, the Balbiani body protein Xvelo uses a prion-like domain to aggregate and a separate RNA-binding domain to recruit RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boke et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, condensation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Oskar does not require the predicted Oskar RNA-binding domain, although this domain augments condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kistler et al., 2018</xref>). These observations parallel our findings with MEG-3 and contrast with recent findings reported for the stress granule scaffold G3BP. Condensation of G3BP in vitro requires RNA and two C-terminal RNA-binding domains. A N-terminal dimerization domain is also required but, unlike the prion-like domain of Xvelo or the C-terminus of MEG-3, is not sufficient to drive condensation on its own. Dimerization of G3BP is thought to enhance LLPS indirectly by augmenting the RNA-binding valency of G3BP complexes. G3BP also contains an inhibitory domain that gates its RNA-binding activity and condensation at low RNA concentrations. This modular organization ensures that G3BP functions as a sensitive switch that initiates LLPS when sufficient RNA molecules are available to cross-link G3BP dimers into a large network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">GuillÃ©n-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Stress granules are transient structures that form under conditions of general translational arrest where thousands of transcripts are released from ribosomes. In contrast, germ granules are long-lived structures that assemble in translationallyÂ active cytoplasm and recruit only a few hundred specific transcripts (~500 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jamieson-Lucy and Mullins, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trcek and Lehmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>). One possibility is that protein-based condensation mechanisms may be better suited to assemble long-lived granules able to capture and retain rare transcripts. By concentrating IDRs with affinity for RNA, protein scaffolds could act as seeds for localized LLPS to amplify protein and RNA condensation. Consistent with this view, IDRs have been observed to undergo spontaneous LLPS in cells when artificially tethered to protein modules that self-assemble into large multimeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakamura et al., 2019</xref>). A challenge for the future will be to understand the mechanisms that regulate the assembly and disassembly of protein scaffolds at the core of germ granules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Scanned western blot films were quantified using the gel analysis tool in ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Fluorescent protein bead halo assay</title><p>Fluorescent protein bead halo assay was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Patel and Rexach, 2008</xref>. 50 Î¼L of Nickel-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) were incubated with 50 Î¼L of 10 Î¼M MEG-3 derivatives trace-labeled with Alexa647 or no protein in MEG-3 storage buffer for 1Â hr. Beads were washed five times with IP Buffer then blocked for 1 hr in blocking buffer (4 mg/mL BSA, 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 500 mM KCl, 0.05% NP40, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4). MBP and PGL-3 trace-labeled with Alexa555 were prepared in PGL-3 storage buffer and diluted to 3 Î¼M in blocking buffer. Additional concentrations of PGL-3 were diluted from this solution to maintain the ratio of label to total protein. 5 Î¼L of blocked MEG-3 or empty beads was added to 50 Î¼L of PGL-3 or MBP solution and incubated for 1Â hr. Beads were washed five times in blocking buffer and resuspended in PBS. Beads were spotted onto a No. 1.5 glass-bottom dish (Mattek) and imaged using a 10Ã air objective. Images are single planes through the center of the beads.</p><p>To quantify the relative intensity of PGL-3 to MEG-3 derivatives on the beads, a mask was created using the Analyze Particles feature in ImageJ on the MEG-3 channel, using a minimum size of 10<sup>â5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>. Using the generated mask, the integrated intensity within each bead was calculated for both the MEG-3 and MBP/PGL-3 channels. To remove non-specific binding signal, the mean intensity empty beads incubated with MBP or PGL-3 were subtracted from each pixel yielding the total intensity of each bead. To calculate the intensity ratio for each image, the total intensity on beads of MBP or PGL-3 was divided by the total intensity of MEG-3 on beads. This ratio was normalized to the mean MBP ratio.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Johns Hopkins Neuroscience Research Multiphoton Imaging Core (NS050274) and the Johns Hopkins Integrated Imaging Center (S10OD023548) for excellent microscopy support.

Both fragments of MEG-3, including the HMGL motif, are needed to generate RNA foci in vivo. This leads to a model in which MEG-3 is recruited to PGL condensates through its C-terminal region, and all elements of the protein are necessary to produce fully functional P granules.</p><p>I have two main concerns regarding the data and story:</p><p>1. As an <italic>eLife</italic> paper on the molecular mechanism by which MEG-3 acts to create P granules, the work does not go far enough in understanding how the sequence and structural elements of MEG-3 interact with PGL condensates and RNA to produce the full granule.</p><p>It is unclear how we should think about the functionality of the C-terminal fragment of MEG-3. Is the whole element a single folded domain, which mediates binding to PGL-3, layered condensate formation, and localization of PGL condensates to one pole of the embryo? Or is the fragment a folded HMGL domain surrounded by either other domains or partially disordered elements with independent activities? The hydrophobicity plot in Figure 1 suggests a folded domain might exist at ~residues 720-880. Relatedly, does mutating the HMGL motif disrupt a binding surface, or unfold a domain? What region of the MEG-3 C-terminus mediates localization in vivo? Apparently not the HMGL motif, as the HMGL- mutant still localizes properly. Without such information it is hard to precisely understand the activities of the C-terminal fragment.</p><p>Further, the authors should make an effort to understand why the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> forms homogeneous condensates with PGL-3, while the C-terminal fragment and HMGL- protein remain demixed, forming a heterogeneous structure. What sequence features or binding properties are necessary for demixing? This multi-layered architecture is an important feature of P granules and should be addressed.</p><p>Finally, why does the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> bind RNA with ~7-fold higher affinity than the full-length protein? This suggests some autoinhibition in the protein. Can the C-terminus act in trans to decrease the affinity of the IDR for RNA? If so, does it bind to the IDR?</p><p>2. The in vitro and in vivo data do not correlate particularly well, clouding a clear mechanistic picture of the cellular behaviors. The authors acknowledge this issue in some areas, but we are still left not understanding substantial differences between the molecular behaviors in the two settings. For example, it is not clear how to reconcile the co-condensation with PGL-3 of the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> and HMGL- proteins in vitro with the cellular behaviors of these proteins. From the data presented, both robustly phase separate with PGL-3 (figure 2), but do not co-assemble in vivo (figure 4). This does not seem to be a matter of degree, as the HMGL- construct assembles with PGL-3 in vitro identically to WT MEG-3. Quantifying the effect of the HMGL- mutations on affinity for PGL-3 in physiologic conditions may clarify.</p><p>It is similarly unclear why the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> and HMGL- proteins form foci in cells, and should be able to bind RNA with high affinity (the former better than WT MEG-3) based on in vitro data, do not recruit Y51F10.2 into those foci. Even if RNA levels are reduced in embryos expressing the mutants, one would expect the RNA that is expressed to be recruited into the protein foci. Along these lines, in figure 2, the authors should examine co-recruitment of RNA into the MEG-3/PGL-3 condensates. Recruitment should track with binding, but it is important to show this, in part to compare with the cellular results in Figure 5. Perhaps such experiments would show that there is no in vitro/in vivo discrepancy here, although in that case one would have to explain why IDR and HMGL- can bind RNA but do not recruit it into their condensates.</p><p>Two technical points relate to these concerns:</p><p>First, the authors should quantify the binding data in Figure 2, showing the interactions of PGL proteins with the MEG-3 C-terminus, ideally determining the Kd of the interactions. They claim the interaction is of high affinity, but this cannot be inferred from a single blot performed at a single concentration. Similarly, the magnitude of the change in affinity induced by mutation of the HMGL motif cannot be inferred from these data, especially given that the amount of GST fusion was higher in the HMGL- protein than in the WT C-term protein (cf. GST bands at bottom of blot).</p><p>Second, it is disappointing that the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> was not analyzed for direct binding to PGL proteins. I understand that the GST-fusion did not express, but there are a variety of ways around this technical difficulty, especially given that the His-tagged version of the protein could be expressed and purified. The authors imply that the dominant interaction is mediated by the C-terminus, but the co-LLPS of the IDR with PGL-3 indicates the IDR can also interact with some affinity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Schmidt et al. performs a functional dissection of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> MEG-3 protein in assembling P granules. P granules are a prime model for studying the properties of ribonucleoprotein condensates but how condensates like P granules are actually assembled is less well understood. Previous work has shown that MEG-3, along with the redundantly functioning MEG-4, is required to localize PGL-1 and PGL-3 condensates to the posterior of the embryo. MEG-3/4 form a gel like shell that surrounds a more liquid-like core comprising PGL-1 and PGL-3. In addition, MEG-3 binds to RNA and is thought to recruit RNAs to P granules. How MEG-3 can perform these functions to assemble P granules is the focus of this paper. The authors perform both in vitro and in vivo experiments testing the activities of different domains/regions of the MEG-3 protein. They find that the HMG domain in the C-terminal half of MEG-3 is required for MEG-3 to interact with PGL-3 and that the C-terminal half (including the HMG domain) are required for PGL-3 condensates to localize in the posterior of the embryo, whereas the IDR in the N-terminal half of MEG-3 binds to RNA and recruits RNA to P granules. Notably, the IDR and RNA recruitment are not required for MEG-3 condensation, its localization, or its ability to bind to, localize, and stabilize PGL-3 condensates. The authors guardedly conclude that &quot;germ granule assembly depends at least in part on protein-protein interactions that drive protein condensation independent of RNA&quot;.</p><p>Overall, this is really nice work â the experiments are carefully executed, the data are convincing, and the conclusions are solid. I have two main concerns:</p><p>1) From the data presented, it seems likely that the functions the authors map to MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> can be attributed to the HMG domain but the authors carefully evade this issue. It seems like this is an important distinction to make and would provide significantly more resolution to the analysis. Testing the function of MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> with the HGML mutation would help to answer the question.</p><p>2) The authors seem overly timid in making connections between their findings and in their conclusions. For example, it seems like they want to argue that RNA is largely a passenger rather than an instigator in P granule assembly but are afraid to make that case. In addition, the discussion would benefit from a more thorough fleshing out of their model, with better explanation of how they envision the different domains are MEG-3 are regulating localization, condensation, stabilization of PGL condensates, recruitment of RNA, etc. Why does MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> only condense in the posterior even though it is not localized, why are all the domains are needed for RNA recruitment?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Previously, the Seydoux lab discovered a class of genes, the meg genes, which encode for intrinsically disordered phospho-regulated proteins, and which are required for P granule segregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (Wang et al., 2014). In further studies the lab showed that the MEG-3 protein can bind to RNA and that MEG-3 can phase separate in vitro in the presence of RNA. Importantly, the authors find that the intrinsically disordered region and the RNA concentrations tune phase separation (Smith et al., 2016). In further work, the lab suggested, that MEG-3 is in a rather gel-like protein phase which does not dissolve upon temperature shifts in vivo (Putnam et al., 2019) and which has different material properties than the PGL phase which is liquid-like and forms by phase separation. Both, the MEG phase and the PGL phase overlap but do not seem to mix, both in vitro and in vivo, and the question is how this process could be regulated.</p><p>In a recent study, the lab looked for interacting RNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos by using crosslinking approaches in combination with immunoprecipitations. Surprisingly, they found the majority of mRNAâs bound by MEG-3 after immunoprecipitations rather than to the RGG domain P granule protein PGL-1. Several of the identified mRNAâs indeed colocalize with MEG-3 in combined immunofluorescence/FISH experiments and show as well P lineage enrichment. In the same study, in vitro assays with MEG-3 and RNA indicated that the MEG-3 protein aggregates in the presence of low RNA concentrations and high or low salt conditions, whereas it associates into condensates with high RNA concentrations and medium salt concentrations.</p><p>Now, in the new study by Schmidt et al. the authors further study the protein MEG-3 and do an in vivo and in vitro structure/function analysis of the protein. They suggest that MEG-3 coordinates RNA and protein condensation, propose that the C-terminus is ânecessary and sufficient to build MEG-3/PGL co-condensates independent of RNAâ (line 16 of the abstract) and suggest that the IDR is required but not sufficient for RNA recruitment to P granules. This is a good paper and has lots of excellent data on the role of the MEGs.</p><p>However, the current manuscript has several inconsistencies with their previous work.</p><p>Here are the detailed arguments:</p><p>MEG-3 seems to contain a C-terminal HMG-like motif, which seems to interact in vitro with the PGL P granule proteins.</p><p>In vitro, the C-terminal part of MEG-3 seems to interact with PGL-1 and PGL-3 in pull down assays. Mutations of conserved residues in the HMG-like motif strongly reduces the PGL binding. But how does full length MEG-3 behave in the same pull down assay? Do the mutations in the HMG-like motif as well strongly reduce the interaction? How do the authors conclude that the HMG domain is required for âhigh affinityâ binding to PGL proteins? (see line 162). Whether these interactions play a role in vivo remains unclear as well, especially as MEGs and PGL proteins seem to have very different biophysical material properties.</p><p>MEG-3 interacts with RNA by the IDR region only.</p><p>These results are inconsistent with previous experiments. Full length MEG-3 interacts with polyU RNA in the low nM (around 30nM) range, whereas the IDR region shows around 15 fold lower binding affinities (around 500nM) (see Smith et al., 2016). Now Schmidt et al. report that full length MEG-3 binds to nos-2 RNA in the high nM range (around 800nM, roughly 30 fold lower), whereas the IDR region binds in the low nM range (around 100nM, which is around 8 fold higher). These differences may be explained by the differences in RNA, but could as well represent differences in the MEG-3 protein quality and differences in the assay. MEG-3 protein as well as its fragments tend to aggregate and do not seem spherical as published previously (compare Fig. 2A from this manuscript with Fig. 4 and Fig 4S from Lee et al., 2020). Protein quality control as well as performing gel shift assays, as in previous report, would indicate the quality of the protein and be important to resolve these inconsistencies. Partially aggregated MEG-3 might be present in the filter binding assays and eventually lead to much lower apparent RNA binding constants for the MEG-3 full length protein.</p><p>In further in vitro assays it is tested whether MEG-3 interacts with PGL-3 condensates. Indeed, all MEG-3 fragments interact with the PGL condensates and form domains on the PGL condensates in the presence of RNA (see Fig. 2C). In the absence of RNA the MEG-3 IDR domain fully mixes with the PGL domain indicating strong interaction with PGL-3. However, this domain was not tested for interaction with PGL-3 by any other assays, and in vivo does not interact with PGLs.</p><p>Co-assembly of MEG/PGL condensates is driven by the MEG-3 C-terminus.</p><p>The MEG-3 fragments tested in vitro are now generated in vivo by replacing the endogenous meg-3 locus with the gene variants by CRISPR/Cas9. The authors do a series of immunofluorescence experiments in the meg-3 variant lines and stain for MEG-3 and PGL-3. The authors state that âin embryos expressing MEG-3 Cterm, PGL-3 condensates localized properly in P1â¦â. However, as their images (see Fig4A) as well as their quantification indicates, this is not the case. Only full length MEG-3 shows proper localization of PGL-3, and neither the C-terminal, nor the IDR or the HMGL variant show correct PGL-3 localisation. Although there seems to be an enrichment of PGL-3 in P1 in the Cterm mutant, clearly other parts of the protein contribute to PGL-3 localization as seen in MEG-3 full length (see Fig. 4C)</p><p>Efficient recruitment of mRNA to P granules requires all parts of the MEG-3 protein. Previously, the Seydoux lab discovered that hundreds of mRNA crosslink to MEG-3 in vivo and several of these mRNA are indeed enriched in the P lineage (Lee et al., 2020). Now, they test which part of MEG-3 is required for enrichment of Y51F10.2. Intriguingly, Y51F10.2 becomes only considerably enriched in P4 cells if all domains of the MEG-3 protein get expressed, indicating that enrichment of PGLâs by the MEG-3Cterm construct is not sufficient for enrichment of Y51F10.2 mRNA. However, to address if mRNA recruitment requires indeed all MEG-3 domains it would be much better to quantify the level of polyA enrichment in the different MEG-3 mutants (see Fig 5 supp1). Previously, Lee et al have shown that nearly all polyA RNA which is accessible to FISH in early embryos is located in the P lineage in the P2 cell and this depends on the presence of wildtype copies of meg-3 and meg-4 (see Fig 1F, Lee et al., 2020). And if indeed the IDR of MEG-3 recruits mRNA than the MEG-3Cterm mutant should not enrich any mRNA in P1 to P4. Importantly, very little polyA RNA is enriched in pgl-1 pgl-3 mutants indicating that MEG-3 enrichment is not sufficient for P lineage enrichment of mRNA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63698.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are several essential revisions the reviewers feel should be done, pertaining to Figure 2.

As the reviewer suggests, our observations are consistent with mutations in the HMGL motif affecting only a PGL-3 binding surface and not the entire C-terminal domain, since MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> and MEG-3<sub>C-termHMGL-</sub> exhibited identical condensation properties in vitro.

In the presence of high RNA, which has a strong solubilizing influence on MEG-3 (Lee et al., 2020), only full-length MEG-3 fully de-mixes from PGL-3 (Figure 6B). Under low or no RNA conditions, both full-length MEG-3 and MEG-3<sub>C-term</sub> de-mix (Figure 6 Supplement 3).

These experiments, however, were confounded by the fact that the C-terminus also binds poly-U (albeit with much lower affinity) complicating the assay, which required using high concentrations of the C-terminus. We therefore did not include these experiments in the manuscript but present them as Author response images 1-3.</p><p>MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> RNA binding competition assays:</p><p>In these experiments, we examined binding of MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> (105nM) to polyU RNA (50nM) in the presence of increasing concentrations of MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub>.</p><p>Replication of a normally <italic>intramolecular</italic> inhibitory interaction <italic>in trans</italic> is expected to require high concentration of the inhibitory domain.

We prefer therefore not to draw any conclusions from these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The in vitro and in vivo data do not correlate particularly well, clouding a clear mechanistic picture of the cellular behaviors. The authors acknowledge this issue in some areas, but we are still left not understanding substantial differences between the molecular behaviors in the two settings. For example, it is not clear how to reconcile the co-condensation with PGL-3 of the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> and HMGL- proteins in vitro with the cellular behaviors of these proteins. From the data presented, both robustly phase separate with PGL-3 (figure 2), but do not co-assemble in vivo (figure 4). This does not seem to be a matter of degree, as the HMGL- construct assembles with PGL-3 in vitro identically to WT MEG-3. Quantifying the effect of the HMGL- mutations on affinity for PGL-3 in physiologic conditions may clarify.</p><p>It is similarly unclear why the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> and HMGL- proteins form foci in cells, and should be able to bind RNA with high affinity (the former better than WT MEG-3) based on in vitro data, do not recruit Y51F10.2 into those foci. Even if RNA levels are reduced in embryos expressing the mutants, one would expect the RNA that is expressed to be recruited into the protein foci. Along these lines, in figure 2, the authors should examine co-recruitment of RNA into the MEG-3/PGL-3 condensates. Recruitment should track with binding, but it is important to show this, in part to compare with the cellular results in Figure 5. Perhaps such experiments would show that there is no in vitro/in vivo discrepancy here, although in that case one would have to explain why IDR and HMGL- can bind RNA but do not recruit it into their condensates.</p></disp-quote><p>We have identified in vitro conditions that best correlate with in vivo observations. We now present the in vitro data AFTER the in vivo data to make it clear that we evaluated several in vitro conditions (Figure 6 Supplement 1) and identified those that most closely reproduced the in vivo observations (150mM NaCl, 150nM MEG-3 and 20ng/ul RNA, all within the range of estimated physiological conditions). Under these conditions, we find that full length MEG-3 is required to promote maximum MEG-3 condensation and RNA recruitment as is observed in vivo. The C-term performs better than the IDR in promoting condensation, but is less efficient than full length MEG-3, and does not recruit RNA as efficiently as either full length MEG-3 or the IDR (Figure 6A).</p><p>One difference that remains between in vitro and in vivo findings is that the IDR and MEG-3<sub>HMGL-</sub> are recruited to PGL-3 condensates in vitro but not in vivo.</p><p>To address this discrepancy, we built on our prior finding that MEG-3 binds to PGL-3 directly in a GST-pull down assay. We developed a second binding assay that allowed us to examine the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub>, MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> and MEG-3<sub>CtermHMGL-</sub> in parallel for binding to PGL-3. In this assay, we found that only wild-type MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> binds to PGL-3. (The binding assays are done under conditions where PGL-3 does not form condensates).</p><p>These results suggest that co-assembly of MEG-3 and PGL-3 condensates in vivo depends on a direct binding interaction between MEG-3 and PGL-3 mediated by the HMGL domain. We hypothesize that the complexity of the cytoplasm makes for a competitive environment not reproduced in our in vitro reconstitutions with purified proteins. Consequently, specific binding between MEG-3 and PGL-3 mediated by the HMGL is required for co-assembly in vivo but not in vitro.</p><p>We showed previously that association with PGL-3 condensates stimulates MEG-3 condensation (Putnam et al. 2019). As expected therefore, the condensation efficiency of MEG-3<sub>HMGL-</sub> was reduced compared to wild-type in vivo (Figure 2 D). We suggest that this reduced condensation efficiency may also account for why MEG-3<sub>HMGL-</sub> fails to assemble support RNA recruitment in vivo (Figure 4).</p><p>In conclusion, although the new in vitro conditions do not fully recapitulate the complex environment of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cytoplasm, they have allowed us to define three regions in MEG-3 (IDR, HMGL motif, and C-terminal domain) with distinct activities that play complementary roles in P granule assembly. The take-home message overall is that protein-protein and condensate-condensate interactions are the primary drivers of P granule assembly. We have rewritten the abstract and title to better reflect this emphasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two technical points relate to these concerns:</p><p>First, the authors should quantify the binding data in Figure 2, showing the interactions of PGL proteins with the MEG-3 C-terminus, ideally determining the Kd of the interactions. They claim the interaction is of high affinity, but this cannot be inferred from a single blot performed at a single concentration. Similarly, the magnitude of the change in affinity induced by mutation of the HMGL motif cannot be inferred from these data, especially given that the amount of GST fusion was higher in the HMGL- protein than in the WT C-term protein (cf. GST bands at bottom of blot).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these concerns in a new bead-based assay for protein-protein interactions (Figure 7 C). The new assay utilizes purified proteins, which allowed us to compare different concentrations of MEG-3<sub>Cterm.</sub></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, it is disappointing that the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> was not analyzed for direct binding to PGL proteins. I understand that the GST-fusion did not express, but there are a variety of ways around this technical difficulty, especially given that the His-tagged version of the protein could be expressed and purified. The authors imply that the dominant interaction is mediated by the C-terminus, but the co-LLPS of the IDR with PGL-3 indicates the IDR can also interact with some affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tested the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> for PGL-3 binding in the new bead-based assay and found that the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> does NOT bind PGL-3, unlike MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] Overall, this is really nice work â the experiments are carefully executed, the data are convincing, and the conclusions are solid. I have two main concerns:</p><p>1) From the data presented, it seems likely that the functions the authors map to MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> can be attributed to the HMG domain but the authors carefully evade this issue. It seems like this is an important distinction to make and would provide significantly more resolution to the analysis. Testing the function of MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> with the HGML mutation would help to answer the question.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have tested the properties MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> with the HGML mutation (Figures 6-7). We find that the HMGL- mutation does not affect condensation and recruitment in vitro, but severely reduces binding to PGL-3. These findings confirm that the C-terminus has two independent activities: driving MEG-3 condensation which does NOT require the HMGL motif, and binding to PGL-3 which requires HMGL.</p><p>The HMGL domain is essential for assembly of PGL-MEG co-condensates in vivo but not in vitro. We speculate this discrepancy is due to the presence of other factors or condensates in vivo that compete with PGL-3 condensates for co-assembly with MEG-3.</p><p>We previously showed that PGL-3 stimulates MEG-3 condensation (Putnam et al., 2019). The observation that MEG-3<sub>HMGL-</sub> does not condense as efficiently as wild-type in vivo, therefore, is consistent with the inability of MEG-3<sub>HMGL-</sub> to interact efficiently with PGL-3 in vivo. We have clarified these points in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors seem overly timid in making connections between their findings and in their conclusions. For example, it seems like they want to argue that RNA is largely a passenger rather than an instigator in P granule assembly but are afraid to make that case. In addition, the discussion would benefit from a more thorough fleshing out of their model, with better explanation of how they envision the different domains are MEG-3 are regulating localization, condensation, stabilization of PGL condensates, recruitment of RNA, etc. Why does MEG-3<sub>Cterm</sub> only condense in the posterior even though it is not localized, why are all the domains are needed for RNA recruitment?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have expanded the discussion to make these points more clearly and reworked the title and abstract to emphasize our main finding: that P granule assembly is driven primarily by protein-based condensation mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Previously, the Seydoux lab discovered a class of genes, the meg genes, which encode for intrinsically disordered phospho-regulated proteins, and which are required for P granule segregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (Wang et al., 2014). In further studies the lab showed that the MEG-3 protein can bind to RNA and that MEG-3 can phase separate in vitro in the presence of RNA. Importantly, the authors find that the intrinsically disordered region and the RNA concentrations tune phase separation (Smith et al., 2016). In further work, the lab suggested, that MEG-3 is in a rather gel-like protein phase which does not dissolve upon temperature shifts in vivo (Putnam et al., 2019) and which has different material properties than the PGL phase which is liquid-like and forms by phase separation. Both, the MEG phase and the PGL phase overlap but do not seem to mix, both in vitro and in vivo, and the question is how this process could be regulated.</p><p>In a recent study, the lab looked for interacting RNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos by using crosslinking approaches in combination with immunoprecipitations. Surprisingly, they found the majority of mRNAâs bound by MEG-3 after immunoprecipitations rather than to the RGG domain P granule protein PGL-1. Several of the identified mRNAâs indeed colocalize with MEG-3 in combined immunofluorescence/FISH experiments and show as well P lineage enrichment. In the same study, in vitro assays with MEG-3 and RNA indicated that the MEG-3 protein aggregates in the presence of low RNA concentrations and high or low salt conditions, whereas it associates into condensates with high RNA concentrations and medium salt concentrations.</p><p>Now, in the new study by Schmidt et al. the authors further study the protein MEG-3 and do an in vivo and in vitro structure/function analysis of the protein. They suggest that MEG-3 coordinates RNA and protein condensation, propose that the C-terminus is ânecessary and sufficient to build MEG-3/PGL co-condensates independent of RNAâ (line 16 of the abstract) and suggest that the IDR is required but not sufficient for RNA recruitment to P granules. This is a good paper and has lots of excellent data on the role of the MEGs.</p><p>However, the current manuscript has several inconsistencies with their previous work.</p><p>Here are the detailed arguments:</p><p>MEG-3 seems to contain a C-terminal HMG-like motif, which seems to interact in vitro with the PGL P granule proteins.</p><p>In vitro, the C-terminal part of MEG-3 seems to interact with PGL-1 and PGL-3 in pull down assays. Mutations of conserved residues in the HMG-like motif strongly reduces the PGL binding. But how does full length MEG-3 behave in the same pull down assay? Do the mutations in the HMG-like motif as well strongly reduce the interaction? How do the authors conclude that the HMG domain is required for âhigh affinityâ binding to PGL proteins? (see line 162). Whether these interactions play a role in vivo remains unclear as well, especially as MEGs and PGL proteins seem to have very different biophysical material properties.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our analyses of the MEG-3/PGL-3 interaction using a new bead halo assay using purified proteins (Figure 7C). The new data confirms that MEG-3 interacts with PGL-3 via the HMGL motif. Unlike the C-term, the IDR does not interact with PGL-3. Additionally we have modified our language and no longer characterize this interaction as âhigh affinityâ since our data do not address binding affinity, only specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MEG-3 interacts with RNA by the IDR region only.</p><p>These results are inconsistent with previous experiments. Full length MEG-3 interacts with polyU RNA in the low nM (around 30nM) range, whereas the IDR region shows around 15 fold lower binding affinities (around 500nM) (see Smith et al., 2016). Now Schmidt et al. report that full length MEG-3 binds to nos-2 RNA in the high nM range (around 800nM, roughly 30 fold lower), whereas the IDR region binds in the low nM range (around 100nM, which is around 8 fold higher). These differences may be explained by the differences in RNA, but could as well represent differences in the MEG-3 protein quality and differences in the assay.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences are likely due to 1) the new assay used to measure RNA binding and 2) improvements in our protein purification protocols.</p><p>The assay used previously was based on fluorescence anisotropy. Since phase separation can alter the fluorescence anisotropy signal, this assay suffers potentially from complications resulting from phase separation that occurs at different concentrations for MEG-3 and variants.</p><p>We also have added a size exclusion step to the protein purification protocol described in Smith et al 2016 which significantly improves protein purity. See protein gels in Figure 5 â figure supplement 1 showing purity of each MEG-3 variant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MEG-3 protein as well as its fragments tend to aggregate and do not seem spherical as published previously (compare Fig. 2A from this manuscript with Fig. 4 and Fig 4S from Lee et al., 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of RNA, MEG-3 form amorphous aggregates as reported in Lee et al., 2020. In the revised in vitro analyses, we avoid conditions that induce aggregates (e.g. high MEG-3 concentration/no RNA which is non physiological). We show that all the variants are soluble under high RNA/low salt conditions. High salt conditions in the presence of RNA lead to condensation and no aggregation. The new data are shown in Figures 5,6,7 and replace Figure 2 in the original version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Protein quality control as well as performing gel shift assays, as in previous report, would indicate the quality of the protein and be important to resolve these inconsistencies. Partially aggregated MEG-3 might be present in the filter binding assays and eventually lead to much lower apparent RNA binding constants for the MEG-3 full length protein.</p></disp-quote><p>The conditions used in the filter binding assay (150mM NaCl and variable amounts of RNA) will prevent formation of MEG-3 aggregates, which only form in the absence of RNA (Lee et al., 2020).</p><p>Also, we now include new experiments that show that the apparent lower RNA affinity of full-length MEG-3 is only seen with poly-U30. Binding assays using <italic>nos-2</italic> RNA show no differences between full length MEG-3 and MEG-3 IDR (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In further in vitro assays it is tested whether MEG-3 interacts with PGL-3 condensates. Indeed, all MEG-3 fragments interact with the PGL condensates and form domains on the PGL condensates in the presence of RNA (see Fig. 2C). In the absence of RNA the MEG-3 IDR domain fully mixes with the PGL domain indicating strong interaction with PGL-3. However, this domain was not tested for interaction with PGL-3 by any other assays, and in vivo does not interact with PGLs.</p></disp-quote><p>Mixing into a condensate is NOT necessarily an indication of a strong or specific binding interaction. Phase separation is known to be driven by weak interactions and IDRs often show non-specific mixing. We have tested directly the IDR for binding to PGL-3 in a new bead assay (Figure 7) and found no evidence for specific binding to PGL-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Co-assembly of MEG/PGL condensates is driven by the MEG-3 C-terminus.</p><p>The MEG-3 fragments tested in vitro are now generated in vivo by replacing the endogenous meg-3 locus with the gene variants by CRISPR/Cas9. The authors do a series of immunofluorescence experiments in the meg-3 variant lines and stain for MEG-3 and PGL-3. The authors state that âin embryos expressing MEG-3 Cterm, PGL-3 condensates localized properly in P1â¦â. However, as their images (see Fig4A) as well as their quantification indicates, this is not the case. Only full length MEG-3 shows proper localization of PGL-3, and neither the C-terminal, nor the IDR or the HMGL variant show correct PGL-3 localisation. Although there seems to be an enrichment of PGL-3 in P1 in the Cterm mutant, clearly other parts of the protein contribute to PGL-3 localization as seen in MEG-3 full length (see Fig. 4C)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised our discussion of what drives MEG and PGL asymmetry in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Efficient recruitment of mRNA to P granules requires all parts of the MEG-3 protein. Previously, the Seydoux lab discovered that hundreds of mRNA crosslink to MEG-3 in vivo and several of these mRNA are indeed enriched in the P lineage (Lee et al., 2020). Now, they test which part of MEG-3 is required for enrichment of Y51F10.2. Intriguingly, Y51F10.2 becomes only considerably enriched in P4 cells if all domains of the MEG-3 protein get expressed, indicating that enrichment of PGLâs by the MEG-3Cterm construct is not sufficient for enrichment of Y51F10.2 mRNA. However, to address if mRNA recruitment requires indeed all MEG-3 domains it would be much better to quantify the level of polyA enrichment in the different MEG-3 mutants (see Fig 5 supp1).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an additional specific RNA probe (nos-2) in Figure 4 â Figure supplement 2, as well as quantifying the polyA data now in Figure 4 Figure supplement-3 to further support our conclusion that enrichment of mRNA in the P cell requires all the MEG-3 domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previously, Lee et al have shown that nearly all polyA RNA which is accessible to FISH in early embryos is located in the P lineage in the P2 cell and this depends on the presence of wildtype copies of meg-3 and meg-4 (see Fig 1F, Lee et al., 2020). And if indeed the IDR of MEG-3 recruits mRNA than the MEG-3Cterm mutant should not enrich any mRNA in P1 to P4. Importantly, very little polyA RNA is enriched in pgl-1 pgl-3 mutants indicating that MEG-3 enrichment is not sufficient for P lineage enrichment of mRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have clarified this in the text (see in particular last section of Discussion).
