During male gametogenesis in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, mitosis is exceptionally rapid and highly divergent. Within 8 min, the haploid male gametocyte genome undergoes three replication cycles (1N to 8N), while maintaining an intact NE. Axonemes assemble in the cytoplasm and connect to a bipartite MTOC-containing nuclear pole (NP) and cytoplasmic basal body, producing eight flagellated gametes. The mechanisms coordinating NE remodelling, MTOC dynamics, and flagellum assembly remain poorly understood. We identify the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> male gametogenesis. SUN1, a conserved NE protein, localises to dynamic loops and focal points at the nucleoplasmic face of the spindle poles. ALLAN, a divergent allantoicase, has a location like that of SUN1, and these proteins form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN genes disrupts nuclear MTOC organisation, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired spindle microtubule-kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. These defects block development in the mosquito and parasite transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex.</p></abstract><kwd-group

The NE, a double-membrane structure with embedded NP complexes, is a selective barrier, facilitating signal exchange between cytoplasm and nucleus. The NE consists of inner (INM) and outer (ONM) membranes, with the ONM continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Beyond structural and transport roles, the NE is integral to mitosis, supporting spindle formation, kinetochore attachment, and chromosome segregation, while also accommodating changes in ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dey and Baum, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smoyer and Jaspersen, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In most mammalian cells, mitosis is considered ‘open,’ characterised by complete NE disassembly, chromosome condensation, and segregation via a microtubule-based bipolar spindle. In contrast, in unicellular organisms such as the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> mitosis is comparatively ‘closed:’ the NE remains intact, and chromosomes are segregated by an intranuclear spindle anchored to acentriolar NPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boettcher and Barral, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sazer et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is now believed that no mitosis is wholly ‘open’ or ‘closed’ and that in most cases, remnants of the NE interact with the spindle to support chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dey and Baum, 2021</xref>). Closed mitosis involves diverse NE dynamics: for example, <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> employ intranuclear spindle assembly, whereas <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic> assemble spindles outside the nucleus; the NE remains largely unbroken, but large polar fenestrae are formed to allow microtubule access to the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Makarova and Oliferenko, 2016</xref>). These examples highlight the fact that ‘open’ and ‘closed’ mitosis are merely two extremes of a continuum of NE remodelling strategies during mitosis, underlining extensive diversity in cell division, a core cellular process.</p><p>The interaction between nucleus, the chromatin, and in general the nucleoplasmic environment and the cytoskeleton is facilitated by the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which bridges the INM and ONM in most eukaryotes via interactions between SUN (Sad1, UNC84)-domain proteins on the INM and KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, Syne Homology)-domain proteins on the ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao and Starr, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>). The LINC complex links chromatin and the cytoskeleton throughout eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For instance, LINC complexes anchor telomeres to the NE during meiosis in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schober et al., 2008</xref>) and cluster centromeres near the INM in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Funabiki et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, SUN proteins connect to the lamin-like proteins that cover the INM on the nucleoplasmic side in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koreny and Field, 2016</xref>). In plants, SUN–WIP complexes (analogous to the SUN-KASH proteins of animals and fungi) connect the nucleus to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), while <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> uses SUN1 to anchor the spindle pole body-like MTOC at the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiong et al., 2008</xref>). Such interactions coordinate nuclear positioning, chromosome organisation, and mechanical integration with the cytoskeleton. Evolutionary studies suggest that LINC was established before the emergence of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), highlighting its ancient role in NE formation and cytoskeletal coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baum and Baum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koreny and Field, 2016</xref>). However, as SUN proteins are broadly conserved in many eukaryotic lineages, KASH and lamin-like proteins are often not detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koreny and Field, 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, in many non-model eukaryotes like for instance apicomplexan parasites (e.g. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>) microscopic observations reveal chromatin structures such as centromeres, telomeres, and the spindle pole body-like MTOCs are to be closely associated with and/or embedded in the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Have KASH/lamins proteins been lost or have novel systems evolved to support a SUN protein-based functions at the nuclear envelope?</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of SUN protein functions in common eukaryotic model systems.</title><p>SUN proteins bridge the outer (ONM) and inner (INM) membranes of the nuclear envelope (NE) to link the cytoskeleton (i.e. actin, microtubules and its organising centres) to various heterochromatic domains (i.e. centromere, telomeres) and the nuclear lamina (five different functions with a unique colour).

In the asexual stage in the blood of its vertebrate host, during schizogony there is asynchronous nuclear division without coincident cytokinesis, and during male gametogenesis in the mosquito host there is a unique and rapid form of closed mitosis essential for parasite transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guttery et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sinden et al., 1978</xref>). Following activation in the mosquito gut, the haploid male gametocyte undergoes three rounds of genome replication (from 1N to 8N) within just 6–8 min, while maintaining an intact NE. Concurrently, axonemes form in the cytoplasm, emanating from bipartite MTOCs that consist of intranuclear spindle poles and cytoplasmic basal bodies (BB). This rapid karyokinesis and subsequent cytokinesis results in the production of eight flagellated haploid male gametes within 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guttery et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The speed of male gametogenesis in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> imposes unique requirements and constraints on cellular structures. Notably, the flagella lack intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is atypical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sinden et al., 2010</xref>). The bipartite organisation of the MTOC was recently revealed, and the use of fluorescently tagged markers such as SAS4 and kinesin-8B has illuminated the dynamics of BB and axoneme formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zeeshan et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zeeshan et al., 2019a</xref>). Kinetochore proteins like NDC80 display an unconventional, largely clustered linear organisation on the spindle, redistributing only during successive spindle duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zeeshan et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, successive spindle and BB segregation occurs within 8 min of gametocyte activation, without NE breakdown, indicating an unusual, streamlined closed mitotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zeeshan et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zeeshan et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms that coordinate the formation and function of the intranuclear spindle poles, the cytoplasmic BB, and the NE remain unclear. Specifically, how the NE is remodelled to accommodate rapid genome replication, and how it affects the organisation and function of the bipartite MTOC remain open questions. We addressed these questions by investigating NE remodelling and MTOC coordination in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (Pb), using the conserved NE protein SUN1. By combining live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy (U-ExM), and proteomic analysis, we identify SUN1 as a key NE component. Using different mitotic and MTOC/BB markers, we investigate their coordination and the flexibility of NE during rapid mitosis. Our findings reveal that SUN1 interacts with a novel allantoicase-like protein (termed ALLAN), to form a divergent LINC-like complex without KASH proteins. Functional disruption of either SUN1 or ALLAN impairs BB segregation, disrupts spindle-kinetochore attachment, and results in defective flagellum assembly.

In activated male gametocytes undergoing mitotic division, SUN1-GFP had a dynamic localisation around the nuclear DNA (Hoechst-stained), associated with loops and folds formed in the NE during the transition from 1N to 8N ploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The NE loops extended beyond the Hoechst-stained DNA, suggesting an abundant non-spherical NE membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further characterise NE morphology during male gametogenesis, serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) was used.

It was also possible to find clumps (groups) of BB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dd,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). Electron densities similar to NPs were observed adjacent to the BB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3De</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H,I,J</xref>). An extensive search (100+sections) failed to identify examples of nuclear spindle formation with attached kinetochores. In contrast to the WT-GFP cells, a significant proportion of <italic>Δsun1</italic> cells (20%) had groups of centrally located kinetochores with no attached microtubules (naked kinetochores: NK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Df</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D,G</xref>). NK were not observed in an extensive search of WT-GFP microgametocytes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Nevertheless, the parallel orientation of the axonemes appeared to be maintained and many displayed the normal 9+2 arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dc</xref>).</p><p>By 15 min, WT-GFP gametocytes showed examples of exflagellation, with flagella displaying BB at the tip. Cross-sections showed gametes with normal axonemes with a 9+2 arrangement and an enclosed nucleus surrounded by a plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dg,h</xref>). In <italic>Δsun1</italic> samples, several late stages as well as some mid-stages were observed. The late stages had more electron dense cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Di</xref>). The majority had few, if any axonemes, but all had a large nucleus with small clumps of electron dense material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Di</xref>). A few microgametocytes appeared to be undergoing exflagellation with flagellar-like structures protruding from the cell surface, often with multiple axonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dj,I</xref>). However, they were abnormal, lacking a nucleus and often with variable numbers (1–6) of normal 9+2 axonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dj,k,l</xref>). There appeared to be a disconnect between the axonemes and the nucleus during exflagellation. There was evidence of chromatin condensation to form microgamete nuclei but no connection between the nucleus and axoneme during exflagellation, resulting in microgametes lacking a nucleus. This <italic>Δsun1</italic> mutant appeared to have a problem with separation of NPs and nuclear spindle formation, resulting in no genome segregation. The nuclear poles were difficult to find and did not appear to have been able to divide or move apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dd,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E,F,H,I,J</xref>). It is possible that this lack of spindle pole division and movement was responsible for the BB remaining clumped together in the cytoplasm. It is also possible that clumping of the BB may explain the presence of multiple axonemes associated with the exflagellated structures. The quantification data for the <italic>Δsun1</italic> phenotypes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2k</xref>.</p><p>Together, these findings highlight the pivotal role of SUN1 in coordinating the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments during male gametogenesis.

Notably, SUN1 co-purified with nuclear pore proteins (NUP269, NUP335), membrane proteins, including a likely ER component (DDRGK-domain containing UFM1 E3 ligase, PBANKA_0927700), chromatin-related factors (e.g. condensin I/II subunits, topoisomerase II and the kinetochore subunit AKit-8), and the cytoplasmic and male gametocyte-specific kinesin-15 (PBANKA_145880). This suggests a role for SUN1 in bridging chromatin (through condensin II) on the nuclear side and the cytoskeleton (through kinesin-15) on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope, potentially in association with nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) in a similar fashion to what has been proposed in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ito et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakamoto et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>PbSUN1 also interacted with proteins harbouring a divergent carbohydrate-binding domain (like SUN1 itself), such as the allantoicase-like protein ALCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sayers et al., 2024</xref>), here referred to as ALLAN (PBANKA_1144200) and PBANKA_0209200, an ER-Golgi protein with a mannose-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). ALLAN is an uncharacterised orthologue of allantoicase, an enzyme in purine metabolism. We could detect no KASH-like or lamin-like proteins in the co-immunoprecipitates. To further explore the interaction between ALLAN and SUN1, we performed the reciprocal ALLAN-GFP, from lysates of gametocytes 6 min post-activation. Amongst the interactors, we found SUN1 and its interactors, DDRGK-domain containing protein and kinesin-15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

However, by late schizogony, the ALLAN signal had diminished.

This localisation persisted as ploidy increased from 1N to 8N in successive rounds of genome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using U-ExM, ALLAN-GFP was resolved at the INM, enriched at spindle poles marked by NHS-ester staining, but absent from BB, where axonemes form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). The location of ALLAN-GFP showed no overlap with that of kinesin-8B, a BB marker, or that of kinetochore marker NDC80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). Conversely, crosses with EB1-mCherry, a spindle marker, revealed an overlap at spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) suggesting a role for ALLAN in nuclear spindle pole organisation. Thus, the spatial relationship of SUN1 and ALLAN suggests coordinated roles in nuclear architecture and division of labour.

Most eukaryotes have representatives of both families. <italic>P. berghei</italic> has two SUN domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandelis-Shalev et al., 2024</xref>), one of each family with PbSUN1 having a C-terminal SUN domain. Allantoicase-like proteins often consist of two nearly identical domains, belonging to the galactose-binding-like family that are remarkably similar to the SUN domain, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Among apicomplexans, two allantoicase subtypes are present due to duplication in the ancestor of all Apicomplexa: AKiT8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brusini et al., 2022</xref>) a kinetochore-associated protein, and ALLAN, the allantoicase-like subtype. Notably, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is one of the few apicomplexans retaining both subtypes (i.e. only AKiT is retained in Toxoplasma). Extreme sequence divergence complicates phylogenetic classification of allantoicase-like proteins among apicomplexans, but length-based classification distinguished the longer AKiT8 (~2300 aa) from ALLAN-like proteins (~800 aa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Despite using previously developed Hidden Markov Model and structural searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benz et al., 2024</xref>), we found no evidence of KASH-domain proteins or lamins in amongst apicomplexans, similar to what was reported in prior studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koreny and Field, 2016</xref>).</p><p>AlphaFold3 (AF3) modelling suggested that SUN1 and ALLAN interact specifically in Haemosporida through the N-terminal domain of SUN1, a region that is absent from other apicomplexan and/or other eukaryotic SUN1 family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We could not detect similar interactions between SUN1-like and ALLAN-like orthologs amongst other apicomplexans, ruling out a rapidly evolving interaction. Based on these structural predictions and the super-resolution imaging of SUN1- and ALLAN-GFP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, E ,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B and C</xref>), we propose that ALLAN resides on the nucleoplasmic side of the NE, while SUN1’s C-terminal domain likely extends toward the ONM to interact with proteins involved in axoneme and cytoskeletal dynamics in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This specificity may underscore the restricted nature of a SUN1-ALLAN complex to Haemosporida, and thus specific adaptation of the allantoicase-like protein ALLAN for nuclear envelope dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study identifies the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel and essential mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during <italic>P. berghei</italic> male gametogenesis. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lacks KASH-domain proteins and lamins, and a canonical LINC complex, relying on a highly divergent mechanism to tether nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments during rapid closed mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rout et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our results reveal that SUN1 and ALLAN form a unique complex essential for spindle assembly, BB segregation, and axoneme organisation, maintaining an intact NE throughout. Disruption of either protein causes spindle and MTOC miscoordination, leading to defective male gametes incapable of fertilisation. Additionally, SUN1 deletion alters lipid homeostasis and NE dynamics, underscoring its multifaceted role in nuclear organisation and metabolism. These findings establish the SUN1-ALLAN axis as a crucial evolutionary innovation in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p><p>In <italic>P. berghei</italic> male gametogenesis, mitosis is closed and extraordinarily rapid with features that diverge significantly from those of classical models. Within just 8 min, there are three rounds of DNA replication (1N to 8N), accompanied by the assembly of axonemes on cytoplasmic BB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guttery et al., 2022</xref>). KASH-domain proteins and lamins are absent, yet <italic>Plasmodium</italic> achieves precise nuclear and cytoskeletal coordination. Our findings reveal that this is accomplished through a non-canonical SUN1-ALLAN complex. SUN1 located at the NE forms loops and folds to accommodate rapid nuclear expansion, and ALLAN facilitates spindle pole coordination.</p><p>Recent studies on SUN1-domain containing proteins have been reported in some Apicomplexa parasites including <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandelis-Shalev et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sayers et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wagner et al., 2023</xref>). SUN-like protein-1 of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> shows a mitotic spindle pole (MTOC) location and is important for nuclear division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wagner et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>. encode two SUN proteins (SUN1 and SUN2), that show a nuclear membrane location and play roles in nuclear division and DNA repair during the blood stage of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandelis-Shalev et al., 2024</xref>). Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sayers et al., 2024</xref> demonstrated that PbSUN1-HA was associated with the NE and suggested that it may be required to capture the intranuclear MTOC onto the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sayers et al., 2024</xref>). They also showed that it forms a complex with ALCC1 (the protein we have designated ALLAN). They showed that SUN1 is essential for fertile male gamete formation and that in SUN1-KO lines basal bodies are aggregated. Our study extends their findings by providing live-cell imaging of SUN1 and ALLAN and their coordination with key mitotic markers such as NDC80, EB1, and Kinesin-8B. We generated and characterised both SUN1 and ALLAN knockout parasites, performing ultrastructural analyses using TEM and extensive functional studies. Consistent with the results of Sayers et al., we observed basal body clumping in SUN1-KO, and showed that kinetochore attachment to the spindle is compromised in both mutant parasites. Our work emphasises the role of the nuclear envelope in the rapid cell division during male gametogenesis. Collectively, the findings from both studies highlight the importance of the SUN1–ALLAN complex in Plasmodium cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sayers et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> SUN1 shares some similarities with SUN proteins in other organisms like <italic>S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagan and Yanagida, 1995</xref>), but its interaction with ALLAN is a highly specialised adaptation in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. The location of SUN1 at the nuclear MTOC, distinct from axonemal markers like kinesin-8B, underscores its role in nuclear compartmentalisation. Similarly, the absence of functional spindle formation and kinetochore attachment in <italic>Δsun1</italic> mutants is reminiscent of phenotypes seen in mutants of spindle-associated proteins in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, such as EB1, ARK2, and kinesin-8X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zeeshan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeeshan et al., 2019b</xref>). However, SUN1’s role extends specifically to NE remodelling and the organisation of the inner acentriolar MTOC.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that SUN1 is primarily located in the space between the INM and ONM, with the NE but facing the nucleoplasm via it’s N-terminus, forming dynamic loops and folds to accommodate the rapid expansion of the nucleus during three rounds of genome replication. These loops serve as structural hubs for spindle assembly and kinetochore attachment at the nuclear MTOC, separating nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The absence of SUN1 disrupts spindle formation, causing defects in chromosome segregation and kinetochore attachment, while BB segregation remains incomplete, resulting in clumped basal bodies and anuclear flagellated gametes. This phenotype highlights the role of SUN1 in maintaining the nuclear compartment of the bipartite MTOC.</p><p>ALLAN, a novel allantoicase-like protein, has a location complementary to that of SUN1, forming focal points at the inner side of the NE. Like SUN1, ALLAN is also not essential during asexual erythrocytic stage proliferation. Functional studies following ALLAN gene deletion revealed similar defects in MTOC organisation, with impaired spindle formation, kinetochore attachment, and nuclear-cytoplasmic coordination during flagellated gamete assembly. Compared to SUN1, ALLAN gene deletion exhibited a less stringent phenotype because ALLAN knock-out parasites were able to transmit the disease from vector to host, while SUN1 knock-out parasites were blocked. This suggests that SUN1 has additional functional roles. These findings indicate that SUN1 and ALLAN work together, replacing the role of lamins and KASH proteins in coordinating nuclear and cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p>Interestingly, our interactome analysis identified kinesin-15 as a putative interactor of SUN1 and ALLAN, suggesting a possible link between this motor protein and nuclear remodelling. Previous studies have shown that kinesin-15 is essential for male gamete formation and is located partially at the plasma membrane and nuclear periphery, albeit mostly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zeeshan et al., 2022b</xref>). On the nuclear side, we found subunits of the condensin-II complex, similar to what was found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ito et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakamoto et al., 2022</xref>). These interactions with SUN1 and ALLAN raise the possibility of a broader network of proteins facilitating nuclear and cytoskeletal coordination during male gametogenesis.</p><p>Transcriptomic analysis of the <italic>Δsun1</italic> mutant showed upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and microtubule organisation. Lipidomic profiling further confirmed substantial alterations in the lipid composition of SUN1-deficient gametocytes. Notably, PA and CE, both critical for membrane curvature and expansion, were reduced in the <italic>Δsun1</italic> mutant, whereas MAG and DAG levels were elevated. These disruptions likely reflect impaired NE expansion and structural integrity during gametogenesis. Additionally, the altered levels of specific fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid and myristic acid, suggest perturbations in both scavenged and apicoplast-derived lipid pathways.</p><p>The SUN1-ALLAN complex exemplifies a lineage-specific adaptation in <italic>P. berghei</italic>, highlighting the evolutionary plasticity of NE remodelling mechanisms across eukaryotes. SUN-domain proteins, a hallmark of LINC complexes, are widely conserved and diversified across eukaryotic lineages, yet <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and related apicomplexans lack key canonical LINC components.</p><p>Our analyses suggest that the SUN1-ALLAN complex is specific to Haemosporida. While SUN-domain proteins are conserved across most eukaryotes, the allantoicase-like protein ALLAN is a novel addition to the nuclear architecture of apicomplexans. Phylogenetic profiling indicates that ALLAN likely arose from a duplication of an allantoicase in an early apicomplexan ancestor, likely the ancestor to all coccidians and hematozoa. This event gave rise to two subtypes: AKiT8, associated with kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brusini et al., 2022</xref>), and ALLAN, specialised in NE dynamics.</p><p>The absence of KASH proteins and lamins in apicomplexans raises fascinating questions about how NE and cytoskeletal coordination evolved in this group. Comparative studies in ichthyosporeans, close relatives of fungi and animals, have identified intermediate forms of mitosis involving partial NE disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shah et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> employs a highly streamlined closed mitosis, likely driven by the requirement for rapid nuclear and cytoskeletal coordination during male gametogenesis. The discovery of the SUN1-ALLAN axis suggests that apicomplexans have developed alternative strategies to adapt the NE for their cellular and mitotic requirements. These findings raise intriguing questions about the evolutionary pressures that shaped this unique nuclear-cytoskeletal interface in apicomplexans. The presence of similar or other non-canonical complexes in other organisms remains an open question, with potential implications for understanding the diversity of mitotic processes.</p><p>This study opens several avenues for future research into the biology of the malaria parasite and its unique adaptations for mitosis. While the SUN1-ALLAN complex has been shown to play a central role in bipartite MTOC organisation during male gametogenesis, many questions remain about its broader role and potential applications. Another key question concerns the evolutionary origins of the SUN1-ALLAN axis; comparative studies across apicomplexans, dinoflagellates, ciliates, and other non-model eukaryotes may help trace the evolution of this complex. The presence of similar non-canonical complexes in other rapidly dividing eukaryotic systems may shed light on the diversity of mitotic adaptations beyond <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. A functional further exploration of associated proteins, such as kinesin-15, may help elucidate how the SUN1-ALLAN complex integrates with other cellular machinery and structures. Investigating whether kinesin-15, a motor protein, interacts directly with SUN1 or ALLAN and has a catalytic role in nuclear-cytoskeletal remodelling may be critical to further our understanding of how the system achieves such rapid mitotic coordination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

These mosquitoes were checked for oocyst development and sporozoite formation at day 14 and day 21 after feeding. Infected mosquitoes were then allowed to feed on naïve mice, and after 4–5 d, these mice were examined for blood stage parasitaemia by microscopy with Giemsa-stained blood smears. In this way, some parasites expressed both GFP and mCherry in the resultant gametocytes, and these were purified, and fluorescence microscopy images were collected as described above.</p><p>Co-localisation between proteins was assessed in ImageJ. A line was drawn over a two-channel image and the line added to the ROI manager in the same place on both channels.

WT-GFP gametocytes were used as controls. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitation was conducted using a GFP-Trap_A Kit (Chromotek) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, lysates were incubated for 2 hr with GFP-Trap_A beads at 4°C with continuous rotation, then unbound proteins were washed away, and bound proteins were digested with trypsin.

Experiments were performed in duplicate. Peptides and proteins with a minimum threshold of 95% were used for further proteomic analysis. The PlasmoDB database was used for protein annotation, and manual curation was used to classify proteins into categories relevant for SUN1/ALLAN interactions: chromatin, nuclear pore, ER membrane and axonemal proteins. To capture co-variation of bound proteins between different experiments (comparing GFP-only with SUN1-GFP and ALLAN-GFP), we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) using unique peptide values per protein present in two replicates per experiment. Values for undetected proteins were set to 0.

To assess the stoichiometry of the complex we modelled from monomers up to decamers for both ALLAN and SUN1, using the N-terminus, the middle domain and the C-terminus of SUN1. ALLAN consistently formed higher order structures containing trimeric complexes. Although SUN1 could form higher order structures beyond trimers, we opted to model it as a trimer given the preference of ALLAN to form trimers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fixed Immunofluorescence assay and DNA content analysis</title><p>SUN1-KO and ALLAN-KO gametocytes were purified, activated in ookinete medium, fixed at various time points with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma) diluted in microtubule (MT)-stabilising buffer (MTSB) for 10 to 15 min, and added to poly-L-lysine coated slides. Immunocytochemistry used mouse anti-α tubulin mAb (Sigma-T9026; used at 1:1000) as primary antibody, and secondary antibody was Alexa 568 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen-A11004) (used at 1:1000).

The following day, gels were washed twice in PBS for 15 min to remove excess water, and then incubated with primary antibodies at 37 °C for 3 hr. After washing three times for 10 min in PBS/ 0.1% Tween, incubation with secondary antibodies was performed for 3 hr at 37°C followed by three washes of 10min each in PBS/ 0.1% Tween (all antibody incubation steps were performed at 37 °C with 120 to 160 rpm shaking).

Gene expression was quantified from 80 ng of total RNA using the SYBR Green Fast Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems). All primers were designed using Primer3 (Primer-BLAST, NCBI). The analysis was conducted on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast machine with the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 30 s. Three technical replicates and three biological replicates were performed for each gene tested. The genes hsp70 (PBANKA_081890) and arginyl-tRNA synthetase (PBANKA_143420) were used as endogenous control reference genes. The primers used for qPCR are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>Libraries were prepared from lyophilised total RNA, starting with the isolation of mRNA using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB), followed by the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were amplified through 12 PCR cycles (12 cycles of [15 s at 98°C, 30 s at 55°C, 30 s at 62°C]) using the KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems). Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 DNA sequerncer (Illumina), generating paired-end 100-bp reads.</p><p>FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews, 2023</xref>) was used to analyse raw read quality and the adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic (v0.39) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic">http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolger et al., 2018</xref>).

Uniquely mapped, properly paired reads with mapping quality of 40 or higher were retained using SAMtools (v1.19) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">http://samtools.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li, 2018</xref>).

Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 to call up-and down-regulated genes (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log2 FC &gt; 1.0). Volcano plots were made using the R package Enhanced Volcano.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Lipidomics analyses</title><p>Lipidomics analysis was performed on 3-4 independent cell harvests of the <italic>Δsun1</italic> and WT-GFP gametocytes. Gametocytes were purified as described above and metabolically quenched at 0 min and 8 min post activation via rapid cooling to 0°C by suspending the tube over a dry ice/100% ethanol slurry mix, while continually stirring the solution.</p><p>After three washing steps with 1 ml ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation, the parasite pellet was subjected to lipid extraction using chloroform and methanol in the presence of butylhydroxytoluene, PC (C21:0/C21:0), C13:0 or C15:0 FA standards. Lipid extraction, separation, and analyses were all performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flammersfeld et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, dried down samples were reconstituted in 80 μL methanol and incubated at 30°C for 5 min with vigorous vortex. Samples (1 μL) were analysed by LCMS (Agilent 1290 infinity/Infinity II Agilent) MS (Agilent 6495c triple quadruple). Acquisition DMRM (dynamic multiple reaction monitoring) method was used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charital et al., 2024</xref>) with a modification for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lipid species. The LCMS data was subjected to targeted analysis using Mass Hunter Quantification software (Agilent). Each lipid species was quantified using a calibration curve of each representative lipid with known abundance. Then each lipid abundance was normalised according to the cell ratio.</p><p>The graphical data for this study was generated using GraphPad Prism software. Three biological replicates were used per experiment (at least n = 3, unless stated otherwise). The error bars are representative of the standard error of mean (SEM) for each study. Statistical significance was determined for each experiment by unpaired t tests using GraphPad Prism. The range of statistical significance was signified as per the <italic>p</italic> value indicated in each graph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software). Student’s t-test and/or a two-way ANOVA test were employed to assess differences between control and experimental groups. Statistical significance is indicated as *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, **p&lt;0.001, or ns for not significant. ‘n’ denotes the sample size in each group or the number of biological replicates. For qRT-PCR data, a multiple comparisons t-test, with post hoc Holm–Sidak test, was utilised to evaluate significant differences between wild-type and mutant parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Newly created parasite lines in this study are available from Nottingham laboratory and can be accessed upon request from corresponding author Prof. Rita Tewari.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Software, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Software, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Software, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Software, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The animal work passed an ethical review process and was approved by the United Kingdom Home Office.

There is interest in how events inside the nucleus are co-ordinated with events in the parasite cytoplasm, to ensure that each nucleus is packaged into a nascent male gamete.</p><p>This manuscript by Zeeshan et al describes the organisation of a nuclear membrane bridging protein, SUN1, during nuclear division. SUN1 is expected from studies in other organisms to be a component of a bridging complex (LINC) that connects the inner nuclear membrane to the outer nuclear membrane, and from there to the cytoplasmic microtubule-organising centres, the centrosome and the basal body.</p><p>The authors show that knockout of the SUN1 in gametocytes leads to severe disruption of the mitotic spindle and failure of the basal bodies to segregate. The authors show convincingly that functional SUN1 is required for male gamete formation and subsequent oocyst development.</p><p>The authors identified several SUN1-interacting proteins, thus providing information about the nuclear membrane bridging machinery.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have used state of the art imaging, genetic manipulation and immunoprecipitation approaches.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Technical limitations of some of the methods used make it difficult to interpret some of the micrographs.</p><p>From studies in other organisms, a protein called KASH is a critical component the bridging complex (LINC). That is, KASH links SUN1 to the outer nuclear membrane. The authors undertook a gene sequence analysis that reveals that Plasmodium lacks a KASH homologue. Thus, further work is needed to identify the functional equivalent of KASH, to understand bridging machinery in Plasmodium.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have addressed the comments and suggestions that I provided as part of a Review Commons assessment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106537.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Zeeshan et al. investigate the function of the protein SUN1, a proposed nuclear envelope protein linking nuclear and cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, during the rapid male gametogenesis of the rodent malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. They reveal that SUN1 localises to the nuclear envelope (NE) in male and female gametes and show that the male NE has unexpectedly high dynamics during the rapid process of gametogenesis. Using expansion microscopy, the authors find that SUN1 is enriched at the neck of the bipartite MTOC that links the intranuclear spindle to the basal bodies of the cytoplasmic axonemes. Upon deletion of SUN1, the basal bodies of the eight axonemes fail to segregate, no spindle is formed, and emerging gametes are anucleated, leading to a complete block in transmission. By interactomics the authors identify a divergent allantoicase-like protein, ALLAN, as a main interaction partner of SUN1 and further show that ALLAN deletion largely phenocopies the effect of SUN1.</p><p>Overall, the authors use an extensive array of fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques as well as interactomics to convincingly demonstrate that SUN1 and ALLAN play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the bipartite MTOC during the rapid rounds of endomitosis in male gametogenesis.</p><p>Two suggestions for improvement of the work remain:</p><p>(1) Lipidomic analysis of WT and SUN1-knockout gametocytes before and after activation resulted in only minor changes in some lipid species. Without statistical analysis, it remains unclear if these changes are statistically significant and not rather due to expected biological variability. While the authors clearly toned down their conclusions in the revised manuscript, some phrasings in the results and the discussion still suggest that gametocyte activation and/or SUN1-knockout affects lipid composition. Similarly, some phrases suggest that SUN1 is responsible for the observed loops and folds in the NE and that SUN1 KO affects the NE dynamics. Currently, I do not think that the data supports these statements.</p><p>(2) It is interesting to note that ALLAN has a much more specific localisation to basal bodies than SUN1, which is located to the entire nuclear envelope. Knock out of ALLAN also exhibits a milder (but still striking) phenotype than knockout of SUN1. These observations suggest that SUN1 has additional roles in male gametogenesis besides its interaction with ALLAN, which could be discussed a bit more.</p><p>This study uses extensive microscopy and genetics to characterise an unusual SUN1-ALLAN complex, thus providing new insights into the molecular events during Plasmodium male gametogenesis, especially how the intranuclear events (spindle formation and mitosis) are linked to the cytoplasmic separation of the axonemes. The characterisation of the mutants reveals an interesting phenotype, showing that SUN1 and ALLAN are localised to and maintain the neck region of the bipartite MTOC. The authors here confirm and expand the previous knowledge about SUN1 in P. berghei, adding more detail to its localisation and dynamics, and further characterise the interaction partner ALLAN. Given the evolutionary divergence of Plasmodium, these results are interesting not only for parasitologists, but also for more general cell biologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

comments:</p><p>In the results section (lines 498-499), the authors describe free kinetochores in many cells without associated spindle microtubules. However, some nuclei appear to have kinetochores, as presented in Figure 6. Could the authors clarify how this conclusion was derived using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) without serial sectioning, as this is not explicitly mentioned in the materials and methods?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed free kinetochores in the ALLAN-KO parasites with no associated spindle microtubules (see Fig. 6Gh), while kinetochores are attached to spindle microtubules in WT-GFP cells (see Fig. 6Gc). To provide further evidence we analysed additional images and found that ALLAN-KO cells have free kinetochores in the centre of nucleus, unattached to spindle microtubules. We provide some more images clearly showing free kinetochores in these cells (new supplementary Fig. S11).</p><p>However, in the ALLAN mutant, this difference is not absolute: in a search of over 50 cells, one example of a cell with a “normal” nuclear spindle and attached kinetochores was observed.</p><p>The use of serial sectioning has limitations for examining small structures like kinetochores in whole cells. The limitations of the various techniques (for example, SBF-SEM vs tomography) are highlighted in our previous study (Hair et al 2022; PMID: 38092766), and we consider that examining a population of randomly sectioned cells provides a better understanding of the overall incidence of specific features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion Section:</p><p>Could the authors expand on why SUN1 and ALLAN are not required during asexual replication, even though they play essential roles during male gametogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed no phenotype in asexual blood stage parasites associated with the <italic>sun1</italic> and <italic>allan</italic> gene deletions. Several other <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> gene knockout parasites with a phenotype in sexual stages, for example CDPK4 (PMID: 15137943), SRPK (PMID: 20951971), PPKL (PMID: 23028336) and kinesin-5 (PMID: 33154955) have no phenotype in blood stages, so perhaps this is not surprising. One explanation may be the substantial differences in the mode of cell division between these two stages. Asexual blood stages produce new progeny (merozoites) over 24 hours with closed mitosis and asynchronous karyokinesis during schizogony, while male gametogenesis is a rapid process, completed within 15 min to produce eight flagellated gametes. During male gametogenesis the nuclear envelope must expand to accommodate the increased DNA content (from 1N to 8N) before cytokinesis. Furthermore, male gametogenesis is the only stage of the life cycle to make flagella, and axonemes must be assembled in the cytoplasm to produce the flagellated motile male gametes at the end of the process. Thus, these two stages of parasite development have some very different and specific features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 611-613 states: &quot;These loops serve as structural hubs for spindle assembly and kinetochore attachment at the nuclear MTOC, separating nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.&quot; Could the authors elaborate on the evidence supporting this statement?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed the loops/folds in the nuclear envelope (NE) as revealed by SUN1-GFP and 3D TEM images during male gametogenesis. These folds/loops occur mainly in the vicinity of the nuclear MTOC where the spindles are assembled (as visualised by EB1 fluorescence) and attached to kinetochores (as visualised by NDC80 fluorescence). These loops/folds may form due to the contraction of the spindle pole back to the nuclear periphery, inducing distortion of the NE. Since there is no physical segregation of chromosomes during the three rounds of mitosis (DNA increasing from 1N to 8N), we suggest that these folds provide additional space for spindle and kinetochore dynamics within an intact NE to maintain separation from the cytoplasm (as shown by location of kinesin-8B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 621-622, the authors suggest that ALLAN may have a broader role in NE remodelling across the parasite's lifecycle. Could they reflect on or remind readers of the finding that ALLAN is not essential during the asexual stage?</p></disp-quote><p>ALLAN-GFP is expressed throughout the parasite life cycle but as the reviewer points out, a functional role is more pronounced during male gametogenesis. This does not mean that it has no role at other stages of the life cycle even if there is no obvious phenotype following deletion of the gene during the asexual blood stage. The fact that ALLAN is not essential during the asexual blood stage is noted in lines 628-29.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Line 63: The authors stat: &quot;NE is integral to mitosis, supporting spindle formation, kinetochore attachment, and chromosome segregation..&quot;.

It is believed that there is no complete disassembly of the NE during open mitosis and no completely intact NE during closed mitosis, respectively. In fact, the NE plays a critical role in the different modes of mitosis during MTOC organisation and spindle dynamics.

The authors generated a C-terminal GFP-tagged SUN1 transfectants and used ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to examine SUN1-GFP in male gametocytes post-activation. The immuno-labelling of SUN1-GFP in these fixed cells appears very different to the live cell images of SUN1-GFP. The labelling profile comprises distinct punctate structures (particularly in the U-ExM images), suggesting that paraformaldehyde fixation process, followed by the addition of the primary and secondary antibodies has caused coalescing of the SUN1-GFP signal into particular regions within the NE.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Fixation with paraformaldehyde (PFA) results in a coalescence of the SUN1-GFP signal. We have also tried methanol fixation (see new Fig. S2), but a similar problem was encountered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these fixation issues, the suggestion that the SUN1-GFP signal is concentrated at the BB/ nuclear MTOC and &quot;enriched near spindle poles&quot; needs further support.</p><p>These statements seem at odd with the data for live cell imaging where the SUN1-GFP seems evenly distributed around the nuclear periphery. Can the observation be quantitated by calculating the percentage of BB/ nuclear MTOC structures with associated SUN1-GFP puncta? If not, I am not convinced these data help understand the molecular events.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that whilst the live cell imaging showed an even distribution of SUN1-GFP signal, after fixation with either PFA or methanol, then SUN1-GFP puncta are observed in addition to the peripheral location around the stained DNA (Hoechst) (See Fig. S2; puncta are indicated by arrows). These SUN1-GFP labelled puncta were observed at the junction of the nuclear MTOC and the basal body (Fig. 2F). Quantification of the distribution showed that these SUN1-GFP puncta are associated with nuclear MTOC in more than 90 % of cells (18 cells examined). Live cell imaging of the dual labelled parasites; SUN1xkinesin-8B (Fig. 2H) and SUN1x EB1 (Fig. 2I) provides further support for the association of SUN1-GFP puncta with BB (kinesin-8B) /nuclear MTOC (EB1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then generated dual transfectants and examined the relative locations of different markers in live cells.

The nuclear MTOCs are not labelled in this experiment. The SUN1-GFP signal between the kinesin-8B puncta is evident as small puncta on regions of NE distortion. I would prefer to not describe this signal as &quot;strong&quot;. The signal is stronger in other regions of the NE.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the sentence on line 213 to accommodate this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 219.

That Sayers et al. study identified a complex of SUN1 and ALLC1 as essential for male fertility in P. berghei.

The study by Sayers et al, (2024) was published while our manuscript was under preparation. It was interesting to see that these complementary studies have similar findings about the role of SUN1 and the novel complex of SUN1-ALLAN. Our study contains a more detailed, in-depth analysis both by Expansion and TEM of SUN1. We include additional studies on the role of ALLAN. We discuss the overlap in the findings of the two studies in lines 590-605.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the work is interesting, the conclusions may need to be tempered.

However, the protein that functionally replaces KASH (i.e. links SUN1 to the ONM) remains unidentified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer, and future studies will need to focus on identifying the KASH replacement that links SUN1 to the ONM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It may also be premature to suggest that the SUN1-ALLAN complex is promising target for blocking malaria transmission.

GO-based analysis suggested up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Given the modest changes, it may not be correct to conclude that &quot;lipid metabolism and microtubule function may be critical functions for gametogenesis that can be perturbed by sun1 deletion.&quot; These changes may simply be a consequence of the stalled male gametocyte development.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion we have moved these data to the supplementary information (Fig. S5D-I) and toned down their discussion in the results and discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have then undertaken a detailed lipid analysis of the Δsun1 and WT gametocytes, before and after activation. Substantial changes in lipid metabolites might not be expected in such a short period of time. And indeed, the changes appear minimal. Similarly, there are only minor changes in a few lipid sub-classes between Δsun1 and WT gametocytes. In my opinion, the data are not sufficient to support the authors conclusion that &quot;SUN1 plays a crucial role, linking lipid metabolism to NE remodelling and gamete formation.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the reviewer’s comments we have moved these data to supplementary information (Fig. S6) and substantially toned down the conclusions based on these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>My main concern with this manuscript is that the authors do conclude not only that SUN1 is important for spindle formation and basal body segregation, but also that it influences for lipid metabolism and NE dynamics. I don't think the data supports this conclusion, for several reasons listed below. I would suggest to remove this claim from the manuscript or at least tone it down unless more supporting data are provided, in particular showing any change in NE dynamics in the SUN1-KO. Instead I would recommend to focus on the more interesting role of SUN1-ALLAN in bipartite MTOC organisation, which likely explains all observed phenotypes (including those in later stages of the parasite life cycle). In addition, some aspects of the knockout phenotype should be quantified to a bit deeper level.</p><p>In more detail:</p><p>- The lipidomics analysis is clearly the weakest point of the manuscript: The authors state that there are significant changes in some lipid populations between WT and sun1-KO, and between activated and non-activated cells, yet no statistical analysis is shown and the error bars are quite high compared to only minor changes in the means. For some discussed lipids, the result text does not match the graphs, e.g. PA, where the increase upon activation is more pronounced in the SUN1-KO vs WT (contrary to the text), or MAG, which is reduced in the SUN1-KO vs WT (contrary to the text). I don't see the discussed changes in arachidonic acid levels and myristic acid levels in the data either. Even if the authors find after analysis some statistically significant differences between some groups, they should carefully discuss the biological significance of these differences. As it is, I do not think the presented data warrants the conclusion that deletion of SUN1 changes lipid homeostasis, but rather shows that overall lipid homeostasis is not majorly affected by gametogenesis or SUN1 deletion. As a minor comment, if you decide to keep the lipidomics analysis in the manuscript, please state how many replicates were done.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed above we have moved the lipidomics data to supplementary information (Fig. S6) and substantially toned down the discussion of these data in the results and discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I can't quite follow the logic why the authors performed transcriptomic analysis of the SUN1 and how they chose their time points. Their data up to this point indicate that SUN1 has a structural or coordinating role in the bipartite MTOC during male gametogenesis. Based on that it is rather unlikely that SUN1 KO directly leads to transcriptional changes within the 8 min of exflagellation. Isn't it more likely that transcriptional differences are purely a downstream effect of incomplete/failed gametogenesis? This is particularly true for the comparison at 30 min, which compares a mixture of exflagellated/emerged gametes and zygotes in WT to a mixture of aberrant, arrested gametes in the knockout, which will likely not give any meaningful insight. The by far most significant GO-term is then also nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, which is likely not related at all to SUN1 function (and the authors do not even comment on this in the main text). I would therefore suggest removing the 30 min data set from this manuscript. As a minor point, I would suggest highlighting some of the top de-regulated gene IDs in the volcano plots and stating their function. Also, please state how you prepared the cells for the transcriptomes and in how many replicates this was done.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have removed the 30 min post activation data from the manuscript. We have also moved the rest of the transcriptomics data to supplementary information (Fig. S5) and toned down the presentation of this aspect of the work in the results and discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Live-cell imaging of SUN1-GFP does nicely visualise the NE during gametogenesis, showing a highly dynamic NE forming loops and folds, which is very exciting to see. It would be beneficial to also show a video from the life-cell imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added videos to the manuscript as suggested by the reviewer. Please see the supplementary Videos S1 and S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their discussion, the authors state multiple times that NE dynamics are changed upon SUN1 KO. Yet, they do not provide data supporting this claim, i.e. that the extended loops and folds found in the nuclear envelope during gametogenesis are affected in any way by the knockout of SUN1 or ALLAN. What happens to the NE in absence of SUN1? Are there less loops and folds? In absence of a reliable NE marker this may not be entirely easy to address, but at least some SBF-SEM images of the sun1-KO gametocytes could provide insight.</p></disp-quote><p>It was difficult to provide SBF-SEM images as that work is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We will consider this approach in our future work. We re-examined many of our TEM images of SUN1-KO and ALLAN-KO parasites and did find some micrographs showing aberrant nuclear membrane folding (&lt;5%) (Please see Author response image 2). However, we also observed similar structures in some of the WT-GFP samples (&lt;5%), so we do not think this is a strong phenotype of the SUN1 or ALLAN mutants.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106537-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I think the exciting part of the manuscript is the cell biological role of SUN1 on male gametogenesis, which could be carved out a bit more by a more detailed phenotyping.

In WT parasites a small proportion of gametes can appear to lack a nucleus if it does not extend all the way to the apical and basal ends (Hair et al. 2022). However, the proportion of microgametes that appear to lack a nucleus (no nucleus seen in any section) was much higher in the SUN1 mutant. In contrast, this difference was not as clear cut in the ALLAN mutant with a small proportion of intact (with axoneme and nucleus) microgametes being observed.</p><p>We have done additional analysis of male gametes, looking for the presence of the nucleus by live cell imaging after DNA staining with Hoechst. These data are added in Fig. 3K (for Sun1-KO) and Fig. S10G (for Allan-KO).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The TEM suggests that in the SUN1-KO, kinetochores are free in the nucleus. Are all kinetochores free or do some still associate to a (minor/incorrectly formed) spindle? The authors could address this by tagging NDC80 in the KO lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Our observation and quantification of the data indicated that 100% of kinetochores were attached to spindle microtubules and that 0% were unattached kinetochores in the WT parasites. However, the exact opposite was found for the SUN1 mutant with 100% unattached kinetochores and 0% attached. The result was not quite as clear cut in the ALLAN mutant, with 98% unattached and 2% attached. An important observation was the lack of separation of the nuclear poles and any spindle formation. Spindle formation was never or very rarely observed in the mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Finally, I think it is curious that in contrast to SUN1, ALLAN seems to be less important, with some KO parasite completing the life cycle. Maybe a more detailed phenotyping as above gives some more hints to where the phenotypic difference between the two proteins lies. I would assume some ALLAN-KO cells can still segregate the basal body. Can the authors speculate/discuss in more detail why these two proteins seems to have slightly different phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Overall, the ALLAN-KO has a less prominent phenotype than that of the Sun1-KO. The main difference is that in the ALLAN-KO mutant some basal body segregation can occur, leading to the production of some fertile microgametocytes, and ookinetes, and oocyst formation (Fig. 8). Approximately 5% of oocysts sporulated to release infective sporozoites that could infect mice in bite back experiments and complete the life cycle. In contrast the Sun1-KO mutant made no healthy oocysts, or infective sporozoites, and could not complete the life cycle in bite back experiments. We have analysed the phenotype in detail and provide quantitative data for gametocyte stages by EM and ExM in Figs. 4 and S8 (SUN1) and Figs. 7 and S11 (ALLAN). We have also performed detailed analysis of oocyst and sporozoite stages and included the data in Fig. 3 (SUN1) and S10 (ALLAN).</p><p>Based on the location, and functional and interactome data, we think that SUN1 plays a central role in coordinating nucleoplasm and cytoplasmic events as a key component of the nuclear membrane lumen, whereas ALLAN is located in the nucleoplasm. Deleting the SUN1 gene may disrupt the connection between INM and ONM whereas the deletion of ALLAN may affect only the INM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some additional points where the data is not entirely sound yet or could be improved:</p><p>- Localisation of SUN1: There seems to be a discrepancy between SUN1-GFP location as observed by live cell microscopy, and by Expansion Microscopy (ExM), similar for ALLAN-GFP. By live-cell microscopy, the SUN1 localisation is much more evenly distributed around the NE, while the localisation in ExM is much more punctuated, and e.g. in Figure 1E seems to be within the nucleus. Do the authors have an explanation for this? Also, in Fig. 1D there are two GFP foci at the cell periphery (bottom left of the image), which I would think are not SUN1-Foci, as they seem to be outside of the cell. Is the antibody specific? Was there a negative control done for the antibody (WT cells stained with GFP antibodies after ExM)?</p></disp-quote><p>High resolution SIM and expansion microscopy showed that the SUN1-GFP molecules coalesce to form puncta, in contrast to the more uniform distribution observed by live cell imaging. This apparent difference may be due to a better resolution that could not be achieved by live cell imaging. We agree with the reviewer that the two green foci are outside of the cell. As a negative control we have used WT-ANKA cells (which contain no GFP) and the anti-GFP antibody, which gave no signal. This confirms the specificity of the antibody (please see the new Fig. S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors argue that SIM gave unexpected results due to PFA fixation leading to collapse of the NE loops. However, they also fix their ExM cells and their EM cells with PFA and do not observe a collapse, at least from what I see in the two presented images and in the 3D reconstruction. Is there something else different in the sample preparation?</p></disp-quote><p>There was no difference in the fixation process for samples examined by SIM and ExM, but we used an anti-GFP antibody in ExM to visualise the SUN1-GFP, while in SIM the images of GFP signal were collected directly after fixation. We used both PFA and methanol as fixative, and both methods showed a coalescing of the SUN1-GFP signal (please see the new Fig. S2 and S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors trace their NE in ExM according to the NHS-Ester signal?</p></disp-quote><p>We could trace the NE in the ExM by the NHS-ester signal and observed that the SUN1-GFP signal was largely coincident with the NE (Please see the new Fig. S3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig 2D: It would be good to not just show images of oocysts but actually quantify their size from images. Also, have the authors determined the sporozoite numbers in SUN1-KO?</p></disp-quote><p>We have measured oocyst size (data added in new Fig. 3) and added the sporozoite quantification data in Fig. 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 481-483: the authors state that oocyst size is reduced in ALLAN-KO but do not show the data. Please quantify oocyst size or at least show representative images. Also the drastic decrease in sporozoite numbers (Fig. 6D, E) is not mentioned in the text. Please add reference to Fig S7D when talking about the bite back data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the oocyst size data in Fig. S10. We mention the changes in sporozoite numbers (now shown in Fig. 7D, E), and refer to the bite back data shown in current Fig. 7E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig S1C, 6C: Both WB images are stitched, but this is not clearly indicated e.g. by leaving a small gap between the lanes. Also please show a loading control along with the western blots. Also there seems to be a (unspecific?) band in the control, running at the same height as Allan-GFP WB. What exactly is the control?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the original blot showing the bands of ALLAN-GFP and SUN1-GFP. As a positive control, we used an RNA associated protein (RAP-GFP) that is highly expressed in Plasmodium and regularly used in our lab for this purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Regarding the crossing experiment: The authors conclude from this cross that SUN1 is only needed in males, yet for this conclusion they would need to also show that a cross with a female line does not rescue the phenotype. The authors should repeat the cross with a male-deficient line to really test if the phenotype is an exclusively male phenotype. In addition, line 270-272 states that no oocysts/sporozoites were detected in sun1-ko and nek4-ko parasites. However, the figure 2E shows only oocysts, not sporozoites, and shows also that sun1-ko does form oocysts, albeit dead ones.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the experiment of crossing the Sun1-KO parasite line with a male deficient line (Hap2-KO) and added the data in Fig. 3I. We have added images showing sporozoites in oocysts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Fig S1 the authors show that they also generated a SUN1-mCherry line, yet they do not use it in any of the presented experiments (unless I missed it). Would it be beneficial to cross the SUN1-mCherry line with the Allan1-GFP line to test colocalisation (possibly also by expansion microscopy)?</p></disp-quote><p>We did generate a SUN1-mCherry line, with the intent to cross ALLAN-GFP and SUN1-mCherry lines and observe the co-location of the proteins. Despite multiple attempts this cross was unsuccessful. This may have been due to their close proximity such that the addition of both GFP and mCherry was difficult to facilitate a proper protein-protein interaction between either of the proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 498: &quot;In a significant proportion of cells&quot; - What was the proportion of cells, and what does significant mean in this context?</p></disp-quote><p>Approximately 67% of cells showed the clumping of BBs. We have now added the numbers in Figs. 6H and S11I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should discuss a bit more how their work relates to the work of Sayers et al. 2024, which also identified the SUN1-ALLAN complex. The paper is cited, but only very briefly commented on.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended this discussion now in lines 590-605.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions how to improve the writing and data presentation.</p><p>- General presentation of microscopy images: Considering that large parts of the manuscript are based on microscopy data, their presentation could be improved. Single-channel microscopy images would benefit from being depicted in gray scale instead of color, which would make it easier to see the structures and intensities (especially for blue channels).</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst we agree with the reviewer, sometimes it is difficult to see the features in the merged images. Therefore, we would like to request to be allowed to retain the colours, which can be easily followed in both individual and merged images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it would be good to harmonize in which panels arrows are shown (e.g. Fig 1G, where some white arrows are in the SUN1-GFP panel, while others are in the merge panel, but they presumably indicate the same thing.). At the same time, Fig 1H doesn't have any with arrows, even though the figure legend states so.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this lack of consistency, and we have now added arrows wherever they are missing to harmonise in the presentations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 3A and S4 show the same experiment but are coloured in different colours (NHS-Eester in green vs grey scale).</p><p>- Are the scale bars of all expansion microscopy images adjusted for the expansion factor?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the scale bars are adjusted accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The figure legends would benefit from streamlining, as they have very different style between figures (eg Fig. 6 which has a concise figure legend vs microscopy figures where figure legends are very long and describe not only the figure but the results)</p></disp-quote><p>The figure legends have been streamlined, with removal of the description of results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 155-156: The text makes it sound like the expression only happens after activation. is that the case? Are these images activated or non-activated gametocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>They are expressed before activation, but the signal intensifies after activation.

This way, the results would be interesting not only for parasitologists, but also for more general cell biologists.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved the lipidomics and transcriptomics data to supplementary information and toned down the emphasis on these data to make the manuscript more focused on the cell biology and analysis of the genetic KO data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
