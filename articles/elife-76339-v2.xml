While multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes and their key transcriptional regulators have been identified, there is a lack of consistent definition for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transcriptional states. In addition, the progressive changes affecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes during and after immune responses remain poorly defined. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized the diversity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to self-resolving and chronic viral infections in mice. We built a comprehensive map of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and their evolution over time, and identified six major cell states consistently observed in acute and chronic infections. During the course of acute infections, T cell composition progressively changed from effector to memory states, with subtype-specific gene modules and kinetics. Conversely, in persistent infections T cells acquired distinct, chronicity-associated programs. By single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) analysis, we characterized the clonal structure of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells across individuals. Virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were essentially private across individuals and most T cells differentiated into both Tfh and Th1 subtypes irrespective of their TCR. Finally, we showed that our CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell map can be used as a reference to accurately interpret cell states in external single-cell datasets across tissues and disease models. Overall, this study describes a previously unappreciated level of adaptation of the transcriptional states of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to viruses and provides a new computational resource for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CD4 T cells</kwd><kwd>viral infection</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>single-cell transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>exhaustion</kwd><kwd>single-cell data science</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3_180010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmona</surname><given-names>Santiago J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Description of the transcriptional and clonal landscape of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in acute and chronic viral infections, and a new reference map to interpret CD4 T cell diversity across tissues and biological models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a critical role in shaping immune responses against pathogens through the secretion of soluble mediators and direct cell interactions with other immune cell populations. The multifaceted ability of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to orchestrate multiple layers of protection relies on their unique capacity to adopt diverse functional fates upon antigen encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Swain et al., 2012</xref>). Following viral infections, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells clonally expand and differentiate into effector populations supporting both cellular and humoral responses. This functional diversification of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations is under tight transcriptional control, ensuring the appropriate positioning and deployment of effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). While Th1 cells, supported by the transcription factors Blimp1 and T-bet, regulate cellular responses in helping CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and innate populations through the secretion of INF-γ, follicular-helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Tfh), which depend on Bcl6, promote antibody responses via direct cell contact with B cells and the production of cytokines like IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laidlaw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheikh and Groom, 2021</xref>).</p><p>During the contraction phase following its initial amplification, the pool of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells declines in both self-resolving and persistent infections. However, the nature of the infection greatly impacts the evolution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>). After acute viral infections, pathogen clearance is followed by the persistence of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations that acquire distinct phenotypes, gene expression and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hale et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>). Because memory populations are heterogeneous and include many subsets, including Th1- and Tfh-like subsets, measuring transcriptional changes occurring between the effector to memory populations remains challenging. In fact, in addition of Th1 and Tfh cells, memory populations are comprised of a less differentiated subset of Central Memory (Tcm) cells that contribute to long-term protective functions of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pepper and Jenkins, 2011</xref>). Tcm cells phenotypically resemble cells present during the early anti-viral response and referred to as Central Memory precursors (Tcmp), raising the possibility of an early transcriptional imprinting that favors the emergence of long-lived memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, the nature of such program, as well as its overlap with that involved in Th1 and Tfh subsets, has not been elucidated. More broadly, it remains unclear whether a shared transcriptional module regulates memory differentiation, or whether diverse gene programs allowing long-term maintenance are imprinted in a subset-specific manner. In sharp contrast to acute settings, chronic infections do not result in such phenotypic memory transition of persisting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>). Instead, in response to sustained antigenic stimulation, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells acquire dysfunctional features, including the expression of inhibitory receptors and reduced cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, questions remain about how persistent infections alter the functional and transcriptional landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations. However, because of the lack of consistent definition of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states across conditions and over time, the subtype-specific adaptations during infections are currently poorly characterized.</p><p>Although there is evidence that cell fate decisions are stochastically imprinted on T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchholz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soon et al., 2020</xref>), other studies have shown that cell-intrinsic factors as well as environmental cues affect the differentiation of single naïve T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tubo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>). Among these factors, the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and their cognate antigen has been shown to influence the diversification and maintenance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Snook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, recent studies showed that Th1 and Tfh differentiation are influenced by TCR usage, affinity to cognate peptides and the type of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Künzli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Snook et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, we do not fully understand the extent by which the TCR repertoire impacts the early fate decision of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to acute and chronic viral infections. In particular, it remains to be addressed whether naïve T cells with particular TCR chains are preferentially recruited during the effector phase and adopt specific transcriptional profiles that could skew the overall immune response.</p><p>Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with single-cell TCR sequencing to explore the landscape of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states at different timepoints during acute and chronic infections. We provide evidence of both shared and subtype-specific transcriptional changes occurring dynamically in both types of infection. Analysis of paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data of antigen-specific polyclonal T cells revealed that, although a fraction of the clonotypes in both acute and chronic settings were significantly biased towards specific subtypes, T cell functional diversification appears to be mostly independent of the expression of particular TCR chain pairs. Based on these results, we make available a new reference map describing virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states – including Th1, Tfh, and Tcmp/Tcm – and their dynamic evolution over time during acute and chronic infection. By combining this map with a reference-projection algorithm, we provide a new computational framework that enables automated and accurate interpretation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states across models, conditions, and experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential phenotypic adaptation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in acute and chronic viral infection</title><p>To characterize the diversification of T cell populations during acute and chronic infections, we used two variants of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV): the Armstrong and Clone 13 strains. Both viruses induce a strong T cell amplification early in the response, followed by the persistence of a small pool of virus-specific T cells at later timepoints. While the Armstrong strain results in an acute infection cleared within 6–8 days post infection (dpi), Clone 13 persists, leading to chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>). Using these models, we sought to measure the phenotypic changes of virus-specific T cells following infection, both at early and late timepoints. Virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were identified using MHC tetramers loaded with the LCMV-derived GP66 and GP33 peptides, respectively.

Interestingly, while CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to acute and chronic infections at early timepoints showed partial similarities, minimal overlap was observed at late timepoints.

Overall, these analyses revealed a profound and fast-adapting phenotypic heterogeneity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in response to different infection settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Defining the landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states in acute and chronic viral infection</title><p>To characterize the transcriptional landscape of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and gain further insight into their heterogeneity and transcriptional adaptation, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from LCMV-infected animals at different timepoints. Virus-specific GP66:I-A<sup>b+</sup> were purified either 7 or 21 days after Clone 13 infection – conditions referred to as Early and Late Chronic. In addition, similar populations were isolated 7, 21 and &gt;60 days after LCMV Armstrong infection – conditions referred to as Acute, Early and Late Memory, respectively. A total of 11 samples, including two or three biological replicates per condition, were processed with droplet-based scRNA-seq, resulting in over 35,000 high-quality virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A-B</xref>). In addition, selected samples were used to measure simultaneously TCR usage and transcriptome at single-cell resolution. To generate a unified map of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states in acute and chronic infections, all datasets were integrated with STACAS, a computational tool allowing correction of batch effects while preserving relevant biological variability across datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreatta and Carmona, 2021a</xref>) (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While different timepoints and types of infection (i.e. acute vs chronic) occupied different areas of the integrated space, biological replicates were largely covering overlapping areas of the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting a successful data integration. By clustering the high-dimensional space of the integrated map, we defined six major and three minor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters that were annotated based on the expression of canonical markers previously described in this model. Among the six major clusters, representing &gt;93% of the cells in the map, we identified: <italic>(i</italic>) Th1 effector cells, expressing the highest levels of <italic>Cxcr6</italic> and <italic>Ly6c2</italic> (encoding Ly6C)<italic>; (ii</italic>) Tfh effector cells, preferentially expressing <italic>Cxcr5</italic> and <italic>Izumo1r</italic> (encoding FR4); <italic>(iii</italic>) Central memory precursors (Tcmp) expressing the highest levels of <italic>Ccr7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The remaining three major clusters were identified as putative memory populations based on their higher expression of memory-associated genes <italic>Tcf7</italic> (encoding TCF1) and <italic>Il7r</italic>, corresponding to: <italic>(iv</italic>) Th1 memory (co-expressing <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Il7r</italic>, <italic>Cxcr6</italic> and <italic>Ly6c2</italic>), <italic>(v</italic>) Tfh memory (co-expressing <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Il7r</italic> and <italic>Izumo1r</italic>) and (<italic>vi</italic>) Central Memory cells (Tcm), with the highest levels of <italic>Tcf7</italic> and <italic>Il7r</italic> but limited expression of Th1/Tfh marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with these annotations, Th1 memory, Tfh memory and Central Memory (Tcm) populations were predominantly derived from virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated at late timepoints after acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see next section). In addition, these clusters of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and their annotations were independently validated using gene signatures that were previously identified on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after acute viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, three minor clusters corresponded to <italic>(i) Foxp3-</italic>expressing regulatory T cells (Treg), (<italic>ii</italic>) a Tfh-like state expressing high levels of type 1 interferons-stimulated genes (INFI-stimulated) and (<italic>iii</italic>) a population characterized by high levels of <italic>Eomes</italic> (Eomes-HI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We also interrogated potential changes between the early and late memory timepoints resulting in the identification of 196 genes differentially expressed in a time- and state-specific manner in response to acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Our analyses revealed that the transition of Th1 and Tfh subtypes from effector phase to memory phase were accompanied by the dampening of effector function molecules such as <italic>Gzmb</italic> (Th1) and <italic>Il21</italic> (Tfh), and by the acquisition of <italic>Il7r</italic> expression at the memory phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the downregulation of effector programs, especially for the Tfh state, was more pronounced in late memory phase compared to early memory, suggesting that memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo continued transcriptional remodeling after the contraction phase. In contrast, the central memory-type cells [Tcmp and Tcm clusters, referred to as Tcm(p)] readily downregulated most effector-associated genes at the early memory phase. Similarly, the Tcm(p) state more quickly upregulated genes associated with the function, survival or trafficking of memory cells like <italic>Ccr7</italic>, <italic>Il7r</italic>, <italic>Bcl2,</italic> or <italic>Klf6</italic> compared to Th1 and Tfh states. This early divergence and stable expression of memory genes is compatible with the possibility that Tcmp represent a pool of circulatory cells with an increased fitness to develop into long-lived memory cells.</p><p>These analyses highlight subtype-specific transcriptional changes from effector to memory states. In particular, they suggest that, while Tcmp are poised to transition to memory, Th1 and Tfh states do so with different kinetics and using divergent transcriptional modules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Subtype-specific adaptation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states to chronic infection</title><p>We next investigated the adaptation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transcriptional states to chronic infection. Compared to the acute setting, we did not observe a sharp transition to memory states at day 21, and most virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells matched effector subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although the proportion of the Th1 subtype remained similar at early timepoints between acute and chronic condition, there was a reduction in the Th1 effector subsets at late chronic stages. In addition, we observed a larger pool of Tfh cells both at early and late chronic timepoints compared to acute settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>)<bold>,</bold> consistent with previous studies highlighting a Tfh bias during Clone 13 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>). We also noted that the fraction of Tcmp cells was lower in chronic infection, both at early and late stages, compared to the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in acute infection. Indeed, the proportion of Tcmp and Tcm cells, which can be identified by flow cytometry based on CCR7 expression, was greatly reduced among virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in chronic settings compared to acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we aimed to assess the transcriptional changes affecting the differentiation and persistence of each subtype in responses to chronicity. To this end, we measured the differences across subtypes at an early (7 dpi) and late phase (21 dpi) of the chronic response. We identified 214 genes differentially expressed between Acute vs. Early Chronic, Early vs. Late Chronic and Early memory vs. Late Chronic timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Importantly, most changes observed at the late chronic phase were not present at the early chronic stage, suggesting that they are not merely attributed to changes in viral replication or host responses to viral variants. We observed that late chronicity was associated with the upregulation of a shared gene module, including Nr4a family members (<italic>Nr4a1, Nr4a2, Nr4a3</italic>) and <italic>Tox</italic> in all subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>)<bold>,</bold> indicative of the strong TCR engagement in response to persistent antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seo et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the expression of inhibitory receptors such as <italic>Pdcd1</italic> (encoding PD-1) and <italic>Lag3</italic> was also detected across states in late chronic samples. Late timepoints were also characterized by the downregulation of effector modules, including gene associated with cytotoxic function, such as <italic>Gzmb</italic> and <italic>Ctsw</italic> (encoding <italic>Cathepsin W</italic>) in Th1 clusters. In contrast, cytokine <italic>Il21</italic> as well as transcription factor <italic>Maf</italic> remained highly expressed in Tfh clusters, suggesting that, unlike in Th1, effector functions in Tfh cells are not dampened at late chronic phase. In fact, <italic>Il21</italic> expression appears to increase at late timepoints in both Tfh and Th1 subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast to what was observed in response to acute infection, Tcm(p) minimally diverged from other states, as the expression of inhibitory receptors and transcription factors associated with T cell dysfunction such as <italic>Ikzf</italic>2 (encoding Helios), <italic>Bhlhe40,</italic> or <italic>Gata3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doering et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singer et al., 2016</xref>) were equally upregulated in all states in chronic settings. <italic>However,</italic> unlike other subtypes, Tcm(p) maintained expression of <italic>Il7r</italic>, <italic>Ccr7,</italic> and <italic>S1rp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the six main CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states, we detected two distinct states that were almost exclusively present in response to chronic infection: the IFNI-stimulated state and the <italic>Eomes</italic>-HI state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AC</xref>).

To describe the clonal relationship between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell states, we analyzed the TCR usage of all T cells for which a productive pair of TCRα/TCRβ sequences was detected (65% of all single cells). To limit potential confounding factors related to the survival or expansion of clonotypes over time, we restricted our analyses to early timepoints (i.e. 7 dpi) after acute or chronic infections. We observed a consistent pattern of clonal expansion across different animals, with large clonotypes (13–31 clones with &gt;20 cells per animal) occupying roughly half of the clonal space in all samples, both for acute and early chronic settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we interrogated potential repertoire overlaps between animals considering the pair of nucleotide and amino-acid sequences of the CDR3 regions. Strikingly, this analysis showed that less than 3% of the clonotypes (7 out of 795 CDR3 nucleotide pairs; 20 out of 779 CDR3 protein pairs) were observed in two or more animals, when considering clones with 3 cells or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar results were obtained when all clones, including singletons, were included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To this end, we defined a ‘clonotype bias’ metric to quantify how individual clones are skewed toward a specific subtype (see Materials and methods). At its extreme values, a clonotype bias of 1 indicates that a clonotype is composed uniquely of cells from the same subtype, and a clonotype bias of zero corresponds to a clonotype that matches exactly the background subtype distribution of the whole sample. Because small clonotypes are statistically more likely to show high clonotype bias compared to large clonotypes, we only considered expanded clonotypes with 10 or more cells, and corrected for clonotype size by generating expected background distributions by random permutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, see Materials and methods).

However, we observed that a small number of clonotypes exhibited significant functional bias (Z-score &gt;5), that is they were preferentially enriched in one specific subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In the case of acute infection, 9% of expanded clonotypes (15 out of 165) exhibited a functional bias toward one subtype. Similarly, 13% of expanded clonotypes in chronic infection (11 out of 85) showed a significant clonotype bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, in acute infection 14 out of 15 biased clonotypes were skewed toward either the Tcmp or Th1 states (8 and 6 respectively), while in chronic infection all 11 biased clonotypes showed functional bias toward either Th1 or Tfh states (8 and 3, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>).

However, the phenotypic and functional plasticity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has hindered a robust, unbiased delineation of pathogen-specific T cell subtypes. Although the precise characterization of T cell transcriptional states is fundamental toward understanding the dynamics of immune responses, the subtype-specific changes occurring over time in response to acute and chronic infections remain poorly understood. In recent years, scRNA-seq has enabled unbiased interrogation of T cell transcriptional diversity at the single-cell level. However, definition of T cell subtypes and states remains subjective and inconsistent across studies. We have previously demonstrated that reference projection is a scalable computational approach for robust and consistent single-cell data analysis, provided a reference cell map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreatta et al., 2021c</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we aimed at providing a reference map of the transcriptional and clonal landscape of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in acute and chronic infections. To this end, we generated a scRNA-seq dataset of &gt;35,000 high-quality virus-specific polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from infected mice in multiple timepoints throughout LCMV chronic or acute infections. One key advantage of this model is that it allowed us to explore T cell transcriptional diversity and clonality in both acute and chronic settings using a single antigen-specificity (<italic>GP66:I-A<sup>b+</sup></italic>) and to include biological replicates for every condition and timepoint. Combined with the projection algorithm ProjecTILs, our new reference map enabled robust and consistent interpretation of external CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell single-cell transcriptomics data from multiple tissues, conditions, and biological models, providing a new powerful resource for the community.</p><p>We also presented new insights into the transcriptional adaptation of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations over time and across conditions. Our analyses during acute infection highlighted that, although the major gene expression changes occur at the end of the initial proliferative burst, early memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that survive the contraction phase undergo continued transcriptional remodeling at later timepoints, similarly to late changes at play in CD8<sup>+</sup> and NK T cells memory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milner et al., 2020</xref>). However, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets undergo memory transition in a divergent manner, where each subtype acquires memory features with different kinetics and using non-overlapping transcriptional modules. Similar to the acquisition of the memory program in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Th1 memory differentiation is characterized by a dampening of effector functions accompanied by the upregulation of molecules associated with their long-term survival. In contrast, the transition of effector Tfh cells to memory states appears to be delayed, as molecules associated with Tfh function such as IL-21 or ICOS remain expressed in early memory Tfh cells, and their expression only decreases at later timepoints. This delayed transition into resting memory could be associated with differential and prolonged antigen exposure of Tfh within the germinal centers compared to Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Künzli et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the transition to the Tcm state diverges from both Th1 and Tfh. In fact, most memory-associated features like the expression of <italic>Ccr7</italic>, <italic>Il7r,</italic> or <italic>Bcl2</italic> appear quickly at the early memory phase or are already present in Tcmp cells at the acute phase of the response. This observation is in line with the concept that Tcmp cells already express a large fraction of memory-associated genes allowing for their survival and homing to lymphoid organs. Thus, it is possible that most Tcm derived mainly from Tcmp cells through the acquisition of a transcriptional state poised for memory differentiation, similar to memory-precursors in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaech et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>During chronic infection, similar state-specific changes occur in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes. In addition to a shared transcriptional module upregulated in all subsets, Th1 and Tfh states differ in their adaptation to chronic antigen stimulation. Imprinting of persistent antigen exposure on Th1 cells results in a reduction of effector function characterized by the repression of effector molecules like granzymes, reminiscent of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function dampening in chronic infection and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singer et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, Tfh effector functions remain unaffected at the chronic phase of the response. While this could be related to the strong Tfh bias observed in chronic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>), we also observed in Th1 subsets features typically associated with Tfh cells, including the expression of IL-21. Because IL-21 is critical to limit T cell dysfunction during chronic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elsaesser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fröhlich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yi et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that compensatory mechanisms enforce its expression in non-Tfh subsets. Alternatively, the ‘boundaries’ between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells states may be less easily delineated during chronic infection. In line with this idea, our analyses reveal that during chronic infection, the accumulation of Eomes<sup>+</sup> virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is accompanied by the downregulation of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-defining factor Thpok. Similar to ‘redirected’ CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in both human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mucida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serroukh et al., 2018</xref>), this CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset is characterized by the upregulation of targets actively repressed by Thpok, including the transcription factor Eomes and genes associated with cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vacchio et al., 2019</xref>). While the downregulation of Thpok in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be influenced by the cytokine milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reis et al., 2014</xref>), it is important to note that the Eomes<sup>+</sup> Thpok<sup>low</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population appears to be limited to chronic settings, including in responses to the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mucida et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although we have focused on LCMV viral infection, this study represents the first step into building a more comprehensive reference map of the transcriptional landscape supporting the functional heterogeneity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells across tissues and beyond viral infections.

In order to filter out potential contaminants and experimental artifacts, we applied the UCell package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreatta and Carmona, 2021b</xref>) to evaluate a panel of signatures for several common immune and non-immune cell types. This resulted in high-quality transcriptomes for 35,488 single cells from 11 samples, covering acute and chronic infections at three different timepoints.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>scRNA-seq data integration</title><p>For the construction of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell reference map, datasets were downsampled to balance the contribution from different types of infection and timepoint. To this end, a maximum of 5000 cells were randomly selected for each of the 5 subsets: acute day 7, acute day 21, acute day 60, chronic day 7 and chronic day 21. To mitigate batch effects between samples, we integrated the 11 samples using STACAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreatta and Carmona, 2021a</xref>) with the following parameters: <italic>number of variable genes</italic> = 800, <italic>dist.thr</italic>=0.6, dims = 20. For the selection of variable genes for data integration, we did not consider mitochondrial genes, ribosomal genes, heatshock proteins, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), cell cycle genes or T cell receptor genes (gene sets available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). On the integrated data, unsupervised clusters were calculated using the <italic>FindNeighbors</italic> and <italic>FindClusters</italic> functions from Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hao et al., 2021</xref>) with parameters: <italic>k.parameter</italic>=10, resolution = 0.4. Finally, unsupervised clusters were manually annotated guided by differential expression analysis between clusters, merging clusters where appropriate, to obtain nine ‘functional clusters’ that summarize the diversity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in acute and chronic infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Dataset projection and reference-based analysis of scRNA-seq data</title><p>In order to avoid large imbalances between subtypes, and to limit its disk size, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reference map is a downsampled version of all available data. In order to obtain low-dimensional embeddings and subtype annotations for all cells generated in this study, we projected them onto the map using ProjecTILs with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreatta et al., 2021c</xref>). The same method was applied to project and interpret scRNA-seq data from several additional studies not included in the reference map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ciucci et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Künzli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swarnalekha et al., 2021</xref>). For all re-analyses of public data, we retrieved the gene expression matrices from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the following accession numbers: LCMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at 7 and 30 days p.i. (GSE121002); LCMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at day 10 p.i. (GSE158896); LCMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at day 35 p.i. (GSE139198); CD4 +T cells from lung and lymph nodes of influenza-infected mice (multiple timepoints), and liver cells at day 37 post-LCMV infection (GSE146626); <italic>Blc6</italic>-deficient, <italic>Blimp-1</italic> deficient and WT CD4 +T cells 7 days post-acute LCMV infection (GSE149912); Anti-PD-L1-treated and isotype-treated virus-specific CD4 +T cells at day 33 p.i. (GSE163345). Prior to reference projection, CD4 +T cells were purified from each dataset using scGate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreatta et al., 2022</xref>) and default T cell and CD4 +T cell gating models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Detection of novel/unrepresented states</title><p>Several utilities are available in the ProjecTILs package to evaluate query projection accuracy and to detect the presence of novel cell states. First, on a qualitative level, one can apply the <italic>plot.states.radar</italic>() function to compare the expression of panels of key genes between query and reference. Second, the user can recalculate the UMAP embeddings of the combined reference and query space (function <italic>recalculate.embeddings</italic>()) to assess whether part of the projected data form a novel, separate cluster (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Third, per-subtype differential expression analysis (function <italic>find.discriminant.genes</italic>()) can reveal which and how many genes are differentially expressed between reference and query in a given subtype (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Fourth, the <italic>compute_silhouette</italic>() function calculates an average silhouette coefficient per subtype, which aims at measuring the average distance of query cells from their own assigned cluster compared to all other clusters of the reference. A case study highlighting the application of these metrics can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/novelstate.html">https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/novelstate.html</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Gene signatures of adaptation to acute and chronic infections</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell state signatures were calculated by comparing each of the 3 main effector and 3 main memory clusters to the two other clusters in the same state (i.e. effector or memory) using the <italic>FindMarkers</italic> function implemented in Seurat. To summarize subtype-specific transcriptional changes at different stages of infection, we first identified differentially expressed genes between timepoints and subtypes. For this analysis, Th1 effector and Th1 memory cells were grouped together to identify Th1-type cells. Similarly, we combined the Tfh effector and Tfh memory clusters (Tfh type), as well as Tcmp and Tcm clusters (Tcm(p) type). For significantly differentially expressed genes, we calculated average expression profiles for the Th1, Tfh, and Tcm(p) types at individual timepoints using the <italic>find.discriminant.genes</italic> function of ProjecTILs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreatta et al., 2021c</xref>). The UCell algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreatta and Carmona, 2021b</xref>) was applied on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell map subtypes to evaluate gene signatures for subtypes identified in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>). To exclude potential confounding factors, ribosomal-associated, sex-specific and TCR transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magen et al., 2019</xref>) were removed from signatures related to acute and chronic adaptation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>T cell clonal analysis</title><p>The CDR3 amino acid sequence for productive alpha-beta VDJ rearrangements obtained by scTCR-seq were used as unique ‘barcodes’ to identify individual T cell clones. The expansion level of a clone was calculated as the absolute number of cells with identical TCR sequence in a given sample, either in terms of CDR3 sequence or full nucleotide sequence. Expanded clones that were unique to a sample were denoted as private clones, expanded clones found in at least three samples were denoted as public clones. Merging and visualization of scTCR-seq data were performed using the scRepertoire package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borcherding et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To measure gene expression- TCR relationship, we defined a ‘clonotype bias’ metric to quantify whether a given clonotype was preferentially composed of one of the T cell subtypes: c=max<sub>i</sub> [ (f<sub>i</sub> - q<sub>i</sub>) / (1-q<sub>i</sub>) ] where f<sub>i</sub> is the observed frequency for subtype i in the clonotype, and q<sub>i</sub> is the background frequency of subtype i in the whole sample. To assess statistical significance of measured clonotype bias scores, we generated N random permutations of the observed clonotype data, preserving clonal size and global subtype background frequencies. On the distribution of permuted clonotype bias scores, binned by clone size, we determined expected mean and standard deviation for each clone size bin. Z scores for observed clonotype bias scores were then calculated as the number of standard deviations from the background mean (Z score = 5 corresponds to a p-value ~6*10<sup>–7</sup>). PWMs for the fate-biased TCR alpha CDR3 motifs identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khatun et al., 2021</xref> were kindly provided by the authors. We applied <italic>glam2scan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frith et al., 2008</xref>) as in the original study to score these motifs on our data and rank clones based on individual motifs. We found that the motifs by Khatun et al. did not correlate with biased clones from our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Selecting clonotypes based on the 65% percentile of each of these motifs (as in the original study) did not enrich biased clones compared to their expected frequency. In particular, Tfh motifs were not predictive of Tfh bias and Th1 motifs were not predictive of Th1 bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Effect of cell cycling in defining reference spaces</title><p>To investigate the effect of cycling cells in the definition of low-dimensional embeddings, we re-analyzed the dataset by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khatun et al., 2021</xref> (LCMV acute day 10). Unsupervised analysis of two replicates from this study (replicates 1 and 2) showed that cycling cells clustered together and that cells in this cluster expressed a mixture of markers for Th1, Tfh, and Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). Next, we asked whether projecting these cycling cells into our reference map allowed discriminating the different subsets. Reference projection of cycling cells revealed that, while the majority of cells were assigned to Th1, more than 30% of cycling cells were predicted to be Tfh, Tcmp, and Treg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The expression profile of a panel of marker genes for these cell subtypes corresponded closely with the reference profiles (with additional high expression of cycling markers for example <italic>Mki67</italic>, as these are all cycling cells), confirming that the cycling cluster was composed of a mixture of different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These analyses showed that cell cycling can mask differences between cell subtypes, and that failing to account for cell cycling signals leads to mixing of multiple cell types in low dimensional spaces.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Effect of sequencing depth on reference-based annotation</title><p>Starting from the data generated in this study, as well as on an external dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>), we applied the ‘downsampleMatrix’ function from the <italic>scuttle</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>) to generate downsampled scRNA-seq count matrices with increasingly lower sequencing depth (99%–10% of measured depth) for each sample in the study. These reduced-depth datasets were then systematically projected into the reference map, and we evaluated the agreement of the cell subtype annotation with the annotation of the full-depth dataset. We measured the classification agreement as a function of the minimal (1% quantile) or median (50% quantile) number of genes, and of the minimal and median number of UMIs. We observed that subtype classification was robust to sequencing depths down to 30% of the original sequencing depth, corresponding roughly to a median of 500 detected genes and around 1000 median UMIs per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,E</xref>). Moreover, disagreement in classification between full depth and downsampled depth was mostly affecting related cell subtypes, such as the effector and memory states of Tfh or Th1 cells, or Tcm cells and other memory subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,F</xref>). On the whole, these experiments show that reference-based annotation is robust to sequencing depth for transcript counts and numbers of detected genes currently yielded by standard scRNA-seq technologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Statistical analyses for flow cytometry data</title><p>Statistical significance was calculated with Prism software.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Laura M Snell (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that additional details, clarity, validation, and broader integration of the proposed atlas would strengthen the conclusions and usefulness of the study. However, if these additional analyses lead to altered interpretation or utility of the atlas then the authors should revise the work accordingly.</p><p>2) Please pay close attention to the detailed recommendations provided by Rev #2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Viral titers should be paired to the different antiviral CD4 T cell transcriptional outcomes. Although LCMV Armstrong is quickly cleared, the clearance kinetics of LCMV Clone 13 can vary dramatically from laboratory to laboratory. The paper simply says that LCMV Clone 13 persists, but it is important to demonstrate how close the virus is to being cleared at the late chronic timepoint, as viral titer will impact transcriptional phenotypes. It will be relevant to have this information when using the reference atlas on other LCMV datasets which may clear with slightly altered kinetics.</p><p>2) Gene expression in Th1, Tfh and Tcm(p) is well characterized across time. Does gene expression in the Th1 memory, Tfh memory and Tcm change across early memory to late memory during acute infection? How does gene expression in the Tfh memory in late chronic infection compare to that of early memory (day 21 in both models)?</p><p>3) While the changes in proportions of the cell clusters across time and in acute versus chronic viral infection are demonstrated, a big contraction of virus-specific CD4 T cell numbers would be expected between Day 7 and Day 21 in both acute and chronic infection. As such, it would be relevant to also show the absolute number of cells in each cluster across the timepoints to get an accurate depiction of whether the enhancement in proportions of memory clusters also translated to an enhancement in absolute numbers of these clusters, or whether the numbers of memory cells in each cluster are simply maintained across the timepoints.</p><p>4) The text says that the atlas with the reference projection algorithm can enable interpretation of CD4 states across models, although all the examples given were based on LCMV datasets. Can the reference atlas accurately determine Th1/Tfh phenotypes from non-LCMV CD4 datasets? Many other models also drive Th1/Tfh differentiation. Single-cell analysis has been done on the discrimination of Th1/Tfh in malaria for instance: Lonnberg T et al. Sci Immunol. 2017 etc. and new data is emerging characterizing CD4s in various cancer models. Does the reference atlas hold up when determining CD4 subsets from data that is not LCMV-based?</p><p>5) The figure legends could benefit from more detail. In figure 1 for instance it is unclear if the UMAPs are based on a representative sample or the merged data of all samples. Also, the tissue of origin where the cells were sorted from should be mentioned for the reader's clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The sequencing batches used to construct the 'atlas' contain biologically distinct samples (Figure 1A-B). Therefore, prior to integration, both technical and biological differences will drive cell separation. In such instances it is useful to have at least one cell population present in all batches to verify integration performance – cells from equivalent populations should produce a joint overlapping cluster whereas biologically distinct populations such as central memory T cells and exhausted T cells should produce distinct clusters. By difficult to understand experimental design, this paper does not seem to have any such populations so the performance of the integration is difficult to assess. Even so, the authors could quantify the degree of alignment between clusters in the d21 Clone 13 samples present in batches 2 and 3, and the d7 Arm samples present in Batch 1 and 2. Based on Figure S2A which is the only data related to integration performance, there is significant heterogeneity between biological replicates. For example, Tregs are virtually absent from the second Late Chronic biological replicate whereas the 'Tfh memory' subset is highly abundant compared to the first replicate. Similarly, the cluster frequencies of the low-frequency clusters look very different between replicates in the Early Memory (d21 Arm) group. Given this uncertainty about integration performance, it is difficult to interpret the subsequent data as it could be partially explained by technical variation between batches.</p><p>2) The TCR analysis does not address prior work by Khatun et al. (JEM 2020) which showed that the Tfh bias of certain TCR sequences could be predicted in independent mice. The authors' analysis is limited to stating the degree of bias in each clonotype frequency group. Did the authors attempt to replicate the observation by Khatun et al.? What was the overlap between CDR3 motifs? What was the overlap in motifs between Khatun et al. and this study?</p><p>3) The 'atlas' functionality is limited to a superficial demonstration of projecting several LCMV CD4 T cell dataset onto the authors' dataset. There is no data quantifying the performance of this integration in absolute terms or relative to other methods. For example, given that the 9 clusters defined by the authors are previously known CD4 T cell subsets, what is the advantage of using this method compared to quantifying the expression of existing marker gene sets in the primary datasets? What is the performance of this method compared to manual integration of individual datasets?</p><p>4) What is the effect of sequencing depth on integration performance? Would low-depth datasets produce annotation results with the most central clusters dominant due to lack of specific, cluster-defining lowly expressed genes? What is the minimum depth at which technical effects would not drive integration? This type of information is essential if the 'atlas' is to be used as a tool, otherwise the resulting misannotations could do more harm than good to the users.</p><p>5) It is unclear how the removal of cell cycle genes from the initial dataset affects interpretation and integration. Given that cell cycle state and cell fate are causally linked in T cells, would the removal of cell cycle genes not obscure some meaningful transcriptomic differences between populations? Are the cell cycle genes in dividing effector cells the same as in dividing early memory cells?</p><p>6) The experimental validation of this dataset is limited to showing that CD4 T cells in persistent infection express more EOMES than T cells in acutely infected mice and that they express lower levels of THPOK. However, what is the global alignment between flow cytometry data presented in Figure 1 and the scRNAseq data? Were any of the cluster frequencies predicted by the scRNAseq data validated using a protein panel?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell reference map delineates subtype-specific adaptation during acute and chronic viral infections&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general this reviewer is satisfied with the revisions to the manuscript, however, one point needs to be better clarified. When the tumor-specific CD4 T cells from TILs were projected into the reference map 40-50% of them mapped into Th1 effectors. Yet upon further analysis and reclustering, these cells ended up being a completely distinct population of cells from the viral effector Th1. Thus, this reviewer is worried this could lead to misinterpretation and incorrect identification of subsets when using the reference map on other systems with unrepresented subsets not in the reference map. Could the authors comment on/clarify this point? It would be helpful to discuss the additional steps needed to verify that the corresponding states determined from projecting one's data into the reference map have similar gene profiles, and if they do not, how to address and identify these novel populations not represented in the map.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed my concerns. I can now recommend publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76339.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that additional details, clarity, validation, and broader integration of the proposed atlas would strengthen the conclusions and usefulness of the study.

We have addressed all the reviewers' comments, supported by new data and several new analyses.

In addition, we generated and analyzed a novel dataset derived from tumor-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, showing the utility of our framework to interpret cell diversity even beyond the cell states currently present in the reference map.</p><p>The new results are shown in Figure 5 (new panels D and E), in two new main Figures 6 and 7, in new panels in supplemental figures Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and new supplemental figures Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and Figure 5—figure supplement 3.

We agree with the reviewer that, ideally, viral titers could be determined before proceeding to the single-cell capture and RT-PCR. However, our experience with single-cell transcriptomic technology showed that optimal capture, <italic>i.e.</italic> cell number and gene coverage, sharply decreases ~4h after animals are sacrificed. Therefore, determining viral titers, even by qPCR, represents a logistical challenge that could have technically jeopardized the study or compromised data quality.</p><p>However, we performed a phenotypic characterization of T cell populations by flow cytometry for each capture, in particular focusing on the persistence of the “exhaustion” marker PD1 and the diminution of IL7R expression by the virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we confirmed that, for both “Late chronic” captures, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were PD1<sup>high</sup> IL7R<sup>intermadiate/low</sup> unlike their “Early Memory” counterparts which were PD1<sup>low</sup> IL7R<sup>high</sup>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Flow cytometry expression of PD1 and IL7R on naïve and GP66 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for each of the indicated sample processed for scRNAseq capture.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76339-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Moreover, to put our results in the context of known LCMV Cl13 viral titers, we compared our transcriptional profiles to those of a recent study of LCMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at day 33 of chronic infection, in which plasma viral titers have been determined (in the order of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU per ml of plasma) (Snell <italic>et al.</italic>, Nature Immunology 2021, PMID: 34795443). Although this study used (transgenic-TCR) SMARTA cells and our data consist of polyclonal GP66-specific tetramer sorted cells, projection of the data by Snell <italic>et al.</italic> into our reference map showed a remarkable similarity to our Late Chronic samples, both in terms of subtype composition and their transcriptional profiles.

To this end, we projected scRNA-seq data of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice with LMCV chronic infection, after treatment with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (Snell et al. 2021). While control samples showed a similar subtype distribution to our late chronic samples (Figure 3C, Figure 5E), anti-PD-L1 treatment increased the relative proportion of Th1 effectors (Figure 5E). Expression profiles for all major subtypes in this dataset largely matched those of our reference (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A), including the expression of exhaustion markers that was similar to that of the chronic infection samples of the reference map (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B). Notably, Th1 effector cells after anti-PD-L1 treatment, upregulated a Th1-associated gene module that includes <italic>Klrd1</italic>, <italic>Plac8</italic>, <italic>Ctla2a,</italic> and <italic>Ly6c2</italic> (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C), confirming the findings by Snell et al. 2021.”</p><p>These two independent validations demonstrate that our late chronic datasets were isolated at a timepoint when CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were actively responding to viral antigens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Gene expression in Th1, Tfh and Tcm(p) is well characterized across time. Does gene expression in the Th1 memory, Tfh memory and Tcm change across early memory to late memory during acute infection? How does gene expression in the Tfh memory in late chronic infection compare to that of early memory (day 21 in both models)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point that we briefly discussed for Tfh memory (lines 174 to 180), since we observed that this subtype undergoes substantial changes in late memory compared to the early memory phase. These changes include the downregulation of Tfh effector program (including <italic>Icos</italic> and <italic>Il21</italic>) and are accompanied by the upregulation of memory genes like <italic>Il7r</italic>. We did note a modest increase in “memory-associated” genes for Th1 and Tcm(p) subtypes from early to late memory, though not to the same extent as Tfh memory cells (Figure 3B). Additional comparisons during Acute timepoints and subsets are included in Supplementary File 2 – Acute Adaptation.</p><p>Concerning the differences between Acute day 21 (Early Memory) to Chronic day 21 (Late Chronic), we now included these comparisons in Supplementary File 2 – Chronic Adaptation. As expected, many of the genes upregulated in Late Chronic are associated with T cell activation and T cell dysfunction in response to persistent TCR signaling and response to viral antigens. In particular, Tfh cells in late chronic infection upregulated inhibitory receptors such as <italic>Lag3</italic>, <italic>Pdcd1</italic> and <italic>Ctla4</italic>, and transcription factors associated with exhaustion such as <italic>Tox</italic> and <italic>Bhlhe40</italic> (Supplementary File 2 – Chronic Adaptation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the changes in proportions of the cell clusters across time and in acute versus chronic viral infection are demonstrated, a big contraction of virus-specific CD4 T cell numbers would be expected between Day 7 and Day 21 in both acute and chronic infection. As such, it would be relevant to also show the absolute number of cells in each cluster across the timepoints to get an accurate depiction of whether the enhancement in proportions of memory clusters also translated to an enhancement in absolute numbers of these clusters, or whether the numbers of memory cells in each cluster are simply maintained across the timepoints.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including absolute T cell numbers will provide a clearer view of the immune response. To address this point, we estimated the absolute number of T cells for all subtypes at early and late timepoints by multiplying total cell numbers in spleen determined by flow-cytometry across multiple experiments (new panel Figure 2—figure supplement 1F) and cluster proportions (shown in Figure 3A,C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). We observed that for both types of infection the number of memory cells at later timepoints exceed the number of the same cells at day 7 (new panel Figure 2—figure supplement 1G). Since there is no evidence that these memory subsets are actively proliferating at early timepoints (see reply to Reviewer #2), one possibility is that at least part of the memory pool is derived from effector subsets generated at earlier timepoints. This is consistent with previous studies showing that effector subtypes can transition – although to a lower extent than “memory precursors” – to memory subtypes (Harrington <italic>et al.</italic>, Nature 2008, PMID: 18322463; Marshall <italic>et al.</italic>, Immunity 2011; PMID: 22018471). We integrated these results in the Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-G and lines 163-164.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The text says that the atlas with the reference projection algorithm can enable interpretation of CD4 states across models, although all the examples given were based on LCMV datasets. Can the reference atlas accurately determine Th1/Tfh phenotypes from non-LCMV CD4 datasets? Many other models also drive Th1/Tfh differentiation. Single-cell analysis has been done on the discrimination of Th1/Tfh in malaria for instance: Lonnberg T et al. Sci Immunol. 2017 etc. and new data is emerging characterizing CD4s in various cancer models. Does the reference atlas hold up when determining CD4 subsets from data that is not LCMV-based?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. Indeed, our method can be used to annotate and interpret datasets from other models and tissues. To illustrate this, we analyzed T cells isolated from different tissues and infection models. In particular, our method accurately interpreted data from LCMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the liver (Künzli et al., Science Immunology, PMID: 32144185) and from influenza infection in the lung and lymph nodes (Swarnalekha et al., Science Immunology 2021, PMID: 33419790). These results are presented in the new Figure 6 and discussed in a new section of the manuscript: “Diversity of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells across tissues”.</p><p>Briefly, we recapitulate the findings by Swarnalekha et al. that (<italic>a)</italic> Th1 subtypes dominate in lung populations at early time points, unlike their counterpart in the lymph nodes after influenza infection, (<italic>b)</italic> lung CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations become enriched in Tfh-like states over time, (<italic>c)</italic> cells in the lungs display a tissue-resident gene module expressed across Tfh memory, Tfh effector and Th1 effector subtypes (Figure 6A-D). Interestingly, this gene module was also found to be significantly higher in liver compared to spleen in the context of LCMV infection (Figure 6F), suggesting a tissue residency program that is partly conserved across infections and cell states, and highlighting the power of our framework for discovering such programs.</p><p>In addition, we included a new analysis showing that our tool is useful to interpret the heterogeneity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells beyond viral infections.

Projection of these data into our viral infection-derived reference map revealed that tumor-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in the tumor-draining lymph nodes were dominated by Tfh cells while tumors were enriched in Tregs, as well as by a distinct non-Treg, non-Tfh state (Figure 7A-B). Further investigation showed that, compared to Th1 effectors in response to viruses, these effector cells in the tumor differentially expressed Th2-associated genes (e.g. <italic>Ccr8</italic>, <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, <italic>Ccl1</italic>, <italic>Il5</italic>, <italic>Il13</italic>, <italic>Igfbp7)</italic> (Figure 7E-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The figure legends could benefit from more detail.

Therefore, prior to integration, both technical and biological differences will drive cell separation. In such instances it is useful to have at least one cell population present in all batches to verify integration performance – cells from equivalent populations should produce a joint overlapping cluster whereas biologically distinct populations such as central memory T cells and exhausted T cells should produce distinct clusters. By difficult to understand experimental design, this paper does not seem to have any such populations so the performance of the integration is difficult to assess. Even so, the authors could quantify the degree of alignment between clusters in the d21 Clone 13 samples present in batches 2 and 3, and the d7 Arm samples present in Batch 1 and 2. Based on Figure S2A which is the only data related to integration performance, there is significant heterogeneity between biological replicates. For example, Tregs are virtually absent from the second Late Chronic biological replicate whereas the 'Tfh memory' subset is highly abundant compared to the first replicate. Similarly, the cluster frequencies of the low-frequency clusters look very different between replicates in the Early Memory (d21 Arm) group. Given this uncertainty about integration performance, it is difficult to interpret the subsequent data as it could be partially explained by technical variation between batches.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments, which allow us to clarify a few points about batch effects, biological variability, and the power of our approach.</p><p>In their comment, we believe the reviewer refers to Figure 2A-B and not Figure 1, since Figure 1A-B are not for sequencing data but from spectral flow cytometry, for which the cells from all 4 conditions were analyzed at the same time. For additional clarification, the latter consisted in infecting animals at different timepoints so that the cell processing and analyses will be performed on the same day. This represents, for each experiment, 16-20 mice for which splenocytes were isolated, stained and acquired simultaneously to limit batch effect.</p><p>Regarding the integration of scRNA-seq data (Figure 2 A-B), we agree with the reviewer that data presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A were not sufficient to convincingly assess integration quality and reproducibly of the many replicates, which we have now addressed extensively (see below).</p><p>The reviewer commented that: “In such instances it is useful to have at least one cell population present in all batches to verify integration performance – cells from equivalent populations should produce a joint overlapping cluster whereas biologically distinct populations such as central memory T cells and exhausted T cells should produce distinct clusters.”. While we agree that it can be useful to have one cell population present in all batches, we have previously shown (Andreatta and Carmona (2021) PMID:32845323) that our integration method STACAS does not require that every batch shares a population with every other batch. Instead, it is sufficient that every batch shares one cell population with <italic>at least</italic> another batch to enable generating an integration guide tree. This is indeed the case, now highlighted in a new table (Supplementary File 1 B).</p><p>For instance, as the reviewer mentioned, cell populations present in d21 in Clone 13 and Arm samples (Early Memory and Late Chronic) are present in both batches 2 and 3, and cell populations of d7 Armstrong samples were present in both Batch 1 and 2; allowing for a pairwise batch integration strategy (e.g. B2-B3; (B2-B3)-B1). We acknowledge that this information was not clear in the first version, which was important to understand the experimental design.</p><p>Regarding heterogeneity between biological replicates (“Based on Figure S2A which is the only data related to integration performance, there is significant heterogeneity between biological replicates.”), we provide evidence that variability between biological replicates is within an expected range (by flow cytometry as well as by re-analysis of data by Snell et al. Nature Immunology 2021), and much lower than variability between conditions. Importantly, unlike the vast majority of scRNA-seq studies, we provide at least two biological replicates for every condition, allowing us to assess similarity between replicates (as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>To better illustrate the proportion of each cell population across biological replicates, we show in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E the strong similarities in the distribution of all cell states across samples. In particular, despite minimal variations in the percentages of each state, all replicates from each condition are composed of similar subtype composition. Critically, samples clustered by condition rather than by batch (i.e. biological replicates bear the largest similarity to each other, despite batch effects). Validating the proportions of these populations by spectral cytometry showed that they are comparable to the subtypes defined from scRNA-seq (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1 E). These results are presented as new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E and discussed lines 129-132:</p><p>“All subtypes were present in similar proportions across biological replicates, and samples clustered by condition rather than by batch, further confirming a successful data integration (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E). Similar subtype proportions were confirmed by spectral cytometry (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E)”</p><p>Regarding the 3 minor states, the IFNI-stimulated population was mostly found in chronic samples, where it consistently represented 6-10% of the cells, and the Eomes<sup>HI</sup> state was mostly seen in the two late chronic replicates, with a frequency of 3-4%. Finally, Tregs represented a very small fraction (consistently below 1% in all samples); preventing us to make any robust conclusion concerning their proportions variability.</p><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, we observed indeed that the Tfh_memory subtype was relatively more variable between Late Memory replicates (i.e. 24% vs 10%; ~17% on average). However, these proportions are (a) very similar to the Tfh_memory percentage confirmed by flow cytometry (~15%, Figure 1—figure supplement 1E), and (b) very similar to the Tfh_memory proportion determined in an independent scRNA-seq dataset of chronic infection (Figure 5E; ~15% Tfh memory in the untreated mice).</p><p>With all that said, precisely determining the degree of biological variability in the proportion of Tfh_memory is out of the scope of this manuscript, and these variabilities do not affect the conclusions of our study, given that gene expression profiles in each subtype were consistent across replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The TCR analysis does not address prior work by Khatun et al. (JEM 2020) which showed that the Tfh bias of certain TCR sequences could be predicted in independent mice. The authors' analysis is limited to stating the degree of bias in each clonotype frequency group. Did the authors attempt to replicate the observation by Khatun et al.? What was the overlap between CDR3 motifs? What was the overlap in motifs between Khatun et al. and this study?</p></disp-quote><p>In line with our results, the study by Khatun <italic>et al.</italic> found that while the majority of clonotypes were not biased towards a specific fate, a subset of clonotypes were seen to preferentially develop into one particular lineage. In addition, they found that certain TCR α chains, but not β chains, were enriched in Tfh cells compared to other fates. Based on this observation, they derived CDR3 motifs of the TCR α chains that distinguished biased clones in their dataset, obtaining 27 (11 Th1-specific and 16 Tfh-specific) motifs. When tested on left-out mice not used to compute the motifs, they found that no Th1 motifs were predictive of Th1 bias, 2 Tfh motifs were predictive of Tfh bias, and one Tfh motif showed in fact significant preference towards the opposite lineage. The remaining 24 “fate-biased” motifs were not reproduced in the independent mice. We believe this is very weak evidence for the predictability of fate based on TCR sequence.</p><p>Nevertheless, we evaluated the PWMs for the motifs described by Khatun et al. (kindly provided by the authors) on our data to determine whether they were predictive of clonotype fate. As shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, motif scores for the 7 motifs from Figure 4 of Khatun et al. (calculated using <italic>glam2scan</italic> [Frith et al. (2008)] as in the original paper) do not correlate with biased clones from our datasets. Selecting clonotypes based on the 65% percentile of each of these motifs (threshold used by Khatun et al) does not enrich biased clones compared to their expected frequency (column “All”). In particular, Tfh motifs are not predictive of Tfh bias and Th1 motifs are not predictive of Th1 bias (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). These analyses were included as part of Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (panels C and D), and discussed on lines 281-283 and 710-717.</p><p>“We did not observe any robust CDR3 motif associated with biased clonotypes, and previously reported fate-biased CDR3 motifs (Khatun et al., 2021) were not predictive of clonotype lineage on our data (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D).”</p><p>“PWMs for the fate-biased TCR α CDR3 motifs identified by Khatun et al. (2021) were kindly provided by the authors. We applied glam2scan [PMID:18437229] as in the original study to score these motifs on our data and rank clones based on individual motifs. We found that the motifs by Khatun et al. did not correlate with biased clones from our datasets (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Selecting clonotypes based on the 65% percentile of each of these motifs (as in the original study) did not enrich biased clones compared to their expected frequency. In particular, Tfh motifs were not predictive of Tfh bias and Th1 motifs were not predictive of Th1 bias (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The 'atlas' functionality is limited to a superficial demonstration of projecting several LCMV CD4 T cell dataset onto the authors' dataset. There is no data quantifying the performance of this integration in absolute terms or relative to other methods. For example, given that the 9 clusters defined by the authors are previously known CD4 T cell subsets, what is the advantage of using this method compared to quantifying the expression of existing marker gene sets in the primary datasets? What is the performance of this method compared to manual integration of individual datasets?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the lack of robust methods or validated gene signatures for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtype classification, the only alternative is, as the reviewer suggests, manual annotation. Since there is no standardized way of performing a manual annotation, this process is usually both highly time-demanding and subjective. As an increasingly large body of scRNA-seq data becomes available, unsupervised analysis of individual datasets will become untenable. An automated and scalable system provides a unified framework to bring multiple datasets into the same space, to assign consistent labels, and to perform meta-analyses with robust criteria. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness and accuracy of such an approach in other contexts, and compared its performance with alternative methods (Andreatta <italic>et al.</italic> Nature Communications 2021).</p><p>In this revised version, we perform several additional analyses showing that our tool accurately predicts CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtype composition changes across tissues in two different viral infections (LCMV infection spleen vs. liver; and flu in lymph node vs. lung; new Figure 6), upon anti-PD-L1 therapy (new Figure 5E, new Figure 5—figure supplement 3), and in the context of cancer (new Figure 7). Please see the detailed answer to reviewer #1 for these analyses. Using a fully automated method, we were able to recapitulate non trivial conclusions from previous studies, including (a) a large proportion of Tfh-like cells in lungs at late timepoints after influenza infection, (b) expression of a conserved non-lymphoid tissue residency gene module that was predictive across infection types, (c) amplification of Th1 cells following anti-PD-L1 therapy; showing that this reference-based analysis framework can save huge efforts in data analysis and subjectivity of manual annotations. Finally, we showed that even such an ‘incomplete’ CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell map (built from viral infection data) provides a scaffold to identify novel states, such as that of tumor-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (new Figure 7).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern about a potential misunderstanding of the word ‘atlas’ (i.e. collection of maps) in this context, we have replaced it with ‘map’ throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is the effect of sequencing depth on integration performance? Would low-depth datasets produce annotation results with the most central clusters dominant due to lack of specific, cluster-defining lowly expressed genes? What is the minimum depth at which technical effects would not drive integration? This type of information is essential if the 'atlas' is to be used as a tool, otherwise the resulting misannotations could do more harm than good to the users.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important technical point that was not sufficiently addressed. We performed new analyses to assess the effect of sequencing depth on reference projection accuracy. Starting from the data generated in this study, as well as on an external dataset (Khatun et al. 2021), we applied the ‘downsampleMatrix’ function from the <italic>scuttle</italic> package (McCarthy et al. 2017) to generate downsampled scRNA-seq count matrices with increasingly lower sequencing depth (99% to 10% of measured depth) for each sample in the study. These reduced-depth datasets were then systematically projected into the reference map, and we evaluated the agreement of the cell subtype annotation with the annotation of the full-depth dataset (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,D). We were also able to evaluate how the classification agreement was maintained as a function of the minimal (1% quantile) or median (50% quantile) number of genes, and of the minimal and median number of UMIs (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,E). We observed that subtype classification was robust to sequencing depths down to 30% of the original sequencing depth, corresponding roughly to a median of 500 detected genes and around 1000 median UMIs per cell. Moreover, disagreement in classification between full depth and downsampled depth was mostly affecting related cell subtypes, such as the effector and memory states of Tfh or Th1 cells, or Tcm(p) cells and other memory subtypes (results for downsampling to 30% of select samples Figure 5—figure supplement 2 C,F). On the whole, these experiments show that reference-based annotation is robust to sequencing depth for transcript counts and numbers of detected genes currently yielded by standard scRNA-seq technologies. Thus, users can confidently use our tool without significant risks of misannotation. These results are presented in new Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and discussed in the new section: “Effect of sequencing depth on reference-based annotation” (lines 734-749).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is unclear how the removal of cell cycle genes from the initial dataset affects interpretation and integration. Given that cell cycle state and cell fate are causally linked in T cells, would the removal of cell cycle genes not obscure some meaningful transcriptomic differences between populations? Are the cell cycle genes in dividing effector cells the same as in dividing early memory cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for allowing us to clarify this point. First, we would like to point out that cell cycle genes are not removed from the datasets. The misunderstanding might stem from the fact that, as part of our data integration procedure, cell cycle genes (as well as TCR genes and others) are excluded from variable gene selection (this has been clarified in line 651-653). This procedure is done to mitigate the effect of cell cycling, which causes dramatic transcriptional changes irrespective of cell subtype or basal transcriptional programs. Instead, we aim at clustering cells based on functionally distinct subtypes (i.e. the subtype-defining core transcriptional programs) rather than based on proliferation status, or other more transient signals. In practice, this only leads to excluding a limited number of genes that fell within the set of most highly variable genes (800 for this map). Of note, the exclusion of cell cycle genes from the variable features has much less impact than the typical ‘cell cycle regression’ procedure used to mitigate cell cycle, which affects all genes measurements (reviewed in Lueken et al. (2019) Mol Syst Biol).</p><p>To address more directly the reviewer’s concern about the possibility that we might be missing important biological information encoded in cell cycle genes with our procedure, we re-analyzed the dataset by Khatun et al. (LCMV acute day 10) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-G). Unsupervised analysis shows that cycling cells cluster together (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D), and that cells in this cluster express a mixture of markers for Th1 and Tfh (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D-E). A fraction of cells in the cycling cluster also express high levels of <italic>Foxp3</italic>, a marker of Tregs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). Thus, unsupervised clustering practically groups cells solely based on their proliferation status, regardless of their functional phenotype.</p><p>Next, we asked whether projecting these cycling cells into our reference map allows discriminating the different subsets. Projection of all cells from the cycling cluster reveals that, while the majority of cells were assigned to Th1, more than 30% of cycling cells were predicted to be Tfh, Tcmp and Treg (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). The expression profile of a panel of marker genes for these cell subtypes corresponded closely with the reference profiles (with additional high expression of cycling markers e.g. <italic>Mki67</italic>, as these are all cycling cells), confirming that the cycling cluster was composed of a mixture of different cell types (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G).</p><p>These results show that cell cycling can indeed mask differences between cell subtypes, and that failing to account for cell cycling signals leads to mixing of multiple cell types in low dimensional spaces; thus validating our choices. Cell cycling, which is an essential characteristic to consider in a biological system, can then be evaluated as a separate quantity that is orthogonal to cell subtypes, and cycling cells can be annotated by projection into the reference space.</p><p>These results are presented in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and described in section: “Effect of cell cycling in defining reference spaces” (lines 719-732)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The experimental validation of this dataset is limited to showing that CD4 T cells in persistent infection express more EOMES than T cells in acutely infected mice and that they express lower levels of THPOK. However, what is the global alignment between flow cytometry data presented in Figure 1 and the scRNAseq data? Were any of the cluster frequencies predicted by the scRNAseq data validated using a protein panel?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to explain in more details the steps we take to validate the robustness of our results. The manuscript described the validation of both the presence of the Thpok<sup>low</sup> Eomes<sup>high</sup> population (Figure 2E-F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D) and the decrease of CCR7-expressing cells in chronic settings (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). In addition, we confirmed by flow cytometry the presence and proportions of major cell populations described in our study (see validation below). It is however important to note that identifying robust T cell states by flow cytometry is difficult and often fails to discriminate T cell subsets from plastic T cell populations. For example, defining Tcm populations by flow cytometry remains challenging as this cell population can only be distinguished from Tfh based on CCR7 expression. With these limitations in mind, our study was precisely designed to overcome these difficulties and define more robustly T cell states by relying on global transcriptional features instead of expression of a few proteins by flow cytometry, which is often highly variable across laboratories, models and tissues.</p><p>To directly address the reviewer’s comment, we included our flow cytometry validation using our flow cytometry datasets based on the expression of known markers on virus-specific T cells (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Overall, this analysis shows a very good correspondence between scRNA-seq and flow cytometry in the presence and distribution of the major clusters across conditions. These results are also consistent with previous studies during acute (Ciucci et al., Immunity 2019, PMID: 30638736, Künzli et al., Science Immunology 2020, PMID: 32144185, Marshall et al., Immunity 2011; PMID: 22018471) and chronic (Snell et al., Nature Immunology 2022, PMID: 34795443, Zander et al., Immunity 2022, PMID: 35216666) LCMV infections.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general this reviewer is satisfied with the revisions to the manuscript, however, one point needs to be better clarified. When the tumor-specific CD4 T cells from TILs were projected into the reference map 40-50% of them mapped into Th1 effectors. Yet upon further analysis and reclustering, these cells ended up being a completely distinct population of cells from the viral effector Th1. Thus, this reviewer is worried this could lead to misinterpretation and incorrect identification of subsets when using the reference map on other systems with unrepresented subsets not in the reference map. Could the authors comment on/clarify this point? It would be helpful to discuss the additional steps needed to verify that the corresponding states determined from projecting one's data into the reference map have similar gene profiles, and if they do not, how to address and identify these novel populations not represented in the map.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. In fact, the analysis of T cells from tumor was included in the revised manuscript to illustrate how to detect novel populations in a query dataset compared to the reference. We have at least four possible strategies, all implemented as functions in the ProjecTILs analysis package, to aid the user in detecting new/unrepresented states. First, on a qualitative level, one can inspect the radar plots (function <italic>plot.states.radar()</italic>) to compare the expression of panels of key genes between query and reference. While for all other well-represented cell types the profiles displayed a good correspondence, Th1_Effector cells in the tumor lacked the expression of key Th1 markers (Ccl5, Ly6c2) (Figure 7C). Second, the user can recalculate the UMAP embeddings of the combined reference and query space (function <italic>recalculate.embeddings()</italic>) to assess whether part of the projected data form a novel, separate cluster (e.g. Figure 7D). Third, per-subtype differential gene expression analysis (function <italic>find.discriminant.genes()</italic>) can reveal which and how many genes are differentially expressed between reference and query in a given subtype. In the case of the TIL data, tumoral T helpers showed increased expression of Th2 markers, guiding the users towards interpreting the nature of the novel cluster (Figure 7E). Finally, to provide a more quantitative measure of deviation from the reference, we implemented an average silhouette coefficient per subtype (function <italic>compute_silhouette()</italic>), which aims at measuring the average distance of query cells from their own assigned cluster/state compared to all other clusters/states of the reference. We report below the silhouette scores, normalized by the silhouettes of the reference, for the T cells from tumor and lymphnode from Figure 7, as well as from the dataset from Khatun et al. <italic>JEM</italic> (2020), which come from the same viral model and should act as a control.</p><p>The outlier value in this analysis is the normalized silhouette score of tumor-specific cells classified as Th1 effector, indicating that they do match poorly with the Th1 effectors of the reference. Taken together with the other three diagnostic analyses outlined above and described in the manuscript, these results should warn the user of the presence of a novel state in the query dataset.</p><p>To better convey this message in the manuscript, we added the following text to the section “Reference map projection to explore CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell diversity beyond viral infections”:</p><p>“While reference maps aim at being as comprehensive as possible, it is possible that new datasets contain novel states that are not represented in the reference, especially when used in different diseases models. In these cases, the user is encouraged to make use of all the analytic tools we provide with the ProjecTILs package (see Methods) to evaluate the degree of correspondence between reference and query, as we illustrated in the case of tumor-specific T cells (Figure 7C-E). These analyses demonstrate the feasibility of using a reference map to describe cell diversity beyond the states already present in the map, and as a strategy to expand references to incorporate novel, unrepresented cell states.”</p><p>And a more detailed description of the available analytical functions in a new section in the Methods:</p><p>“Detection of novel/unrepresented states</p><p>Several utilities are available in the ProjecTILs package to evaluate query projection accuracy and to detect the presence of novel cell states. First, on a qualitative level, one can apply the <italic>plot.states.radar()</italic> function to compare the expression of panels of key genes between query and reference. Second, the user can recalculate the UMAP embeddings of the combined reference and query space (function <italic>recalculate.embeddings()</italic>) to assess whether part of the projected data form a new, separate cluster (e.g. Figure 7D). Third, per-subtype differential expression analysis (function <italic>find.discriminant.genes()</italic>) can reveal which and how many genes are differentially expressed between reference and query in a given subtype (e.g. Figure 7E). Fourth, the <italic>compute_silhouette()</italic> function calculates an average silhouette coefficient per subtype, which aims at measuring the average distance of query cells from their own assigned cluster compared to all other clusters of the reference. A case study highlighting the application of these metrics can be found at: https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/novelstate.html”</p></body></sub-article></article>
