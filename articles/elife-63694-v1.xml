mitochondrial homeostasis. In yeast, the phosphorylation of the mitophagy receptor Atg32 by casein kinase 2 is essential for mitophagy. This phosphorylation is counteracted by the yeast equivalent of the STRIPAK complex consisting of the PP2A-like protein phosphatase Ppg1 and Far3-7-8-9-10-11 (Far complex), but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that two subpopulations of the Far complex reside in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, and play distinct roles; the former inhibits mitophagy via Atg32 dephosphorylation, and the latter regulates TORC2 signaling. Ppg1 and Far11 form a subcomplex, and Ppg1 activity is required for the assembling integrity of Ppg1-Far11-Far8. The Far complex preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Atg32, and this interaction is weakened by mitophagy induction. Furthermore, the artificial tethering of Far8 to Atg32 prevents mitophagy. Taken together, the Ppg1-mediated Far complex formation and its dissociation from Atg32 are crucial for mitophagy regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic process that non-selectively degrades cytoplasmic components in response to a wide range of cellular stresses, such as nutrient starvation, oxidative stress, infection, and inflammatory stimuli. Upon autophagy induction, a cup-shaped membrane vesicle called an isolation membrane or a phagophore emerges in the cytosol. The isolation membrane extends and sequesters cytoplasmic components, forming an autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with vacuoles in yeast or lysosomes in mammalian cells, and vacuolar/lysosomal hydrolases degrade the sequestered material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to bulk autophagy, selective autophagy targets specific cellular components, such as particular proteins, mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nuclei, and intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Farré and Subramani, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gatica et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin and Rogov, 2019</xref>). Among the multiple types of selective autophagy, mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) has gained prominence over the last decade because quality and quantity control of mitochondria are crucial for preventing various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms of mitophagy in yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda and Kanki, 2018</xref>). In mammals, mitophagy mediated by the mitochondrial serine/threonine protein kinase PINK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and mitophagy induced by mitophagy receptors (Nix, BNIP3, FKBP8, FUNDC1, and Bcl2-L-13) have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pickles et al., 2018</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Atg32 serves as a receptor essential for mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kanki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okamoto et al., 2009</xref>). When mitophagy is induced by either nitrogen starvation or cell culture in a nonfermentable medium until the stationary phase, Ser114 and Ser119 on Atg32 are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanki et al., 2013</xref>). This phosphorylation event facilitates the interaction between Atg32 and the adaptor protein Atg11, leading to the recruitment of the core autophagy machinery, which initiates autophagosome formation around the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, we reported that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-like protein phosphatase Ppg1 and the Far complex (consisting of Far3, Far7, Far8, Far9, Far10, and Far11) cooperatively dephosphorylate Atg32 to inhibit mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The Far complex components were originally identified as factors necessary for pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horecka and Sprague, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kemp and Sprague, 2003</xref>). The Far complex has also been shown to be involved in the target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baryshnikova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pracheil et al., 2012</xref>) and human caspase-10-induced toxicity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lisa-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive these processes remain elusive. Also, the Far complex is known to require tiered assembly and localize at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pracheil and Liu, 2013</xref>). Still, how the ER-localized Far complex acts cooperatively with Ppg1 to affect the mitochondrial protein Atg32 remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Furukawa and Kanki, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Ppg1 and the Far complex form the yeast counterpart of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which is widely conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hwang and Pallas, 2014</xref>). Most STRIPAK components, such as Striatin/Far8 (PP2A regulatory subunit), PP2AA/Tpd3 (PP2A scaffolding subunit), PP2Ac/Ppg1 (PP2A or PP2A-like catalytic subunit), striatin-interacting protein (STRIP)/Far11, sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein (SLMAP)/Far9-10, and suppressor of IKKε (SIKE)/Far3-7, are highly conserved in eukaryotes, whereas the other components, such as monopolar spindle one-binder protein (Mob), germinal center kinase (GCKIII), and cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (CCM3), are not fully conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kück et al., 2016</xref>). The STRIPAK complex has been shown to be involved in diverse cellular processes, including development, cellular transport, signal transduction, stem cell differentiation, and cardiac functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kück et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the biochemical, structural, and physiological characterizations that have been performed on the STRIPAK complex using diverse eukaryotic model organisms, the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of the STRIPAK complex are not yet fully understood. In particular, the mechanism that regulates the enzymatic activities and cellular localization of the STRIPAK complex remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we found that the Far complex is localized at both the mitochondria and ER and the mitochondria-localized Far complex mediates the Ppg1-dependent inhibition of mitophagy via Atg32 dephosphorylation, whereas the ER-localized Far complex plays a role in the regulation of the TORC2 signaling pathway. Remarkably, Ppg1 phosphatase activity is essential for the recruitment of the Ppg1-Far11 subcomplex to the core of the Far complex. The Far complex preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Atg32 via the 151–200 amino acid region of Atg32, and this interaction becomes weakened under mitophagy-inducing conditions. Far8 directly interacts with Atg32, and their artificial tethering prevents mitophagy. Taken together, we propose that the association and dissociation of the mitochondria-localized Far complex and Atg32 represent crucial processes that regulate mitophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondria-localized, but not ER-localized, Far complex is required for Atg32 dephosphorylation</title><p>Although Far9 and Far10 both contain tail-anchor (TA) domains required for the localization of the entire Far complex to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pracheil and Liu, 2013</xref>), the reason why ER-localized Far complex is essential for the dephosphorylation of the mitochondrial protein Atg32 remains unclear. Thus, we reinvestigated the cellular localization of Far proteins using yeast strains expressing Far proteins fused to either an N-terminal or a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag (Far3-GFP, Far7-GFP, Far8-GFP, GFP-Far9, GFP-Far10, and Far11-GFP). All GFP-fused Far proteins were confirmed to be functional as assessed by Atg32 dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we realized that a substantial portion of GFP-fused Far proteins was localized in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Far8-GFP, 93%; GFP-Far9, 96%; and Far11-GFP, 94% of cells showed mitochondrial GFP signal).

As reported previously, GFP-Far9 lacking its TA domain (GFP-Far9ΔTA) was localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, and the same was true for Far10 lacking its TA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; GFP-Far9ΔTA, 99%; GFP-Far10ΔTA, 100% of cells showed cytoplasmic GFP signal). To examine whether the presence of the Far9 and Far10 TA domains is necessary for Atg32 dephosphorylation, we constructed single and double Far9 (Far9ΔTA) and Far10 (Far10ΔTA) mutants, whose TA domains were replaced by 3HA tags. Under growing conditions, Atg32 is dephosphorylated in wild-type cells, whereas it displays a phosphorylated form, detected as slowly migrating bands in immunoblotting experiments, in <italic>FAR</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the Far9ΔTA and Far10ΔTA single mutant cells did not display significant alterations in the phosphorylation status of Atg32, whereas the double mutant cells showed highly phosphorylated Atg32 at the same levels as observed in cells lacking both Far9 and Far10 (<italic>far9Δ far10Δ</italic>). These results suggest that the membrane anchoring of at least one of Far9 or Far10 is important for the Far complex-mediated dephosphorylation of Atg32.</p><p>Next, to examine the possibility that mitochondria- and ER-localized Far complexes have different functions, we constructed two GFP-Far9 mutants, in which the TA domains were replaced by the TA domain of Tom5 and Cyb5, which localize specifically to the mitochondria and ER, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilharz et al., 2003</xref>). As expected, GFP-Far9-Tom5<sup>TA</sup> and GFP-Far9-Cyb5<sup>TA</sup> showed distinct mitochondrial and ER localization, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; GFP-Far9-Tom5<sup>TA</sup>, 100% mitochondria; GFP-Far9-Cyb5<sup>TA</sup>, 99% ER). Remarkably, Atg32 in GFP-Far9-Tom5<sup>TA</sup> cells appeared in the dephosphorylated form similar to Atg32 in cells expressing GFP-Far9 under growing conditions, whereas Atg32 was highly phosphorylated in GFP-Far9-Cyb5<sup>TA</sup> cells regardless of the presence or absence of Far10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To this end, we expressed a chimeric protein consisting of Far8 and Atg32 (Far8-Atg32) in <italic>PPG1<sup>+</sup> FAR8<sup>+</sup></italic>, their single or double deletion mutant. The Atg32-Far8 chimeric protein was detected as an unphosphorylated form irrespective of endogenous Far8 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The dephosphorylation of Atg32-Far8 requires Ppg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) as well as other Far complex components, except for Far10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Moreover, Far11-GFP was diffused throughout the entire cytoplasm in <italic>far8Δ</italic> cells, while it was localized to mitochondria in the <italic>far8Δ</italic> cells expressing Far8-Atg32, but not wild-type Atg32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; Far11-GFP localization in <italic>FAR8<sup>+</sup></italic>, 99% mitochondria/ER; <italic>far8Δ</italic>, 93% cytoplasm; <italic>far8Δ/ATG32</italic>, 95% cytoplasm; <italic>far8Δ/FAR8-ATG32</italic>, 84% mitochondria). Thus, these results indicate that the Atg32-Far8 chimeric protein normally serves as a Far complex component and counteracts with the phosphorylation of the Atg32 part. We then addressed the impact of the artificial tethering of Atg32-Far8 on mitophagy. During the stationary phase, in wild-type cells, Atg32 was phosphorylated and mitophagy was induced, whereas in cells expressing Far8-Atg32, Far8-Atg32 remained unphosphorylated and mitophagy induction was severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The elimination of Ppg1 restored the phosphorylation of Far8-Atg32 and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), confirming that Far8-Atg32 is functional as a mitophagy receptor unless dephosphorylated by Ppg1. Taken together, these results indicate that association between the Far complex and Atg32 strictly inhibits Atg32 phosphorylation and mitophagy and that the dissociation of the Far complex from Atg32 is a crucial step for Atg32 phosphorylation and mitophagy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although our previous study showed that Ppg1 and the Far complex played essential roles in the prevention of CK2-mediated Atg32 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa et al., 2018</xref>), the underlying mechanism and regulation of this process remained largely unclear. In the present study, we first demonstrated that the Far complex is localized at both the mitochondria and ER and that these complexes play distinct roles; the mitochondria-localized Far complex inhibits mitophagy through the Ppg1-dependent dephosphorylation of Atg32, whereas the ER-localized Far complex negatively regulates the TORC2 signaling pathway. Second, we demonstrated that Ppg1 phosphatase activity is required for the assembly of the entire Far complex. Finally, we found that the association and dissociation between the Far complex and Atg32 are crucial determinants for mitophagy regulation. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the Ppg1-Far complex-mediated phosphoregulatory mechanism of Atg32, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Our findings regarding the localization, assembly, and substrate interactions of the Far complex will serve as a model system of the study of STRIPAK complexes in the other organisms.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the phosphoregulatory mechanism of Atg32.</title><p>Far9 is localized to both the ER and mitochondria, where the other Far complex components are assembled dependently on Far9. According to this localization pattern, the Far complex plays distinct roles in the regulation of TORC2 signaling at the ER and the regulation of mitophagy at the mitochondria. Without stimuli, the mitochondria-localized Far complex mediates the Ppg1-dependent Atg32 dephosphorylation via interaction with Atg32. Upon mitophagy stimuli, the interaction between Atg32 and the Far complex is impaired, allowing Atg32 to be phosphorylated by CK2. The general names for the common STRIPAK complex components are shown in the box.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63694-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to the ER localization of the Far complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pracheil and Liu, 2013</xref>), we detected its mitochondria localization and further demonstrated that the mitochondria- and ER-localized Far complexes play different roles in Atg32 dephosphorylation and TORC2 signaling, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report to distinguish localization-dependent roles of the Far/STRIPAK complex. Moreover, we succeeded in altering the cellular localization of the Far complex by replacing the TA domain of Far9. Although Far10 is a paralogue of Far9 and contains a TA domain, the mitochondria-localized Far9 recruited the other Far proteins to the mitochondria, except for Far10, indicating that Far9 is dominant to Far10 for the assembly of the other Far proteins. This hierarchy between Far9 and Far10 is consistent with their degrees of contribution to Atg32 dephosphorylation and TORC2 signaling, where Far9 plays a crucial role, but Far10 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pracheil et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We found that artificially fixing the mitochondria localization of Far9 causes the strong inhibition of mitophagy in a Ppg1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This result raises the question of what regulates the balance between mitochondria- and ER-localized Far complexes in wild-type cells. Evaluation of the percentages of each localization pattern under different conditions and detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms associated with each localization are necessary to better understand this process.</p><p>PP2AA (PP2A scaffolding subunit) is generally included as a component of the STRIPAK complex. However, our results indicate that only a small portion of Tpd3, a PP2AA protein, is included in the Ppg1-Far complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) and that Tpd3 is dispensable for Atg32 dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, Tpd3 and the Far complex components are involved in the regulation of TORC2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pracheil et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, Tpd3 is likely to be an essential component of the subpopulation of the ER-localized Ppg1-Far complex, whereas it may act as an accessory component in the mitochondria-localized population. Although Pph21 and Pph22 (PP2A catalytic subunits) have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of TORC2 signaling as components of a protein complex that includes Far proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pracheil et al., 2012</xref>), their mutants do not disrupt the Far8-Far11 interaction as observed for the <italic>ppg1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Also, Pph21 and Pph22 are dispensable for Atg32 dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa et al., 2018</xref>). A minor fraction of the protein complex that includes the Far proteins, Tpd3, and Pph21/Pph22 may contribute to TORC2 signaling. Alternatively, Pph21/Pph22 may regulate TORC2 signaling independently of the Far complex. Further analysis is necessary to clarify the differential actions of different subpopulations of the Far complex.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pracheil and Liu, 2013</xref> proposed a tiered assembly model for the Far complex, in which a subcomplex containing Far3, Far7, and Far8 is recruited to Far9-Far10 followed by the loading of Far11 to the core (Far3-Far7-Far8-Far9-Far10). Our results indicate that Ppg1 is required for the final step of this assembly model. Moreover, the necessity of Ppg1 phosphatase activity for complex assembly implies that Far11 and/or the other Far proteins are regulated by (de)phosphorylation. In the case of Sit4, another PP2A-like protein phosphatase, its binding proteins (Sap155, Sap185, and Sap190) were previously shown to be phosphorylated in the absence of Sit4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luke et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, further studies are necessary to investigate whether Far proteins are phosphorylated in <italic>ppg1Δ</italic> cells or under mitophagy-inducing conditions and whether and how such modification(s) affect the function, assembly, and localization of the Far complex.</p><p>This study identified the following five points regarding the interaction between the Far complex and Atg32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). (1) The Far complex preferentially binds to phosphorylated Atg32 rather than non-phosphorylated Atg32. (2) The 151–250 amino acid region of Atg32 acts as a scaffold for the interaction. (3) The interaction is weakened under mitophagy-inducing conditions. (4) Far8 directly interacts with Atg32 in vitro, but the core proteins of the Far complex (Far3-Far7-Far9) are also required for the interaction in yeast. (5) The forced interaction between Atg32 and the Far complex by their artificial tethering causes the inhibition of Atg32 phosphorylation and mitophagy. The first and fourth points may explain the reason for the weak in vitro interaction between Atg32 and Far8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which was examined using non-phosphorylated Atg32 (produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>) and Far8 only among six Far proteins. In addition, mitochondrial localization of Atg32 might be important for the stable interaction with Far8. Also, our results indicate that the interactions between Ppg1 and Far8/Far11 and between Far8 and Far11 are not affected by mitophagy induction. The modification(s) of any of the core proteins (Far3-Far7-Far8-Far9) may serve as a key determinant for the association/dissociation between the Far complex and Atg32. Additional experiments that examine modifications of Far proteins are necessary to solve these issues.</p><p>Recent studies of the STRIPAK complexes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tang et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elramli et al., 2019</xref>) proposed a common model, in which two subcomplex arms converge on Striatin (Far8 orthologue). In both cases, one arm contains STRIP1/SipC (Far11 orthologue) and the other contains SIKE1-SLMAP/SipB-SipD (Far3/Far7 and Far9/Far10 orthologues, respectively). Moreover, protein kinases and Mob proteins generally included in the STRIPAK complex have not been identified yet in some organisms, including yeast. These differences in constitution among species may reflect divergent functions and regulations for the STRIPAK complexes found in each organism. STRIPAK complexes have been shown to play distinct roles in different organisms, likely due to functional repurposing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frost et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>This study revealed several previously unsolved mechanistic issues regarding the Ppg1-Far complex and provided significant insights into the research field concerned with the STRIPAK complex. However, the following issues remained unclear. First, how does Ppg1 phosphatase activity facilitate the Far complex formation? Second, what signals disrupt the interaction between the Far complex and Atg32 upon mitophagy induction? Third, are the regulations that govern the Far complex assembly and the interaction between Atg32 and the Ppg1-Far complex mediated by phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications? Future studies examining the regulatory mechanisms associated with the Ppg1-Far complex in yeast will elucidate these issues and provide detailed insights into not only how mitophagy-inducing signal is sensed and transmitted to Atg32 but also the evolutionally conserved mechanism associated with the assembly, localization, and activation of the STRIPAK complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Association and dissociation between the mitochondrial Far complex and Atg32 regulates mitophagy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers, and summarized by the Reviewing Editor as you can see below. All the reviewers recognize the significance of this study that addresses an important mechanistic issue in mitophagy regulation. At the same time, the consensus amongst us is that two key conclusions are not convincingly supported by experiments in the present manuscript. Based on these discussions, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, in the future we will be happy to re-consider a new manuscript that addresses the issues outlined here.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In earlier work, this group showed that the phosphatase Ppg1 and the Far complex cooperate to dephosphorylate the mitophagy receptor Atg32, resulting in mitophagy inhibition. In the present study, they take a closer look at this mechanism and the role of the Far complex. The authors discovered that a significant proportion of the Far complex localizes to mitochondria in addition to its previously-described ER localization. They then elegantly showed that these differently localized complexes play distinct roles, the regulation of mitophagy and the TORC2 pathway, respectively. The authors further clarified the mechanisms underlying the assembly of the Far complex and its association with Atg32, and how these processes are affected before and after mitophagy induction. Thus, this study will provide significant insights into our understanding of the regulation of mitophagy. However, the authors should perform further experiments to convincingly draw their conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Two important discoveries in this manuscript, the regulation of Atg32-Far interaction and the dependence of Far-Ppg1 complex assembly on the phosphatase activity of Ppg1, are not fully validated and corroborated. The former would be the most important conclusion of this study and is highlighted by the authors in the title and the Abstract. However, the conclusion is based on a single piece of data in Figure 5G, and the quality of the immunoblotting image was not clear enough, which should be replaced with a better one. We also request the authors to provide additional evidence to strengthen this conclusion. For example, the authors should examine if the same result is obtained when mitophagy is induced in non-fermentable medium or rapamycin treatment instead of nitrogen starvation. In addition, it would be worth examining whether artificial tethering of a Far protein to Atg32 prevents the activation of mitophagy. As for the latter, it would be useful to examine whether the Ppg1-H111N mutant can interact normally with Far11 and Far8, respectively.</p><p>2) The assembly of the Far complex and Ppg1: The authors write: &quot;We next investigated whether the Far complex interacts directly with Atg32&quot;. Whereas I agree that this is an important question to address, the authors do not address the directness of the interaction with their experiments. They solely use immunoprecipitations, with which distinguishing between a direct and an indirect interaction is not possible. As the authors draw a clear assembly model in the end, which is based on – possibly indirect – co-immunoprecipitation studies only, further experiments addressing the directness of these interactions are required to draw this conclusion. In general, this part on the Far complex and its (possibly different) assembly during TORC2 signaling and during mitophagy is the weakest part of the story and would profit of further analyses.</p><p>3) Statistics and reproducibility: For almost all experiments one single Western blot or one microscopy image only are shown. Some indication of reproducibility is needed. Whereas quantifications would be the best, at least a statement on how many times the experiment has been performed with the same outcome and how many cells out of how many cells showed the respective phenotype, is absolutely needed, at least in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Kanki's group, by extending their previous findings, has advanced understanding of the regulatory mechanism of mitophagy in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Specifically, the authors discovered that a significant proportion of the Ppg1-Far protein complex, which dephosphorylates the mitophagy receptor Atg32 under mitophagy-suppressing conditions, localizes to mitochondria in addition to its previously-described ER localization, and then elegantly revealed that these differently localized complexes play distinct roles, the regulation of mitophagy and the TORC2 pathway, respectively. The authors further clarified the mechanisms underlying the assembly of the Far complex and its association with Atg32, and how these processes are affected before and after mitophagy induction. Consequently, this study has provided significant mechanistic insights into the regulation of mitophagy, in which the interaction between the Far complex and Atg32, rather than the assembly or localization of the Ppg1-Far complex, is regulated in response to mitophagy-inducing signals.</p><p>1) Figure 5G: This is the most important experiment to explain mitophagy regulation based on an alteration in the interaction between the Far complex and Atg32, but the quality of the immunoblotting image was not clear enough; should be replaced with a better one. In addition, the authors should examine if the same result is obtained when mitophagy is induced in non-fermentable medium or rapamycin treatment instead of nitrogen starvation.</p><p>2) Figure 4A: A &quot;no antibody&quot; control should be added to confirm that Far proteins other than Far11 were also coprecipitated with Far8 in a specific manner.</p><p>3) Figure 5E: It would be interesting to examine whether the S114D/S119D mutant showed a stronger association with the Far complex than the wild type protein. The results may strengthen the authors' model that the Far complex preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Atg32.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the regulation of mitophagy by the Ppg1 phosphatase and the Far complex. In earlier work in 2018, the group showed that the phosphatase Ppg1 and the Far complex cooperate in counteracting Atg32 dependent mitophagy. This counteraction happens by dephosphorylating Atg32, which results in mitophagy inhibition.</p><p>In this new study they take a closer look at this mechanism and the role of the Far complex. They find that several Far complex members not only localize to the known location at the ER but also to mitochondria. A forced ER localization of the Far complex results in no inhibition of mitophagy, whereas a forced mitochondrial localization does, suggesting that the Far complex plays different roles, at the ER in TORC2 signaling, and at the mitochondria in mitophagy.</p><p>Further detailed analysis reveals insight into the Far complex assembly at mitochondria and its interaction with Atg32.</p><p>This is an elegant mechanistic study of known factors in autophagy. The field of autophagy largely lacks knowledge of mechanisms, many factors are known, but we don't know what they do. Such studies are important to move the field forward. In my opinion the experiments shown are very well done and only little revision is needed for the shown experiments.</p><p>I have only two additional comments:</p><p>1) The assembly of the Far complex and Ppg1: The authors write: &quot;We next investigated whether the Far complex interacts directly with Atg32&quot;. Whereas I agree that this is an important question to address, the authors do not address the directness of the interaction with their experiments. They solely use immunoprecipitations, with which distinguishing between a direct and an indirect interaction is not possible. As the authors draw a clear assembly model in the end, which is based on – possibly indirect – co-immunoprecipitation studies only, further experiments addressing the directness of these interactions are required to draw this conclusion.

Some indication of reproducibility is needed. Whereas quantifications would be the best, at least a statement on how many times the experiment has been performed with the same outcome and how many cells out of how many cells showed the respective phenotype, is absolutely needed, at least in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors followed up on their previous discovery that budding yeast mitophagy receptor Atg32 is negatively regulated by the Far-Ppg1 phosphatase complex, and dissected the subcellular localization, the complex composition, and the regulatory mechanisms of the Far-Ppg1 phosphatase complex. They revealed that the Far-Ppg1 phosphatase complex in budding yeast has a previously unknown mitochondrial localization and mitochondrial localized Far-Ppg1 is responsible for Atg32 inhibition. They found that Ppg1 is important for the assembly of Far11 with the rest of the Far proteins. They showed that Far8 interacts with Atg32 and this interaction is weakened under a mitophgay-inducing condition. These findings provide significant new insights into how Far-Ppg1 phosphatase acts, and enhance our understanding on how mitophagy is regulated.</p><p>I have the following suggestions for the authors to consider:</p><p>1) Two important discoveries in this manuscript, the regulation of Atg32-Far interaction and the dependence of Far-Ppg1 complex assembly on the phosphatase activity of Ppg1, seemed to me not fully validated and corroborated, and felt somewhat preliminary. The first under-validated conclusion is that Atg32 is activated by weakening the Atg32-Far interaction. This is probably the most important conclusion of this manuscript and is highlighted by the authors in the title and the Abstract. However, the conclusion is based on a single piece of data in Figure 5G. It would be useful to add additional evidence to strengthen this conclusion. For example, does artificial tethering of a Far protein to Atg32 prevent the activation of mitophagy?</p><p>2) The second under-validated conclusion is also only supported by a single piece of data in Figure 4E.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Two important discoveries in this manuscript, the regulation of Atg32-Far interaction and the dependence of Far-Ppg1 complex assembly on the phosphatase activity of Ppg1, are not fully validated and corroborated. The former would be the most important conclusion of this study and is highlighted by the authors in the title and the Abstract. However, the conclusion is based on a single piece of data in Figure 5G, and the quality of the immunoblotting image was not clear enough, which should be replaced with a better one. We also request the authors to provide additional evidence to strengthen this conclusion. For example, the authors should examine if the same result is obtained when mitophagy is induced in non-fermentable medium or rapamycin treatment instead of nitrogen starvation. In addition, it would be worth examining whether artificial tethering of a Far protein to Atg32 prevents the activation of mitophagy. As for the latter, it would be useful to examine whether the Ppg1-H111N mutant can interact normally with Far11 and Far8, respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the first part of the comment, we reproduced the dissociation between Atg32 and Far8 upon nitrogen starvation and showed the result in Figure 5G. We believe that the current immunoblotting is clearer than the previous one.</p><p>Following the second part of the comment, we obtained additional data regarding dissociation between Atg32 and Far8 upon rapamycin treatment (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), supporting our conclusion that the interaction between Atg32 and Far8 is weakened by mitophagy-inducing conditions.</p><p>Following the third part of the comment, we expressed a Far8-Atg32 chimeric protein as artificial tethering of the Far complex to Atg32 and tested whether it affects the phosphorylation status of Atg32 and mitophagy. This Far8-Atg32 chimeric protein showed an unphosphorylated form even without endogenous Far8 under growing conditions, and it was not phosphorylated even under mitophagy-inducing conditions (Figures 6C and F). Moreover, the cells expressing the Far8-Atg32 chimeric protein showed impaired mitophagy (Idh1-GFP processing; Figure 6F). These effects of the Far8-Atg32 chimera protein were canceled by <italic>PPG1</italic> deletion. These results strongly support our conclusion that the association and dissociation between Atg32 and Far8 (Far complex) are crucial for mitophagy regulation.</p><p>We also found that Far3, Far7, Far9, and Far11 are still required for Far8-Atg32 dephosphorylation (Figure 6D) and that cells expressing Far8-Atg32, but not Atg32, recruit Far11 (Far11-GFP) to the mitochondria (Figure 6E). These results suggest that the Atg32-Far8 chimeric protein normally serves as a Far complex component and counteracts with the phosphorylation of the Atg32 part.</p><p>Following the last part of the comment, we examined whether Ppg1-H111N can interact with Far8 and Far11. We found that Ppg1-H111N can interact with Far11 and Far8, but the interaction is impaired (Figure 4G). This result suggests that the phosphatase activity of Ppg1 is required for the assembling integrity of Ppg1-Far11-Far8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The assembly of the Far complex and Ppg1: The authors write: &quot;We next investigated whether the Far complex interacts directly with Atg32&quot;. Whereas I agree that this is an important question to address, the authors do not address the directness of the interaction with their experiments. They solely use immunoprecipitations, with which distinguishing between a direct and an indirect interaction is not possible. As the authors draw a clear assembly model in the end, which is based on – possibly indirect – co-immunoprecipitation studies only, further experiments addressing the directness of these interactions are required to draw this conclusion. In general, this part on the Far complex and its (possibly different) assembly during TORC2 signaling and during mitophagy is the weakest part of the story and would profit of further analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our previous manuscript did not include critical evidence for the direct interaction between Atg32 and the Far complex. To investigate whether the Far complex directly interacts with Atg32, we performed a GST pull-down assay using recombinant His6-Far8 and GST-Atg32 proteins produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>. As shown in Figure 6, GST-Atg32(N250), but not GST only or GST-Atg32(N200/N150), pulled down His6-Far8. This result, together with Figure 5E, indicates that Far8 directly interacts with Atg32 and that the 151–250 region of Atg32 is required for the interaction. Based on this finding, we modified our proposed model that Far8 interacts with Atg32 in Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistics and reproducibility: For almost all experiments one single Western blot or one microscopy image only are shown. Some indication of reproducibility is needed. Whereas quantifications would be the best, at least a statement on how many times the experiment has been performed with the same outcome and how many cells out of how many cells showed the respective phenotype, is absolutely needed, at least in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We employed representative images from at least two to three independent experiments (yeast growth assay and Western blot, including Atg32 phosphorylation, mitophagy, immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays). We mentioned this information in Materials and methods. In all microscopy experiments (two to three independent experiments analyzing 100–200 cells), most of the analyzed cells showed the same localization pattern, as shown in each panel. We mentioned this information in the main text and Materials and methods.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Statistics and reproducibility</p><p>The authors have not provided sufficient statistical details to enable the reader to gage the reproducibility of the observations reported, the new manuscript merely provides a general statement in the Materials and method section that the experiments were performed &quot;two to three times&quot;.

We repeated all of the experiments that were performed only two times in the original manuscript, and all of the repeated experiments gave the same outcome. We mentioned how many times each experiment was repeated in the figure legends. Because some of repeated data look better than previous ones, we replaced them in the revised manuscript (Figures 1E, 3B, 3I, and 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The “direct” interaction between the Far complex and Atg32</p><p>This has been well addressed by using recombinant proteins, showing that Far8 interacts directly with Atg32.

How do the authors envision this works? This point should be addressed at least in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Although the interaction between Atg32 and Far8 was slightly observed even by CBB staining for Far8, we did not include it in the original manuscript because the western blot data was much clearer than the CBB staining. For more accurate information, we included the CBB staining for Far8 in the revised manuscript (new Figure 6B).</p><p>As the reason for the weak interaction, we speculate; (i) Far8 preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Atg32 in vivo (Figure 5E), but we used non-phosphorylated Atg32 (produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>) for the GST pull-down assay.; (ii) The presence of Far3, Far7, and Far9 is likely to increase the interaction between Atg32 and Far8 (Figure 5F), but our in vitro assay used Far8 alone among six Far proteins.; (iii) Mitochondrial localization of Atg32 might be important for the stable interaction with Far8. We mentioned these points in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
