We characterized polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the melanocyte antigen tyrosinase-related protein 2 (Trp2) in mice expressing or lacking this enzyme (due to deficiency in <italic>Dct</italic>, which encodes Trp2). Phenotypic and gene expression profiles of pre-immune Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells were similar; the size of this population was only slightly reduced in wild-type (WT) compared to <italic>Dct</italic>-deficient (<italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Despite comparable initial responses to Trp2 immunization, WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells showed blunted expansion and less readily differentiated into a CD25<sup>+</sup>proliferative population. Functional self-tolerance clearly emerged when assessing immunopathology: adoptively transferred WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells mediated vitiligo much less efficiently. Hence, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell self-specificity is poorly predicted by precursor frequency, phenotype, or even initial responsiveness, while deficient activation-induced CD25 expression and other gene expression characteristics may help to identify functionally tolerant cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tolerance</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>autoimmune response/disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI140631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jameson</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AI035296</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jameson</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32OD010993</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Truckenbrod</surname><given-names>Emily N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fulton</surname><given-names>Ross B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renkema</surname><given-names>Kristin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification and characterization of the responses of T lymphocytes that are specific for 'self' tissue antigens, revealing the functional limits of immune tolerance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate discrimination between harmful (pathogens, toxins, cancerous cells) and non-harmful entities (self, innocuous environmental components, non-pathogenic microbes) underlies effective functioning of the immune system. Understanding the mechanisms that normally enforce immunological tolerance to self is a prerequisite for safely and effectively manipulating the immune system to therapeutically induce or break self-tolerance.</p><p>Tolerance can be mediated by the clonal deletion of developing self-reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hogquist et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kappler et al., 1987</xref>). Largely based on studies in transgenic mouse models, this process has long been regarded as common and highly efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer, 2003</xref>). However, recent studies have revealed that thymic clonal deletion is less effective than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richards et al., 2016</xref>). Self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to escape negative selection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouneaud et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zehn and Bevan, 2006</xref>), with one group proposing that up to 4% of peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are self-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richards et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, studies in humans indicated that precursor frequencies of blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for certain self-peptides were comparable to those demonstrated for foreign peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) and suggested that such cells might be capable of overt autoreactivity if suitably stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Aside from clonal deletion, tolerance mechanisms include ignorance of antigen, suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs), and induction of a functionally unresponsive or hyporesponsive anergic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mescher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Redmond and Sherman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schietinger and Greenberg, 2014</xref>). However, different models have produced conflicting evidence regarding the contribution of each of these mechanisms and whether non-deletional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance is an intrinsic property of tolerant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) or dependent on restraint by Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richards et al., 2015</xref>). It is also unclear how the presence and reactivity of self-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells relates to their ability to drive immunopathology. The majority of commonly used mouse models of tolerance have the drawbacks of relying on T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic animals that may not recapitulate normal physiology or utilizing in vitro analyses for characterization of functionality.</p><p>Our studies are intended to provide a better understanding of non-deletional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance by utilizing a more physiological and translationally relevant mouse model in which an epitope from the melanocyte differentiation enzyme tyrosinase-related protein 2 (Trp2) is recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as either self or foreign. Trp2, an enzyme involved in melanin biosynthesis encoded by the dopachrome tautomerase (<italic>Dct</italic>) gene, is normally expressed by melanocytes in the skin in both humans and C57BL/6 mice and is overexpressed by many melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avogadri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 1996</xref>). Using wild-type (WT) mice and a novel <italic>Dct-</italic>deficient (<italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) strain, we compared responses to Trp2<sub>180–188</sub>/K<sup>b</sup> (Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>) as a self- versus foreign antigen. This model is relevant to human health, as Trp2 is a common target in cancer immunotherapy directed against melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho and Celis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parkhurst et al., 1998</xref>), and Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific responses can be induced in WT mice with vigorous priming approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho and Celis, 2009</xref>). Instead of utilizing TCR transgenic models, we focus on the polyclonal Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire to maximize applicability to normal physiology.</p><p>Here, we show that tolerance among Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is manifest primarily at the level of minimizing overt autoimmunity; differences in the size and initial Trp2 responsiveness of the precursor pool in WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were relatively modest, although there was evidence for ‘pruning’ of cells with the highest avidity Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific TCRs from the WT precursor population. The underlying tolerance mechanism does not depend on cell-extrinsic regulation but rather correlates with a cell-intrinsic failure of WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to sustain optimal proliferation. However, while differences in the responsiveness of WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells to Trp2 immunization were mostly subtle, a notable difference emerged when the cells were assessed for their ability to provoke autoimmune vitiligo: cells primed in <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were much more effective than those primed in WT animals. Accordingly, we conclude that tolerance in this setting does not lead to marked changes in the presence, phenotype, or initial reactivity of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but limits these cells’ capacity for overt autoreactivity. Moreover, our polyclonal model reveals that certain characteristics of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-responsive effector cells—reduced CD25 expression and impaired differentiation into a highly proliferative subpopulation—correlate with functional tolerance of a T cell population, providing a framework for future characterization of self-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The pre-immune population of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells is similarly sized and appears naïve in WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice</title><p>Clonal deletion is a well-studied tolerance mechanism that may result in the near-total culling of self-specific cells or a reduction in the number and apparent TCR affinity of surviving self-specific cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouneaud et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng and Anderson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enouz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hogquist et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zehn and Bevan, 2006</xref>). We assessed the number and phenotype of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells in pre-immune (naïve) mice to examine deletional central tolerance in our model. For mice in which Trp2 would not be a self-antigen, we used a novel <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> strain that carries a large deletion encompassing the exon (exon 2) encoding Trp2<sub>180–188</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">3</xref>), unlike a previously described <italic>Dct</italic>-targeted strain that retains the coding sequence for that epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guyonneau et al., 2004</xref>). We performed tetramer enrichment from the spleen and lymph nodes of pre-immune WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to quantify the number of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While on average we identified more antigen-specific cells in <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (~1.4-fold increased), we nevertheless found relatively large numbers of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (&gt;1500) in both strains, evidence that most Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells escape thymic or peripheral clonal deletion in WT mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in pre-immune wild-type (WT) and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice share a naïve phenotype while showing modest differences in frequency and tetramer staining.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tetramer enrichment was performed to enumerate Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells per mouse. Median tetramer fluorescence intensity (MFI) was used to estimate the avidity of enriched Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific (<bold>B</bold>) or B8R/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells (<bold>C</bold>).

Accordingly, we tracked CD25 expression as an indicator of activation. CD25, the high-affinity alpha component of the IL-2 receptor, is upregulated with activation in certain situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valenzuela et al., 2002</xref>) and may enable a stronger effector response by cells expressing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2006</xref>).

Once again, <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells displayed significantly higher tetramer MFI than WT cells on days 2 through 7, but the avidity differences detected by tetramer staining did not demonstrate a progressive increase with time; the ratio between the WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> tetramer MFI transiently dropped at days 4–6, but the ratio at day 7 was similar to that of pre-immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These findings contrasted with the clear difference in vitiligo elicited by <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> versus WT cells and indicate that differences in skin recruitment and retention are unlikely to account for the distinct disease progression induced by these populations.</p><p>In summary, in contrast to the relatively modest differences in the expansion of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup> responders in WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the ability of these populations to mediate autoimmune damage—melanocyte destruction—was strikingly different.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A number of groups have demonstrated the existence of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery of mice and healthy human adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delluc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). In some cases, self-reactive cells display indicators of reduced functionality, revealing them as tolerant and unlikely to cause spontaneous pathology. For example, self-reactive cells are often reported to express inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4, PD-1, and LAG-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fife and Bluestone, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schietinger et al., 2012</xref>). However, studies in human adults have identified self-reactive cells with a phenotype similar to that of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for foreign antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2015</xref>); these cells did not display an overtly anergic phenotype but still responded poorly to stimulation. It is important to understand the mechanisms restraining these cells under normal conditions as well as their potential to cause pathology; such knowledge is critical to designing effective therapies to restrain these cells (e.g., to control autoimmune disease) or induce their responses (e.g., for cancer immunotherapy). As described in this report, we developed a polyclonal mouse model for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell self-tolerance, enabling us to define the characteristics of these cells and their reactivity in a physiological setting.</p><p>We found that the pre-immune populations of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells in WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> strains were qualitatively similar, sharing a naïve phenotype and indistinguishable gene expression profile; there were no clear signs of prior antigen exposure among the WT cells. The size of the Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific precursor pool was only slightly (although significantly) smaller in WT mice, by less than twofold, and the response to Trp2 immunization was substantial in both strains, leading to a &gt;1000-fold expansion of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells in both WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Despite these commonalities, the population primed in <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed greater expansion and elicited more rapid and widespread tissue destruction, read out as vitiligo, after adoptive transfer. Since the enhanced induction of vitiligo by transferred <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells did not align with their improved recruitment to the skin, these findings suggest that <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells are more efficient at mediating melanocyte destruction within the tissue.</p><p>Our adoptive transfer studies showed that the observed restraint in the WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific response did not depend on extrinsic factors but was a cell-intrinsic feature of pre-immune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This implies that other cell populations, including CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs or regulatory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saligrama et al., 2019</xref>) are neither required for nor capable of affecting the responses of tolerant and non-tolerant Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells during priming. These findings also effectively eliminate the possibility that self-antigen presentation during Trp2 priming alters the nature of the immune response. However, while our studies argue that cell-extrinsic regulation is not required for enforcement or maintenance of tolerance by Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells, this does not exclude a potential role for Treg populations in establishing the initial tolerant state in WT mice. It is currently unclear whether tolerance to Trp2 is enforced during thymic development or in the periphery of WT mice: one report suggested that <italic>Dct</italic> expression is undetectable in thymic mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Träger et al., 2012</xref>), but Trp2 could be brought into the thymus by dendritic cell populations to induce tolerance in WT animals. The site of tolerance induction was not a focus of the current study, but it will be interesting to determine whether instances of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell self-tolerance correlate with self-antigen expression patterns in the thymus (e.g., AIRE-regulated tissue-specific antigen expression).</p><p>Many of the characteristics we report for Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in WT mice are strongly reminiscent of T cells with low affinity/avidity for antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouneaud et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enouz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zehn and Bevan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zehn et al., 2009</xref>), and we did observe modestly higher Trp2/K<sup>b</sup> tetramer staining intensity on a subset of <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells compared to WT responder cells. The ‘pruning’ of WT CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with high-avidity Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific TCRs remains the most likely explanation for this finding. If so, however, the effect of such pruning appears to be remarkably subtle. While analysis of unimmunized mice revealed that the average number and tetramer staining intensity of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly lower in WT than <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals, the degree of overlap suggests such measures would be unreliable for detecting tolerant cells beyond this optimized experimental model. Furthermore, the relatively consistent WT to <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> tetramer MFI ratio in our time course experiments argues against an imbalanced outgrowth of higher affinity/avidity TCR clones in <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> relative to WT animals (as might have been expected if TCR affinity was the primary factor driving improved proliferation in the <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> population). At a practical level, the relatively modest differences in cell number and tetramer staining between tolerant and non-tolerant cells that we observed in this carefully controlled model system would not be sufficient to accurately predict self-reactivity versus tolerance in a clinical setting. Broadly similar conclusions were drawn from earlier studies of self-tolerance in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). This finding highlights the limitations of currently available assays for accurately predicting responsiveness to self-antigens.</p><p>Other studies utilizing mouse models have reported that even CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with very-low-affinity/avidity TCRs (including those undetectable by normal peptide/MHC tetramer staining) can provoke overt tissue damage that may reach or exceed the response observed for non-tolerant, high-affinity/avidity cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enouz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sabatino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zehn and Bevan, 2006</xref>). Our data indicate that the opposite can also occur: despite largely overlapping tetramer staining profiles, WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells exhibit markedly different abilities to mediate widespread vitiligo. Hence, the impact of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance toward some self-antigens only partially limits expansion but can prevent the generation of cells readily capable of potent tissue destruction: tolerance is not a binary state.</p><p>Although enumeration, phenotyping, and pre-immune gene expression profiling failed to provide a robust metric for identifying functionally tolerant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we were able to delineate an inflection point following priming at which the responses of tolerant and non-tolerant cells diverged. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells soon after priming demonstrated that WT responders failed to differentiate into a CD25<sup>+</sup>, IRF4<sup>+</sup> population (a characteristic of most <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> responder cells) and indicated that WT cells showed poor commitment to sustained proliferation. These combined features may be useful for further defining the responses by self-antigen-specific cells that are or are not capable of overt tissue destruction.</p><p>The early effector population of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells demonstrates heterogeneity on a transcriptomic level in both strains. Whereas the majority of <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells show a highly proliferative phenotype characterized by active cell cycling and responsiveness to mTOR and Myc, few WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells fall into this group. The reason(s) underlying the inability of WT cells to optimally engage these important pathways and proliferate efficiently require(s) further investigation but may relate to impaired sensitivity to endogenous IL-2 or other cytokines, the composition of the TCR repertoire, and/or altered TCR signaling. How these or other factors relate to the relative inability of primed WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells to mediate overt tissue damage is currently unclear, but it will be critical to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in future studies. Recent studies on dysfunctional tumor-specific or exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have shown that epigenetic changes in chromatin accessibility or methylation can maintain such states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghoneim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pauken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Philip et al., 2017</xref>), which is one potential explanation for the cell-intrinsic nature of the tolerance seen in our model.</p><p>We were able to identify CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for other melanocyte epitopes/antigens in pre-immune mice; these cells had a similar phenotype to WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells. Accordingly, we predict that our results will apply to other populations of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for melanocyte and potentially other tissue-restricted antigens. Similar populations of self-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may exist in humans, and the ability of such cells to respond to self-antigen immunization while not causing autoimmune damage is relevant for understanding the limits of ‘breaking’ tolerance, for example, for cancer immunotherapy. Indeed, our results align with work examining polyclonal self-antigen-specific cells in human adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) with regard to the phenotype (modestly lower tetramer MFI, lower CD25 expression) and response to cognate peptide (diminished) observed among tolerant cells. Another study examining self-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>) attributed their restrained responsiveness to Treg-mediated suppression; while we did not detect a cell-extrinsic regulatory mechanism in our studies, it is certainly possible that this mechanism limits the response to some self-antigens.</p><p>Our finding that polyclonal melanocyte-specific cells exhibit covert cell-intrinsic tolerance characterized by a partial defect in proliferation and a profound defect in tissue damage has implications for utilizing such cells therapeutically. This model has clear relevance to human physiology and will be useful in exploring methods of correcting the proliferative defects of tolerant cells to more effectively mobilize them in cancer immunotherapy approaches targeting tumor antigens shared with self.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Dct<sup>-/-</sup> (Exon 2–6<sup>-/-</sup>)</td><td>Dr. A.

Andy Hurwitz at the NCI (see below); the mice were subsequently bred in-house on different congenic backgrounds and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions. Animals were used at 6–14 weeks of age. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Minnesota. In accordance with NIH guidelines, both male and female animals were used in experiments; males are indicated by square symbols in the figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of <italic>Dct<sup>Δ2-6</sup></italic> (<italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice</title><p>The construct used to generate an exon 2–6 deletion mutant of <italic>Dct</italic> (<italic>Dct<sup>Δ2-6</sup></italic>—referred to as Dct<sup>-/-</sup> in the manuscript) was synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA). Electroporation of the gene construct into mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) was performed by the Transgenic Mouse Model Laboratory (TMML) of the Laboratory Animal Services Program at the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed to screen for the presence of the recombined construct in the proper genomic location of prospective clones. pDRAW32 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acalone.com">http://www.acalone.com</ext-link>) and Primer3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.simgene.com">http://www.simgene.com</ext-link>) were used to design primers, and the NCBI Primer-BLAST tool was used to confirm the specificity of primers in the mouse genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/</ext-link>).</p><p>Genomic DNA from candidate mESC samples was purified using standard phenol chloroform extraction. Clones were screened by PCR using the primer pairs listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>. Hot-Start Taq Blue Master Mix from Denville Scientific (Holliston, MA) was used with the following conditions: 5 min at 95°C; followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 7 min at 72°C; followed by cooling and storage at 4°C. PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. After screening ~350 mESC samples, four candidates that showed recombination were found. These cells were then transferred into blastocysts and inserted into pseudo-pregnant females by the TMML. Ultimately, two chimera lines were generated and transferred into the Hurwitz laboratory’s mouse colony where we oversaw the breeding of chimeras and the intercrossing of pups. Pups were screened for slate coat color, which is the phenotype expected for mice with a homozygous deletion of Dct. Tail clips were used to test for the presence or absence of exons by PCR.

A modification of the method used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obar et al., 2008</xref> was employed. Following digestion with collagenase D, single-cell suspensions were prepared from the spleens (acutely challenged mice) or spleen and cervical, axillary, brachial, inguinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes (pre-immune mice). When possible, the same tetramer (Trp2<sub>180–188</sub>/K<sup>b</sup>) was used in both APC and PE to ensure specificity. Anti-PE and anti-APC beads and magnetized columns (both from Miltenyi Biotec) were used to enrich for tetramer-bound cells. Samples were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry; CountBright counting beads (Invitrogen) were used for enumeration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo priming with Trp2</title><p>TriVax immunization was used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho and Celis, 2009</xref>); mice were immunized intravenously (via tail vein injections) with Trp2<sub>180–188</sub> peptide or Trp2 and B8R<sub>20–27</sub> peptides, agonist-anti CD40 antibody (BioXCell), and vaccine-grade poly(I:C), a toll-like receptor 3 agonist (InvivoGen). Peptide doses of 50, 100, and 200 μg per mouse were used for effector time points, transfer experiments, and acute time points, respectively, unless otherwise noted. Animals that received TriVax immunization via intraperitoneal instead of intravenous injection were removed from the analysis unless otherwise noted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Infections with LmTrp2</title><p>Frozen stocks of LmTrp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruhn et al., 2005</xref>) were thawed and grown to log-phase in tryptic soy broth supplemented with streptomycin (50 μg/mL). Mice were typically injected with ~10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming units intravenously or intraperitoneally. Infectious doses were verified by colony counts on tryptic soy broth-streptomycin plates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ex vivo stimulation</title><p>In some experiments, splenocytes were stimulated ex vivo after isolation from infected mice. Splenocytes were incubated with Trp2 peptide (10<sup>−6</sup> M) and Golgiplug (BD Biosciences) for 4–6 hr at 37°C; parallel wells with no peptide were used as a control. Cells were washed and stained with surface antibodies, followed by fixation and permeabilization with a FoxP3 Fix/Perm kit (eBioscience) or FoxP3/transcription factor staining buffer kit (Tonbo Biosciences) and staining with intracellular antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Skin harvests</title><p>Skin was shaved and dissected from the underlying tissue, then cut into small pieces and digested in a Collagenase Type III solution.

Enriched CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (typically ~75–90% pure) were resuspended in sterile PBS and 2–2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were injected intravenously per recipient mouse; recipient mice were congenically distinct (by CD45 and/or Thy-1 alleles). One day later, the recipient mice were immunized with TriVax or LmTrp2 intravenously or intraperitoneally. Mice were sacrificed for analysis 7 days later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bulk RNA sequencing of pre-immune mice</title><p>Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells were isolated from pre-immune WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice using tetramer enrichment followed by FACS on double tetramer-positive cells. Cells were isolated from three separate cohorts, with each cohort comprising eight WT and eight <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. The Clontech StrandedRNA Pico Mammalian workflow was used for library preparation, and samples were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq instrument (2 × 75 bp paired end reads).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Bulk RNAseq analysis</title><p>Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed by sample into FASTQs (mean 24.6 million reads/sample) and mapped against the mouse genome (Ensembl GRCm38 release 95) using Hisat2 software (v 2.1.0). Gene level quantification was completed using Subread featureCounts software (v 1.6.2) and the read counts table was processed in R (v 3.5.2). Differentially expressed genes were identified with DESeq2 software (v 1.22.2) using a negative binomial model with effect size estimation completed by apeglm algorithm via the lfcShrink function. Group comparison p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini and Hochberg method to account for multiple hypothesis testing where genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) q &lt; 0.05 were investigated in downstream analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>Day 7: WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were primed with TriVax (50 μg Trp2), and Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells were isolated using negative enrichment for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells followed by FACS for tetramer-positive cells. Day 3: WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were primed with TriVax (200 μg Trp2), and Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells were isolated using tetramer enrichment followed by FACS. At both time points, cells were submitted for barcoding and library preparation using the 10× Genomics platform (Chromium Single Cell 5’ Library and Gel Bead Kit; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), and samples were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq instrument with 2× 150 bp paired end protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Single-cell RNAseq analysis</title><p>Raw sequencing data were processed using Cell Ranger (v 3.0.2; 10× Genomics) software programs ‘mkfastq’ for demultiplexing the WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Illumina libraries and ‘count’ for read alignment against the mouse genome (mm10, provided by 10× Genomics, v 3.0.0) and generation of the mRNA transcript count table. Raw count data were loaded into R (v 3.6.1) and analyzed with the Seurat R package (v 3.0.3.9039) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). All scRNA datasets (WT or <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) at each time point (3 or 7 days after TriVax immunization) were independently filtered to include only cells (i.e., uniquely barcoded transcripts) expressing more than 300 genes and genes expressed in more than three cells (e.g., counts &gt; 0). The proportion of mitochondrial RNA in each cell was calculated and cells with extreme levels (top or bottom 2% of all cells) were removed from the analysis. Genes with extreme expression levels (top or bottom 1% of all genes) were removed. Contaminating cells in the day 3 dataset expressing high levels of B cell or myeloid lineage marker genes and low levels of T cell markers were removed using empirically derived thresholds (675 B cells and 26 myeloid cells removed from WT and 117 B cells removed from <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup>). Downstream analysis of the day 3 dataset included a total of 4539 WT cells (19,326 genes) and 11,680 <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (19,416 genes); the day 7 dataset included a total of 6254 WT cells (12,902 genes) and 4784 <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (12,437 genes). The datasets from each time point were analyzed similarly in parallel, unless otherwise noted. Raw RNA counts were normalized with the LogNormalize function and each cell was classified according to its expression of canonical cell cycle genes using the CellCycleScoring function from Seurat (S-phase and G2/M-phase gene sets provided by Seurat were originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>). For each cell, a cell cycle score was computed by subtracting the average expression of a random control gene set from the average expression of either S or G2/M cell cycle gene sets. If the difference score was negative for both comparisons, the cell was labeled G1. Otherwise, the cell was labeled according to which difference score was larger (S or G2/M). Raw RNA counts were normalized and transformed using the Seurat SCTransform function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) including the percent of mitochondria expression as a regression factor. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using the normalized, mean-centered, and scaled SCT dataset (RunPCA function). The top 3000 variable genes from each dataset were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function (vst method) and were used for WT and <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> sample integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Two-dimensional projections were generated using the top 30 PCA vectors as input to the RunTSNE and RunUMAP functions. Cells were clustered using the FindNeighbors (top 30 PCA vectors) and FindClusters functions (testing a range of possible resolutions: 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6). Pairwise DE testing (Wilcox rank-sum) with the FindMarkers function was performed between all initial clusters; any two clusters were merged if there were fewer than five significant DE genes (i.e., absolute value of log<sub>2</sub>-fold-change≥0.25 and Bonferroni adjusted p-value≤0.01). Pairwise DE testing continued on subsequently merged clusters. A final resolution of 0.2 was chosen (merging of initial clusters by DE testing was not required) to best represent the biological processes within both datasets. Cluster-specific pathway expression testing was completed using the VISION R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeTomaso et al., 2019</xref>) and figures were generated using the ggplot2 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wickham, 2016</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) was performed using pre-ranked gene lists (sorted from largest to smallest log<sub>2</sub>-fold change between clusters compared). Gene set enrichment statistics were calculated for two gene set collections in the Molecular Signatures Database (hallmarks and c2 curated) derived for mouse symbols using the R package msigdbr, v 6.2.1 using the R package clusterProfiler (v 3.12.0). Interesting gene sets with an FDR q &lt; 0.05 were evaluated.

Negative enrichment for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was performed on day 7. Live cells were counted using a hemocytometer, and the percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> and Trp2/K<sup>b</sup> tetramer-binding cells were applied to enumerate Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells; equal numbers (50,000) of WT or <italic>Dct</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells were transferred to WT or P14 recipients. Recipients were treated with TriVax (100 μg Trp2) later the same day. On day 6 after cell transfer, the recipients were bled to assess donor populations. The mice were then treated with DNFB (0.15% in 4:1 acetone:olive oil) on the left flank; 30 μL was applied to a shaved patch of skin ~1.5 cm×1.5 cm in size; 30 μL of vehicle was applied to the right flank in the same manner. Control mice did not receive cell transfers, but did receive TriVax immunization and DNFB treatment at the same time as mice receiving cell transfers.

They show that while knock-out mice still have ample antigen-specific cells present (albeit in reduced numbers and with lower tetramer binding) they appeared phenotypically naïve. Upon immunisation, the antigen-specific cell population still expands dramatically (1000x) but with slower proliferation kinetics and the proliferation could be recovered by providing IL-2. Thy use single cell sequencing to identify that the most highly proliferative cell clusters are greatly reduced in the WT mice. They use a disease model of vitiligo induction and show that the cells from WT mice with endogenous antigen exposure are less able to induce disease. The strengths of the paper are a very thorough phenotypic analysis including using sophisticated single cell technology to elucidate the responding populations. They also validated their findings using both a vaccination model and an infection model. The model is highly relevant to human disease, particularly in the setting of cancer immunotherapy when self-antigen specific T cell populations must be recruited to the anti-tumour response. The paper is well written and clearly presented. The weakness was the inability to identify phenotypic differences in the pre-immune T cell response that programmed the difference in tolerance outcomes, which did not appear to be derived from recruitment of different affinity cells into the response (though this was not directly tested and closer analysis of TCR usage or clonotype sequencing may reveal this as a potential mechanism). A lack of gene expression differences in the pre-immune population may have been due to analysis of combined cell populations from multiple immune sites (spleen, peripheral and mesenteric LN). While presumably, antigen experience was occurring in the skin-draining LN where Trp2 antigen would be present. This may have diluted their ability to observe phenotypic differences/signs of antigen experience in the pre-immune population. Antigen exposure in the periphery may have resulted in reprogramming of the signalling machinery rather than gene expression changes. However, the authors do not claim to have determined the mechanism behind the tolerogenic phenotype and will investigate this in future studies. overall, the findings are interesting and novel.</p><p>My key issue was combining analysis of spleen and various LN in the analysis of the pre-immune population. Combining these different cell sources may well have masked the ability to detect a population with signs of antigen experience.

It is hard to compare MFI between the two genotypes with low numbers of mice when small differences in staining efficiency can amplify differences between the samples.

They demonstrate persistence of a population of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in wild-type mice, albeit at lower numbers and avidity compared to those cells found within a mouse lacking the target self-antigen. This self-reactive T cell population could be expanded upon antigen encounter during either vaccination or infection, although interestingly the expanded T cell populations that developed in wild-type mice bearing the self-antigen exhibited some defects early during activation, and were less capable of causing autoimmune disease, compared to cells from mice lacking the target self-antigen. These defects were cell intrinsic and apparently not due to suppression by antigen-specific regulatory T cells. The authors conclude that a novel tolerance mechanism independent of deletion preserves responsiveness of cells to antigenic challenge but restrains their capacity to cause tissue damage.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The key strength of this manuscript is the experimental model used. They have examined tolerance within endogenous T cell populations specific for a natural self-antigen in wild-type mice, and in parallel they examine control mice that lack the self-antigen to enable quantification of tolerance. This study is important as most tolerance phenomena have been described in far more artificial settings (eg. using high affinity TCR transgenic cells and/or studying tolerance to model self-antigens). By examining tolerance in more physiological models, the real-world relevance of phenomena previously described in more artificial tolerance models can be assessed. Their data suggest that tolerance within endogenous repertoires is more complex than that observed in more artificial models, consistent with recent findings in humans, and are thus a valuable addition to the field.</p><p>The authors have also conducted a comprehensive and impressive set of experiments to thoroughly probe the effect of tolerance on immune responsiveness in their models.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The main weakness of this manuscript is that the argument that the observed phenomena cannot be explained by previously described tolerance mechanisms such as deletion and ignorance are not supported by the data. They argue that antigen exposure potentially leads to epigenetic conditioning of the remaining cells such that they can respond to antigenic challenge but cannot cause disease. However, their data do provide strong evidence that high avidity self-reactive cells are deleted by tolerance mechanisms and that the remaining cells are simply lower avidity cells that fall below the threshold for selection. These residual cells appear naïve, likely because they receive insufficient signals to be activated (ie. they are ignorant). This shift towards a lower avidity population is just as likely an explanation for the observed phenotypes, particularly given that high avidity cells are likely to be more destructive in autoimmune models. Thus, the findings can be explained by both deletion and ignorance, which are previously reported phenomena.</p><p>The authors also study the autoimmune potential of tolerized or control cells in a vitiligo model by first expanding the cells by vaccination prior to transfer into the disease model. However, little information is provided on the phenotype of these expanded cells prior to transfer. This is important as the phenotypes are likely to be different given that there is an expansion defect in tolerized cells. Phenotypic differences at this stage could explain differences in autoimmune potential. Additionally, the authors have not examined the skin infiltrating potential of the transferred cells, which may also be different due to differences in initial priming.</p><p>Finally, the authors have not examined whether there is evidence of migration of high avidity self-reactive cells into the skin in mice that bear the self-antigen vs those that do not. Differences in skin migration could explain the lower cell counts of tolerized cells in the spleen either in the steady-state or after vaccination.</p><p>The following changes are required to the manuscript</p><p>i. The manuscript should be revised to substantially temper the conclusions. There is clearly some deletion occurring (~2 fold) so it is misleading to suggest that no deletional tolerance has occurred. Given that this reduction in numbers is associated with lower avidity, this argues that the high avidity cells are deleted in WT mice. This is reflected in other data in the paper (eg. appearance of an IRF4hi scRNAseq cluster in KO mice suggestive of stronger TCR signal strength after vaccination, and enhanced expansion of KO cells in WT mice where there is presumably less competition from high avidity cells). The remaining lower avidity cells appear naïve by all measures, and the simplest explanation here is ignorance. While it is possible that other factors may be at play (eg. epigenetic conditioning), without identifying a shared endogenous TCR present in WT and KO mice and showing that it behaves differentially in both contexts (eg. via retrogenic mice), this is very hard to prove. Overall, there should be a diminished focus on an unknown tolerance mechanism contributing to the phenotypes – this can be replaced by a section in the Discussion considering the relative likelihood of deletion/ignorance vs epigenetic conditioning as an explanation for the findings. &quot;Non-deletional&quot; should be removed from the title, and the potential for deletion of high avidity clones to explain the phenotype should not be so readily dismissed within the manuscript.</p><p>ii. Do cells end up in the skin in WT mice (ie. the site of Ag)? This hasn't been ruled out as an explanation for reduced cells in the spleen (either after vaccination or in the steady-state). There could be subclinical inflammation/autoimmunity drawing high avidity cells into this site.</p><p>iii. More detail on the Dct KO strain is needed (schematic showing region deleted, more explanation on generation, whether or not a truncated protein is produced etc)</p><p>iv. Basic phenotyping of d7/8 cells post vaccination is needed, particularly as this has important implications for the vitiligo experiment. Eg. %KLRG1+ vs CD127+KLRG1-, GzmB expression, chemokine receptor expression (CXCR3, CX3CR1), cytokine polyfunctionality (IFNγ/TNFa/IL-2 co-production), degranulation etc. It's likely that the cells transferred in the vitiligo experiments are in different states of effector differentiation given the expansion and avidity differences, which is a major caveat in this experiment that is not considered/discussed. Also, Dct<sup>-/-</sup> CD8s have less competition from endogenous high avidity Trp2-responsive cells in WT mice, so will likely fare better in this transfer system based on Figure 3. Although there was no significant difference in persistence/expansion at d6, they may persist better long-term in this model, and this point should at least be discussed as an explanation for increased disease.</p><p>v. Was there a difference in early skin infiltration of Dct<sup>-/-</sup> derived CD8s in the vitiligo experiments? And did only higher avidity cells make it into the skin? Differences in chemokine receptor/integrin expression downstream of altered differentiation could affect homing capacity.</p><p>vi. Re avidity – although there is no change in relative avidity between the groups, only cells above a certain avidity threshold (~1000 MFI) appear to expand in both groups (compare Figure 2D to 1B). This would suggest that higher avidity cells are preferentially selected for expansion, meaning the statement that there is no selection for high avidity cells is technically incorrect and should be qualified.</p><p>vii. Figure 1 – FR4 and CD73 should be included for completeness given that they are bona fide anergy markers. Compiled MFIs of all markers in this figure should also be plotted. Additionally, CD25 MFIs in Figure 4B should be plotted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65615.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

As now shown in Figures S3 and S7, we observe only moderate differences between WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> populations at day 7 (fewer than we observed at day 3); by this stage, which represents the approximate peak of clonal expansion, it is expected that many cells will be out of cycle. As discussed in the manuscript, we expect that reduced early expression of CD25, limiting responsiveness to IL-2, contributes to the reduced expansion of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells in WT mice. Regarding cytotoxicity, we did not see differential expression of the gene encoding Perforin but there was modestly higher expression of transcripts for Granzyme B in KO cells (at day 7 post-priming; Figure S7B and data not shown).

This work is elegant but seems to lack a strong mechanism explaining the outcomes for tolerized cells and how these might be different from non-tolerized cells.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment (shared by Rev. 3). As made clearer in the revised manuscript, our chief goal in this report was to employ a mouse model to investigate whether non-deletional mechanisms dominate in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance toward self-antigens, as was suggested by some studies in humans (Maeda et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2015). By careful analysis in a well-controlled system, we conclude that there is quite modest “pruning” of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with the highest affinity/avidity TCRs for Trp2/K<sup>b</sup> in WT mice, and that this curtails but does not prevent considerable expansion in response to priming yet has a more substantial effect on restraining induction of immunopathology (the latter being something that could not be tested directly in the human studies). This general conclusion aligns with prior studies on the responses of low affinity/avidity TCR CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but our data suggest the differences in TCR repertoire are remarkably subtle.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The weakness was the inability to identify phenotypic differences in the pre-immune T cell response that programmed the difference in tolerance outcomes, which did not appear to be derived from recruitment of different affinity cells into the response (though this was not directly tested and closer analysis of TCR usage or clonotype sequencing may reveal this as a potential mechanism). A lack of gene expression differences in the pre-immune population may have been due to analysis of combined cell populations from multiple immune sites (spleen, peripheral and mesenteric LN). While presumably, antigen experience was occurring in the skin-draining LN where Trp2 antigen would be present.

Since we are tracking the natural polyclonal T cell pool in these studies there is, however, a substantial technical barrier in analysis of skin-draining lymph nodes since very few cells would be expected to be Trp2/K<sup>b</sup> specific. Still, as the reviewer indicated, that assumption might be incorrect – if there were, for example, accumulation of and/or prior activation of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in skin-draining lymph nodes from WT (but not <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice due to constitutive Trp2 antigen presentation. We have explored this in pilot experiments presented to the reviewers: by pooling skin-draining lymph nodes (axillary, brachial, cervical and inguinal) from 6 mice and performing Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>tetramer enrichment, we could identify sufficient numbers of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells to assess whether there were substantial differences between the populations in WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. From the same mice, we pooled non-skin draining lymph nodes (mesenteric) separately and also examined splenic cells. We observed that the numbers and cell surface phenotype of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>tetramer-binding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from skin-draining vs non-skin draining lymph nodes, and from WT vs <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, were all quite similar: in particular, there was scant evidence for enrichment or prior activation of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated in WT skin-draining nodes (preliminary data, not shown). Even with pooling samples from 6 mice, however, we detected only several hundred Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific events per group of lymph nodes (as would be predicted based on these cells being ~0.01% of the preimmune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire), making it hazardous to be dogmatic about these findings. As a result, we would like to limit our description of these preliminary experiments to “data not shown”.</p><p><bold>In addition to these direct studies, it is also worth noting that if it were indeed the case that Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells in skin-draining nodes (but not other lymphoid sites) of WT mice were tolerized, this would not account for the poor response of WT CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after adoptive transfer into <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> host mice and Trp2 immunization (Figure 3) – presumably, this population of donor T cells would be overwhelmingly non-tolerant Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells from nonskin draining sites. The same set of experiments preclude the idea that a few tolerant Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells dominantly impair responses (note the robust response of <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> donor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in WT host mice).</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not sure that the conclusion from Figure 4D/E that there is no preferential response of higher affinity cells in the KO compared to the WT can be made from this data. It is hard to compare MFI between the two genotypes with low numbers of mice when small differences in staining efficiency can amplify differences between the samples. Ideally, the staining here needs to be normalised to an internal control within the same sample (total TCR staining?) or the two genotypes should be mixed and stained together.</p></disp-quote><p>First, it is important to note that the tetramer MFI ratios do not reflect low numbers of mice – each data point in Figure D is a summary of the average tetramer MFI ratio for groups of mice.

Second, while the reviewer’s comment is well taken, we showed significant differences in Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>tetramer MFI between WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in pre-immune mice and all stages of priming in dozens of experiments yet saw no significant difference in the MFIs for the B8R/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells (a group which happens to be at a similar precursor frequency as Trp2/K<sup>b</sup> cells but is not likely to be affected by ablation of <italic>Dct</italic>; see Figures 1 and S6). Lastly, we have performed limited assessment of TCRß surface expression in parallel with Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>tetramer binding – as shown in Figure S3A (and preliminary data, not shown), we saw similar TCR expression levels but distinct Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>tetramer staining on the WT vs <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B and D are the histograms gated on tetramer+ cells?

However, their data do provide strong evidence that high avidity self-reactive cells are deleted by tolerance mechanisms and that the remaining cells are simply lower avidity cells that fall below the threshold for selection.

To clarify, we did not intend to convey that we believe epigenetic regulation is the root cause of tolerance in this system, but simply raised this a possibility among several. We would also note that our definition of “ignorance” appears to differ from that of the reviewer – our usage of the term is based on the concept of T cells that are fully competent to respond to an antigen yet do not encounter it during normal homeostasis. This is similar, for example, to the model described by Ohashi and colleagues in 1991 (Ohashi et al., 1991), in which TCR transgenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells maturing in an animal that also expresses the cognate antigen are neither deleted nor impaired in their response to priming with the same antigen. This is distinct from a case in which the T cells are <italic>unable</italic> to respond to the antigen (due, for example, to their TCRs being too low affinity to be activated). We have included a clarification about how we define the term on p. 7 (starting on line 187).</bold></p><p><bold>Finally, we agree with the reviewer that our data indicate some degree of deletion occurs in WT mice, culling T cells with the highest avidity TCRs for Trp2/K<sup>b</sup> from the repertoire. While this has certainly been observed before, we believe the novelty and impact of our work is to show that this pruning of the TCR repertoire is quite subtle, leading to a largely overlapping peptide/MHC tetramer staining on tolerant and non-tolerant populations which does not become exaggerated during the immune response.

We do not consider this to be a form of “ignorance” – at least with our intended meaning for the term, which we have clarified in the text.

We believe the adoptive transfer studies (Figure 3) argue against recruitment to the site of antigen as a basis for the low numbers of Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific splenocytes observed in WT mice – in those studies, WT donor cells expanded to a similar extent in the spleens of mice that did (WT hosts) and did not (<italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hosts) express the antigen in the skin. The expansion of <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> donor cells in the spleens of WT host mice was in fact increased relative to <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hosts, which is inconsistent with recruitment to the skin depleting the splenic pool of responder cells.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. More detail on the Dct KO strain is needed (schematic showing region deleted, more explanation on generation, whether or not a truncated protein is produced etc)</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We apologize that these details were not provided – a schematic is now shown (Figure S1A), outlining the deleted regions, and details about the generation of the knockout are provided in the methods (p. 23). This knockout allele removes 5 of the 8 coding exons, so we suspect no truncated protein is produced. In any case, the coding sequence for the K<sup>b</sup>-restricted Trp2 epitope (Trp2 180-188) is in the deleted exon 2.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv. Basic phenotyping of d7/8 cells post vaccination is needed, particularly as this has important implications for the vitiligo experiment. Eg. %KLRG1+ vs CD127+KLRG1-, GzmB expression, chemokine receptor expression (CXCR3, CX3CR1), cytokine polyfunctionality (IFNγ/TNFa/IL-2 co-production), degranulation etc. It's likely that the cells transferred in the vitiligo experiments are in different states of effector differentiation given the expansion and avidity differences, which is a major caveat in this experiment that is not considered/discussed. Also, Dct<sup>-/-</sup> CD8s have less competition from endogenous high avidity Trp2-responsive cells in WT mice, so will likely fare better in this transfer system based on Figure 3. Although there was no significant difference in persistence/expansion at d6, they may persist better long-term in this model, and this point should at least be discussed as an explanation for increased disease.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>As mentioned in the public comments, we apologize for the absence of these data. We examined d7 primed WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells by both phenotypic assays and by scRNAseq (Figures S3 and S7). Since the latter provides a more comprehensive assessment of the status of the cells (and also alignment of subpopulations via clustering), we focus on that in the revised manuscript. However, we also show and refer to data regarding most of the phenotypic and functional characteristics mentioned. Overall, and perhaps surprisingly, these data show that by day 7 of TriVax priming the Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific populations in WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are more closely related than they were at day 3 of priming – the scRNAseq data indicates less distinct clusters (although there certainly are still some minor differences in clustering). This conclusion is amplified by phenotyping – we did not see clear differences in the expression of markers associated with activation or anergy/exhaustion between the populations at this time point. In terms of function, we did observe slightly higher Granzyme B gene expression in <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, and we saw a slight but significant increase in polyfunctionality in <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> vs WT cells in ex vivo stimulation assays (in this case, polyfunctional cells made IFN-g and TNFα – we did not see clear production of IL-2, consistent with effector stage cells). The use of KLRG1 as a marker to distinguish short-lived effector- versus memory precursors is difficult in priming with TriVax; as has been published previously, this type of adjuvanted subunit vaccine does not generate a KLRG1<sup>hi</sup> population (Klarquist et al., 2018). We hope these additional data provide a more comprehensive view of the WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cell populations in the late effector phase (these same cells being used for adoptive transfer in the vitiligo studies).</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v. Was there a difference in early skin infiltration of Dct<sup>-/-</sup> derived CD8s in the vitiligo experiments? And did only higher avidity cells make it into the skin? Differences in chemokine receptor/integrin expression downstream of altered differentiation could affect homing capacity.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>These are interesting but technically challenging experiments. We have had success in isolating donor cells from the skin (both the original DNFB-treated and contralateral flanks) from various timepoints in the vitiligo experiments, and we observe overall similar representation of donor WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells (in terms of both percentage of all infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and in terms of numbers). These data suggest that it is not infiltration into the skin per se that limits vitiligo induction by WT donor cells. Studies on the tetramer binding of these cells suggested that recruited cells were modestly increased for tetramer staining relative to splenic cells, but this was similar in WT and <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> donor populations (and directly comparing tetramer staining MFIs on cells extracted from the skin versus those isolated from lymphoid tissues may be difficult). We included these data in Figure S10.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi. Re avidity – although there is no change in relative avidity between the groups, only cells above a certain avidity threshold (~1000 MFI) appear to expand in both groups (compare Figure 2D to 1B). This would suggest that higher avidity cells are preferentially selected for expansion, meaning the statement that there is no selection for high avidity cells is technically incorrect and should be qualified.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We take the reviewer’s point – there is indeed a trend toward increased tetramer staining (often used as a surrogate for TCR avidity) in the Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells during the primary response relative to naïve cells, although it is difficult to know if this is truly a selection for a high-avidity population or relates to the activation state of the cells influencing staining. Regardless, the point of our statement was that there is not a widening gap in terms of the relative tetramer MFIs on <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT cells during the response – i.e., we do not see an <italic>imbalanced</italic> outgrowth of presumed high avidity cells in <italic>Dct<sup>-/-</sup></italic> relative to WT animals. We have clarified this in the discussion.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vii. Figure 1 – FR4 and CD73 should be included for completeness given that they are bona fide anergy markers. Compiled MFIs of all markers in this figure should also be plotted.
