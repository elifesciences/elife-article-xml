Here, we report that <italic>Sass6</italic>-mutant mouse embryos lack centrioles, activate the mitotic surveillance cell death pathway, and arrest at mid-gestation. In contrast, SAS-6 is not required for centriole formation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), but is essential to maintain centriole architecture. Of note, centrioles appeared after just one day of culture of <italic>Sass6</italic>-mutant blastocysts, from which mESCs are derived. Conversely, the number of cells with centrosomes is drastically decreased upon the exit from a mESC pluripotent state. At the mechanistic level, the activity of the master kinase in centriole formation, PLK4, associated with increased centriolar and centrosomal protein levels, endow mESCs with the robustness in using a SAS-6-independent centriole-biogenesis pathway. Collectively, our data suggest a differential requirement for mouse SAS-6 in centriole formation or integrity depending on PLK4 activity and centrosome composition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>mESCs</kwd><kwd>blastocyst</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>53BP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>73111208 - SFB829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bazzi</surname><given-names>Hisham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>331249414 - BA 5810/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bazzi</surname><given-names>Hisham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unlike mouse embryos, mouse embryonic stem cells are able to use a SAS-6-independent pathway for imperfect centriole biogenesis that is associated with a rich centrosomal milieu and robust PLK4 activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proliferating cells rely on stringent controls of cell division fidelity, primarily through the proper assembly, organization, and polarity of the microtubule-based mitotic spindle. In most animal cells, these functions are ensured by centrosomes, the major microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). At the core of centrosomes are the microtubule-based centrioles that are highly conserved in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nabais et al., 2020</xref>). During interphase or upon differentiation, centrioles provide the essential template to form cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>). Cycling cells in G1 have two centrioles whose duplication is controlled by the centriole formation machinery, with the master kinase Polo-Like Kinase 4 (PLK4) regulating the early initiating steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>). Once per cycle, procentrioles assemble on the existing centrioles and form new daughter centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>). The phenotypes of centriole loss vary between organisms and cell types depending on the essential function of centrioles in each context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marshall, 2007</xref>). In humans, various mutations in genes encoding centrosomal and centriolar proteins cause primordial dwarfism and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2014</xref>). In the mouse, centrioles and centrosomes are crucial for embryonic development beyond mid-gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014b</xref>). Null mutations in mouse <italic>Cenpj</italic> (also called <italic>Sas-4</italic>, <italic>Sas4</italic>, <italic>Cpap</italic>), which is essential for centriole formation, lead to the loss of centrioles and arrest by embryonic day (E) 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014a</xref>). The acentriolar cells in the <italic>Cenpj</italic> null embryos activate a cell death pathway that is dependent on 53BP1 (gene name <italic>Trp53bp1</italic>), USP28 (gene name <italic>Usp28</italic>), and p53 (gene name <italic>Trp53</italic>), which is known as the mitotic surveillance pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lambrus and Holland, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Spindle assembly defective protein 6, SAS-6 (named SASS6), a core protein of the centriole biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>), forms the major structural component of the cartwheel, which is the precursor ensuring a ninefold symmetry in centriole assembly and onto which microtubules of the forming procentriole are added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>). SAS-6 consists of a conserved N-terminal head domain and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region that flank a conserved coiled-coil domain whose homodimeric association forms a long tail. Hydrophobic interactions between the head domains of the dimers lead to the assembly of the hub, while the tails form the spokes of the cartwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hilbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kantsadi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshiba et al., 2019</xref>). The loss of SAS-6 in the worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in human cell lines leads to centriole duplication failure and the consequent loss of centrioles, whereas in the algae <italic>C.

To our knowledge, there are currently no reports on the roles of SAS-6 in centriole assembly or integrity in mice or mouse cells. In this study, we asked whether SAS-6 is required for centriole <italic>de novo</italic> formation and duplication during mouse development and in mESCs. Our data show that the loss of SAS-6 in the developing mouse leads to centriole formation failure, activation of the 53BP1-, USP28-, and p53-dependent mitotic surveillance cell death pathway, and arrest of development at mid-gestation (E9.5). In contrast, mESCs without SAS-6 can still form centrioles, which are nonetheless structurally defective and lack the capacity to template cilia. While <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant blastocyst cells acquire centrioles in culture, mESCs exit from pluripotency leads to the loss of centrioles. Our data indicate that mESCs rely on PLK4 activity, and perhaps enriched centrosomal proteins, for their remarkable ability to bypass the requirement for SAS-6 in centriole duplication. Our findings highlight the importance of centrosome composition in centriole duplication, even for what are considered as core-duplication proteins like SAS-6.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutation in mouse <italic>Sass6</italic> leads to embryonic arrest around mid-gestation</title><p>To determine the functions of mouse SAS-6 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate <italic>Sass6</italic> knockout mice by targeting exon 4 (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The cartwheel protein CEP135 has been shown to be important for centriole stability in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayless et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Our data show that centrioles in <italic>Sass6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mESCs exhibit abnormal localization of CEP135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). We speculate that the lack of an initial stable cartwheel scaffold that provides a ninefold symmetry template and the ensuing mis-localization of CEP135 may account for the abnormal centriole architecture and its instability.</p><p>In conclusion, our work provides new fundamental insights into alternative and SAS-6-independent pathways of centriole formation in mammalian cells. It also highlights that mESCs are a special <italic>in vitro</italic> model for centriole biology that can tolerate centriolar aberrations, such as in <italic>Sass6</italic> mutants, or even the loss of centrioles, as in <italic>Cenpj</italic> mutants, without undergoing apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lambrus and Holland, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>).

This is in contrast to <italic>Cenpj</italic> (<italic>Sas-4</italic>) mutant mESCs for example, which lack centrioles (Xiao*, Grzonka* et al., EMBO Reports 2021), and cultured human cell lines without SAS-6, which have been shown to lose centrosomes. Below, we provide a point-by-point response to the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the revisions that have already been incorporated in the transferred manuscript:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The article by M. Grzonka and H. Bazzi entitled: Mouse Sas-6 is required for centriole formation in embryos and integrity in embryonic stem cells, describes new findings in novel mouse models of Sas-6 knockouts (KO). This is an interesting study that reports two different mouse Sas6 KO models and the depletion of Sas6 from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). This type of analysis has never been done before and so it reveals and describes a role for Sas-6 in centriole biogenesis in mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the novelty of our work on the roles of SAS-6 in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors compare their analysis with Sas-4 KO and overall found similar results when compared to previous work from H. Bazzi, when Sas-4 was depleted in mouse embryos. Due to the mitotic stopwatch pathway, Sas6KO embryos die during development at extremely early stages and this can be rescued by depletion in p53 and other members of the pathway.</p><p>Perhaps, not so surprisingly, these embryos do not contain centrioles, showing that in vivo, Sas6 is absolutely required for centriole duplication. More surprisingly, however, in cultures of mESCs, established and propagated in vitro, Sas-6 crispr induced KO, does not result in lack of centrioles. Instead, abnormal structures that show aberrant morphologies, length, and incapacity to assemble cilia were detected. In principle, this means that centrioles can be assembled independently of Sas-6, even if not in the correct manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the reviewer for astutely pointing out the most surprising finding in our data, which is that mESCs lacking SAS-6 can still form centrioles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors interpret these differences as possible differences in the pathways involved in centriole assembly and propose different requirements in different cell types, within the same species.</p><p>I have problems with this interpretation. To me is very difficult to understand, how the &quot;protein&quot; absolutely required for cartwheel assembly at the early stages of centriole biogenesis, can be essential and dispensable at the same time. Although, I may be wrong, I think the authors have not envisage other possibilities to interpret their data, which should be taken into consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that SAS-6 is currently considered in the centrosome field as one of the “core” centriole formation or duplication factors and that it is a major component of the cartwheel scaffold during the early phase of centriole biogenesis. Although, the absence of centrioles in the <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant mouse embryos <italic>in vivo</italic> supports the essential function of SAS-6, and perhaps the cartwheel, in centriole formation; the mere presence of centrioles in mESCs indicates that SAS-6, and again the cartwheel, is not essential for the existence of centrioles in these cells. Because this is a major finding that we would like to bring across from our study, we better highlighted and clarified it in the new version of the manuscript as described below. In fact, in points #4 and #5, we share the same possible explanation for the difference in the phenotypes between <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant mouse embryos and mESCs as the reviewer and we have included them in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) I do not know anything about ESC and ESC cultures. So maybe this is a stupid suggestion. But can't they be derived exactly from the same genetic background of SAS-6KO embryos? Because the way the two (or even 3 as there are 2 mouse KO lines) are generated is different. Why is that?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correctly suggesting that the mESCs can be derived from the <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant blastocysts. We would also like to direct the attention of the reviewer that we have cultured the blastocysts (E3.5) from the <italic>Sass6<sup>em5/em5</sup></italic> mutants, which as we show lack centrioles at E3.5, and the cells indeed start to form centrioles just 24 h post-culture (Figure 5A-D). Given the literature on the essential role for SAS-6 in centriole formation in other cell types, we also generated a more convincing <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null allele in mESCs by deleting the entire ORF of <italic>Sass6</italic> (more on this point below).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer and to build on these findings, we generated and propagated a mESC line from the <italic>Sass6<sup>em5/em5</sup></italic> mutants, together with a Cetn2-eGFP transgene to mark centrioles (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-F). These <italic>Sass6<sup>em5/em5</sup></italic> Cetn2-eGFP–derived mESCs show CETN2-eGFP-positive centrioles, which are largely similar in number and architecture to those in the CRISPR-generated <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null mESCs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-F compared to Figure 3D-H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Still on mESCs, are the authors sure that there are no WT Sas-6 mRNAs still present in their ESC cells?

In FigS2B, I can see a really faint band, very faint but it is there.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the nature of the surprising finding that <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant mESCs can still form centrioles, we understand the concerns and suggestions of this reviewer and the other reviewers in this regard. We have generated several <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant alleles in mESCs (in exons 2, 4 or 5), in which we used Western blots to check whether they were null alleles or not. We used different commercial (Proteintech cat# 21377-1-AP, Sigma-Aldrich cat# HPA028187 and Santa Cruz cat# SC-81431) and non-commercial (kind gift from Renata Basto, Institute Curie) antibodies. The SAS-6 antibody from the Basto lab gave the most reliable and reproducible results. Using this antibody, and in our own interpretation, we were not able to detect SAS-6 by Western blots in <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant mESCs. We concluded that SAS-6 in mESCs (and mouse embryos, see below) is expressed at low levels.</p><p>Surprisingly, we always detected centrioles in the different <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant mESCs, even those derived from the <italic>Sass6<sup>em5/em5</sup></italic> Cetn2-eGFP mutant blastocysts (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-F), which in the blastocysts had no detectable centrioles (Figure 5A).</p><p>For a more definitive knockout in mESCs, we decided to bi-allelically delete the entire <italic>Sass6</italic> ORF DNA from the ATG to the TAA (over 34 Kb of DNA, Figure 3A). According to the central dogma of molecular biology, when there is no DNA, then there should be no mRNA (Figure 3B) and no protein (Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). In confirmation of this premise, RT-PCR data showed that <italic>Sass6</italic> mRNA is not detectable in these <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null mESCs (Figure 3B). Also, Western Blot analyses (Figure 3C) and immunofluorescence analyses (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) did not detect SAS-6 in these cells.</p><p>These <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs started from a single cell and have been passaged more than 30-40 times without losing centrioles. This is how knockouts have been and are produced. If this mutant is still not convincing, then we respectfully ask that the reviewers provide their own suggestion on what will be more convincing. In our humble opinion, this <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs line can be used to test the specificity of the antibodies in mouse cells and not the other way around.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This last point goes also with the western-blot of Figure S2C- there is still a band, very tiny between the two very tick bands (marked with *). Maybe separating proteins better will help visualizing the real Sas-6 band? Have they used the Sas6 ab in other WBs from the KO embryos, for example? Can they use the Sas6 ab in immunostaining to show if the assembled abnormal centrioles completely lack Sas6. This will allow to distinguish between the hypothesis of having some (even if not much) sas6 left?</p></disp-quote><p>The answer to these questions is above in point #2. In addition, we have used the Basto lab antibody for SAS-6 for Western blots on mouse embryos, which detect low levels of SAS-6 in controls and no signal in the mutants (Figure 2B). We also repeated the SAS-6 Western blots on mESCs and achieved better band resolution (Figure 3C). Using this antibody for immunofluorescence showed that the <italic>Sass6<sup>em4/em4</sup></italic> mutant is hypomorphic (Figure 2C, D), whereas the <italic>Sass6<sup>em5/em5</sup></italic> mutant showed very low, most likely background, staining (Figure 2C, D). For mESCs, we decided to delete the entire <italic>Sass6</italic> ORF DNA and generate homozygous <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null mutants as discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Then a more theoretical point? Have the authors considered that the difference is more in the stability of the abnormal structures. Let's say, without a cartwheel and maybe enough PLK4 activity and high level of other centriolar components, the centrioles are abnormally assembled- they have no cartwheel, but they are disassembled very fast in the embryo but not in ESCs?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and share the reviewer’s interpretation for the potential requirement of SAS-6 <italic>in vivo</italic> to stabilize intermediate structures, that is likely compensated for by the richer centrosome composition (Figure 6) and potent PLK4 activity (Figure 7) in mESCs. The new data support this mechanistic interpretation, which was not directly discussed in the first version of the manuscript and is included in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Even if there is a real difference and without Sas-6 ESCs can make centrioles that are abnormal in structure and function (at least at the cilia assemble level), the choice of words &quot;strictly required&quot;, I am not sure it is correct. Because, since Sas-6 is described by many studies as the factor required for cartwheel assembly, which occurs very early in the pathway, this means that in mESCs centrioles can assembled without forming a cartwheel. And so that the cartwheel is actually not required for the initial building block, but more as a structure that maintains the whole centriole in an intact manner?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on the likely requirement of SAS-6, and therefore the cartwheel as a whole, for the symmetry and integrity of the forming centrioles, which is along the same line as in point #4. In our interpretation, “centriole formation” does not necessarily mean centriole “initiation” but rather the ultimate presence of the centriole as a structure. We used more specific wording to match our shared interpretation with the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors mentioned that in flies, abnormal Sas-6 structures have been described in certain cell types. Are these mutants, null mutants? In other words, do these structures assembled in a context of no Sas6 or abnormal Sas-6 protein or even low levels of Sas-6?</p></disp-quote><p>According to the published report (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B in Rodrigues-Martins et al., 2007, PMID: 17689959) the fly brains have no detectable DSAS-6 protein. Therefore, we assume that they are <italic>Sas-6</italic> null fly mutants. The abnormal centrioles in <italic>Sas-6 C. Reinhardtii</italic> mutants and <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs null mutants support the conclusion that the main role of SAS-6, and perhaps the cartwheel, is in maintaining the integrity of the forming procentriole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>I think the 1st sentence of the abstract appears disconnected from the rest.

The authors generated two SASS6 knock-out strains, SASS6 em4/em4 (frameshift deletion, reported as a severe hypomorphic allele), and SASS6 em5-em5 (frameshift deletion, reported as a null allele). Mutant embryos arrest development at mid-gestation unless the p53, USP28 and USP28 pathway is perturbed. As expected, centrioles do not form in SASS6 -/- mice. However, the authors report that de novo formation of centrioles is facilitated in mESC culture conditions for SASS6 CRISPR knock-out mESCs and mESCs derived from SASS6 em5/em5 blastocysts.

While the authors are trying to demonstrate the decrease in centrosome in the Sas-6−/− NPCs, they should show the few cell that have centrosomes or centrosome-like structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We added an example for the minority of cells (less than 10%) that retain centrosomes upon differentiation of <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs into NPCs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cross-consultation comments</p><p>As mentioned in my review; while the Sas6 model is new, it does not provide further evidence of why centriole duplication is important in developing mice aside from it causing an abortive mitosis leading to cell death. The discordant phenotype in the mESCs likely arises from residual Sas6, similar to experiments that were performed in flies with Sas-4 depletion. Moreover, the odd centriole phenotype represents a very small number of cells and is likely phenomenological. In addition, their work from last year demonstrated a clear connection between Cenpj loss leading to the mitotic surveillance pathway activation. They performed double knockouts that partially rescued the survival phenotype. This new work falls short of that publication.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The new publication adds a known component to the list of animal models for centrosome-opathies but fails to provide novel mechanistic insights. Dr. Bazzi's publication on Sas-4 was far more novel at the time of publication due to the multiple mouse crosses that could rescue the phenotypes. The recent publication fails to provide as much evidence or any novel insights into the role of Sas-6 (sufficient to be convincing).</p><p>The audience will be limited to centrosome biologists and even then it may not have enough novelty to be compelling. I would recommend with the revisions to be published in a more specialized journal.</p><p>My expertise lies in genetic causes of microcephaly-associated with mutations in centrosome encoding proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for taking the time to evaluate our work and provide helpful comments and suggestions. We would like to emphasize that even if a certain phenotype is expected, the experiment has to be performed to test the hypothesis, which is the case with the <italic>Sass6</italic> mutant embryos phenocopying the <italic>Cenpj</italic> mutants. In our opinion, the novelty of our work goes beyond the <italic>in vivo</italic> knockout and analyses of <italic>Sass6</italic> mouse embryo mutants to the ability of <italic>Sass6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> null mESCs to form centrioles. This surprising finding opens new avenues of investigation into the precise roles of SAS-6, the cartwheel, centrosome composition and thresholds of PLK4 activity in centriole biogenesis. We are confident that our study will provide a compelling evidence to re-examine these roles in other cell types and organisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of analyses that authors prefer not to carry out</p></disp-quote><p>We performed almost all of the analyses requested by the reviewers and added more mechanistic data to our study as elaborated above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
