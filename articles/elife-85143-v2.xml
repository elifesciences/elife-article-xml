Although crowding has implications for many everyday tasks and the tremendous amounts of research reflect its importance, surprisingly little is known about how depth affects crowding. Most available studies show that stereoscopic disparity reduces crowding, indicating that crowding may be relatively unimportant in three-dimensional environments. However, most previous studies tested only small stereoscopic differences in depth in which disparity, defocus blur, and accommodation are inconsistent with the real world. Using a novel multi-depth plane display, this study investigated how large (0.54–2.25 diopters), real differences in target-flanker depth, representative of those experienced between many objects in the real world, affect crowding. Our findings show that large differences in target-flanker depth increased crowding in the majority of observers, contrary to previous work showing reduced crowding in the presence of small depth differences. Furthermore, when the target was at fixation depth, crowding was generally more pronounced when the flankers were behind the target as opposed to in front of it. However, when the flankers were at fixation depth, crowding was generally more pronounced when the target was behind the flankers. These findings suggest that crowding from clutter outside the limits of binocular fusion can still have a significant impact on object recognition and visual perception in the peripheral field.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>While human eyesight is clearest at the point where the gaze is focused, peripheral vision makes objects to the side visible. This ability to detect movement and objects in a wider field of vision helps people to have a greater awareness of their surroundings. However, it is more difficult to identify an object using peripheral vision when it is surrounded by other items. This phenomenon is known as crowding and can affect many aspects of daily life, such as driving or spotting a friend in a crowd.</p><p>In our three-dimensional world, peripheral objects are often at different distances. This variation in depth could influence the effect of crowding, yet little is known about its effect. While previous research has investigated the effect of small differences in depth on crowding, the studies did not replicate real-world conditions.</p><p>To replicate depths that are likely to be encountered in the real world, Smithers et al. created a display using multiple screens positioned 0.4, 1.26 and 4 meters from the viewer. Images were displayed on the screens and researchers measured how well study participants could identify a target image when it was surrounded by similar, nearby images displayed closer or further away than the target. The experiments showed that most viewers are less able to recognize a target object when there are surrounding items and this effect is worsened when the items are separated from the object by large differences in depth.</p><p>The findings show that instead of diminishing the effect of crowding – as suggested by previous studies with small depth differences – large depth differences that more closely recreate those encountered in the real world can amplify the effect of crowding. This greater understanding of how humans process objects in three-dimensional environments could help to better estimate the impact of crowding on people with eye and neurological disorders. In turn, the information could be used to design environments that are easier for such individuals to navigate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual crowding</kwd><kwd>depth perception</kwd><kwd>object recognition</kwd><kwd>diplopia</kwd><kwd>peripheral vision</kwd><kwd>multi-depth plane display</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY032162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bex</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Visual crowding from clutter outside the limits of binocular fusion can still have a significant impact on object recognition and visual perception in the peripheral field.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visual crowding is a phenomenon in which a peripherally viewed object, that is easily identifiable in isolation, becomes harder to recognize or identify when it is surrounded by other objects, despite still being clearly visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouma, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herzog et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pelli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitney and Levi, 2011</xref>). The importance of crowding is reflected by the tremendous amount of research on the topic and it has been extensively reviewed over the years (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coates et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herzog et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manassi and Whitney, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pelli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strasburger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitney and Levi, 2011</xref>). This high level of interest is not surprising given that the natural environment is usually cluttered and mostly viewed in the peripheral visual field. Consequently, it is assumed that crowding has a large impact on our daily lives with implications for many everyday visual tasks including driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xia et al., 2020</xref>), reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Legge, 2007</xref>), and face recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalpadakis-Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Louie et al., 2007</xref>). Crowding also has important clinical implications for people with glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ogata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shamsi et al., 2022</xref>), as well as for other disorders including central vision impairment (e.g. macular degeneration), amblyopia and dyslexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitney and Levi, 2011</xref>). Through this body of research, we have been able to build a good understanding of the factors that mediate and moderate crowding and develop unifying theories (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison and Bex, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keshvari and Rosenholtz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van den Berg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van den Berg et al., 2010</xref>). However, despite the large body of literature, one area that remains surprisingly understudied is how depth affects crowding. This is important because we live in a three-dimensional environment and so to understand the significance of crowding in the real world it is essential to understand the role of depth information.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kooi et al., 1994</xref> were the first to investigate how depth influences crowding. The authors found that compared to when a peripheral target and flankers were at the same depth, there was a release from crowding when the target and flankers were stereoscopically presented in crossed (front) and uncrossed (behind) disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kooi et al., 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sayim et al., 2008</xref> found that when flankers were at fixation depth, there was less foveal crowding when the target was stereoscopically presented in front or behind the flankers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felisberti et al., 2005</xref> also found an effect of depth on crowding in the parafovea, but to a more limited extent. They reported a release from crowding in two out of three subjects when the target appeared behind the flankers, but only in one of the three subjects when the target was in front of the flankers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felisberti et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref> extended on previous research by testing the effect of depth on crowding over a range of stereoscopically produced target-flanker disparities (±800 arcsec). In line with previous studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref> found that when the target was at fixation depth, increasing target-flanker disparity systematically reduced crowding. They also found that the release from crowding was asymmetric whereby crowding was greater when the flankers were in front of the target compared to behind it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Taken together these studies appear to paint the picture that a difference in depth between a target and flankers reduces crowding. This could challenge the concept that crowding is ubiquitous in three-dimensional natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitney and Levi, 2011</xref>) because it implies that depth differences between natural objects could prevent crowding from being a problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, all the above studies tested only small depth differences between target and flankers that do not reflect the often-large differences in depth between objects in the real world. Furthermore, the generalizability of these studies to real world depth is also limited by the fact that depth cues were generated stereoscopically. One potential problem with stereo displays is that disparity information often does not match with accommodation or defocus blur which can detrimentally affect depth perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watt et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Example of crowding in a simulated everyday scene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When fixating on the red dot above the horizon, it is relatively easy to spot and recognize the person crossing on the right. However, it is more difficult, or impossible, to recognize the person about to cross the road on the left because of the presence of nearby signs. Images like this one are often used to illustrate how crowding is ubiquitous in everyday natural scenes. (<bold>B</bold>) However, in real life the two signs and the person on the left may be several meters apart and so each would appear at a different depth from the observer. Currently, little is known about how large, real differences in depth between objects affect crowding.

All four studies used two orthogonally positioned screens viewed through a half-transparent mirror allowing stimuli to be displayed on two different depth planes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eberhardt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2017</xref> kept a target and flankers at the same depth and presented them 0.06 diopters (i.e. 1/focal length in meters), in front, behind or at the same depth as fixation. The authors found that this small difference in depth between the stimuli and fixation planes had no effect on the amount of crowding compared to when everything was presented at the fixation plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2019</xref> repeated and expanded on this work with the addition of a ±0.1 diopter depth difference between fixation and the stimuli in addition to the ±0.06 diopter condition. The results showed that crowding was greater when the stimuli were furthest from fixation compared to when they were closer to fixation, regardless of whether the stimuli were in front or behind the fixation plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2019</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref> used the same approach to investigate the effect of depth on crowding when the target and flankers were separated in depth. When flanker depth was varied while the target was at fixation depth, crowding increased with increasing target-flanker depth difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref>). This result is the opposite to the findings of other studies in which small differences in depth between the target and flankers were introduced with stereoscopic disparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felisberti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kooi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sayim et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the authors also found that when flanker depth was varied while the target was at fixation depth, crowding was greater when the flankers were behind the target and fixation compared to in front of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref>). When target depth was varied while the flankers were at fixation, there was more crowding when the target was in front of the flankers and fixation compared to when it was behind them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In light of the above discrepancies, and the prevalence of depth information in real world scenes, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of how visual crowding is affected by depth differences representative of those experienced between objects in the real world. Therefore, using a novel multi-depth plane display consisting of screens at 0.4 m (near screen), 1.26 m (mid screen), and 4 m (far screen) viewing distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we investigate how crowding is affected by large, real differences in target-flanker depth. These viewing distances were chosen because 4 m is close to optical infinity while 0.4 m is the clinical standard for near distance, with 1.26 m being in the middle of these two extremes in log units. Given in diopters, the near, mid, and far screens were at 2.5 diopters, 0.79 diopters and 0.25 diopters receptively.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the multi-depth plane display setup used for this study.</title><p>The near and mid screens consisted of transparent acrylic covered with ClearBright display film (see Methods for details) that enabled projected images to be displayed on to the screens while preserving their transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). This enabled observers to simultaneously view adjacent stimuli presented at different depth planes at the same time. The screens were temporally synchronized and spatially aligned (see Methods) to ensure display timing and position were consistent across the three depth planes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85143-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For the main study, naive observers were tasked with reporting the orientation of a peripherally viewed target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in a series of five experiments (see Methods for details and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for example trial). The target was surrounded by a flanker ring with a target-flanker spacing of 5°, 2.5°, 1.25°, 0.625°, or infinity, i.e., no flanker ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In Experiments 1 and 2, the target was always presented at fixation depth while the depth of the flanker ring was varied. Conversely, in Experiments 3 and 4 the flanker ring was presented at fixation depth while target depth was varied. Finally, for Experiment 5, the target, flanker ring and fixation were presented together on the same screen at three different depths. To quantify crowding for each stimulus condition we used the reported target orientation across repeated trials to calculate perceptual error (see Methods), which is reported in degrees.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of experimental stimuli and fixation marker.</title><p>In all conditions, except the no-flanker condition, the randomly orientated target (a white Landolt-C) was surrounded by a white flanker ring at one of four possible target-flanker distances.

Therefore, in all experiments except Experiment 5, observers were also asked to report the perceived location of the target relative to the position of the flanker ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

This raises questions about whether the variation is because the effects of depth are highly variable between some observers, or because the naive observers were not very stable at indicating their perception. The latter could be due to the naive observers being relatively inexperienced at the task, despite receiving training, since each observer only participated in a single experiment. Therefore, to investigate the effects of depth at the individual level we repeated the study with a small number of highly trained, experienced observers who performed all five experiments (see Methods for details).</p><sec id="s2-6-1"><title>Target always at fixation depth with variable flanker depth</title><sec id="s2-6-1-1"><title>Experiments 1 and 2 with experienced observers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure suppliments 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>)</title><p>The small sample size means direct comparisons between these results and the results reported above for the main study should be avoided.

However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> shows that even among highly trained, experienced observers there is a large amount of variation both between and within subjects. For instance, when the target and fixation are on the near screen (0.4 m) and target-flanker spacing is 0.625°, ES3 and ES4 both exhibit a similar increase in perceptual error with increasing flanker depth, which is consistent with the overall effect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. In contrast, ES2 shows the opposite trend for the same stimulus condition, a reduction in perceptual error with increased flanker depth.

Overall, perceptual error was higher when the target or flanker ring were presented at a different depth from the other and from fixation. The greatest differences in perceptual error among the different depth conditions occurred when the target or flanker ring were presented behind fixation depth. In contrast, when the target or flanker ring were presented in front of fixation depth, the differences in perceptual error among depth conditions were notably smaller. The results also show that when the target, flanker ring and fixation were all at the same depth plane, crowding tended to increase with the absolute distance of the stimuli from the observer. However, in all the main experiments with naive observers there was a large amount of variation within the data. Follow up experiments with a small sample of highly trained, experienced observers were largely consistent with the main effects observed in the main study. Moreover, the experienced observers also exhibited a high degree of between subject variation, which supports the suggestion that the variability in the main data from the large sample of naive observers is representative of the natural variation between different individuals. Therefore, although significant effects were found at the population level, the effects of large differences in target-flanker depth can be highly variable at the individual level. This demonstrates the importance of using a large sample size to investigate effects that are not necessarily detectable at the individual level. The discussion of the findings will focus on the overall results from the main study on naive participants, with the findings from the small sample of experienced observers used to provide additional context and insight.</p><p>The main finding that a depth difference between the flankers and the target led to an increase, rather than a decrease, in perceptual error is different from the findings of several previous studies that investigated the effect of depth on crowding using a stereoscopic presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felisberti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kooi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sayim et al., 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref> found that when the target was presented at fixation depth (comparable to Experiments 1 and 2 in our study), increasing the disparity between the target and flankers resulted in less crowding, and ultimately a complete release from crowding. The authors also reported that crowding was greater when flankers were presented in crossed disparity (in front of the target and fixation), compared to uncrossed disparity (behind the target and fixation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, when the flankers were presented at fixation depth (comparable to Experiments 3 and 4 in our study), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sayim et al., 2008</xref> found that foveal crowding was lower when the target was presented in front of or behind the flankers and fixation.</p><p>Several explanations for crowding have been proposed in which crowding occurs because target and flanking features are inappropriately grouped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banks et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzog and Manassi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pachai et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this explanation, crowding can be alleviated when the flankers are grouped together and segmented from the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzog and Manassi, 2015</xref>). One piece of evidence in support of this account is the reduction of crowding that can occur when flankers are presented at a different depth from the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felisberti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kooi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sayim et al., 2008</xref>). Our results challenge this view of crowding because it would predict that increasing the depth difference between target and flankers would decrease the probability of them being inappropriately grouped and increase the probability of the flankers being segmented from the target, thereby decreasing perceptual error, the opposite of our finding. Other models of crowding, such as texture processing and feature integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman and Simoncelli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parkes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van den Berg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wallis and Bex, 2012</xref>), sampling errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ester et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ester et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison and Bex, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrison and Bex, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison and Bex, 2015</xref>), attentional resolution limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 1996</xref>) or saccade properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nandy and Tjan, 2012</xref>) are agnostic concerning the influence of depth differences among targets and flankers. Therefore, each of these models would require modification to explain the increase in crowding that we observe with large real depth differences between a target and its flankers.</p><p>In contrast with studies that controlled depth with small stereoscopic disparities, our results do agree with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref> who also used a real-depth display and tested larger differences in depth between the target and flankers than previous studies had examined, though depth differences were still much smaller than those tested in our current study. When the target was at fixation depth (comparable to Experiments 1 and 2 in our study), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref> found that crowding increased with increasing target-flanker depth difference. The authors also found that crowding was greater when the flankers were behind the target and fixation compared to in front of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref>). Our findings from Experiments 1 and 2 are consistent with these results. However, when the flankers were at fixation depth (comparable to Experiments 3 and 4 in our study), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref> found that crowding was higher when the target was in front of the flankers and fixation compared to when it was behind them. In contrast, in Experiments 3 and 4 we found that perceptual error was greatest when the target was presented behind the flanker ring and fixation rather than in front of it. This difference is likely due to a combination of high defocus blur when the target was behind fixation combined with the finding from Experiment 5 which found that in our study a larger absolute distance from the observer resulted in higher perceptual error.</p><p>Why the inconsistencies across studies? It is important to consider that most of the previous studies used very small depth differences, the largest being 0.1 diopters in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref>. In comparison, the depth difference in our study ranged from 0.54 diopters (between the mid and far screens) to 2.25 diopters (between the near and far screens). Our results, together with those from previous studies, suggest that small differences in depth between the target and flankers reduce crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felisberti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kooi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sayim et al., 2008</xref>), while larger differences in depth can increase it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2020</xref> and results from our study). Although this pattern is quite surprising, there is precedent for non-linear effects of depth on perceptual processing outside the crowding literature. In a multiple object tracking task, when the targets and distractors were distributed equally on two depth planes, tracking accuracy was better than the accuracy during trials in which targets and distractors appeared on a single depth plane when the depth difference between planes was small (~6 cm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ur Rehman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Viswanathan and Mingolla, 2002</xref>), but worse when the depth difference between planes was large (50 cm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ur Rehman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How could depth affect perception in this nonlinear way? The geometry of the eyes and the 3D environment create interocular disparity differences between the images in each eye. When corresponding features in the images in each eye can be identified, the images can be fused to generate a binocular perceptual experience of depth (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nityananda and Read, 2017</xref>). There is a horizontal and vertical spatial limit to the interocular disparity difference over which the visual system attempts to identify corresponding retinal points in order to fuse different 2D interocular images as a single 3D object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Westheimer, 1979</xref>). This 2D spatial correspondence limit creates a 3D volume along the horopter known as Panum’s Fusional Area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Panum, 1858</xref>). Outside Panum’s Fusional Area, there is a loss of stereoscopic depth perception and either double vision (diplopia) may be experienced, or single vision may occur if the image from one eye is partly suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Georgeson and Wallis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ono et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spiegel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stidwill and Fletcher, 2010</xref>). The spatial extent of Panum’s Fusional Area depends on the spatial frequency of the stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maiello et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pulliam, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reynaud and Hess, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilcox and Allison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang and Blake, 1991</xref>) and increases with eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton and Kertesz, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrold and Grove, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that differences between fusion and depth perception within Panum’s Fusional Area versus diplopia, and/or local suppression for single vision, outside of it can explain the patterns of results observed between studies. Small disparity differences between target and flankers create differences in perceived depth that can alleviate the effects of crowding, potentially through ungrouping of target and flanking elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herzog et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzog and Manassi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manassi et al., 2012</xref>) or by independent processing of target and flankers in different depth-selective channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Norcia et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pulliam, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reynaud and Hess, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tyler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilcox and Allison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang and Blake, 1991</xref>) by any of the computational models of crowding based on texture processing and feature integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman and Simoncelli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parkes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van den Berg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wallis and Bex, 2012</xref>), sampling errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ester et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ester et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison and Bex, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrison and Bex, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison and Bex, 2015</xref>) attentional resolution limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 1996</xref>) or saccade properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nandy and Tjan, 2012</xref>). Large interocular disparity differences on the other hand can induce diplopia that could increase the perceived number of flankers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberhardt and Huckauf, 2019</xref>). In theory, this perceived increase in the number of flanking elements could result in higher perceptual error because increasing the number of flankers is known to increase crowding under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chanceaux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manassi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pluháček et al., 2021</xref>). It is however worth noting that the opposite can occur, that is reduced crowding with increasing number of flankers, in cases where the additional flankers are grouped together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manassi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manassi et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, when asked, only a few of the naive observers reported experiencing diplopia, and those that did reported only experiencing it in a minority of presentations for which they selected the ‘unsure or no ring’ option (see Methods) when reporting the perceived location of the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2E</xref>). However, among the four experienced observers, three verbally reported experiencing diplopia during some of the conditions for which they either selected the ‘unsure or no ring’ option (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2E</xref>), or in cases when the diplopia was barely visible, they chose the option that was the closest match to the clearest stimulus image. The fact that the experienced observers were more likely to report experiencing diplopia, possibly because they were better at recognizing it, raises the possibility that diplopia may have been more common among the naive observers than was indicated by asking them. However, it is worth noting that one of the four experienced observers reported that they never experienced diplopia in any of the experiments, which is more consistent with the majority of naive observers. It is possible that the short presentation time of the stimulus was too fast for most observers to notice diplopia consciously (i.e. diplopia did not enter awareness), or that diplopia was suppressed entirely by local suppression to maintain single vision. Attention effects such as inattentional blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bredemeier and Simons, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simons and Chabris, 1999</xref>) could also play a role in explaining why so few observers reported diplopia in the main experiments. There is conflicting evidence as to whether conscious awareness of a flanker is necessary for it to induce crowding (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho and Cheung, 2011</xref> vs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wallis and Bex, 2011</xref>), and thus whether ‘unconscious diplopia’ could have increased crowding in this study due to the reason highlighted above is a matter for debate and beyond the scope of our findings. In addition, it is worth noting that due to the lack of binocular fusion of stimulus areas outside Panum’s Fusional Area, we can’t rule out the possible involvement of binocular rivalry which has been shown to interfere with object recognition not just in isolation but also when combined with crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another explanation for higher perceptual error with increasing target-flanker depth differences could be perceived target misalignment. As explained in the Methods, at the start of Experiments 1–4 each observer performed a subjective spatial calibration to ensure that the angular positions of the stimuli and fixation point relative to primary gaze were consistent across all three depth planes. Although the main experiments were performed under binocular viewing conditions, this spatial calibration had to be performed monocularly using the observer’s dominant eye to avoid confusion caused by diplopia or rivalry (see Methods). This means that the screens were imperfectly aligned for the non-dominant eye. Therefore, as in the real world, at certain flanker sizes and separations there may be occlusions between target and flanker features that could affect target report accuracy, which is not the same mechanism as crowding. In our study, such misalignment could result from local suppression of the calibrated eye to maintain single vision, and/or head movements following the spatial calibration. To examine how target misalignment affected the overall results, we recalculated perceptual error for the main experiments with naive observers using only trials in which the observer reported seeing the target inside the flanker ring. We then reanalyzed these data the same way as for perceptual error calculated from the full data set (see Methods). Apart from Experiment 2, the effect of flanker and/or target depth remained statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for plots and analysis results). Therefore, across the majority of experiments, misalignment or occlusion of the target by the flanker ring is not enough to explain the overall results. This supports the suggestion that the increase in perceptual error when the target and flankers are at different depths is being driven by an increase in crowding.</p><p>This current study is the first to investigate how crowding is affected by large, real differences in depth between a target and flanking features. This is important because objects in the real world are often flanked by visual features that vary greatly in their distance from an observer, and many will fall outside the limits of Panum’s Fusional Area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A limitation of our approach is that the use of relatively simple stimuli in a tightly controlled experiment limits the generalizability of our findings to the real world where clutter is abundant and more complex. Future research should therefore aim to utilize stimuli that better capture the complexity and heterogeneity of natural scenes. Future work should also investigate if the reported effects of depth on crowding in our study hold at different target eccentricities, particularly given that the range of Panum’s Fusional Area changes with eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton and Kertesz, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrold and Grove, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, our findings still show that crowding from clutter outside Panum’s Fusional Area has the potential to significantly impact object recognition and visual perception in the peripheral field. Our findings therefore do not support the view that depth differences between targets and flankers necessarily reduce crowding, instead the effect of depth on crowding appears to be more complex than originally thought. Furthermore, data collected from experienced participants shows that the overall trends at the population level may not always be apparent at the individual level. Nonetheless, our results, alongside those of previous studies, suggest that small differences in depth between targets and flankers do not have the same effect on crowding as larger differences in depth in which either the target or flankers are presented outside the limits of binocular fusion. This finding confirms the potential importance and relevance of crowding in three-dimensional scenes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subject recruitment</title><p>For the main study, a total of 110 naive subjects were recruited from the Northeastern University undergraduate population in exchange for course credit as compensation for their time.

For the far screen, we used an ultra-short throw projector (Bomaker Polaris 4 K Laser Projector) projected onto a 240 cm x 250 cm white wall at the end of the room at a throw distance (measured horizontally from the projector to the wall) of approximately 50 cm. The mid and near screens were made from 101.5 cm x 76 cm and 46 cm x 36.5 cm clear 5 mm acrylic, respectively, held in position by a frame constructed from extruded aluminum rails. The transparent acrylic was covered on one side with ClearBright transparent display film (Lux Labs Inc, Boston, MA, USA). The nanoparticle film enabled us to display images from two projectors (InFocus IN3116) onto the near and mid screens while preserving their transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). This design enables observers to simultaneously view adjacent stimuli presented on all three depth planes at the same time. The throw distances of the near and mid screen projectors (measured from the projector to the bottom of the screen) were approximately 72 cm and approximately 150 cm, respectively. Both projectors were positioned and angled so that projected light that passed through the transparent screens did not fall upon the observer or any areas visible by the observer, such as an adjacent screen. Key stoning was used to digitally correct distortions in the image caused by the projection angle of the near and mid screen projectors. The screens were temporally synchronized and spatially aligned to ensure display timing and position were consistent across the three depth planes.

With their head in the chin and head rest, observers were instructed to sequentially position a series of targets so that they were in the same position as a fixed reference target that was displayed on the reference screen. The calibration was performed under monocular conditions using the observer’s dominant eye as determined by the Miles test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miles, 1929</xref>). The calibration was performed monocularly because during a preliminary experiment subjects reported finding the task too difficult to complete under binocular conditions (e.g., because of diplopia, an issue that is considered further in the Discussion section). For Experiment 5, the spatial calibration was performed by the experimenter prior to the experiment using a webcam positioned at the observer’s cyclopean point.

The target was a white Landolt-C displayed against a black background at 10° eccentricity to the right or left of the fixation point at primary gaze. Following the structure of a Landolt-C optotype, the target was 1° in diameter with a 0.25° line width and a 0.25° opening. The opening orientation of the target was random each trial, drawn from a uniform 360° distribution. The target was surrounded by a white flanker ring formed of four circular arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In each depth combination described below, the outer edge of the target was separated from the inner edge of the flanker ring by 5°, 2.5°, 1.25° or 0.625°. These distances of separation represented 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 of the target eccentricity, respectively. Note that for the experiments conducted with the four experienced subjects, the 5° target-flanker eccentricity condition was not included. The line width and size of the four gaps in the flanker ring were kept constant (0.25°). For each target depth, a control condition with no flanker ring was also included. The fixation point consisted of a 1° white circle with a black cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This design was used because it has been reported to elicit more stable fixation compared to a plain circle or cross hair alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thaler et al., 2013</xref>). The background on all screens was always set to the lowest RGB (i.e. <italic>R</italic>=G=B=0) value which was transparent on the near and mid screens, and black on the far screen. Since the mid screen was dimmest (<italic>R</italic>=G=B=255, white = 13.56 cd/m<sup>2</sup>), the luminance of stimuli displayed on the near and far screens were calibrated to match the luminance of the mid screen using a Photo Research PR-650 spectroradiometer (Photo Research, Chatsworth, CA, USA). The room lights were switched off for the duration of the experiment.</p><p>A summary of the stimulus conditions tested in each experiment is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. In Experiment 1, the target and fixation point were always on the mid screen while the flanker ring was displayed in front, behind or at fixation depth. In Experiment 2, the target and fixation point were presented on the near or far screen while the depth of the flanker ring was varied. Experiments 3 and 4 were the same as Experiments 1 and 2 respectively except that the flanker ring was presented at fixation depth while the target depth was varied. For Experiment 5, the target, flanker ring and fixation were presented together on the same screen at three different depths. This was to investigate whether there was an effect of absolute viewing distance on crowding. Each condition was repeated 10 times in Experiments 1, 2, 3 and 5 and eight times in Experiment 4, with equal number of repeats on either side of the fixation point. The order of testing was randomized.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of the stimulus conditions in each experiment.

rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Briefly, at the start of each trial, observers were instructed to focus on the central fixation point. The fixation point appeared on the fixation screen 1 s before stimulus onset in Experiments 1, 3 and 5, and 1.5 s before stimulus onset in Experiments 2 and 4. The fixation point was displayed for slightly longer before stimulus onset in Experiments 2 and 4 to ensure that observers had adequate time to refocus on the fixation point when it switched between the near and far screens. The target and flanker ring (if present) were displayed for 0.25 s. The fixation point remained on the screen for 1 s before being replaced by a randomly oriented Landolt-C that was the same size as the target Landolt-C. The observer used the mouse to rotate this Landolt-C until it matched the perceived orientation of the target and then clicked to report the orientation.</p><p>In all experiments except Experiment 5, observers were also asked to report the perceived location of the target relative to the position of the flanker ring. There were five options to choose from, ‘target in center of ring’, ‘target inside ring but not in the center’, ‘ring obstructs target’, ‘target outside ring’, and ‘unsure or no ring’. Observers were instructed to select the option that most closely matched how they perceived the stimulus. If an observer missed the stimulus or they were unsure of the targets’ location relative to the flanker ring, for example, because of confusion caused by diplopia, they were instructed to select the ‘unsure or no ring’ option. Collecting data on the perceived target-flanker location enabled us to examine how differences in target-flanker depth influenced the perception of the stimulus and investigate the potential effect that factors such as target misalignment and possible diplopia may have had on perceptual error (see Discussion). Following this selection, the next trial started immediately.</p><p>Before starting an experiment, all participants underwent training during which they completed as many practice trials as they needed to familiarize themselves with the task. The main experiment only began once the researcher running the study was confident that the participant understood the task and was able to perform it correctly. These practice trials did not contribute to the collected data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data processing and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Perceptual error</title><p>To quantify crowding for each stimulus condition, we first calculated the report error for each presentation, that is, the angular difference between the reported gap orientation of the target and the actual gap orientation. For each subject, this generated 10 report errors per stimulus condition in Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 5, and eight per stimulus condition in Experiment 4. We then used these report errors to calculate the circular standard deviation for each stimulus condition using the Circular Statistics Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berens, 2009</xref>) in MATLAB R2022a (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). We refer to this measure as perceptual error, which is reported in degrees.</p><p>For the main study with naive observers, the effects of target/flanker depth and target-flanker spacing on perceptual error were analyzed using mixed effects multiple linear regression, fitted using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">R Development Core Team, 2022</xref>). Perceptual error was used as the response (dependent) variable after being natural log transformed to correct for positive skew. For all five experiments, we included target-flanker spacing as a fixed effect. We also included flanker depth for Experiments 1 and 2, target depth for Experiments 3 and 4 or target-flanker-fixation depth for Experiment 5. Target-fixation depth or flanker-fixation depth were also included as a third fixed effect for Experiments 2 and 4, respectively. All possible pairwise interactions of fixed effects were fitted in the full model. Subject identification (ID) was included as a random effect in all experiments to control for repeated measures. We first used model simplification, whereby models were compared with one another using a likelihood ratio test (LRT), to remove non-significant interactions sequentially. This enabled us to test the effect of individual fixed effects that were not involved in an interaction. We then used the minimum model (i.e. model containing all fixed effects of interest plus any significant two-way interactions) to report the significance of each main effect or significant interaction(s) by using a LRT to compare the minimum model with the same model but with the effect/interaction of interest removed. Individual main effects that were part of a significant interaction were not tested in this way because their effect was dependent on another variable. Note that data for the control condition (i.e. no flanker ring) were excluded from statistical analysis. This was to ensure that (a) the fixed effects remained independent and (b) the effect of having no flanker ring did not mask the effect of flanker and target depth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Perceived target position relative to flanker ring</title><p>We used the observers’ perceived target position relative to the flanker ring to calculate the proportion of trials in which observers reported seeing the target inside the flanker ring (i.e. they chose either ‘target in center of ring’ or ‘target inside ring but not in the center’). For statistical analysis, these data were treated as a binary response variable whereby trials in which observers reported seeing the target inside the flanker ring were assigned a value of 1 while all other trials (i.e. those for which the observer chose ‘ring obstructs target’, ‘target outside ring’ or ‘unsure or no ring’) were assigned a value of 0.</p><p>For the main study with naive observers, these data were then analyzed using mixed effects binary logistic regression, fitted using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">R Development Core Team, 2022</xref>). We used the DHARMa package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartig, 2022</xref>) to run residual diagnostics that are often overlooked in logistic regression. Perceived target position was used as the binary response variable (i.e. 1=target inside ring and 0=target not inside ring). The fixed effects and pairwise interactions for each experiment were the same as those described above for the analysis of perceptual error. Subject ID was included as a random effect in all experiments to control for repeated measures. Model simplification (to remove non-significant interactions) and significance testing was the same as described above for the analysis of perceptual error. Data for the control condition (i.e., no flanker ring) were excluded from statistical analysis for the same reasons as those outlined above. The separate results showing the proportion of trials for which observers chose each of the five choices for perceived target position relative to the flanker ring can be found in the figure supplements (see Results).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The experimental procedure was approved by the institutional review board at Northeastern University (IRB #14-09-16) and the experiments were performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Marisa Carrasco as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Chris Baker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) In general, there are some interactions that were reported, and others that were not reported, but it would be important to know if they are significant (pages 15-16). For example, when the target is at fixation and the target is at a variable flanker depth: In Experiment 1, was there a significant interaction between (a) target-fixation depth and flanker depth (in front versus behind) and (b) target-fixation depth and target-flanker spacing? In Experiment 3, it is reported that perceptual error was higher when the target was in from or behind the flanker ring and fixation and that the greatest perceptual error occurred when the target was behind, but it is not reported if this interaction was significant. Its presence if important to know whether the data should be independently analyzed for 'in front' and 'behind'. In Experiment 5, was the interaction between target-flanker spacing and depth significant?</p><p>2) The findings are clear but the explanation(s) for the findings is not. The authors state that large interocular disparity differences likely induce diplopia, which could increase perceptual error by increasing the number of features. The authors should explain what they mean by features and how an increased perceived number of features would increase crowding. Moreover, the authors acknowledge that only a few observers reported experiencing diplopia; however, they speculate that observers may have experienced diplopia but not noticed it consciously given the short stimulus presentation time.</p><p>3) At several points in the paper authors refer to the 'natural three-dimensional scenes'. Indeed, the authors increase the ecological validity of their experiment by introducing actual depth differences, therefore allowing for depth cues such as accommodation, vergence and defocus blur. This is indeed a significant improvement over previous studies. However, they still use relatively impoverished visual stimuli in a tightly controlled psychophysical experiment requiring head stabilization by means of a chin rest. So, their experiment is still far removed from deploying actual, ecologically valid, conditions. Consequently, their stimuli mostly lack the complexity and associated clutter of natural stimuli as well as other potential depth cues that an observer might gain from parallax, aerial perspective, lighting, or shading. Therefore, their suggestion &quot;that crowding has a more significant impact on our perception of natural three-dimensional environments than previously estimated with 2D displays.&quot; is stretching what can be concluded from their present work. Please temper these comments.</p><p>4) The inclusion of a large number of participants, in which none of the participants seemed to have performed all the conditions, is both a strength and a potential weakness. Their current approach of including (presumably) naive participants and having each do a portion of the experiments in itself is valid. But it also adds to the complexity of their study and presumably adds variability to their data.</p><p>Including data from a few well-trained participants (some of which could be the authors) performing all the conditions would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– (lines 205-206) any reason why fixation time differed between Experiments 1, 3, and 5 and Experiments 2 and 4?</p><p>– (line 217) the authors state that participants underwent training, but they do not specify either how many trials or whether there was a criterion in performance that observers should reach before starting the experiments.</p><p>– It would be useful if the axes in the Supplementary figure were the same as in the related main figures.</p><p>– The authors may want to discuss whether they think their findings would hold at different eccentricities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors measure but do not introduce nor discuss well why they analyze the &quot;proportion of trials in which observers reported seeing the target inside the flanker ring&quot; as an additional dependent variable. This only becomes somewhat clear in the discussion. Here, the usage of this variable as a control variable to discuss the effect of target misalignment on perceptual error becomes clear and useful to interpret the results. However, a much better explanation is needed for why this variable is analyzed as a dependent variable and how this analysis informs about the difference in target-flanker depth on crowding. One may even wonder why the corrected analysis is not treated as the main analysis (as there are good reasons for this control), and the analysis on the unfiltered data in the SI.</p><p>2. Following up from weakness 1, the authors should discuss in more detail how these real-world aspects and cues may affect crowding introduced by objects presented at different depth differences. Moreover, they should discuss how this would affect their suggested implication &quot;that crowding has a more significant impact on our perception of natural three-dimensional environments than previously estimated with 2D displays.&quot; (citation of abstract).</p><p>3. Following up on weakness 2, having a few well-trained participants (some of which could be the authors) perform all the conditions would be a nice addition to the present work. Obviously, in particular, if they show the same pattern of results.</p><p>4. I am sure the authors are aware that in crowding research, it is quite common to present results in terms of &quot;crowding magnitude&quot;, by subtracting the non-flanker (infinity) condition from the flanker conditions. While this is not a necessity, and their statistics are appropriate, it presumably could remove some of the individual variability in the data and reduce the number of conditions of interest that have to be displayed. At present, this number is quite overwhelming, resulting in somewhat &quot;crowded&quot; figures (pun intended).</p><p>5. The sentence in Lines 17 to 19 – &quot;Contrary to previous work showing small differences in target-flanker depth reduce crowding, the larger depth differences tested in our study instead increased crowding&quot; summarizes the result of the study in the abstract. However, instead of highlighting their own result, it tends to emphasize previous work. Therefore, to emphasize their own contribution, I suggest reordering the sentence to something like: &quot;Our study showed that larger differences in target-flanker depth increase crowding, contrary to previous work showing reduced crowding in the presence of small depth differences.&quot;</p><p>6. Line 68 effect – affect.</p><p>7. The text describing the perceived location of the target in Figure 3 step 5 is not readable. The icons by themselves are enough to get the message across. I suggest removing the text (in the picture) from the figure.</p><p>8. Increased crowding has also been found in glaucoma: https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.63.1.36 and https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.18-25150</p><p>9. In the introduction (line 39), in my view, some pioneering modeling work of van den Berg is missing from the citations on &quot;unifying theories&quot;. E.g. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000646 and https://doi.org/10.1167/12.6.13</p><p>10. While explained in the methods section, for readability, I suggest explaining the concept of disparities and diopters in relation to depth perception at an earlier stage.</p><p>11. It is not clearly described in the methods that the participants viewed the displays binocularly. Only binocular calibration is mentioned.</p><p>12. Line 63 &quot;This challenges the assumption that crowding is a significant problem in three-dimensional natural environments.&quot; It is not explained who made this assumption or what it is based on.</p><p>13. Line 66 – &quot;that&quot; missing.</p><p>14. Line 146 &quot;determined by the Miles test&quot;. Suggest briefly describing this test and/or providing a reference.</p><p>15.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Tirin Moore (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>We are glad to see that the manuscript has been improved, as you have satisfactorily addressed most issues raised in the first round of reviews. However, there is a remaining issue that needs to be addressed, explained below by Reviewer #3. The reviewer also recommends how to address this issue. It would strengthen your manuscript to do so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed most of my comments satisfactorily.</p><p>The authors also well explain their position on why a combination of (condition wise) incomplete data from various groups of participants is still valuable. However, the reason to ask for data in a small group with experienced participants wasn't about not believing the statistics on their large observer pool. It was primarily about whether the reported findings have real-world relevance at the individual level. This may not have been so clear in the first iteration. At the moment, that is hard to conclude, in my view. Indeed, there are statistically significant effects that emerge from the variable data. But is the variance in the data due to the effects themselves being small and highly variable, or is it because the naive participants were simply not very good/stable at indicating their perception, despite the training? In my view, this issue could be resolved by having well-trained, experienced observers repeat the task. If the authors believe they may be biased themselves, they could train a few other observers. I am open to other means to resolve this issue. But it is an actual question/issue that I have/see with the current results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85143.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) In general, there are some interactions that were reported, and others that were not reported, but it would be important to know if they are significant (pages 15-16).

In Experiment 5, was the interaction between target-flanker spacing and depth significant?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our reporting of the statistical analysis. As described in the statistical analysis section of the methods, for each experiment we first used model simplification, whereby models were compared with one another using a likelihood ratio test (LRT), to remove non-significant interactions sequentially. This enabled us to test the effect of individual fixed effects that were not involved in an interaction. We then used the minimum model (i.e., model containing all fixed effects of interest plus any significant two-way interactions) to report the significance of each main effect or significant interaction(s) by using a LRT to compare the minimum model with the same model but with the effect/interaction of interest removed. Therefore, in the original version of the manuscript we only reported the results of significant interactions as non-significant interaction were not present in the minimum model. Since, as the review points out, some readers may be interested in the results of these non-significant interactions, we have updated the Results section and now report the results of all non-significant interactions (based on the results of the LRT during model simplification).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The findings are clear but the explanation(s) for the findings is not.

Based on these comments we have reworded and expanded the paragraph where we discuss how diplopia, in theory, could increase perceptual error (lines 406-428). This includes adding additional references. We have also made improvements to the abstract (line 17-24) and last paragraph of the discussion (lines 455-470) to make them less speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At several points in the paper authors refer to the 'natural three-dimensional scenes'.

Please temper these comments.</p></disp-quote><p>This assessment of the ecological validity is fair. We agree that while, as the reviewer notes, our study is certainly a significant step forward in our use of large real depth differences, there is still a long way to go in our understanding of how crowding affects perception in complex, real world scenes. Our hope is that this study will help to form the basis and catalysis for this future research. In response to these comments, we have modified the abstract (line 17-24) and discussion (line 455-470) to temper claims concerning ecological validity. We have also added a new figure (Figure 1) to the introduction in response to another reviewer comment which helps to link the motivation for this research to the real world.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The inclusion of a large number of participants, in which none of the participants seemed to have performed all the conditions, is both a strength and a potential weakness. Their current approach of including (presumably) naive participants and having each do a portion of the experiments in itself is valid. But it also adds to the complexity of their study and presumably adds variability to their data.</p><p>Including data from a few well-trained participants (some of which could be the authors) performing all the conditions would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated at the start of the ‘Subject recruitment’ section of the methods, all subjects were naïve and were recruited from the Northeastern University undergraduate population. We agree that it would have strengthened the study if each participant had performed all the conditions, however, each participant was limited to one hour in exchange for course credit as compensation for their time. This is why each participant only performed one of the five experiments.</p><p>While the fact each participant did not perform all the conditions may have added variation to the data, we compensated for this by our inclusion of large sample sizes and employed appropriate statistical analysis. This design avoided effects of fatigue or learning that could confound data collected on the same subjects over multiple sessions. Furthermore, we argue that conclusions based on a large sample of naïve participants are more representative of the population than conclusions based on data collected on only a few experienced and potentially non-naïve participants. This is particularly true in cases where some, or all, of the experienced participants are the authors (which is common in human psychophysics) because, depending on the nature of the study, it may be impossible to avoid unconscious bias. While the additional variation in the data from naïve participants does add to the complexity of interpretation, it is nevertheless important to capture and report this variation as it is representative of the natural variation present within the real population.</p><p>Given that our results show convincing and statistically supported evidence that large differences in target-flanker depth increase perceptual errors in a naive population, we are surprised that a reviewer would request a replication in a small sample size of experienced, and potentially non-naïve, participants. Aside from being questionable scientifically, this would add redundancy and complexity to an already long manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– (lines 205-206) any reason why fixation time differed between Experiments 1, 3, and 5 and Experiments 2 and 4?</p></disp-quote><p>The fixation point was displayed for slightly longer before stimulus onset in Experiments 2 and 4 to ensure that observers had adequate time to refocus on the fixation point whenever it switched between the near and far screens.

As such the number of practice trials differed between participants.

We have added a sentence to the methods to provide more detail on the training (line 581-584).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be useful if the axes in the Supplementary figure were the same as in the related main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the Y axis of S1-S4 to be “proportion of trials” (in line with the related figure in the main text) instead of “Number of trials”.

As described in the updated methods (lines 594-602, and throughout the methods) all of the experienced subjects (none of whom were the authors) were volunteers from within the university vision research community and were therefore extremely familiar and well-practiced in participating in psychophysics experiments such as those in our current study. The Results section has been updated to include the results from the experiments with these experienced subjects (lines 307-390). We show that the variation in the data from the main experiments is indeed representative of the natural variation between some individuals within the population, and not because the naive subjects were not good/stable at reporting their responses. We have updated the discussion accordingly (lines 400-412, 515-525, and 576-577) and believe it is much stronger as a result. We have also updated the abstract and title to take into account that overall trends at the population level may not always be apparent at the individual level due to natural variation. We are confident that this repeated study with experienced subjects addresses the forementioned question raised by the reviewer and has improved the manuscript.</p><p>Additional improvements</p><p>We have improved the description of the projector set up by adding additional details (lines 613-614, and 619-626).</p><p>Figures 5, 6, 8 and 9, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 have been updated to make it easier to interpret the second boxplot (A has been made narrower while B has been widened).</p><p>Corrected an error in figures 6B and 9B, and Figure 9—figure supplement 2 that meant the results for the no flanker condition were pooled together instead of being plotted separately for the two fixation depths. Also updated Figure 9—figure supplement 1 so it’s formatting is consistent with Figure 9—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Correction to Figure 7 which was missing a label for ‘no flankers’ on the x axis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
