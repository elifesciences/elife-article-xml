Staging patients along the sepsis timeline requires a thorough knowledge of the evolution of cellular and molecular events at the tissue level. Here, we investigated the kidney, an organ central to the pathophysiology of sepsis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing in a murine endotoxemia model revealed the involvement of various cell populations to be temporally organized and highly orchestrated. Endothelial and stromal cells were the first responders. At later time points, epithelial cells upregulated immune-related pathways while concomitantly downregulating physiological functions such as solute homeostasis. Sixteen hours after endotoxin, there was global cell–cell communication failure and organ shutdown. Despite this apparent organ paralysis, upstream regulatory analysis showed significant activity in pathways involved in healing and recovery. This rigorous spatial and temporal definition of murine endotoxemia will uncover precise biomarkers and targets that can help stage and treat human sepsis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08-DK113223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hato</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK080063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dagher</surname><given-names>Pierre C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08-DK107864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eadon</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1I01BX002901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dagher</surname><given-names>Pierre C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006975</institution-id><institution>Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR002529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janosevic</surname><given-names>Danielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK120524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janosevic</surname><given-names>Danielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI148282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hato</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006975</institution-id><institution>Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL091816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janosevic</surname><given-names>Danielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA-sequencing identifies the precise cellular and molecular events that occur along the sepsis timeline in the kidney, pointing to potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of sepsis that doubles the mortality risk. In addition to failed homeostasis, kidney injury can contribute to multi-organ dysfunction through distant effects. Indeed, the injured kidney is a significant source of inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species that can have both local as well as remote deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Husain-Syed et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutschman and Tracey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poston and Koyner, 2019</xref>). Therefore, understanding the complex pathophysiology of kidney injury is crucial for the comprehensive treatment of sepsis and its complications.</p><p>We have recently shown that renal injury in endotoxemia progresses through multiple phases. These include an early inflammatory burst followed by a broad antiviral response that culminated in protein translation shutdown and organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hato et al., 2019</xref>). In a non-lethal and reversible model of endotoxemia, organ failure was followed by spontaneous recovery. The exact cellular and molecular contributors to this multifaceted response remain unknown. Indeed, the kidney is architecturally a highly complex organ in which epithelial, endothelial, immune, and stromal cells are at constant interplay. Therefore, we now examined the spatial and temporal progression of endotoxin injury to the kidney using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our data revealed that cell–cell communication failure is a major contributor to organ dysfunction in endotoxemia. Remarkably, this phase of communication failure was also a transition point where recovery pathways were activated. We believe this spatially and temporally-anchored approach to the pathophysiology of endotoxemia is crucial for identifying potential sepsis biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ScRNA-seq identifies various renal cell populations</title><p>We harvested a cumulative amount of 63,287 renal cells obtained at 0, 1, 4, 16, 27, 36, and 48 hr after endotoxin (LPS) administration. The majority of renal epithelial, immune and endothelial cell types were represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://connect.rstudio.iu.edu/content/18/">https://connect.rstudio.iu.edu/content/18/</ext-link>). Note the absence of podocyte and mesangial cells, which can be a limitation of warm dissociation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denisenko et al., 2020</xref>). Cluster identities were assigned and grouped using known classical phenotypic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ransick et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the UMAP-based computational layout of epithelial clusters recapitulated the normal tubular segmental order of the nephron. This indicates that cell type-defining gene expression patterns gradually change among neighboring tubular segments along the nephron. The expression of cluster-defining markers varied significantly during the injury and recovery phases of endotoxemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Therefore, we also identified a set of genes that are conserved across time for a given cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ScRNA-seq identifies various renal cell populations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Integrated UMAP of kidney cell clusters from control and LPS-treated mice (0, 1, 4, 16, 27, 36, and 48 hr after LPS injection). Actual anatomical layout of kidney nephronal segments is shown below UMAP.

The stress markers <italic>Jun</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> that are typically associated with the dissociation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van den Brink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denisenko et al., 2020</xref>) were not strongly expressed in this proliferating cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). By back mapping to time-specific unintegrated UMAPs, we determined that these proliferating cells could be traced to specific cell types at various points along the endotoxemia timeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At baseline, proliferating indices localized to the proximal tubular cluster in uninjured tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This was confirmed microscopically after in vivo thymidine analog injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Within the first hour after LPS, these proliferative indices were expressed primarily in S1 cells. These cells are the site of LPS uptake in the kidney as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalakeche et al., 2011</xref>). At later time points, proliferative indices are seen in lymphocytes (16 hr) and S3 cells (36 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The migration of proliferation indices among various cell types highlights the spatial and temporal nature of the renal response to LPS. These proliferative indices likely reflect cell cycle activity which may be involved in injury, repair or recovery processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Integration of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics localizes subtypes of S3 proximal tubules</title><p>Among the proximal tubular cells, we noted the presence of a distinct cluster expressing Angiotensinogen (Agt) and other unique identifiers such as <italic>Rnf24, Slc22a7</italic>, and <italic>Slc22a13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is likely the proximal tubular S3-Type 2 (S3T2) reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ransick et al., 2019</xref>). This cluster maintained a separate and distinct identity throughout most of the endotoxemia timeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because the location of S3T2 is currently unknown, we performed in-situ spatial transcriptomics on endotoxemic mouse kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ståhl et al., 2016</xref>). We then integrated our scRNA-seq with the in-situ RNA-seq to map our scRNA-seq clusters onto the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We found that the S3 cluster localizes to the cortex while S3T2 is in the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OS-OM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed the location of S3T2 to the OS-OM with single-molecular FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The differential gene expression between S3 and S3T2 is likely dictated by regional differences in the microenvironments of the cortex and the outer stripe. The small number of cells in this S3T2 cluster in our scRNA-seq data may be the result of a cortical dissociation bias.

At each time point, cells exhibited various states of gene expression that are well defined with pseudotime analysis. In fact, pseudotime accurately predicted future states as observed in real time. The endothelium exhibited changes in states as early as 1 hr, while S1 showed changes at later time points (4 hr). Importantly, the 16 hr timepoint was a turning point after which most cells returned to their baseline states indicating recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). At later time points, many cell types lost function-defining markers while acquiring novel ones. For example, S1 and S3 lost classical markers like <italic>Slc5a2</italic> (SGLT2) and <italic>Aqp1</italic> and expressed new genes involved in antigen presentation such as <italic>H2-Ab1</italic> (MHC-II) and <italic>Cd74</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

However, despite the apparent convergent phenotype at 16 hr, additional analytical approaches such as RNA velocity revealed significant differences in RNA splicing kinetics between S1 and S3 segments at this time point. In addition, RNA velocity revealed the presence of two subclusters within the S3 segment at 16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These two velocity subclusters did not correlate with the two states seen in pseudotime analysis. Overall, the distinct changes observed in the RNA velocity field point to the significance of altered splicing activities at 16 hr.

For example, patients whose gene expression matched that of later time points in the murine endotoxemia timeline (e.g. recovery) had the lowest SOFA score. These findings suggest that underlying injury mechanisms are partially conserved, and the mouse timeline may be valuable in staging and defining biomarkers and therapeutics in human sepsis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we provide comprehensive transcriptomic profiling of the kidney in a murine endotoxemia model. To our knowledge, this is the first description of spatial and temporal endotoxin-induced transcriptomic changes in the kidney that extend from early injury well into the recovery phase. Our data cover nearly all renal cell types and are time-anchored, thus providing a detailed and precise view of the evolution of endotoxemia in the kidney at the cellular and molecular levels.</p><p>Using a combination of analytical approaches, we identified marked phenotypic changes in multiple cell populations in response to endotoxin. The proximal tubular S1 segment exhibited significant alterations consisting of early loss of traditional function-defining markers (e.g. transporters such as SGLT2). Such deranged expression of tubular transporters may explain the frequently observed alterations in water, electrolytes, acid base, and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, the global cell–cell communication failure likely underlies kidney shutdown that cannot be ascribed solely to hypoperfusion and ischemic injury (e.g. hyperdynamic sepsis). Concomitantly, we observed novel epithelial expression of immune-related genes such as those involved in antigen presentation. This indicates a dramatic switch in epithelial function from transport and homeostasis to immunity and defense. These phenotypic changes were reversible, underscoring the remarkable resilience and plasticity of the renal epithelium. Our data regarding loss of transport function and acquisition of immune-related functions have also been reported by others in bulk kidney tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tran et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the significant agreement between our data and these earlier studies, some differences were noted in the time course of these changes that may be related to different dosage of endotoxin and choice of time points. Our data extends these earlier studies in bulk tissue by providing spatial resolution at the single cell level. In addition, our combined analytical tools clearly identified unique subclusters within each epithelial cell population (e.g. cortical S3 and OS S3). These subclusters likely represent cell populations that may be in part influenced by the complex microenvironments in the kidney.</p><p>Similarly, we also identified unique features in immune-cell populations. For example, the combined use of RNA velocity field and pseudotime analyses uncovered differences in macrophage subtypes relating to RNA kinetics and cell differentiation trajectories. Of note is that these subtypes only partially matched the traditional flow cytometry-based classification of macrophages (e.g. M1/M2). Therefore, the use of scRNA-seq is a powerful approach that will add to and complement our current understanding of the immune cell repertoire in the kidney.</p><p>Additional approaches such as receptor-ligand crosstalk and gene regulatory network analyses identified unique cell- and time-dependent players involved in the pathophysiology of endotoxemia. Importantly, the expression of genes involved in vectorial transport, inflammation, vascular health, coagulation and complement cascades varied greatly along the endotoxemia timeline, and required simultaneous contributions from multiple cell types. However, these complex interactions collapsed at the 16 hr time point. This indeed is a remarkable juncture in the endotoxemia timeline that we have previously investigated in other models of murine sepsis including cecal ligation and puncture/CLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hato et al., 2019</xref>). It is the time where profound translation failure and organ shutdown occur. Our current data point to massive cell-cell communication failure as a key feature of this time point. Surprisingly, it is also at this time point that reparative pathways started to emerge. It is thus a defining point in sepsis that may have significant clinical implications. For example, the recovery process begins at the time when traditional markers such as serum creatinine is still increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, molecules involved in this recovery (e.g. Sox9) can be future targets at the bedside and thus have clinical potential to treat sepsis-associated AKI.</p><p>Our work points to the urgent need for defining a more accurate and precise human sepsis timeline. Such definition will guide the development of biomarkers and therapies that are cell and time specific. In our data, the gene expression changes in murine endotoxemia did partially map to tissues from septic patients, thus allowing temporal stratification of human sepsis. These precisely time- and space-anchored data will provide the community with rich and comprehensive foundations that will propel further investigations into human sepsis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>We recognize that endotoxemia and other murine models may not perfectly recapitulate human sepsis. Nevertheless, these models partially exhibit molecular similarities to various stages of human sepsis. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) may mimic human sepsis better than endotoxemia. However, CLP is a polymicrobial model that may be intractable at the molecular level. It carries very high mortality and is thus more useful for survival interventions. In contrast, endotoxemia is a well-defined ligand-receptor pathway that can be dissected with precision. With the endotoxin dose used in this study, it is also a reversible model that allows the investigation of recovery pathways. Another limitation of our study is the use of young healthy mice thus losing the contributions of age and comorbidities to the pathophysiology of sepsis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">RNAscope probe-Mm-Agt</td><td valign="top">Advance Cell Diagnosis</td><td valign="top">Cat.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity: Jesus Bermejo-Martin (Reviewer #2); Sebastian Weis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an elegant study deconvoluting the cellular changes in the kidney (kind and function) along the course of a sepsis-like disease model on mice challenged with LPS. For achieving this objective, the authors have employed a single cell sequencing approach, and compared their findings to those observed in renal biopsies from patients suffering from AKI secondary to sepsis. This work provides interesting new data on the changes on immunological, endothelial and parenchymal cells composition and function following the LPS challenge, revealing important new insight on the dynamics and nature of this changes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One main limitation is that it is not possible to fully understand the storyline of the authors which becomes confusing at some points. Several parts of the Results start with the verb &quot;Note&quot; as if they are figures and not text. It is also very difficult to understand what the need of archived renal tissue from humans was and the participation of this analysis in the storyline.</p><p>2) The authors do not provide explanation on the purification of cell populations and on the methods, they used to avoid cell contamination.</p><p>3) We would like to see in the Discussion the comparison of the data of single cell RNA analysis with previously published array data.</p><p>4)The authors work with a model of LPS injection. This is all fine and can be done and provides useful information. However, it explicitly does not reflect the pathophysiology of sepsis that is defined as a deregulated host response to infection. Therefore, any reliable sepsis model needs to apply pathogens, which is not done. What we here look at, is TLR4 activation by LPS as a model of inflammatory stress. This needs to be changed. The best way would be by using an additional animal sepsis model confirming the LPS data. As an alternative, the manuscript should be rewritten in a way that it is evident, that the model is a pure TLR4 activation model of inflammatory stress and not sepsis. The discussion should be adopted accordingly. As such a short term &quot;initial inflammatory burst&quot; will be seen in an LPS model but would hardly reflect clinical reality.</p><p>5) In the same vein, there are additional problems concerning animal models in sepsis that need to be discussed here: for example, patients suffering from sepsis use to be aged individuals suffering from chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. Ageing and chronic diseases impact on the host immune system and tissues. The authors seem to employ mice with no prior comorbidities. Please address this limitation in the Discussion.</p><p>6) The authors should clarify how many mice were used to obtain the SCS results. A sentence in the Materials and methods, Results and Abstract would help. Does &quot;mice&quot; mean two, or more? This could help to assess data validity.</p><p>7) A correlate is missing between SCS findings and clinical / biological parameters obtained in parallel from the mice: creatinine, inflammatory proteins / cytokines, urine volume, etc.</p><p>8) The authors should provide disease severity, mortality, organ damage markers, cytokine levels for their animal model so that the reader can better assess the severity of the model.</p><p>9) Is there any data on the consequences of the different states with regard to kidney function. This would be very interesting to see.</p><p>10) The authors state that kidneys from septic patients have been used. Please provide clinical characteristics (SOFA; source of infection; microbiology, main clinical parameters; age, gender, comorbidity etc.) of these patients and of the controls.

Several parts of the Results start with the verb &quot;Note&quot; as if they are figures and not text. It is also very difficult to understand what the need of archived renal tissue from humans was and the participation of this analysis in the storyline.</p></disp-quote><p>Our findings show space- and time-dependent changes in the kidney following endotoxin challenge with an organized participation of various cell populations. This has relevance to the design and administration of therapy to precisely target unique cell populations at specific time points. We also showed phenotypic changes such as loss of transporters that can alter the function of the renal epithelium and may explain some clinical findings in septic patients. Furthermore, we showed that all these changes culminate in cell-cell communication failure at exactly the same time point characterized by translation shutdown as we have previously shown. Importantly, several genes and pathways involved in tissue healing become activated at this time point, indicating that it is a time of transition from injury to recovery.</p><p>As to the archived renal tissue, it was obtained from patients with the diagnosis of acute renal failure in the setting of sepsis without specific chronological information as to the timing of sepsis. We show that time-specific gene expression changes in the mouse sepsis timeline can be partially mapped to some of the human samples. This allowed a staging of the human samples from early to late phases of sepsis. We believe this may have important therapeutic implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors do not provide explanation on the purification of cell populations and on the methods, they used to avoid cell contamination.</p></disp-quote><p>The single-cell RNA-seq procedure used in this paper attempted to capture all cell populations in the kidney. Therefore, the tissue dissociation step was not followed by flow sorting or other attempts to enrich any specific cell types. Cell populations thereafter were identified and grouped based on gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We would like to see in the Discussion the comparison of the data of single cell RNA analysis with previously published array data.</p></disp-quote><p>Our scRNA-seq data were well in line with published array data from bulk kidney tissue (Tran et al., 2011). For example, the changes in the thick ascending loop sodium/potassium/chloride transporter (Slc12a1/NKCC2), proximal tubular aquaporin (Aqp1), and genes involved in antigen presentation (H2-Ab1, Cd74) were comparable to those reported in bulk tissue as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. scRNA-seq has the advantage of localizing these changes to specific cell populations.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Bulk kidney microarray data.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62270-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors work with a model of LPS injection. This is all fine and can be done and provides useful information. However, it explicitly does not reflect the pathophysiology of sepsis that is defined as a deregulated host response to infection. Therefore, any reliable sepsis model needs to apply pathogens, which is not done. What we here look at, is TLR4 activation by LPS as a model of inflammatory stress. This needs to be changed. The best way would be by using an additional animal sepsis model confirming the LPS data. As an alternative, the manuscript should be rewritten in a way that it is evident, that the model is a pure TLR4 activation model of inflammatory stress and not sepsis. The discussion should be adopted accordingly. As such a short term &quot;initial inflammatory burst&quot; will be seen in an LPS model but would hardly reflect clinical reality.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that LPS/endotoxemia model may not capture the full spectrum of Gram-negative sepsis in humans. However, as we and others have shown, it does recapitulate several key events in the sepsis timeline, and correlates well with the CLP model (Seok et al., 2013; Takao et al., 2015). As the reviewers’ state, it is a precise model that follows signaling events initiated by endotoxin/TLR4 interaction. It is a highly reproducible model that is also reversible, and therefore can be used to identify pathways involved in tissue recovery and healing. In fact, murine models of endotoxemia and its variants have been found to have significant similarities in gene expression changes to human sepsis. This has been elegantly demonstrated in Takao et al., 2015. This is also supported in our data by the successful mapping of gene expression changes in the endotoxemic mouse to human tissues from septic patients (Figure 7D). We have now changed the word “sepsis” to endotoxemia in several parts of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the same vein, there are additional problems concerning animal models in sepsis that need to be discussed here: for example, patients suffering from sepsis use to be aged individuals suffering from chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. Ageing and chronic diseases impact on the host immune system and tissues. The authors seem to employ mice with no prior comorbidities. Please address this limitation in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and are aware of such models. For example, one such model uses CLP in aged rats or mice. This model was originally introduced with the goal of inducing measurable renal injury which is not always apparent in traditional CLP (Doi et al., 2009). These models are primarily used to test the effect of therapeutics on renal function and animal survival. However, they pose more challenges in identifying specific and canonical molecular pathways because of their polymicrobial nature, comorbidities, and hemodynamic effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should clarify how many mice were used to obtain the SCS results. A sentence in the Materials and methods, Results and Abstract would help. Does &quot;mice&quot; mean two, or more? This could help to assess data validity.</p></disp-quote><p>We pool kidneys from 3 mice per time point. The pooled 3 kidneys are run as one sample for cost purposes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A correlate is missing between SCS findings and clinical / biological parameters obtained in parallel from the mice: creatinine, inflammatory proteins / cytokines, urine volume, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see below (response to #8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should provide disease severity, mortality, organ damage markers, cytokine levels for their animal model so that the reader can better assess the severity of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously characterized this endotoxemia model extensively, including parameters such as survival, reversibility, renal function (serum creatinine, BUN), tubular injury (KIM1, NGAL), as well as tissue and serum cytokines (Kalakeche et al., 2011; Hato et al., 2015; Hato et al., 2017; Hato et al., 2018; Hato et al., 2019). The dose of endotoxin used in this model does not result in significant hemodynamic alterations (Nakano et al., 2015). We now provide additional new data on such clinical/biological parameters that characterize this murine model (New Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Is there any data on the consequences of the different states with regard to kidney function. This would be very interesting to see.</p></disp-quote><p>Kidney tissue from septic patients typically does not show significant morphological changes that can explain the observed profound organ shutdown. Furthermore, organ shutdown in septic patients occurs even in hyperdynamic states where tissue perfusion is not compromised. Similarly, animal models of sepsis such as endotoxemia or CLP do not exhibit marked morphological changes in the kidney.</p><p>Therefore, we propose that the molecular changes reported in this paper (e.g. dysregulated translation and cell-cell communication failure) may underlie the observed organ failure. Furthermore, some of the tubular phenotypic changes we report e.g. loss of aquaporins and glucose transporters may explain dysregulated urinary concentrating mechanisms and altered glucose metabolism reported in sepsis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors state that kidneys from septic patients have been used. Please provide clinical characteristics (SOFA; source of infection; microbiology, main clinical parameters; age, gender, comorbidity etc.) of these patients and of the controls. Were they really patients with sepsis that received a kidney biopsy? This is rarely done. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. The human biopsies used in this paper were not research or protocol biopsies. In fact, these are leftover tissues stored and typically discarded at later times by the pathologist. We made every effort to retrieve any available clinical data associated with each biopsy. Such clinical data from chart reviews were frequently scarce and incomplete. Furthermore, some of these biopsies were from other institutions and no detailed clinical data were forwarded to our pathologist with the biopsies. Nevertheless, we have now included all available data such as SOFA scores and microbiology when available (New Supplementary file 5). We also agree that typically kidney biopsies are not performed in septic patients. The indications for biopsy in our cohort were variable and included delayed recovery, distinguishing interstitial nephritis and tubular necrosis, or exclusion of underlying glomerulonephritis. The final diagnosis in all these biopsies was acute tubular necrosis in the setting of sepsis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It is unclear, why the authors swing for some lines to SARS-CoV-2. This is not the topic of the manuscript. LPS has no role in SARS-CoV-2 and no viral infections are being studies here. This should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have removed the SARS-CoV-2-related data. It was originally included because of the observed increased angiotensinogen in S3 cells, which prompted us to examine the broad expression of the renin-angiotensin system. We thought this may be of general interest due to the SARSCoV-2 pandemic, but we agree that it may not help the flow of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) As the authors provide IHC data (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and as there is a LPS directly regulates NF-κB function, we would suggest to specifically add data for NF-κB activation with IHC.</p></disp-quote><p>The IHC imaging data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 was shown to specifically localize the proliferating cell cluster observed in the scRNA-seq data. The imaging confirmed that the localization of these cells in tubules versus interstitium varies along the sepsis timeline. The expression of Nf-<sub>κ</sub>B in the kidney in sepsis/endotoxemia has been extensively investigated (Song et al., 2019; Belen-Sanz et al., 2010; Guijarro et al., 2001). Furthermore, the expression of several components of the Nf-<sub>κ</sub>B pathway can be localized to specific cells along the sepsis timeline using the following link to our data (e.g. <italic>Rela, Relb, Nfkbia, Nfkb1</italic>): https://connect.rstudio.iu.edu/content/18/ . The activation of Nf-<sub>κ</sub>B is evident in endothelial and stromal cells at the 1 hour time point and then is evident in immune cells and epithelial cells at later time points. c-Jun and Fos expression levels are commonly used to identify cells exhibiting stress related to the organ dissociation procedure (Denisenko et al., 2020; van den Brink et al.,2017).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Janosevic et al., submit the first revision of their manuscript entitled &quot;The orchestrated cellular and molecular responses of the kidney to endotoxin define a precise sepsis timeline&quot;.

We would also like to thank the reviewer for providing clear and practical suggestions to improve the manuscript. Finally, we apologize for our previous incomplete response to the reviewer’s comments. Indeed, we had provided in the response some of the required data. We have now added all responses, discussions and new data in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In more detail.</p><p>i) The authors do not discuss their single cell RNA data with previously published data, as requested.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, our work is the first examination of endotoxin-induced kidney injury covering from very early phases (1 hour~) to recovery (48 hours) at the single-cell resolution. We searched for publicly available datasets for murine endotoxemia models, which were all done in bulk kidneys. The closest time course we could find was by Tran et al., 2011 in which 10 mg/kg LPS ip (<italic>E. coli</italic> serotype O111:B4) was used in C57BL/6 mice and gene expression profiles were examined at 0, 18 and 42 hours post LPS (Our endotoxemia model consists of 5 mg/kg LPS iv, <italic>E. coli</italic> serotype O111:B4, and gene expression profiles were examined at 0, 1, 4, 16, 27, 36 and 48 hours). As shown in new Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and discussed in the Results section, Discussion and Materials and methods we demonstrate that overall gene expression changes are similar between our study and Tran et al. We accomplished this analysis by reconstructing pseudobulk kidneys from our single-cell RNA-seq data and cross-examining time-dependent gene expression changes between the two datasets using Jaccard similarity index.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Although that the reviewer stated specifically that the presented work is not sepsis and ask for a change, this was not followed convincingly in the revised version.

If patients' samples are being used, the authors should be able to retrieve the requested information.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a serious and honest effort to retrieve all clinical data that were available. Note that these were not research biopsies and some of them originated from outside institutions. We compiled all available data in Supplementary file 5 showing SOFA score, source of infection, microbiology, clinical context, age, gender, and comorbidity. We also provide a statistical correlation between gene-based patient stratification into early and late phases of sepsis, and their SOFA score (new Figure 7E and new Figure 7—figure supplement 1, subsection “The murine endotoxemia timeline allows staging of human sepsis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) Data for NfKB activation using IHC is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide NfkB IHC in new Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and subsection “Endotoxemia induces an organ-wide host defense phenotype in the kidney”. The data show nuclear translocation of NfkB as early as 1 hour after endotoxin in most cell types. These data are in line with our previously published ribo-seq data (Hato et al., 2019; specifically supplemental Figure 3 and Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi) Consequences with regard to kidney function are not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now addressed possible consequences of endotoxin-induced gene expression changes on global kidney function and clinical parameters (Discussion; please also see Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vii) Disease severity/mortality is not provided as requested.</p></disp-quote><p>The endotoxin model used here results in transient kidney injury. The animals invariably recover and the mortality is nil. We use this nonlethal model to elucidate molecular mechanisms of renal recovery. With regard to disease severity, serum creatinine is arguably the gold standard for defining the severity of kidney failure. We provide serum creatinine data as well as other markers of tubular injury as shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2. Histological changes are not readily detectable (e.g. Supplemental Figure 9 in Hato et al., 2015) unless leveraging advanced molecular imaging techniques such as two-photon intravital fluorescence lifetime imaging (Hato et al., 2017). Others have worked with higher doses of LPS and examined its renal outcomes. For example, in the study by Tran et al., 2011, 10 mg/kg LPS resulted in heterogeneous renal outcomes (“The majority of mice recovered normal function by 42 hours after LPS, but some had persistent AKI”) and the survival was greater than 80%. Even with the 10 mg/kg LPS, light microscopy showed only minor to no changes in their study. We provide in subsection “Experimental Model and Subject Details<italic>”</italic> describing the severity and mortality of our endotoxin model. Figure 7—figure supplement 2 also includes tissue and serum cytokine levels as requested by the reviewer.</p><p>Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the rationale behind defining 16 hrs and above as late and recovery phases in our murine model of endotoxemia. This definition is based on the single-cell RNA sequencing data in which resolution of tissue injury becomes apparent after the 16 hour time point (see Author response image 2). We have also previously demonstrated that this dose of endotoxin alters gene expression and culminates in profound protein translation shutdown in the kidney at 16 hours (Hato et al., 2019). Therefore, our molecular-based timeline is anchored around gene expression changes and protein translation shutdown, and their recovery. In contrast, standard biochemical markers (e.g. serum creatinine) resulting from altered gene expression are observed at later time points.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Timeline of murine LPS model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adapted from Figure 4.
