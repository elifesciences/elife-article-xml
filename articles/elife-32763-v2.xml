Optimization, the ability to select the functionally best material and modify it appropriately for a specific function, implies flexibility and is usually thought to be incompatible with inherited behaviour. Here, we show that tree-crickets optimize acoustic baffles, objects that are used to increase the effective loudness of mate-attraction calls. We quantified the acoustic efficiency of all baffles within the naturally feasible design space using finite-element modelling and found that design affects efficiency significantly. We tested the baffle-making behaviour of tree crickets in a series of experimental contexts. We found that given the opportunity, tree crickets optimised baffle acoustics; they selected the best sized object and modified it appropriately to make a near optimal baffle. Surprisingly, optimization could be achieved in a single attempt, and is likely to be achieved through an inherited yet highly accurate behavioural heuristic.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32763.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Male tree crickets produce sounds at a specific pitch to attract females. The louder the call, the further the sound travels and the more females he can attract. But making loud sounds is difficult for small animals like insects.</p><p>To produce sounds, tree crickets rub their wings together and set them into vibration. As the wings vibrate, their motion creates changes in the surrounding air pressure, which is perceived as sound. As the wings move forwards, they compress the air in front of them and thin the air behind them, working much like the membrane of a loudspeaker. However, when the compressed and thinned air meet at the edges of the wings, the sound cancels out. This problem is known as acoustic short-circuiting, and the smaller the wings, the larger this effect and the less efficient the broadcast of sound becomes.</p><p>Tree crickets overcome acoustic short-circuiting by making baffles, for which they cut a hole near the centre of a leaf. The cricket then sings from inside this hole with its wings flat against the leaf surface, so that the sound has to travel to the leaf edge before short-circuiting. Not all baffles work equally well though, and scientists are interested to know whether tree crickets know how to make the best possible baffle to attract more females.</p><p>To find out what makes an ideal baffle, Mhatre et al. first measured the wing vibrations and sounds of real tree crickets, and used them to simulate a cricket singing from different baffles. From these tests, three simple rules emerged that led to the best baffle: use the largest available leaf, make a hole the size of the wings, and place it at the centre of the leaf.</p><p>Mhatre et al. then discovered that the crickets did not make a baffle every time – only when the leaves were large enough. This suggests that rather than being solely ‘robotic’ in their behaviour and the use of objects, insects can behave flexibly. When faced with a choice between two leaves, the crickets followed the same three decision rules that the scientists had discovered, and achieved near optimal baffles.</p><p>Insects are thought to only be able to gradually improve an object or behaviour, but rarely to optimize it. However, the discovery that tree crickets can make optimal acoustic baffles in a single attempt means that we are only beginning to unravel the underappreciated abilities of insects. An enticing next step will be to see whether the creation of baffles could be considered as tool-making.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optimization</kwd><kwd>object manufacture</kwd><kwd>heuristics</kwd><kwd>tree cricket</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I009671/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000732</institution-id><institution>UK-India Education and Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balakrishnan</surname><given-names>Rohini</given-names></name><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003562</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Environment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balakrishnan</surname><given-names>Rohini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09/079(2199)/2008-EMR-I</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deb</surname><given-names>Rittik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003106</institution-id><institution>Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mhatre</surname><given-names>Natasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>254455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mhatre</surname><given-names>Natasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tree crickets can optimize the baffles they make to increase call loudness without any progressive optimization, and manufacture an optimal baffle in a single attempt, by using a simple yet highly accurate heuristic.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals produce conspicuous intraspecific communication signals whose intensity is maximised through sexual selection. Several insect species, including tree crickets, use sound to advertise for mates. The louder the call, the farther it travels and the more detectable and attractive it is to listening females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farris et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forrest, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mhatre and Balakrishnan, 2007</xref>). Several strategies exist to enhance the radiation of acoustic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennet-Clark, 1999</xref>), but the principal strategy insects use is to exploit the mechanical resonance either of adapted body parts, such as wings, or tymbal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mhatre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sueur et al., 2006</xref>), or of their immediate environment as mole crickets do with their calling burrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daws et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Tree crickets use a unique and distinct strategy to enhance the reach of their call; they make and use their own acoustic baffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forrest, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prozesky-Schulze et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrest, 1982</xref>). Tree crickets, like other crickets, produce sound by rubbing raised forewings together and setting them into resonant vibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mhatre et al., 2012</xref>). The sound that radiates from either side of the vibrating wing, however, is of opposite phase; positive pressure or compression in the direction of the wing’s motion and rarefaction or negative pressure on the other side (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The wing’s sound production capability is thus made inefficient by ‘acoustic short-circuiting’, whereby the two opposing sound waves emanating from the wing destructively interfere at its edges, thus reducing the total radiated sound pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forrest, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prozesky-Schulze et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrest, 1982</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This short-circuiting is particularly potent in tree crickets because their wings are small (~9 mm in length) compared to the wavelength of their call (~110 mm at 3.1 kHz).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-32763-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32763.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Finite element analysis simulation of instantaneous sound pressure radiated by unbaffled and baffled calling cricket.</title></caption></media><p>One way to circumvent the limitation is to separate the front and back faces of the sound source (the resonating wings) thus precluding deleterious interaction between the two pressure waves. A baffle provides exactly such acoustic isolation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In effect, male tree crickets cut a hole in a leaf to make a baffle. They then place their head and forelegs through the hole and call with their wings parallel to the leaf surface and centred within the hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The leaf surface area provides acoustic isolation between the two sides, increasing call loudness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forrest, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prozesky-Schulze et al., 1975</xref>). Given that the only function of the baffle is to prevent acoustic short circuiting, and not to resonate with the call, a tree cricket could use any leaf, or flat surface for this purpose.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32763.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tree cricket calling and baffle-use behaviour.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A wild male <italic>Oecanthus henryi</italic> calling from a baffle (photograph reproduced from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mhatre et al., 2012</xref>]).

Baffle design has a profound effect on radiation efficiency, and tree crickets can select the best leaf to make a near optimal baffle. We show that we can quantitatively predict the relationship between calling effort (measured as wing vibration velocity), baffle design, and the resulting sound using biomechanical and acoustical measurements, and finite element analysis (FEA). Using FEA models, we calculate and test the efficiency of tree crickets calling from different natural baffle designs, accounting for the complex geometries of cricket wings, their self-made baffles, and the leaves crickets chose to call from.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Calling effort and wing speed</title><p>To characterize calling effort, wing vibrations during calling were measured using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry.

Measurements were made from freely behaving animals who sang when offered pre-made paper baffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, Materials and methods). The sound pressure produced by a vibrating structure is dependent on its space and time averaged velocity. It also depends on the size of the radiator and the wavelength of the sound being produced and is captured by a constant called the radiator resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hambric and Fahnline, 2007</xref>). In tree crickets, the average velocity over the entire wing surface for a fixed period of one second was 0.13 ± 0.06 m·s<sup>−1</sup>, and it produced an average sound pressure level (SPL) of 22.8 ± 11.0 mPa (60.4 ± 4.1 dB).

SRE with a baffle of any size is higher than unbaffled calling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), and the expectation is that males should always baffle given an opportunity. In natural populations observed over three field seasons, however, the probability of finding a baffling male was as low as 26% (27 of 105 males observed calling) and while baffling males tended to be on larger leaves, there was wide variation in leaf size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus baffled-calling is not a stereotyped and obligate calling behaviour; tree cricket males must decide whether to call with or without a baffle.</p><p>In the wild, large leaves that can make acoustically optimal baffles are extremely rare and search costs are likely to be high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, if we eliminate search costs, the propensity to make a baffle may increase with leaf size, a hypothesis that we tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Males were offered leaves of four size classes, one leaf at a time, over four nights. Each night, they could choose either to make a baffle or to call from the edge of the leaf. In this situation, in the absence of search costs, calling males were only balancing the effort expended in making a baffle against the increased SRE. Baffling probability varied depending on the leaf size (Cochran’s Q: 63.9, df = 3, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and was significantly different between extra-large and large leaf sizes (Mc-Nemars χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.9, df = 1, p=0.02), large and medium leaf sizes (Mc-Nemars χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.05, df = 1, p&lt;0.001) and medium and small leaf sizes (Mc-Nemars χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.14, df = 1, p=0.02). The larger the leaves, the more likely the crickets were to make a baffle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the probability of making a baffle approached 50% only with leaves between 61 and 69 mm long, where SRE increased by 54%. Even with the largest leaves, baffling probability did not exceed 67%, and 33% of the males missed the opportunity to more than double their SRE and thus their active acoustic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether males preferred larger leaves or whether they could also select the best leaf when given a choice. Tree crickets could indeed select the leaves that yielded higher SREs. 19 males were presented with a choice between a small (61.2 ± 4.8 mm) and a large leaf (115.2 ± 11.7 mm) of their host plant (<italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>). Males always selected the leaves yielding the higher SRE. All males that made a baffle (15 of 19) used the larger leaf. The holes they made were also acoustically optimal in size (10.0 ± 1.9 mm, n = 15). Thus, given the opportunity males would indeed optimize the SRE of their baffles in terms of both selecting the appropriate materials, i.e. the largest leaf and then modifying it appropriately i.e. cutting a hole of acoustically optimal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Males, however, did not make holes at the exact centre of leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We used our FEA to further explore whether eccentric hole positions came at a cost to SRE. An SRE map was constructed by varying hole position across an average leaf in the large size class. This map revealed that SRE was highest at the leaf centre and decreased for eccentric hole positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, eccentric hole positions come at a cost to SRE. A central-hole baffle on the smaller leaf would have achieved an SRE of 226.3 ± 20.9 mPa/m∙s<sup>−1</sup>. On the large leaf, it would achieve an SRE of 375.1 ± 11.1 mPa/m∙s<sup>−1</sup>. The radiation efficiency of the real baffles made by the crickets was 332.2 ± 30.3 mPa/m∙s<sup>−1</sup> i.e. 88.6 ± 7.6% of the maximum achievable SRE with a skew towards higher efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (mean ± SD, range = 72.8% to 97.7%, n = 15 all measures).</p><p>Although theoretically optimal, a central hole position is impractical as it cuts through the midrib. This compromises the leaf’s structural rigidity and its main water transport system, causing it to wilt, thus reducing the lifetime of the baffle. Additionally, cutting through the rigid midrib may be mechanically difficult. Indeed, closer observation of baffle holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) showed that males never cut through major leaf veins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Progressive versus single shot optimization</title><p>Surprisingly, most males made only one hole and thus made a baffle in a single attempt, without any progressive trial and error optimization of baffle design.

In this scenario, the primary hole can be positioned anywhere on the leaf but the second hole is always at the optimal central position. The colour on the map depicts the percent increase in SRE that a male at that position can accrue by making a second optimally positioned hole. SRE increases only if the primary hole was eccentric; if the primary hole was close to the optimal position, however, making a second hole in effect reduces the baffle’s SRE.

For instance, mole crickets gradually restructure their burrows to bring burrow resonance closer to call frequency(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daws et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennet-Clark, 1987</xref>). Baffles however, are unique and cannot be ‘edited’ unlike cavities; once a hole has been cut in a leaf, it cannot be erased or repositioned. Only a new hole can be made. Here we show that cutting a new hole entails the risk of making a sub-optimal baffle by reducing current SRE through increased acoustic short-circuiting. We studied the effect of a second hole on SRE by simulating a scenario where an eccentric hole was abandoned and a second, optimally centred hole was constructed. The map depicts at each primary hole position, the percent change in SRE if the male abandoned that position and made a centrally positioned secondary hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>A second baffle hole would accrue a large increase in SRE only if the primary hole was near a leaf margin and produced very low SRE to begin with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The only two-holed baffle observed was from a male that made an unusually eccentric primary baffle hole (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In this example, making a more central hole improved SRE by 37.5%, despite increased acoustic short-circuiting. Interestingly, our simulations predict that the more central the primary hole, the less beneficial a secondary baffle hole becomes and in the central zone of the leaf, a second hole becomes deleterious to SRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is because the second hole would fuse with the primary hole effectively enlarging it to a suboptimal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our observations show that the first holes made by males are already close to the centre; if they made a second central hole, six males would have decreased SRE by 6.73 ± 2.77% and the other nine males stood to increase SRE but only by 19.17 ± 11.15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This finding supports the notion that crickets position their baffle holes with geometric optimality, but also avoid jeopardising this optimality. This may be why large, and sought-after, leaves only ever have one baffle hole. Near-optimal SREs are achieved by most males at the first baffling attempt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and most attempts at improvement can be predicted as being futile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The mechanism for baffle optimization</title><p>The question naturally arises as to how tree crickets make acoustically optimal baffles in a single attempt?

Thus, the optimization procedure may also be ‘hard-wired’, rather than learned and may have developed <italic>via</italic> sexual selection.</p><p>We surmise that tree crickets accomplish acoustic optimization using hard-wired heuristics or ‘rules of thumb’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hutchinson and Gigerenzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cross and Jackson, 2005</xref>), which require them to make a series of choices. If a male decides to make a baffle, three simple rules can produce an optimal baffle in a single attempt: (i) find the largest available leaf, (ii) place the hole as close to the centre of the leaf as possible and (iii) cut a hole that can just accommodate wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These rules encode sufficient information to capture the shape of SRE landscape within baffle design space into a simple, yet high-accuracy heuristic that always produces the baffle with the highest possible SRE.</p><p>The accuracy of this heuristic is higher than observed in the progressive optimization procedure observed in mole crickets burrows which always perform just sub-optimally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daws et al., 1996</xref>). At 3 kHz, the burrow resonance is always higher than call frequency at 2.5 kHz and the actual burrow dimensions do not fit optimal dimensions for sound radiation at either frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daws et al., 1996</xref>). The explanation for this sub-optimal performance lies in Weber’s law, whereby sensory systems cannot distinguish between small differences in signal amplitude or frequency at high signal amplitudes due to receptor saturation and habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imaizumi and Pollack, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imaizumi and Pollack, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Givois and Pollack, 2000</xref>).

Tree crickets call only as adults, and for only a few hours each day. Finding and testing each leaf size with every baffle position to find the optimal solution, especially with large leaf sizes being so rare, would require a formidably large number of learning trials and considerable memory. Another possibility is that they can abstract these general rules from a few trials. While we believe that inherited heuristic optimization is a more parsimonious explanation, however, repeating these experiments with naïve males would provide a more definitive answer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Heuristic optimization in object manufacture</title><p>Heuristics are, in essence, rational search methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McFarland, 1991</xref>). When an object or behaviour has different efficiencies depending on a set of parameters, heuristics guide the search for the optimal position in the landscape described by these efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McFarland, 1991</xref>). Therefore, using a heuristic demonstrates the implicit or explicit knowledge that a behaviour can be accomplished in multiple ways and that each way differs in performance. Therefore heuristics, whether invertebrate, or vertebrate including humans, inherited or learned, imply not only an expectation of performance variability, but also choice and behavioural flexibility. One context in which this may be important is tool use; the conventional view is that invertebrates generally inherit tool use behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunt et al., 2013</xref>) and hence have highly <italic>stereotyped</italic> tool use, whereas vertebrates inherit a propensity to ‘innovate’ tool behaviour and hence have <italic>flexible</italic> tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shettleworth, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2010</xref>).

Indeed, we argue that the behavioural flexibility that enables bees to improve upon demonstrated tool use emerges from a heuristic strategy. Bumble bees were trained to roll a ball into a specific position to gain a reward. The bees spontaneously used the ball nearest to the target even when they had been trained on a different ball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loukola et al., 2017</xref>), an excellent example of the well-known greedy heuristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cormen et al., 2009</xref>) in which the nearest solution is the most preferred. Indeed, tree cricket behaviour shows that even inherited heuristic mechanisms may enable flexibility and even optimization, prompting a re-examination of invertebrate tool use.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Baffle-use and sexual selection</title><p>In summary, tree cricket males that call from the edge of leaves tend to have low efficiencies (94–171 mPa/m∙s<sup>−1</sup> depending on leaf size) and those that make baffles can achieve much higher efficiencies (91–386 mPa/m∙s<sup>−1</sup> over same size range). Thus, by finding the largest leaf and making a near optimal baffle, a male tree cricket can increase his active acoustic area by as much as four times (12 dB), greatly increasing his chances of attracting a mate. The increase in call amplitude that baffling confers can work in two ways. Baffling can either add to the existing variability, broadening the distribution of male call amplitudes or it can function as a compensatory mechanism: males unable to call loudly may make a baffle instead.</p><p>Behavioural experiments show that despite the advantage baffles confer, only a few animals choose to make a baffle under natural conditions. Non-host plants with larger leaves are available to the tree crickets, yet are rarely used. The rarity of baffling suggests that manufacturing a baffle may be a costly activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, all mole cricket males stereotypically make acoustic burrow chambers that resonate and boost call amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill, 1999</xref>). The low incidence of baffling and high variability in baffle design observed in natural baffling behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) are quite distinct. Baffling may be used to garner even higher mate-attraction benefits on males whose high quality or condition already allows them to make larger energetic investments. Thus, baffle making may represent a unique system in which ‘good’ males use an acoustically optimized object to further enhance their mate-attraction signal. Another enticing possibility is that baffle-making may have evolved as an alternative strategy allowing smaller males, or those in poorer condition, to sound bigger or louder than they actually are.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vibration measurement of calling crickets in the laboratory</title><p>Vibration velocities from the forewings of freely calling tree cricket (<italic>Oecanthus henryi</italic>) males calling from baffles were measured using a micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (Polytec, PSV-400, Waldbronn, Germany) with a Polytec PSV-I-400 scanning head fitted with a close-up attachment, and digitized using the Polytec Scanning Vibrometer software (version 8.8, Polytec Gmbh, Waldbronn, Germany) through a data acquisition board (National Instruments, PCI-6110, Austin, Texas, USA).</p><p>Acoustic measurements were made simultaneously using two calibrated 1/8th inch precision pressure microphones (Brüel and Kjær, 4138, [frequency range 6 Hz to 140 kHz], Naerum, Denmark) and preamplifier (Brüel and Kjær, 2633, Naerum, Denmark).

The crickets in the choice experiment were maintained at the appropriate temperature (26.3 ± 0.1°C, n = 15) so that they would call at a similar frequency (3.00 ± 0.07 kHz, mean ± SD, n = 9).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4-2"><title>Costal angle</title><p>The costal angle is defined as the angle between the dorsal field of the wing and the lateral or costal field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The angle observed in living crickets was ≈137° (n = 5) and this was the value used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4-3"><title>Leaf wing distance</title><p>The leaf wing distance is the parallel in-plane separation between the leaf and the wings. The distance of real crickets could not be measured directly but was estimated from the video images during vibrometry recording to be around 1 mm and this was the value used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4-4"><title>Leaf tilt angle</title><p>The angle between the leaf surface and wing surface in real crickets appeared to be 0° (both surfaces being parallel to each other) and this was the value used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Effect of leaf length and hole length on sound field</title><p>The combined effect of leaf and hole length was studied by modeling a matrix of combinations. Leaf length was varied from 30 mm to 200 mm at 14 mm intervals and hole length was varied from 5 mm to 20 mm at 0.8 mm intervals. The SRE for each of these matrix combinations was predicted by the FEA model, and the resulting data were linearly interpolated and presented as an image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Effect of baffle hole position on sound field</title><p>The effect of baffle hole position on the leaf (horizontally and vertically) on the resultant radiated acoustic field was studied on a large leaf of average length (115 mm). Baffle holes were placed at a number of positions on the leaf, creating a matrix of locations. The baffle hole was placed at 8 mm intervals in the x direction and 10 mm intervals in the y direction. SRE was predicted by the FEA models for each of the matrix positions. The same method was used when simulating a baffle with two holes. This was converted to % maximum SRE and this matrix was displayed after linear interpolation as an image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The sound field radiating from two examples, a geometrically centered hole, and a hole 30 mm from the center at an angle of 45°, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The reduction in the SRE for crickets calling closer to the edge can be explained by an increase in the acoustic short-circuiting experienced close to the vibrating body where the air pressure amplitude is highest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cricket calling behavior</title><p><italic>Oecanthus henryi</italic> males are observed to call and manufacture baffles from <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic> leaves in the wild. To better understand their interactions with the leaves, we performed three independent studies.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Effect of leaf size on likelihood of baffling</title><p>We first investigated the cricket's likelihood of creating a baffle in a leaf. To understand the range of leaves that may potentially be used as baffles, we measured 570 randomly selected leaves and created a leaf length frequency distribution, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Data were collected from 114 plants across three field sites (50 from site 1, 30 from site 2 and 34 from site 3). Once a calling male was found on a plant, five leaves were picked at random from the plant and their maximum length and breadth was measured using a scale. For this study, the whole plant was divided into four quadrants and a leaf was picked from a randomly selected quadrant at a random distance from the centre of the plant and at a random height using previously generated random numbers.</p><p>From this, we selected 4 sizes of leaf which would be presented singly to a male tree cricket; (a) small (length: 35 ± 2 mm), (b) medium (length: 50 ± 2 mm), (c) large (length: 65 ± 2 mm) and (d) extra-large (length: 115 ± 4 mm).</p><p>51 males were presented with a leaf of randomly picked size once an evening for four consecutive evenings (random sampling without replacement). Each evening an individual male was released onto the twig of the leaf and observed for 3 hr. At the end of the experiment, it was noted if the cricket had made a baffle hole on the leaf. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Leaf size preference and creation of a baffle hole</title><p>We studied the behavior of males when a choice between a small and large leaf was available and also the size and location of a baffle hole they made. The experiment was conducted indoors in an anechoic chamber on 19 males. The setup consisted of two <italic>H. suaveolens</italic> leaves, small (length: 51–73 mm) and large (length: 100–142 mm) attached to a <italic>H. suaveolens</italic> twig pinned to a polystyrene foam base (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The leaves were attached at exactly the same elevation on the twig such that the petioles of the leaves were 180° apart. This creates a decision point. Both leaf stalks were covered using wet cotton to prevent the leaves from desiccating.</p><p>The experimental arena was divided into two halves (left and right) and the orientation of the big leaf (and hence the small leaf) was randomly selected on each night to correct for any directional bias shown by the animals while choosing the leaves. The set-up was covered by a transparent plastic container (150 mm height, 400 mm length and 300 mm width) so that the animals could be confined inside the arena.</p><p>For each trial, an animal was released at the base of the central <italic>H. suaveolens</italic> twig. Trials were conducted in complete darkness and an infra-red sensitive video camera (Sony, XR 500E, Tokyo, Japan) was used to record animal movements and choice. The trials had a cut-off time of 3 hr, within which the animal had to choose a leaf and call from it. If an animal did not call within this duration it was dropped from the experiment. Once the animal selected a leaf and consistently called from it (initially from the edge) for at least 10 min, the plastic container was removed for the rest of the night. Each animal was then recorded calling from the edge of the leaf for at least 70 pulses (200 mm from the front of the animal) and sound pressure level was measured. If the animal then made a baffle, the animal was recorded again for at least 70 pulses and sound pressure level was measured. The recordings were performed using a solid-state audio recorder (Marantz, PMD-660 [frequency range 20 Hz to 20 kHz], Kanagawa, Japan). All calls were recorded at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and were saved as uncompressed sound files. Sound pressure levels of the calls were measured using a calibrated sound level meter (Brüel and Kjær, 2250, Naerum, Denmark) with a ½” microphone (Brüel and Kjær, 4189 [frequency range 20 Hz to 20 kHz], Naerum, Denmark).</p><p>Experiments were conducted at a mean temperature of 26.1° C maintained using a room heater. During the experiment, the temperature of the arena was monitored with a digital thermometer (Testo, 110 Precision Thermometer, Hampshire, UK). Before experiments were started, the animals were acclimatized for 30 min to the temperature in the experimental room. Experiments were conducted in the evenings between 6:45 PM and 9:45 PM, the peak activity time for these animals. The leaf selected by the animal for making a baffle was noted. If any animal did not make a baffle within this time, it was not used for a subsequent trial, i.e. animals were tested only once. One male made two holes of nearly identical dimensions. We have, however, considered only the second hole in our analysis of hole location in order to avoid pseudo replication.</p><p>All leaves used for the trials were scanned using a flatbed scanner (Hewlett-Packard, M10005MFP, Idaho, USA), and the images were used for further analysis. After the trial, the animals were preserved in 70% alcohol and their wings were dissected under a microscope and photographed for measurement. Dimensions of baffle leaves and holes were analyzed using image processing software (ImageJ v1.43, National Institutes of Health, USA). Examples of baffle holes created are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Call recordings were analyzed using commercial analyses software (Pioneer Hill Software, Spectra Plus-Professional - Version 3.0a, Washington, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Baffling and non-baffling leaf size measurements in the wild</title><p>In the field, all the baffling and non-baffling individuals in a plot were localized and the leaves from which they were calling were collected over three field seasons (two dry seasons and one post-monsoon season, 2011–2012). All the field data were collected on marked individuals. Focal individuals were not resampled in this experiment. On each night, a male calling from a baffle was found, and then all the other individuals who were calling in the same plot were found. The length of the leaves from which these males were calling were collected. A total of 27 baffling and 78 non-baffling leaves were collected. These were then pressed separately using a standard botanical tissue collection protocol to ensure they did not change shape or size due to wilting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ministry of Forests Research Program, 1996</xref>). The leaves were brought back to the laboratory and scanned using a flatbed scanner (HP Laser Jet M10005MFP, Idaho, USA) and measured using image processing software (ImageJ version 1.43). Distribution of the leaf sizes used for baffling was compared with the distribution of non-baffling leaf sizes to examine size bias in the choice of leaves used for baffling, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> .</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The project was funded by grants from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council UK, the UK India Education and Research Initiative and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India.

It faces the problem of synchronising the vibration of its two wings with each other, which crickets generally solve by using a phase shifting mechanism (Montealegre-Z et al., 2009, JEB). The other is of sound cancellation cause by the anti-phase sound emanating from the front face and back face of the synchronously vibrating wings, which it solves by using a baffle that prevents this sound cancellation by avoiding this form of acoustic ‘short-circuiting’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This remarkable finding is likely to be of broad interest to researchers studying the evolution of animal behavior, as well as behavioral ecology, neuroethology, and acoustics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Abstract, second to last sentence and several other locations; I find the use of the word materials here misleading, because it implies the animals select from materials with different material properties. Instead it seems more precise to discuss how the animals choose between different possible baffle hole geometries.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a useful observation. We do not wish to talk about material properties such as hardness, density or weight of the leaf. The functional property that is important to the baffle is leaf size and size is what we want to refer to. We have now altered the wording, making the size aspect explicit by using the following phrase: “…they selected the best sized object and modified it appropriately to make a near optimal baffle.” The second part of the sentence, ‘modified it appropriately’ refers to baffle hole geometries.</p><p>The complete statement is explained further in the text: “Thus, given the opportunity males would indeed optimize the SRE of their baffles in terms of both selecting the appropriate materials, i.e. the largest leaf and then modifying it appropriately i.e. cutting a hole of acoustically optimal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).”</p><p>Here, since size is now explicitly mentioned, the terms of reference from the Abstract are now fully explained.</p><p>We also use the word material in a general description of optimization, where we believe using the term material is reasonable. We have added ‘functionally’ to make it more explicit. It now reads: “Optimization, the ability to select the functionally best material and modify it appropriately for a specific function, implies flexibility and is thought to be incompatible with inherited behaviour.”</p><p>Another passage is modified to avoid the issue raised by the referees: “Thus, by finding the best materials and making a near optimal baffle, a male tree cricket can increase his active acoustic area by as much as four times (12 dB), greatly increasing his chances of attracting a mate.” We modify this statement to now read “Thus, by finding the largest leaf and making a near optimal baffle, a male tree cricket can increase his active acoustic area by as much as four times (12 dB), greatly increasing his chances of attracting a mate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, second paragraph and several other locations; The advertisement sounds made by tree crickets are typically not considered to be songs; Only a very lax definition of song (e.g. in Broughton 1963; &quot;Sound of animal origin which is not both accidental and meaningless&quot;) includes these sounds. We recommend to term them calls.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have now changed <italic>songs</italic> to <italic>calls</italic> throughout the text of our manuscript and in the Materials and methods. Additionally, for semantic consistency, we have changed the verb form, <italic>singing/sing</italic> to <italic>calling/call</italic> throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Singing effort and wing speed”, throughout source levels are reported at 200mm which is a less conventional reference distance. Please also report source levels with respect to 1 m distance if possible or discuss in the Materials and methods why 200mm is the better choice if you have a specific compelling reasoning.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the convention in animal bioacoustics is to give the SPL reference at 1m. When dealing with invertebrate calls, a smaller reference distance is often used, especially so for high frequency species (Mhatre and Balakrishnan, 2006; Deb, Balakrishnan, 2014). There are several reasons. One is due to the high level of attenuation calls may face in field conditions. Even under lab conditions, a smaller distance is preferred due to lower call SPLs and the very directional and ‘lobed’ pattern of sound radiation.</p><p>Tree crickets specifically are about an order of magnitude smaller (wings ~1 cm) than the wavelength of sound they produce (~11 cm at 3100 Hz). The result of this is that the sound source is directional (sometimes called ‘lobed’), and that the SPLs they produce are low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Even with a baffle, at 200 mm or 20 cm, the SPL from a calling male was ~60 dB SPL on average. At 1m, the call will be at ~46 dB SPL, which is close to the ambient noise which is generally ~40 dB SPL. In addition, because of a strongly lobed pattern, measuring SPL even slightly off-axis, will cause larger errors at larger distances, making the measurement un-representative of the source SPL. Such small angular deviations are difficult to control for when making measurements from a calling animal which is free to move and reposition itself. Finally, since we use two microphones, in front of and behind the singing male, the reference length is constrained by the size of the acoustic booth and the optical table.</p><p>Thus, the 20 cm distance is chosen for being physically achievable, outside the so-called near-field (&gt; 1λ), having a good signal to noise ratio, and for being representative of the source SPL despite small angular deviation from the true axis of the sound radiator.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Optimization of baffle acoustics”, second paragraph. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is somewhat confusing. The leaf distribution and probability seem to belong to the left axis and SRE to the right axis; this could be made more intuitive by a different color scheme. Also, SD error bars are missing on blue baffle manufacture bars. It might be clearer if the raw data of leaf size and probability for the individuals are added.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the complexity of this figure. Thank you for the suggestion to coordinate the colour of the axis and the line graphs, which will now make the figure clearer. We have changed the axis and the SRE lines all to red and edited the caption to reflect this.</p><p>For the baffle manufacture bars, we have the proportion of 51 individuals that made a baffle. Similarly for the leaves, we have the proportion of leaves in each size class from 570 randomly selected leaves. As such there are no SD/error bars for these data. We apologize for any confusion. To make this explicit, we have changed probability to proportion in the graph. In the legend, we have made the following changes: “(B) Blue bars depict the proportion of males that made baffles on different leaf sizes in a no-choice experiment. Grey bars depict the distribution of natural leaf sizes by depicting the proportion of leaves that fall into different size classes (N=570 leaves). The two red lines depict the SRE associated with baffled singing (solid line), and with unbaffled singing from the leaf edge (wings parallel to the leaf surface, stippled line) at different leaf sizes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Progressive versus single shot optimization”, second paragraph, mole crickets optimize their burrow structure to match call frequency resonance. This contradicts the statement or gist in the Abstract that there are no precedents of optimization in innate behavior, please discuss in the manuscript with accompanying references to frame the novity of the finding in this study better.</p></disp-quote><p>In that passage, we do not mean to imply that there are no precedents in optimization in innate behaviour, and mole crickets truly are an excellent example of such behaviour. Yet, the inflexibility of insect behaviour remains a widely held view, for instance, see the contemporary article by Hunt, Gray and Taylor (Hunt, Gray and Taylor, 2013). To avoid confusion, within the word limit of the Abstract, we have changed the line “Optimization, the ability to select the best material and modify it appropriately for a specific function, implies flexibility and is usually thought to be incompatible with inherited behaviour.”</p><p>Within the manuscript, we discuss mole crickets extensively (Introduction, second paragraph, subsection “Progressive versus single shot optimization”, second paragraph and subsection “The mechanism for baffle optimization”, third paragraph) and the following references in our reference list are about mole cricket burrow use and optimization: Daws, Bennet-Clark and Fletcher, 1996; Bennet-Clark, 1987; Hill, Wells and Shadley, 2006; Hill, 1999.</p><p>Specifically, the entire Results section “Progressive versus single shot optimization” is inspired by a comparison of the differences between mole cricket and tree cricket optimization behaviour. Mole crickets improve their burrow resonance gradually, over about 50 minutes, whereas tree crickets optimize their baffles in a single attempt, and do not often make further modifications.</p><p>In this section, we explore the reasons behind this, consider both the properties of baffles in comparison to burrows and explore how their acoustics would be changed with further modification using a series of FE models. In the discussion, we further consider the differences between the two optimization behaviours with respect to the sensory feedback mechanism (subsection “The mechanism for baffle optimization”, third paragraph). We suggest that the reason behind the slightly suboptimal performance of mole cricket burrows in comparison to heuristic optimization may be due to Weber’s law and reference an excellent recent paper which shows how Weber’s law limits optimization in real ecological systems.</p><p>In short, tree crickets are novel in using a low-error heuristic mechanism for optimization, which allows them to achieve near optimal performance in a single attempt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Progressive versus single shot optimization”, second paragraph and subsection “The mechanism for baffle optimization”, last paragraph. Based on the evidence it cannot be fully excluded that males use the experience they gained in making baffles. E.g. just a few iterations could aid in increasing efficiency, although we would not know how they evaluate this.

Please discuss your perspective on this in the manuscript for completeness and for stimulating further research. We are not asking for these controls as the contribution of the present work is sufficient to merit publication.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true. It is not possible to eliminate this possibility based on the current evidence and further experiments would be required to establish this fully. We have changed the text in this paragraph to reflect this consideration:</p><p>“It is possible that the tree crickets learn the SRE landscape, however, we believe that this is unlikely since the opportunity for learning is small due to life-history and time constraints. […] Another possibility is that they can abstract these general rules from a few trials. While we believe that inherited heuristic optimization is a more parsimonious explanation, repeating the baffle choice experiments with naïve males would provide a more definitive answer.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
