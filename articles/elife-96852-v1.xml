The majority of these signals are located in non-coding regions and likely impact <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (cRE). Because cRE function is dynamic across cell types and states, profiling the epigenetic status of cRE across physiological processes is necessary to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which autoimmune variants contribute to disease risk. We localized risk variants from 15 autoimmune GWAS to cRE active during TCR-CD28 co-stimulation of naïve human CD4+ T cells. To characterize how dynamic changes in gene expression correlate with cRE activity, we measured transcript levels, chromatin accessibility, and promoter–cRE contacts across three phases of naive CD4+ T cell activation using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiC. We identified ~1200 protein-coding genes physically connected to accessible disease-associated variants at 423 GWAS signals, at least one-third of which are dynamically regulated by activation. From these maps, we functionally validated a novel stretch of evolutionarily conserved intergenic enhancers whose activity is required for activation-induced <italic>IL2</italic> gene expression in human and mouse, and is influenced by autoimmune-associated genetic variation. The set of genes implicated by this approach are enriched for genes controlling CD4+ T cell function and genes involved in human inborn errors of immunity, and we pharmacologically validated eight implicated genes as novel regulators of T cell activation. These studies directly show how autoimmune variants and the genes they regulate influence processes involved in CD4+ T cell proliferation and activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immunology</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI137143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK122586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Struan FA</given-names></name><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI110179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The three-dimensional architecture of the genome in distinct cell types predicts genes and regulatory elements involved in cell function and disease.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has linked hundreds of regions of the human genome to autoimmune disease susceptibility. The majority of GWAS variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome and likely contribute to disease risk by modulating <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element (cRE) activity to influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhang and Lupski, 2015</xref>). Identifying causal variants and effector genes molecularly responsible for increased disease risk is critical for identifying targets for downstream molecular study and therapeutic intervention. An understanding of how non-coding variants function is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the mechanism of action, that is, whether a variant is located in a cRE, in which cell types a cRE is active, and which genes are regulated by which cRE.</p><p>CD4+ T cells are key regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses that combat infection by orchestrating the activity of other immune cells. In their quiescent, naïve state, ‘helper’ T cells traffic between the blood and secondary lymphoid tissues as part of an immunosurveillance program maintained by transcription factors (TF) such as KLF2, TOB, and FOXO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weinreich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tzachanis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yusuf and Fruman, 2003</xref>). Upon encountering specific antigen, a cascade of signals activated through the TCR and co-stimulatory receptors results in large-scale changes in gene expression driven by factors like NFKB, NFAT, IRF4, and STATs, leading to proliferation and differentiation into specialized Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets capable of participating in protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saravia et al., 2019</xref>). CD4+ T cells are also key players in the induction and pathogenesis of autoimmunity. The <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory architecture of CD4+ T cells is enriched for autoimmune disease GWAS variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Soskic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Robertson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Soskic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mouri et al., 2022</xref>), and T cells from autoimmune patients harbor distinct epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures linking dysregulated gene expression with disease pathogenesis. Autoimmune variants may contribute to the breakdown of immune self-tolerance by shifting the balance between autoreactive conventional vs. regulatory CD4+ T cells, altering cytokine production, or promoting auto-antigen production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rioux and Abbas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckner, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin conformation assays allow for identification of putative target genes of autoimmune variant-containing cRE in close spatial proximity to gene promoters. Previous work using promoter-capture HiC and HiC in combination with other epigenetic marks has implicated sets of autoimmune variants and effector genes that may participate in T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Javierre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to chromatin conformation approaches, multiple complementary approaches have been developed to link disease-associated SNPs to their downstream effector genes. Expression quantitative trait mapping (eQTL) and chromatin co-accessibility data can be used to implicate effector genes through statistical association of genotypes with readouts of expression or other molecular markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bykova et al., 2022</xref>). However, these approaches do not account for the relevant three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome in the nucleus and are highly susceptible to <italic>trans</italic>-effects and other confounding factors.</p><p>In this study, we measured the impact of TCR-CD28 activation on the autoimmune-associated <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory architecture of CD4+ helper T cells, and by comparing our data to those of several orthogonal GWAS effector gene nomination studies, identify hundreds of effector genes not implicated previously. We find that 3D chromatin-based approaches exhibit two- to tenfold higher predictive sensitivity than eQTL and ABC statistical approaches when benchmarked against a ‘gold standard set’ of genes underlying inborn errors in immunity and tolerance. Our maps of autoimmune SNP-gene contacts also predicted a stretch of evolutionarily conserved, intergenic enhancers that we show are required for normal expression of the canonical T cell activation gene <italic>IL2</italic> in both human and mouse, whose activity is influenced by autoimmune risk variants. The set of variant-connected effector genes defined by 3D physical proximity to autoimmune-associated cRE is enriched for genes that regulate T cell activation, as validated pharmacologically in this study and by CRISPR-based screens in orthogonal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shifrut et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freimer et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gene expression dynamics as a function of naïve CD4+ T cell activation</title><p>To explore the universe of genes and cRE that are affected by and may contribute to CD4+ activation, we characterized the dynamics of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D chromatin conformation in human CD3+CD4+CD45RA +CD45RO-naïve T cells purified directly ex vivo and in response to in vitro activation through the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 for 8 or 24 hr using RNA-seq (N = 3 donors), ATAC-seq (N = 3 donors), and HiC (N = 2 donors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As sequencing depth and restriction enzyme-cutting frequency affect the resolution and reliability of HiC experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Su et al., 2021b</xref>), we constructed libraries with two four-cutter restriction enzymes and sequenced to a total of approximately 4 billion unique-valid reads per timepoint.

These patterns are consistent with known changes in the cellular processes that operate during T cell activation, confirming that in vitro stimulation of CD4+ T cells recapitulates gene expression programs known to be engaged during a T cell immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dynamic changes in chromosomal architecture and genome accessibility during naïve CD4+ T cell activation</title><p>To understand the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory dynamics underlying the observed activation-induced changes in gene expression, we examined CD4+ T cell nuclear chromosome conformation and chromatin accessibility as a function of stimulation state using HiC and ATAC-seq. The human genome consists of ~3 m of DNA that is incorporated into chromatin and compacted into the ~500 cubic micron nucleus of a cell in a hierarchically ordered manner. This degree of compaction results in only ~1% of genomic DNA being accessible to the machinery that regulates gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>); therefore, a map of open chromatin regions (OCR) in a cell represents its potential gene regulatory landscape.

To predict which cRE may regulate which genes in CD4 +T cells across different states of activation, we created 3D maps of cRE-gene proximity in the context of genome structure. The highest order of 3D nuclear genome structure is represented by A/B compartments, which are large chromosomal domains that self-associate into transcriptionally active (A) vs. inactive (B) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with prior studies, we find that OCR located in active A compartments exhibit higher average accessibility than those OCR located in less active B compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), a trend observed across all cell states. Likewise, genes located in A compartments show higher average expression than those located in B compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A quantitative comparison across cell states showed that 94% of the CD4+ T cell genome remained stably compartmentalized into A (42%) and B (52%), indicating that activation does not cause a major shift in the large-scale organization of the genome within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Within each A or B compartment, the genome is further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). These structures are defined by the fact that genomic regions within them have the potential to interact with each other in 3D, but have low potential to interact with regions outside the TAD. The location of TAD boundaries can influence gene expression by limiting the access of cRE to specific, topologically associated genes. While ~80% of TAD boundaries remained stable across all states, 20% of TAD boundaries (8925) changed as a function of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). TAD boundary dynamics were categorized and 2198 boundaries exhibited a change in strength, 2030 boundaries shifted position, and 4697 boundaries exhibited more complex changes such as loss of a boundary resulting in merger of two neighboring TAD, addition of a boundary splitting one TAD into two, or a combination of any of these changes. Genes nearby dynamic TAD boundaries are enriched for pathways involved in RNA metabolism, cellular response to stress, and the activity of PTEN, p53, JAK/STAT, Runx, and Hedgehog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We also detected chromatin stripes, which are TAD-like structures that consist of a genomic anchor region that is brought into contact with a larger loop domain via an active extrusion mechanism. Chromatin stripes are contained within and/or overlap TAD regions, and are enriched for active enhancers and super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mirny et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yoon et al., 2022</xref>). We identified 1526 chromatin stripes in quiescent naïve CD4+ T cells, 1676 stripes in 8 hr stimulated cells, and 2028 stripes at 24 hr post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Consistent with prior studies in other cell types, chromatin stripes were preferentially located in A compartments, and genes and OCR within stripe regions showed increased expression and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>).</p><p>Within active topological structures, transcriptional enhancers can regulate the expression of distant genes by looping to physically interact with gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim and Shiekhattar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamamoto and Fukaya, 2022</xref>). To identify potential regulatory cRE-gene interactions, we identified high-confidence loop contacts across all cell states using Fit-HiC (merged 1 kb, 2 kb, and 4 kb resolutions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This approach detected 933,755 loop contacts in quiescent naïve CD4+ T cells, 900,267 loop contacts in 8 hr stimulated cells, and 551,802 contacts in 24 hr stimulated cells (2,099,627 total unique loops). Approximately 23% of these loops involved a gene promoter at one end and an OCR at the other, and these promoter-interacting OCR were enriched for enhancer signatures based on flanking histone marks from CD4+ T cells in the epigenome roadmap database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). T cell activation resulted in significant reorganization of the open chromatin-promoter interactome as 907 promoter–OCR exhibited increased contact and 1333 showed decreased contact following 8 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Continued stimulation over the next 16 hr was associated with an increase in the contact frequency of 41 promoter–OCR pairs, while only 4 pairs exhibited decreased contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Activation-induced changes in chromatin architecture and gene expression were highly correlated, as genomic regions exhibiting increased promoter connectivity became more accessible at early stages of stimulation, which was associated with increased gene transcription from connected promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). The accessibility of promoter-connected OCR and the expression of their associated genes decreased globally from 8 to 24 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We compared these loop calls to a prior chromatin capture analysis in CD4+ T cells by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burren et al., 2017</xref> and found that roughly 40% of stable loops in both stimulated and unstimulated cells were identical in both studies, despite differing in approach (HiC vs. PCHiC), analysis (HiC vs. CHiCAGO), sample (naïve CD4+ vs. total CD4+), timepoint (8 vs. 4 hr), and donor individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Similarly, most OCR were connected to a single dynamic gene, but many contacted more than one gene (median 2 genes per OCR), suggesting that most dynamic genes have a complex regulatory architecture.

Activation of naïve CD4+ T cells resulted in increased chromatin accessibility around bZIP motifs at tens of thousands of genomic regions by 8 hr post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), which was associated with increased expression of Fos and Jun family members constituting the AP-1 complex, as well as the bZIP factors BATF, BACH1, and BACH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The activity of NFE2 and SMAD was increased without increased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), likely due to post-translational regulation of these factors by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>).

As part of the comparison, we harmonized the chromatin-based datasets using our chromatin loop calling approach and integrated with the same 95% credible set of autoimmune variants to create comparable physical contact maps. A total of 6936 unique genes were implicated by all studies. Our HiC-ATAC-seq approach in naïve and activated human CD4+ implicated 1947 effector genes, 400 of which through proxies in open promoters and 1836 through contacts with distal variants, of which 752 were dynamically regulated throughout activation. The HiC dataset from Gate et al. implicated 110 genes, and the capture-HiC datasets from Burren et al., Yang et al., and Javierre et al. implicated 1408, 2572, and 2368 genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp16">Supplementary file 16</xref>). A total of 369 autoimmune GWAS effector genes were predicted in common by our HiC approach and the pcHiC-based approaches. The eQTL studies by Soskic et al., Gate et al., Ye et al., and Schmiedel et al. (DICE) implicated 171, 15, 15, and 221 genes, and the co-accessibility data from Gate et al. implicated 45 genes. Concordance between our gene predictions and the pcHiC predictions ranged from 15 to 24% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), while concordance between our predictions and the eQTL predictions was low (0.6–5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and concordance among eQTL studies was also low (1.6–13%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The set of genes from our study with disease-associated SNPs located in their open promoters overlapped with only 5% of the genes from the gold standard set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp16">Supplementary file 16</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, leveraging our HiC data to include distal autoimmune variants captured interacting with open gene promoters increased the sensitivity of the approach threefold to 16% (71 overlapping genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), confirming the relevance of long-range promoter–cRE/SNP contacts. This level of sensitivity is comparable to that of other chromosome capture-based datasets for predicting HIEI genes in CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, the eQTL-based approaches were 3- to ~12-fold less sensitive than the chromatin-constrained approaches in predicting HIEI genes, with most recalling 0–2.5% and the DICE eQTL dataset recalling 6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Restricting our 3D chromatin V2G to only those genes dynamically regulated during T cell activation reduced predictive power from 16 to 10%, but the fraction of these genes in the HIEI gold standard set (precision) increased from ~4 to 6.2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that focusing the V2G set on those SNP-gene pairs that are dynamically regulated by T cell activation reduces potential false-positive predictions. The precision of our dataset was superior to that of the other chromosome capture-based datasets except for the Burren pcHiC dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The eQTL approaches were comparable to the 3D chromatin-based datasets in precision (~3–6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>We also analyzed the relative predictive power of a recently proposed ‘activity-by-contact’ (ABC) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nasser et al., 2021</xref>) that uses a multi-tissue averaged HiC dataset instead of cell type-matched 3D chromatin-based data to link variants to genes. This model constrains the input data by removing bidirectional, antisense, and small RNAs, and potentially underweights distal elements connected to ubiquitously expressed genes due to stronger average activity scores near their promoters. Also, while most human genes have multiple alternative transcriptional start sites (median = 3), ABC only annotates only one promoter per gene. To apply the ABC gene nomination model to our CD4+ T cell chromatin-based V2G data, we used our ATAC-seq data and publicly available CD4+ T cell H3K27ac ChIP-seq data as input, and integrated this with GWAS and the averaged HiC dataset from the original ABC study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nasser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fulco et al., 2019</xref>). The ABC model nominated 650 genes compared to 1836 genes using our cell type-matched HiC data and analysis pipeline. Only 357 genes were nominated by both approaches, while 1479 genes nominated by our approach were not implicated by the ABC model, and 293 genes not implicated by our approach were newly implicated by ABC. To measure the predictive power of the ABC approach, we re-ran the precision-recall re-analysis with all datasets subjected to the ABC gene-promoter filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We found that applying the restricted ABC model promoter annotation to all datasets did not have a large effect on recall; however, the precision of several of the datasets was affected. For example, using the restricted promoter/gene set reduced the precision of our V2G approach and artificially inflated the precision of the ‘nearest gene to SNP’ metric. The precision-recall analysis also shows that the ABC score-based approach is only half as powerful at predicting HIEI genes as the chromatin-based V2G approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This indicates that informing GWAS data with cell type- and state-specific 3D chromatin-based data brings more target gene predictive power than application of the multi-tissue-averaged HiC used by the ABC model. Together, these analyses indicate that chromosome capture-based V2G is a more sensitive approach for identifying ‘true’ effector genes than eQTL or ABC approaches, but comes with additional predicted genes that represent either false positives or true effector genes for which monogenic LOF/GOF mutations have not yet been characterized in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional validation of novel autoimmune V2G-predicted enhancers at the <italic>IL2</italic> locus</title><p>Our 3D chromatin-based analysis specifically predicts dynamic, disease-associated regulatory elements in intergenic space at the <italic>IL2</italic> locus.

Activation-induced transcription of <italic>IL2</italic> involves an upstream regulatory region (URR) ~375 bp from the TSS that has served as a paradigm of tissue-specific, inducible gene transcription for nearly four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fujita et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Durand et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Novak et al., 1990</xref>). However, the presence of evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences (CNS) in the ~150 kb of intergenic space 46, 51, 80, 83, 85, 96, 122, and 128 kb upstream of the TSS suggests that additional regulatory elements may have evolved to control <italic>IL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mehra and Wells, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The –51 kb CNS contains an SNP linked to T1D, IBD, PSO, CEL, and allergy (rs72669153), while the –85 kb CNS contains an SNP linked to RA (rs6232750) and the –128 kb CNS contains two SNPs linked to T1D, JIA, and SLE (rs1512973 and rs12504008, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In TCR/CD28-stimulated naïve CD4+ T cells, these CNS are remodeled to become highly accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and they loop to interact physically with the <italic>IL2</italic> URR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) at both timepoints. ChIP-seq analyses in human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Consortium, 2004</xref>) show that the URR and all distal CNS except –85 are occupied by TF such as Jun/Fos (AP-1), NFAT, and NFkB that are known regulators of <italic>IL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the −85,–122, and –128 CNS are occupied by additional TF not previously thought to be direct regulators of <italic>IL2</italic>, such as MYC, BCL6, and STAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Recombinant reporter assays in primary activated human CD4+ T cells showed that the −46,–51, –83, and –128 CNS/OCR can enhance transcription from the URR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To determine whether the native elements contribute to the expression of <italic>IL2</italic>, we targeted each CNS/OCR individually in primary human CD4+ T cells or Jurkat T cells using CRISPR/CAS9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and measured IL-2 secretion following TCR/CD28 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Deletion of the −46,–51, −83, –85, –122, and –128 kb elements in primary human CD4+ T cells each resulted in an ~50% reduction in IL-2 production, while deletion of the –80 kb element had little effect. A very similar pattern of impact was observed when these elements were deleted individually in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The URR has a stronger contribution to IL-2 production than any individual intergenic element, as deletion of the URR almost completely abrogated activation-induced IL-2 production by both primary CD4+ or Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To determine whether these intergenic enhancers exist in synergistic epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lin et al., 2022</xref>) necessary for <italic>IL2</italic> transactivation, we generated Jurkat T cell clones in which the stretch of all seven elements located 46–128 kb upstream of <italic>IL2</italic> was deleted using CRISPR/CAS9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Despite the URR and 46 kb of upstream sequence being intact in these clones, loss of the 81.3 kb stretch of intergenic enhancers renders these cells incapable of expressing <italic>IL2</italic> at both the mRNA and protein levels in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These results show that the URR is not sufficient for activation-induced expression of <italic>IL2</italic>, and that <italic>IL2</italic> has a previously unappreciated, complex, and autoimmune disease-associated regulatory architecture that was accurately predicted by our 3D epigenomic V2G approach. Importantly, we find that the distal <italic>IL2</italic> cRE are highly accessible in quiescent memory T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Th1-17, Th22) isolated directly ex vivo from human blood, whereas naïve CD4+ T cells and non-IL-2-producing Treg showed little accessibility at these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that stable remodeling of distal <italic>IL2</italic> cRE can persist in vivo after TCR signals cease, and that this epigenetic imprinting contributes to the immediate, activation-induced production of IL-2 exhibited by memory, but not naïve or regulatory, CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hedlund et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Picker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sojka et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Functional validation of autoimmune variant-to-gene (V2G)-implicated <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (cRE) at the <italic>IL2</italic> locus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The combination of evolutionary conservation (blue), open chromatin (red), and autoimmune disease-associated SNPs at the <italic>IL2</italic> locus identify putative cRE in quiescent vs. 8 hr activated naïve CD4+ T cells.

Genes implicated by V2G in activated CD4+ T cells were moderately enriched for genes known to control the production of IFN-G, but at the individual disease level, only genes connected to CRO- and ATD-associated variants were enriched for IFNG regulatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

As shown above, this approach validates genes that are well-studied regulators of T cell function; however, a significant portion of implicated genes are not well-studied and are not currently known to regulate T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). We observed a trend that genes expressed more highly in immune tissues (GTEX) have in general been better investigated and identified several less-studied genes that could be novel targets, including <italic>GRK6, PTK6, SIK1,</italic> and <italic>MAP3K11</italic> encoding kinases, <italic>OXER1, GPR183, GPR18,</italic> and <italic>KISS1R</italic> encoding G-protein-coupled receptors, CHRNB1 encoding an acetylcholine receptor, and <italic>GART</italic> encoding a de novo purine pathway enzyme. To determine whether these V2G-implicated genes are novel regulators of T cell activation, we used commercially available pharmacological modulators in dose–response assays of activation-induced T cell proliferation. Stimulation of T cells in the presence of ligands for CHRNB1, KISS1R and OXER1 did not significantly affect T cell proliferation; however, small molecules targeting GRK6, PTK6, MAP3K11, GPR183, GART, and SIK1 inhibited T cell activation in the nanomolar to micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Together, these data show that maps of dynamic, 3D variant-gene chromatin contacts in stimulated CD4+ T cells are able to identify genes with bona fide roles in T cell activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By measuring dynamic changes in chromosome folding, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression in naïve CD4+ T cells as a function of TCR-CD28 co-stimulation, we identified the putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscape of autoimmune disease-associated genetic variation and physically connected these elements to their putative effector genes. This and prior chromosome capture-based studies show that most cRE and their variants interact with, and therefore have the potential to regulate, more than one gene (median 5 in this study), supporting a scenario in which multiple effector genes are operative at a GWAS locus. We validated a stretch of novel distal elements predicted by our V2G approach as bona fide enhancers for the canonical immune gene <italic>IL2</italic> and showed that autoimmune-associated genetic variation at one of these elements influences its activity. We also conducted pharmacological targeting experiments and compared our results with CRISPR-based studies to validate sets of bona fide effector genes with a confluence of multiple orthogonal lines of evidence supporting their role in CD4+ T cell activation.</p><p>We also observe that the vast majority (87–95%) of GWAS effector genes predicted by chromosome capture-based approaches are not the genes nearest to the sentinel SNPs queried in this study, while roughly one-third of eGenes predicted by eQTL approaches are the nearest to a sentinel. This and the low concordance between 3D chromatin vs. eQTL eGene predictions is consistent with the view that eQTL-based and GWAS-based approaches inherently implicate different types of genes. While eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites of genes with simple regulatory structures and low enrichment for functional annotations, GWAS variants are generally far from the TSS of genes with complex regulatory landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mostafavi et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, eGene discovery by eQTL studies using scRNA-seq approaches are significantly limited by the low gene detection power inherent to these methods, particularly in rare cell types.</p><p>Our systematic comparison of 3D chromatin-based target gene nomination studies in human CD4+ T cells revealed significant variability between datasets, with the highest concordance exhibited by the Javierre and Burren datasets (37%) and the next highest exhibited by our V2G and the Javierre dataset (24%). Although we harmonized the comparisons as much as possible by subjecting each dataset to the same HiC loop calling and GWAS integration steps, there are several potential sources for the observed discrepancy between the studies. The modes of stimulation are largely comparable, but timepoints and donors varied, and ours was the only study that sorted naïve CD4+ T cells prior to stimulation. The higher concordance among promoter-capture datasets compared to our HiC dataset is likely due to their lower resolution compared to our HiC and their greater sequencing depth focused at promoters compared to HiC. The lower resolution of HindIII-based capture-HiC results in loops called to the wrong promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Su et al., 2021b</xref>) and will miss distal SNP interactions at any promoters excluded from the capture set. While HiC is unbiased in this regard, high-resolution HiC will fail to call some SNP-promoter loops because the sequencing depth is spread across the whole genome instead of focused at promoters. However, despite variation between studies, the results show the clear value of tissue-matched chromatin conformation maps compared to tissue-averaged HiC for understanding the complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression and for predicting autoimmune effector genes.</p><p>Why do the V2G approaches not capture a larger proportion of genes from the human inborn errors in immunity ‘truth set’? Low recall/sensitivity could result from the fact that a substantial portion of the mutations in the full HIEI gene set result in immunodeficiency but not autoimmune phenotypes. However, restricting the HIEI truth set to only those disease gene mutations that result in an autoimmune phenotype (143 genes) only increased recall from 16 to 17.5%, suggesting that this is not a major factor reducing sensitivity. Also, our method uses GWAS signals as an input, and unlike GWAS for height, body mass index, blood traits, etc., most autoimmune GWAS signals are likely not saturated, which limits discoverability. Another reason for reduced sensitivity is the likelihood that many of the genes in the HIEI truth set operate in cells other than CD4+ T cells, and consistent with this, when the Javierre pcHiC V2G is extended to all immune cell types tested, recall increases from 17 to 27%. This observation emphasizes how limited inclusion cell types and states in a study can significantly limit the power to detect autoimmune effector genes. Why are so few of our 3D chromatin-based V2G genes present in the HIEI truth set? Low precision could be due to false positives in the V2G gene set; that is, contacts between disease-associated cRE and genes that are not in fact involved in disease susceptibility. This does not argue per se against the biological relevance of the cRE or the gene, only that the linkage to disease susceptibility is not relevant. Alternatively, the absence of chromatin-GWAS-implicated genes in the truth set could be a false negative from the point of view of the truth set; that is, monogenic, disease-causing mutations in these genes may exist in the human population, but have not yet been discovered. For example, in the year 2000 approximately 100 monogenic mutations causing human inborn errors of immunity were known, but this increased by ~11 disease mutations per year until 300 human inborn errors of immunity had been identified by 2017. The advent of next-generation exome/genome sequencing and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in the rate of HIEI discovery between 2018 and 2021 to ~40 per year to the current recognized HIEI of ~450. If we assume a conservative continued rate of HIEI discovery of 25 disease genes per year, the next 10 years will show us an additional ~250 disease genes that are not currently contained in the truth set.</p><p>Many of the genes identified in this 3D epigenomic V2G screen have known roles in T cell activation and function. An example is <italic>IL2</italic>, and we used the resulting maps to identify and validate a stretch of previously unknown distal enhancers whose activity is required for <italic>IL2</italic> expression and is influenced by autoimmune genetic variation. Another example is the phosphatase DUSP5 that regulates MAPK signaling during T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kovanen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chuang and Tan, 2019</xref>). However, roles for many of the genes implicated here in T cell activation are not known. For example, one of the top implicated genes, PARK7, is a deglycase studied in the context of Parkinson’s disease, but has recently been shown to modulate regulatory T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Danileviciute et al., 2022</xref>). The orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR108 is another top gene uniquely implicated by our chromatin-based V2G that has not been studied in T cells, but was identified in a recent CRISPR screen for genes affecting IL-2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freimer et al., 2022</xref>). Also co-implicated by our study and recent CRISPR screens are the cannabidiol receptor GPR18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McHugh et al., 2010</xref>) and the purine biosynthetic enzyme GART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kan et al., 1993</xref>). The GPR18 agonist arachidonyl glycine inhibited CD4+ T cell activation above 10 uM, while the GPR18 antagonist O-1918 slightly enhanced T cell activation. This GPR was implicated by both chromatin- and eQTL-based approaches. Antagonism of GART, an enzyme we previous identified as a V2G effector gene in COVID19 severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pahl et al., 2022</xref>), with the FDA-approved drug lometrexol inhibited T cell activation in the 10 nM range. Antagonism of GRK6, a member of the G-coupled receptor kinase family associated with insulin secretion and T2D susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Varney et al., 2022</xref>), and PTK6, an oncogenic kinase studied in the context of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gilic and Tyner, 2020</xref>), led to the inhibition of T cell activation in the nM to uM range. These targets were implicated by the other chromatin-based approaches but not by eQTL. Inhibition of MAP3K11, a kinase that facilitates signaling through JNK1 and IkappaB kinase in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Slattery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knackmuss et al., 2016</xref>), inhibited stimulation-induced CD4+ T cell proliferation in the 100 nM range, as did 25-hydroxycholesterol, a ligand of the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR183 that was implicated by both chromatin- and eQTL-based approaches. SIK1 is a member of the salt-inducible kinase family uniquely implicated in our study that negatively regulates TORC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darling and Cohen, 2021</xref>), and a small-molecule SIK1 inhibitor potently antagonized stimulation-induced CD4+ T cell activation in the pM range.</p><p>Our integration of high-resolution Hi-C, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and GWAS data in a single immune cell type across multiple activation states identified hundreds of autoimmune variant-gene pairs at approximately half of all GWAS loci studied, and application of this technique to additional immune cell types will likely identify effector genes at many of the remaining loci.

protein complex, and electroporation was done using P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L (Lonza, Cat# V4XP-3024) and Lonza 4D nucleofector system. B2M gene was CRISPR targeted as a positive control. As per the manufacturer’s protocol, cells were electroporated pulse code Fl-115 in 100 uL cuvette format. After nucleofection, cells were allowed to rest in the complete media for ~2 days. Cells were then harvested, washed with PBS, and aliquots of cells were used for further experimentation such as flow staining and cell activation. Primary human CD4 T cells (0.1e6/well) were seeded in triplicates (for each experimental condition) in 96-well plate format in RPMI complete medium and stimulated using ImmunoCult Human CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (STEM Cells Technologies, Cat# 10971). Cell culture supernatants were collected at 4 hr of stimulation and stored at –80°C until assayed. IL-2 ELISA was performed using Thermo Fisher Scientific IL-2 Human Uncoated ELISA Kit with Plates, Cat# 88-7025-76.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Recombinant reporter assays</title><p>The <italic>IL2</italic> URR was cloned into XhoI and HindIII sites of PGL4 Luc vector (Promega) and then ~500 bp individual sequence representing <italic>IL2-IL21</italic> intergenic CNS at −46,–51, −80,–83, −85, –128 were cloned upstream to IL-2 URR at the XhoI site of the pGL4 vector. Primary human CD4 T cells obtained from five normal healthy donors were transfected with PGL4-cRE-URR constructs. Briefly, primary human CD4 T cells were activated with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 Dynabeads (1:1) (Thermo Fisher scientific, Cat# 11161D)+IL-2 overnight, and then 1 million aliquots of cells (triplicates) were electroporated using Nucleofector 2b, human T cell Nuclefactor kit (Lonza VPA# 1002, program# T-020) with 2 ug of PGL4 firefly vector constructs along with 0.2 ug of PGL4 Renilla vector; cells were allowed to rest overnight in RPMI+IL-2 and then re-stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3+anti-CD28 (2 ug/mL each) for 5 hr. Dual luciferase assay was performed with cell lysate prepared using Promega dual luciferase assay kit. Cell lysate was prepared in PLB as per the manufacturer’s protocols, and then firefly and renilla luciferase activities were analyzed using spectramax ID5 (Molecular Devices). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized against the internal control renilla luciferase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Pharmacological validation of novel T cell activation regulatory genes</title><p>The drugs lometrexol (GART antagonist), 25-hydroxycholesterol (GPR183 ligand), epinephrine and norepinephrine (CHRNB agonists), and arachidonoyl glycine (GPR18 agonist) were purchased from Sigma. The GPR18 antagonist O-1918 was purchased from ChemCruz. CEP1347 (MAP3K11 antagonist), kisspeptin 234 (KISSIR ligand) and the PTK6 antagonist tilfrinib were purchased from Tocris. The GRK6 antagonist GRK-IN-1 was purchased from DC Chemicals. The SIK1 antagonist HG-91-9-1 was purchased from Selleckchem. The OXER1 agonist 5-Oxo-ete was purchased from Cayman Chemicals. The drugs were dissolved in DMSO or ethanol as suggested by the vendor, and working stocking concentrations were prepared in RPMI1640 medium or PBS. The drug effect on T cell proliferation was assayed using murine lymphocytes cultured under TCR and CD28 activation conditions. Spleen and lymph nodes were collected from 6- to 8-week-old female C57BL/7 mice, and single-cell lymphocyte cell suspensions were prepared in RPMI 1640 complete medium. 20 million lymphocytes were labeled with CFSE and re-suspended in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells (0.5 million labeled cells/well) were loaded into 48-well culture plate and activated with mouse anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 agonistic antibodies (1 μg mL each). Drugs at the indicated concentrations were added in the culture medium, and both untreated and drug treated cell cultures were incubated at 37°C for 72 hr in a cell culture incubator. Cells were harvested after 3 days of culture, washed with PBS, and then stained with live-dead aqua dye. After washing with FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS), cells were stained with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies CD4-APC, CD8-PB, CD44-Percp Cy5.5, and CD25-BV650. Stained cells were analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Cytoflex S flow cytometer. The division profile of CD4+CFSE+ T cells was gated on live populations. The flow data was analyzed using Flowjo10 software, and the number of divided CD4+ T cells was determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wells et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health at the AAALAC-accredited Children's Hospital of Philadelphia vivarium under an IACUC-approved protocol.

They find over a 1000 genes physically linked with autoimmune disease loci in these cells, many of which are upregulated upon T cell activation. Focusing on IL2, they dissect the regulatory architecture of this locus, including the allelic effects of GWAS variants. They also intersect their variant-to-gene lists with data from CRISPR screens for genes involved in CD4 T cell activation and expression of inflammatory genes, finding enrichments for regulators. Finally, they showed that pharmacological inhibition of some of these genes impacts T cell activation.</p><p>This is a solid study that follows a well-established canvas for variant-to-gene prioritisation using 3D genomics, applying it to activated T cells.

The authors cite these papers and present a comparative analysis of their variant-to-gene assignments (in addition to scRNA-seq eQTL-based assignments). Furthermore, they find that the Burren analysis yields a higher enrichment for gold standard genes.</p><p>I thank the authors for their revisions in response to my initial review. The revised version now includes a more comprehensive comparative analysis of different datasets and V2G approaches and discusses the potential sources of differences in the results. Most significantly, the authors have now included an interesting comparison of their methodology with the popular ABC technique and outlined the key limitations of ABC relative to their method and other (Capture) Hi-C-based V2G approaches.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96852.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>There is significant interest in characterizing the mechanisms by which genetic mutations linked to autoimmunity perturb immune processes. Pahl et al. collect information of dynamic accessible regions, genes, and 3D contacts in primary CD4+ T cell samples that have been stimulated ex vivo. The study includes a variety of analyses characterizing these dynamic changes. With TF footprinting they propose factors linked to active regulatory elements. They compare the performance of their variant mapping pipeline that uses their data versus existing datasets. Most compelling there was a deep dive into additional study of regulatory elements nearby the IL2 gene. Finally, they perform a pharmacological screen targeting several genes they suggest are involved in T cell proliferation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The work done characterizing elements at the IL2 locus is impressive.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- There are extensive studies performed on resting and activated immune cell states (CD4+ T cells and other cell types) and some at multiple time points or concentrations of stimuli that collect ATAC-seq and/or RNA-seq. Several analyses performed in published studies were similarly performed in this study. I expected the authors to at least briefly mention published studies and whether their conclusions generally agree or disagree. Are the same dynamic regulatory regions or genes identified upon T cell activation? Are the same TF footprints enriched in these dynamic regulatory elements? In the revision, I appreciate that the authors now include additional data from several studies that I had initially suggested for the purposes of nominating disease genes in their precision-recall analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96852.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper used RNAseq, ATACseq, and Hi-C to assess gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin physical associations for native CD4+ T cells as they respond to stimulation through TCR and CD28. With these data in hand, the author identified 423 GWAS signals to their respective target genes, where most of these were not in the proximal promoter, but rather distal enhancers. The IL-2 gene was used as an example to identify new distal cis regulatory regions required for optimal IL-2 gene transcription. These distal elements interact with the proximal IL2 promoter region. When the distal enhancer contained an autoimmune SNP, it affected IL-2 gene transcription. The authors also identified genetic risk variants that were associated to genes upon activation.

(Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors profile gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and chromosomal architecture (by Hi-C) in activated CD4 T cells and use this information to link non-coding variants associated with autoimmune diseases with putative target genes. They find over 1000 genes physically linked with autoimmune disease loci in these cells, many of which are upregulated upon T cell activation. Focusing on IL2, they dissect the regulatory architecture of this locus, including the allelic effects of GWAS variants. They also intersect their variant-to-gene lists with data from CRISPR screens for genes involved in CD4 T cell activation and expression of inflammatory genes, finding enrichments for regulators. Finally, they showed that pharmacological inhibition of some of these genes impacts T-cell activation.</p><p>This is a solid study that follows a well-established canvas for variant-to-gene prioritisation using 3D genomics, applying it to activated T cells. The authors go some way in validating the lists of candidate genes, as well as exploring the regulatory architecture of a candidate GWAS locus. Jointly with data from previous studies performing variant-to-gene assignment in activated CD4 T cells (and other immune cells), this work provides a useful additional resource for interpreting autoimmune disease-associated genetic variation.</p><p>Suggestions for improvement:</p><p>Autoimmune disease variants were already linked with genes in CD28-stimulated CD4 T cells using chromosome conformation capture, specifically Promoter CHi-C and the COGS pipeline (Javierre et al., Cell 2016; Burren et al., Genome Biol 2017; Yang et al., Nat Comms 2020). The authors cite these papers and present a comparative analysis of their variant-to-gene assignments (in addition to scRNA-seq eQTL-based assignments). Furthermore, they find that the Burren analysis yields a higher enrichment for gold standard genes.</p><p>The obvious question that the authors don't venture into is why the results are quite different. In principle, this could be due to the differences between:</p><p>(a) the cell stimulation procedure</p><p>(b) the GWAS datasets used</p><p>(c) the types of assay (Hi-C vs Capture Hi-C)</p><p>(d) approaches for defining gene-linked regions (loops vs neighbourhoods)</p><p>(e) how the GWAS signals at gene-linked regions are aggregated (e.g., the flavours of COGS in Javierre and Burren vs the authors' approach)</p><p>Re (a), I'm not sure the authors make it explicitly clear in the main text that the Capture Hi-Cbased studies also use *stimulated* CD4 T cells, particularly in the section &quot;Comparative predictive power...&quot;. So the cells used are pretty much the same, and the differences likely arise from points (b) to (e).</p><p>It would be useful for the community to understand more clearly what is driving these differences, ideally with some added data. Could the authors, for example, take the PCHi-C data from Javierre/Burren and use their GWAS data and variant-to-gene assignment algorithms?</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the referee’s expert assessment of our work and its value to the field, and we are glad that the referee was enthused by our comparison of the predictive power of the various V2G approaches. A point not emphasized enough in the original version of the manuscript is that we actually did harmonize the various datasets in the way the referee suggests for the precision/recall analysis. We took the contact maps presented from each paper, mapped genes using the same set of GWAS SNPs, and defined all gene-linked regions using our loop calling approach. This has been clarified in the revised version of the manuscript. We have now included a more thoughtful discussion of the possible sources of discrepancy between the different studies included in the comparison, and our thoughts on the potential sources raised by the referee are outlined below:</p><p>(a) The modes of stimulation used are similar between studies, but timepoints and donors did vary, and ours was the only study that sorted naïve CD4+ T cells before stimulation. These aspects could represent a source of variability.</p><p>(b) The GWAS is not a source of variability because we re-ran the raw data from all the orthogonal studies through our V2G pipeline using the same GWAS as in the current manuscript.</p><p>(c) The use of HiC vs. Capture HiC is a likely source of variability. The Capture-HiC datasets included in our comparison are lower resolution (i.e. HindIII) but focus higher sequencing depth at promoters compared to our HiC datasets – i.e., Capture-HiC may mis-call loops to the wrong promoters due to lower resolution as we have shown in our previous study [Su, Human Genetics, 2021], and will miss distal SNP interactions at promoters not included in the capture set. While HiC is unbiased in this regard, HiC will fail to call some SNP-promoter loops called by CaptureHiC because the sequencing power is not specifically focused at promoters.</p><p>(d) For studies using neighborhood approaches, we re-ran the raw data through our loop calling algorithm to connect distal SNP to gene promoters, and regarding (e) above, we ran the raw data through our V2G pipeline to allow a better comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, given that the authors use Hi-C, a popular method for V2G prioritisation for this type of data is currently ABC (Nasser et al, Nature 2021). Could the authors provide a comparative analysis with respect to the V2G assignments in the paper and, if they see it appropriate, also run ABC-based GWAS integration on their own Hi-C data?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, which we have followed in the revised version of our manuscript. It should be noted (and we do so in the text of the revision) that there is an important caveat to bringing in the ABC model. Chromosome conformation-based approaches are biologically constrained (i.e., informed) by the natural structure of chromatin in the nucleus that controls how gene transcription is regulated in cis, and it does so in a way that brings value to GWAS data. However, the ABC model further constrains the input data by imposing non-biological filters that allow the algorithm to be applied, but impose artifactual limitations that may negatively impact interpretation and discovery. In addition to filtering out pseudogenes, bidirectional RNA, antisense RNAs, and small RNAs, the ABC model gene set eliminates genes ubiquitously expressed across tissues (based on the assumption that these genes are driven primarily by elements adjacent to their promoters) and only allows annotation of one promoter per gene, even though the median number of promoters per gene in the human genome is three. In contrast, our chromatin-based V2G removes pseudogenes, but includes lincRNA and small RNAs, and includes all alternative transcription start sites annotated by gencode.</p><p>To apply the ABC GWAS gene nomination model to our CD4+ T cell chromatin-based V2G data, we used our ATAC-seq data and publicly available CD4+ T cell H3K27ac ChIP-seq data as input, and integrated this with GWAS and the average ENCODE-derived HiC dataset from the original ABC paper. The activity-by-contact model nominated 650 genes, compared to 1836 genes when using our cell type-matched HiC data and analysis pipeline. Only 357 of these genes were nominated by both approaches; 1479 genes nominated by our approach were not nominated by ABC, while 293 genes not implicated by our approach were newly implicated by ABC. To determine how the ABC-constrained approach performs against the HIEI gold standard set, we subjected all datasets used for the comparison depicted in the new Figure 5D to the same promoter filter used by the ABC model prior as part of the precision-recall re-analysis. Firstly, we found that applying the restricted ABC model promoter annotation to all datasets did not have a large effect on recall, however, the precision of several of the datasets were affected. For example, using the restricted promoter set reduced the precision of our (Pahl) V2G approach and inflated the precision of the nearest gene to SNP metric. Second, the new precision-recall analysis shows that the ABC score-based approach is only half as sensitive at predicting HIEI genes as the chromatin-based V2G approaches. This indicates that constraining GWAS data with cell type- and state-specific 3D chromatin-based data brings more GWAS target gene predictive power than application of the multi-tissue-averaged HiC used by the ABC model. We thank the reviewer for helpful suggestions that have improved the quality of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>There is significant interest in characterizing the mechanisms by which genetic mutations linked to autoimmunity perturb immune processes. Pahl et al. collect information on dynamic accessible regions, genes, and 3D contacts in primary CD4+ T cell samples that have been stimulated ex vivo. The study includes a variety of analyses characterizing these dynamic changes. With TF footprinting they propose factors linked to active regulatory elements. They compare the performance of their variant mapping pipeline that uses their data versus existing datasets. Most compelling there was a deep dive into additional study of regulatory elements nearby the IL2 gene. Finally, they perform a pharmacological screen targeting several genes they suggest are involved in T cell proliferation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work done characterizing elements at the IL2 locus is impressive.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Missing critical context to evaluate claims. There are extensive studies performed on resting and activated immune cell states (CD4+ T cells and other cell types) and some at multiple time points or concentrations of stimuli that collect ATAC-seq and/or RNA-seq that have been ignored by this study. How do conclusions from previous studies compare to what the authors conclude here? It is impossible to evaluate the claims without this additional context. These are a few studies I am familiar with (the authors should perform a more comprehensive search to be sure they're not ignoring existing observations) that would be important to compare/contrast conclusions: o Alasoo, K. et al.

Our precision-recall analyses were not meant to represent an exhaustive comparison of all prior GWAS gene nomination studies, although we agree that this could (and should) be done as part of a separate study in a future manuscript. Instead, we focused on gene nomination studies that (1) analyzed resting and activated human CD4+ T cells, (2) whose experimental design was most comparable to our own studies, and (3) had raw data readily available in the appropriate formats to allow re-analysis and harmonization before comparison. This is a point we did not make sufficiently clear in the original version of the manuscript, but have clarified in the revision.</p><p>Based on this rationale, we agree that the studies by Gate et al. and Ye et al. should be included in our comparative precision-recall analysis, and we have done so in the revised manuscript. The Gate study reported ATAC-seq peak co-accessibility, caQTL, eQTL, and HiC data, and we now include the resulting gene nominations from these datasets in the precision-recall analysis. These datasets performed poorly with respect to nomination of HIEI genes, likely due to small sample numbers and low sequencing depth compared to the other eQTL and chromatin capture-based studies. The eQTL reported by Ye et al. nominated 15 genes for autoimmune traits, two of which were in the ‘truth’ HIEI set (IL7R and IL2RB). This resulted low predictive power but a high precision due to the low number of nominated genes compared to the other V2G datasets. As suggested by referee 1, we have also subjected our data to the ‘activity-by-contact’ (ABC) algorithm and have included this dataset in the comparison as well. Please see Figure 5 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have elected not to include data from the other studies suggested by the referee for the following reasons: The stimulation paradigm used in the Glinos study is very different from that used in other studies. Also, this study and the study by Calderon did not nominate genes. The studies by Alasoo et al. and Kim-Hellmuth et al. analyzed macrophages, which are not a comparable cell type to CD4+ T cells. The allele-specific eQTL study by Gutierrez-Arcelus et al. included relevant the cell type and activation states, but included a relatively small number of samples (24) and variants (561), and the raw data in dbGAP does not readily allow for re-analysis and harmonization with the other studies. We thank the reviewer for helpful suggestions that have improved the quality of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper used RNAseq, ATACseq, and Hi-C to assess gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin physical associations for native CD4+ T cells as they respond to stimulation through TCR and CD28. With these data in hand, the authors identified 423 GWAS signals to their respective target genes, where most of these were not in the proximal promoter, but rather distal enhancers. The IL-2 gene was used as an example to identify new distal cisregulatory regions required for optimal IL-2 gene transcription. These distal elements interact with the proximal IL2 promoter region. When the distal enhancer contained an autoimmune SNP, it affected IL-2 gene transcription. The authors also identified genetic risk variants that were associated with genes upon activation. Some of these regulate proliferation and cytokine production, but others are novel.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper provides a wealth of data related to gene expression after CD4 T cells are activated through the TCR and CD28.

We have ensured that all sample sizes, effect sizes, p values and FDR statistics are included in the figures and figure legends. We agree that including more donors for the HiC studies would increase the number of implicated variants and genes, however, all the chromatin-based V2G approaches described in our manuscript use relatively small sample sizes, but implicate more variants and genes than the comparable eQTL studies. I.e., the low overlap is not driven by a paucity of GWAS-chromatin-based associations. An alternative explanation for the low overlap between GWAS-chromatin-based approaches and eQTL approaches was recently by Pritchard and colleagues, who reported that GWAS and eQTL studies systematically implicate different types of variants (Mostafavi et al., Nature Genetics 2023). Among other differences, eQTL tend to implicate nearby genes while GWAS variants implicate distant genes, and our results support this contention. We referred to this study in the original version of the manuscript, but have included a more extensive discussion of potential explanations in the revised version. We thank the reviewer for helpful suggestions that have improved the quality of our study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
