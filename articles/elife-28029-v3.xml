Here we addressed the functional and spatial interaction between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, unique Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels that activate at low voltages. We found that when BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels were co-expressed in the same cell, BK channels started activating near −50 mV, ~30 mV more negative than for activation of co-expressed BK and high-voltage activated Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. In addition, single-molecule localization microscopy revealed striking clusters of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels surrounding clusters of BK channels and forming a multi-channel complex both in a heterologous system and in rat hippocampal and sympathetic neurons. We propose that this spatial arrangement allows tight tracking between local BK channel activation and the gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels at quite negative membrane potentials, facilitating the regulation of neuronal excitability at voltages close to the threshold to fire action potentials.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28029.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28029.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>BK channels</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated calcium channels</kwd><kwd>sympathetic neurons</kwd><kwd>hippocampal neurons</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>ground-state depletion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS008174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hille</surname><given-names>Bertil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL085686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santana</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wayne E.

We present evidence for multi-channel complexes that these two channels form. In nerve and muscle, depolarization of the membrane activates voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) leading to calcium influx. This increase in calcium induces the activation of BK channels. The activation of BK channels serves as negative feedback, tending to repolarize the membrane and to close Ca<sub>V</sub> channels. Therefore, understanding the functional and physical relation between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub> channels is critical to elucidate the biophysical and physiological actions of this feedback mechanism.</p><p>BK channels are expressed in nearly every excitable cell and their activation depends on both voltage and intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2009</xref>). Without calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> = 0), BK channels activate only at very depolarized voltages with a V<sub>1/2</sub> &gt;100 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yan and Aldrich, 2010</xref>). The affinity of BK channels for calcium ions ranges between 1 and 10 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Contreras et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, a rise in calcium concentration from ~100 nM resting levels to the micromolar range is needed to increase the open-channel probability of BK channels at −50 to 0 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrett et al., 1982</xref>).</p><p>Opening of a single calcium channel raises local calcium to more than 100 μM within a few tens of nanometers from the inner mouth of the channel, but most of these ions are quickly buffered--within microseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simon and Llinás, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts, 1994</xref>). BK channels have been found in close proximity to all subfamilies of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, suggesting a molecular interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marrion and Tavalin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkefeld and Fakler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rehak et al., 2013</xref>). This association can be recapitulated in heterologous systems and has been shown to reconstitute functional nanodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkefeld et al., 2006</xref>). The physical arrangement and channel stoichiometry of these putative complexes in the nanodomain are still not clear. Some models depict a 1:1 relation between Ca<sub>V</sub> and BK channels arranged at distances as close as 10 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fakler and Adelman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox, 2014</xref>). Other models are similarly effective in reproducing the functional coupling without a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prakriya and Lingle, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montefusco et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a comprehensive characterization of Ca<sub>V</sub>-BK interactions within functional nanodomains remains to be completed.</p><p>The activation threshold of BK channels tends to reflect the activation threshold of associated Ca<sub>V</sub> partners. Dihydropyridine-sensitive, L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are unique in their activation profile; they can start activating at voltages as negative as −65 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Platzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lipscombe et al., 2004</xref>). These channels play essential roles in the auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koschak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Michna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2005</xref>), in the pacemaker cells of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mangoni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Torrente et al., 2016</xref>), in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marcantoni et al., 2010</xref>), and in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Putzier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stanika et al., 2016</xref>). Deficiency of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels leads to deafness and bradycardia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Platzer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Despite the potential relevance for many excitable cells, functional and structural coupling between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels is poorly defined. Here, we tested the hypothesis that coupling between these channels can activate BK channels at very negative voltages. This would promote a negative feedback mechanism whereby BK-channel opening would oppose further opening of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels even before the membrane potential reaches the firing threshold for action potentials. In order to activate BK channels at these low voltages, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and BK channels must be organized in close proximity (&lt;20 nm), so that nanodomains of calcium forming near the inner mouth of the calcium channel overlap with the calcium sensors of the BK channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test the concept of spatial proximity, we (i) compared the activation properties of BK channels when co-expressed with two different Ca<sub>V</sub> isoforms, (ii) used classical biophysical and biochemical approaches to test for coupling and direct interaction, and (iii) imaged BK and Ca<sub>V</sub> channels with super-resolution microscopy to characterize the spatial distribution of these channels.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels shifts the voltage dependence of activation of BK channels to more negative potentials</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are functionally coupled. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the voltage dependence of activation of the BK channels should follow the activation curve of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkefeld et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we compared activation of BK channels in a cell line (tsA-201 cells) co-expressing BK with either low-voltage activated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels or high-voltage activated Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. These cells do not express BK or any of the isoforms of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels endogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berjukow et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avila et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the inward calcium currents from cells expressing only Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are blocked by cadmium, a general blocker of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, but they differ in their gating kinetics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the voltage dependence of activation gating as conductance-voltage (G-V) curves fitted with Boltzmann functions. The midpoint of activation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels is 35 mV more negative than that for the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. Outward K<sup>+</sup> currents from cells expressing only BK channels are insignificant in the voltage range that we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). When Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are co-expressed with the BK channels, the same voltage steps elicit an outward current that is blocked by cadmium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). These results confirm that calcium influx through Ca<sub>V</sub> isoforms is required for the activation of BK channels in the expression system. As anticipated, the mid-point voltage for activation of BK channels depends on the co-expressed Ca<sub>V</sub> channel isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). For a quantitative comparison, we use the fitted Boltzmann functions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to interpolate the voltage for 5% activation of the channels. Loosely, we will call this the activation threshold, although activation is actually continuously graded at all voltages. In this terminology, the activation threshold for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels was −13.8 mV and for the co-expressed BK channels it was −20.2 mV, whereas for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels the activation threshold was −48.8 mV and for the co-expressed BK channels it was −52.3 mV. In short, there is quantitative agreement with the hypothesis that the Ca<sub>V</sub> channel with the more negative activation voltage allows BK channels to activate at correspondingly more negative potentials. The activation kinetics of BK channels has also been shown to change when coupled with different Ca<sub>V</sub> isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkefeld and Fakler, 2008</xref>). In agreement, the time constant of BK channel activation at 0 mV is shorter when co-expressed with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (8 ± 2 ms, n = 7) than when is co-expressed with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels (18 ± 5, n = 9), resembling the difference in activation kinetics between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (0.7 ± 0.1 ms, n = 9) and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 (4.5 ± 0.7 ms, n = 8) channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28029.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Shift in the activation profile of BK channels by co-expression with different Ca<sub>V</sub> channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative cadmium-sensitive inward (negative) calcium currents activated with the voltage protocol indicated above in tsA-201 cells transfected only with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels.

We tested this hypothesis several ways. As a crude first approximation, we recorded from membrane patches on tsA-201 cells transfected with both BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels with the hypothesis that the channels should be close enough to allow us to observe single-channel events. The pipette solution was similar to Ringer’s solution except that the calcium concentration was increased from 2 to 20 mM. A 1 s voltage step from −80 mV to 0 mV was applied to activate Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and to let calcium in only at the membrane patch. If nearby BK channels were present, they would then open. BK channels outside the membrane patch are not expected to open given the decay in calcium concentration. The solution in the bath, outside the membrane patch, contained high potassium to maintain the cytoplasmic potential close to 0 mV, helping to prevent channel openings outside the pipette. To prevent the activation of BK channels inside the patch by calcium coming from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels outside the patch, 2 mM EGTA was added to the bath solution. Indeed, unitary outward K<sup>+</sup> currents with multiple levels were recorded from these patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for raw trace), reflecting the activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and subsequent activation of BK channels. As a measure of BK channel activity, we calculated NP<sub>o</sub> the product of number of channels times probability of opening. NP<sub>o</sub> in these patches was 3.7 ± 0.7 (n = 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). NP<sub>o</sub> decreased to 0.8 ± 0.4 (n = 7, p value = 0.002) after bath application of the dihydropyridine blocker nifedipine (10 μM) suggesting that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels need to be activated to induce these outward current events. Openings were abolished and NP<sub>o</sub> decreased to 0.2 ± 0.1 (n = 7, p value = 0.0004) after the sequential application of a BK channel blocker, 500 nM paxilline, confirming the identity of BK channels coupled with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28029.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are close enough to be recorded in a small membrane patch and to be detected by co-immunoprecipitation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative single-channel recordings from tsA-201 cells expressing BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels.

However, expression of these channels in a heterologous system might not recapitulate a direct interaction, perhaps requiring additional proteins present uniquely in brain tissue. Thus, we investigated whether, as in neurons, BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel are physically associated in tsA-201 cells using co-IP approaches. A comparison between protein extractions from tsA-201 cells transfected with both BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, only one channel (BK or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3), or none, shows that the BK antibody stains the input blot when BK channels are expressed alone or together with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left gel). The BK antibody also stains immunoprecipitates pulled down with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antibodies (n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right gel), suggesting that some level of interaction between these channels is reconstituted when expressed in a heterologous system and that no other proteins specific to brain tissue are required for this interaction.</p><p>A third biophysical approach tested whether BK channels are distributed within nanometer distances from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. We recorded potassium currents in whole-cell configuration and dialyzed calcium buffers with different binding rate constants into the cytoplasm (through the patch pipette) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naraghi and Neher, 1997</xref>). The buffers limited calcium diffusion to specific distances from the calcium source. The equation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prakriya and Lingle, 2000</xref>, predicts that dialysis of 10 mM EGTA restricts local elevations of intracellular calcium to a radius of 100 nm from the calcium source, whereas dialysis of 10 mM BAPTA restricts diffusion to a radius of 10 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Tellingly, potassium currents activated by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels were reduced by dialysis with BAPTA but not EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, some current remains even with the dialysis of BAPTA, suggesting that some BK channels lie closer than 10 nm to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. In contrast, potassium currents were reduced by dialysis of either BAPTA or EGTA in tsA-201 cells co-expressing BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that BK channels are distributed farther than 100 nm from Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels.

To determine bleed-through between spectral channels, we obtained super-resolution images of microtubules in tsA-201 cells labeled with secondary Alexa-647 or 568. We followed the same imaging settings and imaging sequence normally used in all our experiments (imaging first the 647 channel and then the 568 channel). We calculated the fraction of bleed-through by dividing the total number of localization events detected in the ‘wrong’ channel by the total number of localization events detected in the ‘correct’ channel for both fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The frequency distribution for the distance between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and BK-positive pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, green bars) was empirically fitted by a bell-shaped curve with a peak at 20 nm, our resolution limit, and a half width of 60 nm. This distribution fits with the distances suggested by the use of calcium buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), where BK channels are closer than 100 nm and even BAPTA could not block all the current, meaning that some BK channels probably lie at distances less than 10 nm from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. In another approach to describe the distribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels around BK channels, we defined concentric areas of 20 nm width around the irregular BK clusters and measured the percentage of area occupied by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 positive pixels in each concentric area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, green squares). To avoid bias in the analysis, data were analyzed from the whole cell instead of selected regions of interest (ROIs). The first point corresponds to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-positive pixels that actually overlap with BK clusters. This plot shows a skewed distribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels towards areas within 50 nm from BK clusters, indicating again that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters are preferentially concentrated in close proximity to BK clusters. Importantly, only 17 ± 2% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters are at &lt;200 nm from BK channels while the other 83% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters are not localized close to any BK cluster (n = 5 cells).</p><p>To rule out that this distribution was a fixation artifact, we imaged the clusters from live tsA-201 cells in an AiryScan microscope which doubles the resolution achieved with a diffraction-limited confocal microscope. For these experiments we expressed BK channels tagged with GFP and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels tagged with mRuby. Similar to what we observed in fixed cells, live cells exhibited BK channel puncta surrounded by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We repeated the super-resolution study in cells co-expressing BK channels with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows representative ROIs from these cells. The median BK cluster size is not significantly different when BK channels are co-expressed with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels (2000 nm<sup>2</sup>, n = 4 cells). In comparison to the results with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, there is much less evidence for an association of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 with BK channels. The frequency distribution for the distance between Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 and BK-positive pixels is roughly described by a bell-shaped curve centered at 100 nm from BK-positive pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, cyan bars). This distribution also fits with the distances suggested by the use of calcium buffers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. In addition, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2-positive pixels are more randomly distributed around BK channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, cyan circles). Altogether, these results suggest that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are more likely to be close to BK channels than are Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels in our heterologous expression system. These results do not contradict the observed coupling between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marrion and Tavalin, 1998</xref>). Rather they suggest some differences in the coupling mechanism and its ability to reconstitute in an expression system.</p><p>In the super-resolution maps, there were 2.5 times more Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters (1843 ± 587) with a median cluster size of 1600 nm<sup>2</sup> than Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 clusters (741 ± 273) with a median cluster size of 400 nm<sup>2</sup>. Presumably a higher density of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels is expressed in these cells. We confirmed this observation by comparing the calcium current densities. The peak inward current density was −38 ± 11 pA/pF (n = 11) in cells co-transfected with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and only −10 ± 3 pA/pF (n = 9) in cells co-transfected with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 (p=0.04). Because a higher expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels might explain the closer average proximity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and BK channels, we compared the distribution of BK channels to a random distribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-positive pixels. To generate the random distribution from our data while keeping the number, size, and shape of each cluster, we binarized the maps of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-positive pixels and randomized them with a custom macro written in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>). Then, we merged the original map of BK-positive pixels unchanged with the new random-distribution map of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-positive pixels for each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) and analyzed the distribution around BK clusters. The distribution curve of randomized Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 pixels did not depend on the position of BK clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, orange circles), being more similar to the distribution observed for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. This result rejects the possibility that a higher expression level of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels alone accounts for the greater coupling with BK channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels form clusters in sympathetic and hippocampal neurons</title><p>Does this clustered distribution require overexpression of channels? Hippocampal and sympathetic neurons abundantly express BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, where they are known to serve important physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Storm, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lancaster and Nicoll, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we investigated the spatial distribution of BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in these neurons using super-resolution imaging of immunostained neurons. As neurons express both Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, it is important to be certain of the specificity of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antibody. The antibody used in this work recognizes a highly variable site within the intracellular loop between domains II and III with no homology to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and its specificity has been tested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hell et al., 1993</xref>). To further assess the antibody’s specificity in our super-resolution experiments, we co-transfected tsA-201 cells with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-EGFP channels and co-immunostained with anti-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and anti-GFP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows that the two antibodies label different structures. In fact, the overlap between the two labels is only 2.2 ± 0.5% (n = 4), supporting that the antibody used against Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels does not recognize Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels.</p><p>Similar to the distribution observed in the heterologous expression system, BK channels formed clusters surrounded by clusters of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-647 or Alexa-568 were used to detect BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, respectively. Reciprocal immunostaining using Alexa-647 for the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Alexa-568 for the BK channels was also performed. The BK-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clustering organization was not dependent on the secondary antibody used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Independent of the secondary antibody used, all the cells were included in the distribution analysis. The median BK cluster size is 2800 nm<sup>2</sup> in SCG neurons (n = 7), significantly larger than the median BK cluster size in hippocampal neurons (2000 nm<sup>2</sup>, n = 6) or the expression system (1600 nm<sup>2</sup>, n = 5). The distribution analysis in both types of neurons also showed a skewed distribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters occupying areas adjacent to BK clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>, green squares), indicating that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters are preferentially concentrated in close proximity to BK clusters, similar to the distribution observed in the heterologous expression system. Interestingly, whereas in hippocampal neurons 3% of the pixels inside BK clusters also included Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, in SCG neurons as many as 10% of the BK cluster pixels included Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, suggesting more intimate coupling of these interacting channels in SCG neurons. Randomized Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel clusters were distributed independently of the position of BK channels in the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>, orange circles). Such results show that endogenous BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in neurons exhibit a distribution and coupling similar to those in the expression system and suggest that clustering and proximity are fundamental properties of endogenous BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and not an artifact of overexpression.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28029.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Endogenous BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels also form clusters in neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Representative single-molecule localization maps from cultured hippocampal (<bold>A</bold>) and sympathetic (<bold>B</bold>) neurons labeled for BK (red) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (green) channels; zoom-in panels to the right show clusters of BK channels surrounded by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels.

Given that BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels display a similar coordinated distribution in neurons, we tested whether BK channels are activated at −40 mV in these cells. We recorded potassium currents in dissociated hippocampal and sympathetic neurons before and after the application of 500 nM paxilline and analyzed subtracted currents for evidence of BK channel activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref> show representative potassium currents activated at −40 mV. On average, we observed 200 ± 20 pA (n = 3) of paxilline-sensitive potassium currents at −40 mV in hippocampal neurons and 100 ± 20 pA (n = 3) in sympathetic neurons. Calcium current at −40 mV is minimal or undetectable in whole-cell recordings in hippocampal and sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Regan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vivas et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, it is possible that activation of a few channels, or clusters, is enough to begin to activate BK channels at low voltages. To determine the activity of individual calcium channels at negative voltages, we recorded spontaneous calcium events in total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Sympathetic neurons were patched in whole-cell mode. The calcium indicator Rhod2 (200 μM) and the calcium chelator EGTA (10 mM) were included in the patch pipette to restrict calcium elevations to the plasma membrane. Membrane potential was held at −80 mV. Localized bursts of fluorescent events were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These events, termed sparklets, have been characterized in tsA-201 cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and are known to reflect the opening of single or clustered channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navedo et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, these events increased in number and amplitude after application of 500 nM Bay K 8644 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>), suggesting that they are mediated by L-type calcium channels. Altogether, these results show that SCG neurons exhibit spontaneous activity of single and coupled L-type calcium channels at negative potentials that can contribute to the activation of nearby BK channels even in the absence of detectable whole-cell calcium current.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels couple to BK channels in multi-channel complexes, enabling BK channels to open at voltages as negative as −50 mV. Our single-molecule localization experiments did not support proposed models of strict stoichiometry such as a 1:1 ratio of Ca<sub>V</sub> and BK channels. Instead, we found that BK channels form clusters that are surrounded by clusters of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels with no apparent fixed stoichiometry.</p><p>We provide several lines of evidence that support the hypothesis that these two channels congregate and are functionally coupled: (i) the functional and spatial coordination can be reconstituted in a heterologous system, (ii) the activation profile of BK channels changes with the expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, (iii) functional interaction persists when isolated in a patch pipette, (iv) coordinated gating is abolished by BAPTA, but not by EGTA in the cell, (v) the two channels co-immunoprecipitate, and (vi) they are physically close when observed under super-resolution microscopy. These findings are consistent with previous studies that show that BK channels co-precipitate with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels from rat brain extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunnet and Kaufmann, 2004</xref>) and that chromaffin cells from mice lacking Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels exhibit smaller BK currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marcantoni et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Berkefeld and colleagues have previously shown that the activation profile of BK channels changes with the expression of different Ca<sub>V</sub> isoforms. For instance, in their work BK channels start activating at around −10 mV when co-expressed with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels but start activating at around +10 mV when co-expressed with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkefeld et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement, our results show that the BK channel activation curve corresponds closely to the activation of co-expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, respectively, and with the latter can start activating at voltages as negative as −50 mV. Our experiments differ, however, in that we did not co-express the auxiliary β subunit of BK channels, suggesting that this auxiliary subunit is not necessary to reconstitute the functional coupling between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub> channels. Our results add information about the composition of these complexes by using imaging at nanometer resolution, arguing against a 1:1 channel stoichiometry with a 10 nm distance between them. Instead, BK channels form homotypic clusters and then form higher order heterotypic clusters with clusters of Ca<sub>V</sub> isoforms.</p><p>Clustering is a characteristic of several ion channels, including potassium and calcium channels, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">King et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, it was shown that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels form clusters that are functionally coupled to each other and gate cooperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that BK channels arrange in clusters as well and that these clusters of BK channels arrange in higher order distributions surrounded by clusters of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. Multi-channel complexes between Ca<sub>V</sub> and BK channels have been proposed before. For example, in frog hair cells, it has been proposed that 85 calcium channels and 40 BK channels organize in the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts, 1994</xref>). An important conclusion of that work is that, assuming the simultaneous opening of 10 Ca<sub>V</sub> channels at any given time, the calcium concentration could reach &gt;100 μM inside the active zone, decaying steeply at the edge. Others have proposed complexes with a ratio of 5:1 Ca<sub>V</sub> to BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prakriya and Lingle, 2000</xref>). In this case, calcium channels can be at distances as far as 50 nm from BK channels and would still be able to accumulate enough calcium to activate BK channels, if more than one calcium channel opened at the same time. The association we see between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels appears to have neither fixed stoichiometry nor fixed geometry. Rather it can be described as a statistical bias for proximity of clusters, a bias that would not be present with a random distribution. We describe the most common composition of this mega complex. Homotypic BK clusters have various sizes, with a median of 2000 nm<sup>2</sup> and appear to be nucleation centers for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters to come very close, forming a heterotypic cluster. By counting the number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters within 50 nm from BK clusters, we estimated that there are on average 4 Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters around a single BK cluster (n = 128 ROIs). However, the super-resolution data show considerable lack of symmetry, with some BK clusters lacking nearby Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters not touching BK clusters, and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters in close proximity to BK clusters at various distances and numbers. The mechanisms favoring the formation of higher order cluster between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters might be (1) direct interactions between potassium and calcium channels, (2) indirect interactions mediated by scaffolding proteins, (3) membrane domains that restrict and concentrate their distribution, or (4) weak interactions between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, that by lateral diffusion and mass action, result in aggregations around each other. The later alternative might explain why not all BK clusters are surrounded by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters, given an equilibrium where some clusters are in a non-interacting state while others are in an interacting state.</p><p>What concentration of intracellular calcium might be found in the center of this multi channel mega-complex? The amount of calcium reaching a BK channel cluster will depend on: (i) the number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters around it (a mean of 4 according to our estimations), (ii) the number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels open at any given time, and (iii) their distance from the target BK channel. Interestingly, clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels leads to cooperative opening of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels within the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). It remains uncertain, however, whether a nearby second cluster of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels could open at the same time as the first. Calcium entering from two equidistant Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters around a BK cluster could sum linearly and therefore contribute equally to the activation of BK channels.</p><p>To conclude, we propose that the coupling of BK channels with low-voltage activated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in a multi-channel complex enables this feedback mechanism to activate BK channels at potentials near the threshold, preventing neurons from firing action potentials as we observed recently in sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vivas et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>As heterologous expression system we used tsA-201 cells (SIGMA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2737">CVCL_2737</ext-link>).

Patch pipettes had a resistance of 2–6 MΩ, and series resistances of 6–10 MΩ were compensated by 50–70%. Due to incomplete compensation, large currents at very depolarized voltages induced voltage errors &gt;20 mV, artifactually reducing the steepness of recorded BK activation curves there. Other factors altering the activation of BK channels at different voltages are the inactivation of Ca<sub>V</sub>, the calcium reversal potential, and the application of 0.1 mM BAPTA to the pipette solution.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher J Lingle (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work by Vivas, Santana, Hille and colleagues the functional and spatial coupling of L-type calcium channels and BK channels were investigated. Through a series of very well done electrophysiology, molecular biology, and super-resolution imaging experiments, the nature of the interaction is shown. The authors specifically show 1) the mid-point of activation of the calcium channel influences BK channel activation, 2) membrane patches show dual activation, 3) channels co-immuno-precipitate, 3) EGTA and BAPTA differentially influence BK activation, and 4) GSD imaging shows clusters of BK channels surrounded by calcium channels in cells. Together these data present a model by which Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and BK channels co-assemble into clusters. The BK channels are an &quot;island&quot; surrounded by a variable number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels that form a functional nano-domain on the membrane in model cells and neurons. In general, we think this paper is excellent. Much of the work is, in some way confirmatory of earlier work where L-type calcium channels and BK channels were shown to physically interact and to couple functionally. The unique (and new) data here, however, is the determination of the spatial organization of the channel clusters with fluorescence. The following are specific issues the authors should address in revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use primary and secondary antibodies to label the channels for super-resolution imaging. The dimensions of this label complex (upwards of 30 nm) should be incorporated into any models where channel number or area are estimated.</p><p>2) Both Alexa-598 and Alexa-647 show significant spectral overlap. As far as we can tell no single-label controls were done to confirm that the two-color STORM images did not have any bleed-through or cross-talk. Because these images and analysis are so key to the paper, we would like to see a control where the labels are switched (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is labeled with A647 and BK channels are labeled with A598 etc.) to confirm and control for the spatial distribution of these two channels and the relative organization of the channel complex.</p><p>3) It might also be nice to see a structured illumination (SIM) control of these complexes. This could be done with conventional FP probes in live cells. Thus, any influence of live cell vs. fixed cell could be addressed. The size of these clusters ~200-500nm should be resolvable with TIRF-SIM even in live cells.</p><p>4) There are details in the patch experiment that are missing, e.g., length of time at command voltage prior to illustrated traces, were paxilline and nifedipine applied in the same patch as the control and was it applied to the whole cell, whether by setting the cell in symmetrical K, the overall cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may reach a level for modest activation of BK unrelated to patch Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The authors should also show unsubtracted K currents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> so we can see exactly how the subtracted currents were obtained. The currents shown have some artifacts and it’s difficult to evaluate the quality of the voltage clamp. Also, please provide a description of the experimental and subtraction procedures.</p><p>5) Although it may not be easy to do, one can imagine other useful information contained in the images, e.g., comparisons of average BK channel cluster size. Also, in the analysis of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3/BK data, shouldn't at farther distances (&gt;200 nm) the presence of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 should fall to levels consistent with the &quot;random&quot; case? That would seem to be potentially important. If the distribution even out to 200 nm is still not totally random, that might support an interesting &quot;mechanism&quot; of coupling where lateral mobility of membrane proteins creates some associations simply from weak affinity interactions. The decided lack of symmetry in the Cav/BK clusters might also be more easily viewed within such a context.</p><p>6) The gel shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is confusing. Based on earlier studies BK migrates at around 100 kDa, consistent with one of the bands shown. What is the band at 250 kDa? Also, was this experiment done more than once?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28029.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors use primary and secondary antibodies to label the channels for super-resolution imaging. The dimensions of this label complex (upwards of 30 nm) should be incorporated into any models where channel number or area are estimated.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises a particularly important point regarding the analysis of super-resolution images. We agree that the labeling of proteins with antibodies could lead to an over estimation of the area of protein clusters. Thus, determining the number of channels within each cluster using GSD imaging is difficult. Accordingly, we decided to discuss the composition of the clusters only in terms of area without reaching any conclusion regarding the number of channels within the cluster. We deleted a sentence in the Results section that said “In each pixel with dimensions of 20 by 20 nm, two channels could fit”. We also deleted the sentences in the Discussion section that described the number of BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels per cluster. Finally, we removed the schematic model in Figure 6.</p><p><italic>2) Both Alexa-598 and Alexa-647 show significant spectral overlap. As far as we can tell no single-label controls were done to confirm that the two-color STORM images did not have any bleed-through or cross-talk.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that controls for bleed-through were missing in the previous version of the manuscript. We now provide new data addressing this point. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> shows immunostaining of microtubules using the two different secondary antibodies and calculating the fraction of crosstalk. The fraction of crosstalk of the emission of Alexa-568 into the 647 channel is only 0.092 ± 0.032. The fraction of crosstalk of the emission of Alexa-647 into the 568 channel is only 0.008 ± 0.001. We also give details of how these experiments were conducted in the second paragraph of the Results subsection “Clusters of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels surround BK channels”. It is important to note that we used Alexa-568 and not Alexa-598. We have corrected any typos related to this throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Because these images and analysis are so key to the paper, we would like to see a control where the labels are switched (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is labeled with A647 and BK channels are labeled with A598 etc.) to confirm and control for the spatial distribution of these two channels and the relative organization of the channel complex.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that these controls were necessary. Although we had failed to clarify this in the first version of the manuscript, we in fact had performed these experiments using reciprocal immunostaining using Alexa-647 for the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Alexa-568 for the BK channels in SCG neurons. Giving that BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters and the BK-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 organization was independent of the secondary antibody used, the previous version of the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> already included data from both immunostainings. In order to clarify this we now added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> to show representative super-resolution maps of the reciprocal immunostaining and added a section to the Results explaining this figure:</p><p>“Reciprocal immunostaining using Alexa-647 for the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Alexa-568 for the BK channels was also performed. The BK-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clustering organization was not dependent on the secondary antibody used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Independent of the secondary antibody used, all the cells were included in the distribution analysis”.</p><p><italic>3) It might also be nice to see a structured illumination (SIM) control of these complexes. This could be done with conventional FP probes in live cells. Thus, any influence of live cell vs. fixed cell could be addressed. The size of these clusters ~200-500nm should be resolvable with TIRF-SIM even in live cells.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting these experiments in living cells, as they help us rule out the possibility that the clusters we observed are an artifact of fixation. We performed experiments expressing BK-GFP and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-Ruby tagged channels in tsA-201 cells and imaged the cells in the focal plane of the membrane using a ZEISS AiryScan microscope, which has a lateral resolution of about 140 nm. The AiryScan resolution is similar to that of SIM microscopy (about 100 nm). New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> shows representative cells in which big clusters of BK channels are surrounded by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters in agreement with our previous observations in fixed cells. We added a section describing this result:</p><p>“To rule out that this distribution was a fixation artifact, we imaged the clusters from live tsA-201 cells in an AiryScan microscope which doubles the resolution achieved with a diffraction-limited confocal microscope. For these experiments we expressed BK channels tagged with GFP and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels tagged with mRuby. Similar to what we observed in fixed cells, live cells exhibited BK channel puncta surrounded by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>)”.</p><p><italic>4) There are details in the patch experiment that are missing, e.g., length of time at command voltage prior to illustrated traces.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers and are providing more details in our patch-clamp experiments. In some traces, only 20 ms at the beginning was removed to correct for a transient artifact. We added a sentence in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Electrophysiological recordings”, last paragraph) and added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to show a whole representative trace. We also noticed that there was a typo in the scale bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. It should be 20 ms, not 200 ms. We corrected this error.</p><p><italic>Were paxilline and nifedipine applied in the same patch as the control and was it applied to the whole cell?</italic></p><p>Yes, nifedipine and paxilline were applied sequentially to the patches after recording in control conditions. Yes, it was applied to the whole cell. This has been clarified in legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and Results (subsection “Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are in close proximity to BK channels”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Whether by setting the cell in symmetrical K, the overall cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may reach a level for modest activation of BK unrelated to patch Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point and we thank the reviewers for raising it. In the Materials and methods section (subsection “Electrophysiological recordings”, last paragraph), we stated that we used a bath solution with low free calcium by adding 2 mM EGTA, which results in 10 μM free calcium. This amount of calcium outside the cell would decrease the driving force by half, given that Erev for calcium would go from 127 mV to 64 mV. Activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels by depolarizing the cell to 0 mV (with a symmetrical K solution) would lead to calcium influx. The amount of calcium entering the cell will be reduced by endogenous buffers. In some mammalian cells <sup>1,2</sup>, the buffer strength is 99%, suggesting that from 10 μM outside the cell, less than 100 nM would enter the cell. The inactivation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and the activation of extrusion mechanisms would also reduce calcium influx. For these reasons, we think that the contribution of calcium influx unrelated to the activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in the patch is minimal. We clarified in the Results section this point: “To prevent the activation of BK channels inside the patch by calcium coming from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels outside the patch, 2 mM EGTA was added to the bath solution”.</p><p>1) Neher E, Augustine GJ. 1992.

It also helps to illustrate how the subtraction was done. Thank you for the suggestion.</p><p><italic>5) Although it may not be easy to do, one can imagine other useful information contained in the images, e.g., comparisons of average BK channel cluster size.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers elaborated on the mechanism of coupling between these channels. We performed the suggested analysis. The median cluster size of BK channels is 1600 nm<sup>2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"/></sup> when co-expressed with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (n = 5 cells) and 2000 nm<sup>2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"/></sup> when co-expressed with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels (n = 4 cells). This is not significantly different. We provided the data in the third and sixth paragraphs of the subsection “Clusters of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels surround BK channels”.</p><p><italic>Also, in the analysis of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3/BK data, shouldn't at farther distances (&gt;200 nm) the presence of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 should fall to levels consistent with the &quot;random&quot; case? That would seem to be potentially important. If the distribution even out to 200 nm is still not totally random, that might support an interesting &quot;mechanism&quot; of coupling where lateral mobility of membrane proteins creates some associations simply from weak affinity interactions. The decided lack of symmetry in the Cav/BK clusters might also be more easily viewed within such a context.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct, given the nature of the analysis, the density of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels must fall to levels consistent with the random case after 200 nm. It is important to note that the density of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels does fall to random levels in SCG and hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) supporting such prediction of the analysis. To be able to analyze the presence of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters at distances further away than 200 nm, an experiment with very low expression of BK channels would be ideal. We expanded on the coupling by weak interactions in the Discussion section:</p><p>“4) weak interactions between BK and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, that by lateral diffusion and mass action, result in aggregations around each other. The later alternative might explain why not all BK clusters are surrounded by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters, given an equilibrium where some clusters are in a non-interacting state while others are in an interacting state”.</p><p><italic>6) The gel shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is confusing. Based on earlier studies BK migrates at around 100 kDa, consistent with one of the bands shown. What is the band at 250 kDa? Also, was this experiment done more than once?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this point needed clarification. The molecular weight for the BK channel has been reported to be between 100 to 130 KDa using the clone L6/60 of the anti-Slo1 antibody. The second band observed around 250 KDa likely corresponds to a BK dimer, as it has been seen and proposed by other groups<sup>3,4</sup>. We have clarified this in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>3) Ridgway LD, Kim EY, Dryer SE. 2009.
