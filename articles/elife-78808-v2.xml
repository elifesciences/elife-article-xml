Splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, and docking of the pre-mRNA 5’ splice site into the spliceosome active site depends upon pairing with the conserved ACAGA sequence of U6 snRNA. In some species, including humans, the central adenosine of the AC<underline>A</underline>GA box is modified by <italic>N<sup>6</sup></italic> methylation, but the role of this m<sup>6</sup>A modification is poorly understood. Here, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A modified U6 snRNA determines the accuracy and efficiency of splicing. We reveal that the conserved methyltransferase, FIONA1, is required for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification. <italic>Arabidopsis fio1</italic> mutants show disrupted patterns of splicing that can be explained by the sequence composition of 5’ splice sites and cooperative roles for U5 and U6 snRNA in splice site selection. U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A influences 3’ splice site usage. We generalise these findings to reveal two major classes of 5’ splice site in diverse eukaryotes, which display anti-correlated interaction potential with U5 snRNA loop 1 and the U6 snRNA AC<underline>A</underline>GA box. We conclude that U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification contributes to the selection of degenerate 5’ splice sites crucial to alternative splicing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All the information necessary to build the proteins that perform the biological processes required for life is encoded in the DNA of an organism. Making these proteins requires the DNA sequence of a gene to be transcribed into a ‘messenger RNA’ (mRNA), which is then processed into a final, mature form. This blueprint is then translated to assemble the corresponding protein.</p><p>When an mRNA is processed, segments of the sequence that do not code for protein are removed and the remaining coding sequences are joined together in the right order. An intricate molecular machine known as the spliceosome controls this mechanism by recognising the ‘splice sites’ where coding and non-coding sequences meet. Depending on external conditions, the spliceosome can ‘pick-and-mix’ the coding sequences to create different processed mRNAs (and therefore proteins) from a single gene. This alternative splicing mechanism is often used to regulate when certain biological processes take place based on environmental cues; for example, the splicing of genes which control the timing of plant flowering is sensitive to ambient temperatures.</p><p>To investigate this mechanism, Parker et al. focused on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a plant that blooms later when temperatures are low. This precise timing partly relies on a gene whose mRNA is efficiently spliced in the cold, resulting in an active form of its protein that blocks blooming. Parker et al. grew and screened many <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants to find individuals that could flower early in the cold, in which splicing of this gene was disrupted.</p><p>A mutant fitting these criteria was identified and subjected to further investigation, which revealed that it could not produce FIONA1. In non-mutant plants, this enzyme chemically modifies one of the components of the spliceosome, a small nuclear RNA known as U6. Parker et al found that there are two types of splice site – one more likely to interact with U6 and another that preferentially interacts with another small nuclear RNA, U5. When FIONA1 is inactive (such as in the mutant identified by Parker et al.), splice sites that tend to strongly interact with U5 are selected. However, when the enzyme is active, splice sites that tend to bind with the chemically modified U6 are used instead.</p><p>Further work by Parker et al. showed that these two types of splice sites (‘preferring’ either U5 or U6) are found in equal proportions in the genomes of many species, including humans. This suggests that Parker et al. have uncovered an essential feature of how genomes are organised and splicing is controlled.</p></abstract><kwd-group

During pre-mRNA transcription, intervening sequences (introns) are excised, and the flanking sequences (exons) are spliced together. In developmentally complex eukaryotes, such as humans or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, most protein-coding genes have introns, and the <italic>cis-</italic>elements controlling splicing are degenerate. Such sequence variation facilitates alternative splice site selection that, in turn, permits the regulation of mRNA expression and the production of functionally different protein isoforms (Lee and Rio, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>). Consistent with this, alternative splicing is the foremost genomic predictor of developmental complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Plaschka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). This large, dynamic molecular machine comprises more than 100 proteins and 5 uridylate-rich snRNAs (UsnRNAs). Splicing requires two sequential transesterification reactions. The first reaction, called branching, occurs when the 2’ hydroxyl of the conserved intron branchpoint adenosine performs a nucleophilic attack on the 5’ splice site (5’SS), resulting in a cleaved 5’ exon and a branched lariat-intron intermediate. The second reaction, exon ligation, occurs via nucleophilic attack of the 3’ hydroxyl of the 5’ exon on the 3’ splice site (3’SS). Typically, the 5’SS is first recognised by U1 snRNP, whilst U2 snRNP recognises the branchpoint sequence of pre-mRNA. The preassembled U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP subsequently joins the spliceosome. The conserved U6 snRNA ACAGA sequence replaces U1 snRNP at the 5’SS and loop 1 of U5 snRNA binds 5’ exon sequences adjacent to the 5’SS. In humans, selection of the 5’SS occurs during this hand-off to U6 and U5 snRNAs, and this step is decoupled from formation of the active site, thus potentially allowing for plasticity of 5’SS selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Charenton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fica, 2020</xref>). Subsequently, U6 pairs with U2 snRNA and intramolecular U6 snRNA interactions facilitate the positioning of the catalytic metal ions to effect branching and exon ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>U6 snRNA is the most highly conserved UsnRNA, reflecting its crucial roles at the active site of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). Different base modifications are found in each of the UsnRNAs, including U6 snRNA, but the role of these modifications is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morais et al., 2021</xref>). The essential ACAGA sequence of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> U6 snRNA is unmodified. However, in other species including <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gu et al., 1996</xref>), the plant <italic>Vicia faba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kiss et al., 1987</xref>), and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shimba et al., 1995</xref>), the central adenosine in the corresponding sequence is modified by methylation at the N6 position: AC<sup>m6</sup><bold><underline>A</underline></bold>GA. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, U6 snRNA ACAGA recognises the stringently conserved GUAUGU sequence at the 5’ end of introns, with the central adenosine making a Watson-Crick base pair with the almost invariant U at the +4 position of the 5’SS (5’SS U<sub>+4</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Neuvéglise et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, in species with m<sup>6</sup>A-modified U6 snRNA, the 5’SS can be degenerate and the identity of the base at the +4 position varies but is usually enriched for A. Therefore, the pairing between the 5’SS and the U6 snRNA AC<underline><bold>A</bold></underline>GA box is unlikely to be driven primarily by canonical Watson-Crick base pairs in these species. The precise function of the U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification is unknown.</p><p>In humans, the U6 snRNA AC<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>GA sequence is methylated by the conserved methyltransferase METTL16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Warda et al., 2017</xref>). This modification depends upon a specific sequence and distinct structural features of U6 snRNA that are recognised by METTL16. Hairpin sequences that mimic these features of U6 snRNA are found within the 3’UTR of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase <italic>MAT2A</italic> mRNA and are also methylated by METTL16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shima et al., 2017</xref>). SAM synthetase is the enzyme responsible for production of the methyl donor SAM, which is required for methylation reactions in the cell. Binding of METTL16 to <italic>MAT2A</italic> mRNA influences splicing and/or stability, regulating MAT2A expression and SAM levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shima et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the METTL16 orthologue, METT-10, methylates U6 snRNA and also influences SAM levels by targeting SAM synthetase (<italic>sams</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mendel et al., 2021</xref>). METT-10 methylates the 3’SS of <italic>sams-3/4</italic> intron 2, although in a different sequence and structural context to U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mendel et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the METTL16 orthologue, MTL16, appears to target only U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ishigami et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> mutants defective in MTL16 function show less efficient splicing of some introns, resulting in increased levels of intron retention. The <italic>S. pombe</italic> introns sensitive to loss of MTL16 function are distinguished by having adenosine at the +4 position of the intron (5’SS A<sub>+4</sub>). However, the effect of 5’SS A<sub>+4</sub> is partially suppressed in introns that have stronger predicted base pairing between U5 snRNA loop 1 and the 5’ exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ishigami et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Alternative splicing plays crucial roles in gene regulation, affecting diverse biological processes including the control of flowering in response to ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airoldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Capovilla et al., 2017</xref>). Slight changes in ambient temperature can profoundly influence flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrés and Coupland, 2012</xref>). Indeed, documented changes in the flowering times of many plant species have provided some of the best biological evidence of recent climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>). At cooler ambient temperatures, pre-mRNAs encoding repressors of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowering, FLM (FLOWERING LOCUS M) and MAF2 (MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 2), are efficiently spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airoldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Posé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Scortecci et al., 2001</xref>). As a result, FLM and MAF2 proteins are produced at cooler temperatures and form higher-order protein complexes with other MADS box factors, such as MAF3 (<italic>MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 3</italic>), SVP (<italic>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</italic>), and FLC (<italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic>), to directly repress the expression of the genes <italic>FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic>) and <italic>SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1</italic>), which promote flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gu et al., 2013</xref>). At elevated ambient temperatures, the splicing of <italic>MAF2</italic> and <italic>FLM</italic> introns is adjusted, in different ways, effecting increased levels of non-productive transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airoldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Posé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Scortecci et al., 2001</xref>). Consequently, the abundance of active MAF2 and FLM proteins is compromised at elevated temperatures; repression of genes promoting flowering is relieved, and flowering is enabled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airoldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Capovilla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Posé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rosloski et al., 2013</xref>).

In the first step, we screened 15,000 EMS lines for early flowering <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants at 16°C.

We focus here on EMS-129 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The causal mutation for the early flowering phenotype of EMS-129 was mapped by back-crossing to the M0 parental line to generate a segregating population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

EMS-induced G to A transitions were identified, and allele fractions were compared between the two pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Javorka et al., 2019</xref>). A total of 19 homozygous G to A transitions in a 2.6 Mb region on chromosome 2 were associated with the early flowering phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of these, only the SNP at position 9,041,454 of chromosome 2, which disrupts the 5’SS of AT2G21070 intron 2, was predicted to have a major impact on gene expression.

We quantified the expression of these transcripts using Salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Patro et al., 2017</xref>), then used SUPPA2 to calculate event-level percentage changes in splicing, which also classifies different types of splicing event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Trincado et al., 2018</xref>). These percent spliced indices (PSIs) were used to fit linear models for each splicing event to identify changes in splicing dependent on temperature, genotype, and temperature×genotype interactions. Analysis of the Col-0 temperature-shift data served as a control. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calixto et al., 2018</xref>), we found that intron retention is the predominant class of alternative splicing event detected when <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is subjected to different temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Surprisingly, 22.3% of alternative 5’SS pairs have the same base at the +4 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, of these 5’SS pairs, the majority are associated with a G→H<sub>+5</sub> (H=A, C or U) and/or H→G<sub>–1</sub> switch that weakens interactions with the U6 snRNA ACAGA box and strengthens U5 snRNA loop 1 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>We next examined how the effect size (absolute ΔPSI) of splicing changes correlated with the base at the +4 position of the 5’SS. The largest effect sizes were associated with A→U<sub>+4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, alternative 5’SS pairs with an A→A<sub>+4</sub> shift had smaller effect sizes. We found that <italic>fio1-3</italic>-sensitive 5’SSs with 5’SS G<sub>+5</sub> had larger effect sizes but that G<sub>+5</sub> at the alternative 5’SS had less effect, suggesting that G<sub>+5</sub> is only deleterious in <italic>fio1-3</italic> when in combination with A<sub>+4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Finally, we found that <italic>fio1-3-</italic>sensitive 5’SSs with AG//GU motifs had smaller effect sizes, indicating that favourable interactions with U5 snRNA loop 1 can suppress the effect of unfavourable U6 snRNA interactions in <italic>fio1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these analyses demonstrate widespread change in 5’SS selection in <italic>fio1</italic> mutants. The 5’SSs with a strong match to the U6 snRNA ACAGA box and/or an A<sub>+4</sub> are most sensitive to loss of FIO1. This sensitivity can be suppressed by a strong match in the 5’ exon to U5 snRNA loop 1.

We found the same to be true for 5’SSs in other eukaryotes, including humans.

For example, a ‘seesaw linkage’ pattern was observed where −1 G permits any nucleotide at position +5, and conversely,+5 G permits any nucleotide at position −1.

Compensatory interactions are likely to facilitate degeneracy in sequences that can be recognised as 5’SSs. Degeneracy may act as a buffer against deleterious mutations in splice site sequences, as well as lowering barriers to the evolution of new splicing structures.

This is important because 5’SS A<sub>+3</sub> is not aligned to stack on A<sub>+4</sub> at this stage. However, later in spliceosomal B<sup>act</sup> and C complexes, 5’SS A<sub>+3</sub> engages in a more stable interaction with the U6 snRNA G44 adjacent to m<sup>6</sup>A (AC<sup>m6</sup>A<underline>G</underline>A), stacking on top of the 5’SS/U6 helix and stabilising it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such stabilisation is important because degenerate 5’SS sequences mean that the helix formed with U6 snRNA AC<bold>A</bold>GA is relatively weak, short, and comprised mostly of non-canonical RNA-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>Our global RNA-seq analyses reveal that m<sup>6</sup>A-modified U6 snRNA pairs less readily with 5’SSs containing U<sub>+4</sub> than those containing A<sub>+4</sub>. Biophysical data from model RNAs provide a possible explanation for this finding: an m<sup>6</sup>A-U base pair can form in a duplex, but the methylamino group rotates from a <italic>syn</italic> geometry on the Watson–Crick face to a higher-energy anti-conformation, positioning the methyl group in the major groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Roost et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, m<sup>6</sup>A has a destabilising effect on A−U basepairs in short RNA helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kierzek and Kierzek, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Roost et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, 5’SS U<sub>+4</sub> may be selected less frequently by m<sup>6</sup>A-modified U6 snRNA because of destabilisation of an already weak helix. In contrast, the thermal stability of m<sup>6</sup>A:A is increased compared to A:A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Roost et al., 2015</xref>). Biophysical measurements also indicate m<sup>6</sup>A in unpaired positions base stacks more strongly than the unmodified base, adding substantial stabilisation to adjacent duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Roost et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification, our data reveal that 5’SS U<sub>+4</sub> sites are preferred. This is consistent with a relatively strong interaction being important at the terminal position of the U6 snRNA ACAGA helix in the B complex to stabilise its formation.</p><p>The potential role of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A in 3’SS selection may be explained by U6 AC<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>GA interactions during the remodelling of the spliceosome for the second splicing reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In humans, RNA rearrangements during the C to C* transition include stacking of the 3’SS G<sub>−1</sub> onto U6 A45 (AC<bold>A</bold>G<underline>A</underline>), which remains paired to U<sub>+2</sub> of the 5’SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fica, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fica et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). This results in a continuous helix stack, involving the interaction between U6 A43 and 5’SS A<sub>+4</sub>, which forms the receptor onto which the 3’SS docks. Our data are consistent with a model in which a strong interaction between U6 and the 5’SS +4 position stabilises this receptor, enabling 3’SSs distal to the branchpoint to compete more efficiently with proximal 3’SSs that are favoured by scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith et al., 1993</xref>).

There are 13 genes encoding U6 snRNA in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 genome (Wang and Brendel, 2004). Currently, we know little about the relative patterns of U6 snRNA gene expression or m<sup>6</sup>A modification status and how this may vary in different ecotypes. Indeed, this paucity of knowledge on U6 snRNA variants’ modification and expression applies to humans too. Our study on U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification has important implications for understanding the mechanism of splicing and the evolution of alternative splicing. It will now be interesting to investigate the possibility that modulation of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A may be regulatory or adaptive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><p>The wild-type Col-0 accession, <italic>fio1-3</italic> (SALK_084201), and <italic>maf2</italic> (SALK_045623) were obtained from Nottingham <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Stock Centre.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A previous report suggested limited splicing changes in the fio1 mutant. The authors should add a comparison and discussion. In addition, FLC mRNA can be m6A methylated. The authors appear to suggest the effect is secondary. More analysis and explanation are required. For instance, the authors could measure m6A level on FLC in fio1 mutants and mta mutants, and compare them with that of wild tpye.</p><p>2. The authors used Nanopore m6A sequencing to map m6A in mRNA from wt and fio1 mutant strains. We would suggest either RIP-seq or mass spectrometry measurement to confirm the loss of fio1 leads to limited mRNA m6A changes.</p><p>3. p 3 and Figure 1: &quot;Figure 1. Schematic outline of sequential steps of pre-mRNA splicing.&quot; I don't see why this is a main figure. It's the type of schematic that could be found in any splicing review. This seems like a Supplemental figure, at most. Instead, a schematic of their screen, described in the first paragraph of the Results, including some pictures of WT and early flowering Arabidopsis mutants obtained from the screen, would be more appropriate (and is needed). The authors should also show the RT-PCR data supporting enhanced MAF2 intron 3 retention at 16{degree sign}C. Overall, the authors provide few details about this screen, including how many EMS mutants were screened. How did the authors identify mutants that alter MAF1 intron 3 splicing, when the difference in intron 3 retention (as shown in Figure 4C) is so subtle?</p><p>4. p 6. &quot;Crosses between EMS 129 and either fio1-1, or a Transfer-DNA insertion line disrupting AT2G21070 (SALK_084201; fio1-3) confirmed allelism.&quot; No data for this are shown; data supporting these conclusions should be included.</p><p>5. Many of the figures are difficult to interpret. For example, Figure 3 legend gives some details of the bioinformatics, but does not say anything about what the actual experiments were. The text is overly-focused on bioinformatics without an adequate description of the experiments that were performed. Please provide information detailing the actual experiments; without this information, these parts of the manuscript are both uninformative and impossible to evaluate.</p><p>6. Figure 4C. The change in MAF2 intron 3 retention is seemingly tiny. What exactly is the deltaPsi for this? Can this be confirmed by RT-PCR or RT-qPCR? This highlights an issue raised above: how did the authors identify mutants in the screen by RT-PCR that altered MAF2 intron 3 retention if the change is this subtle?</p><p>7. I found the description of the SS sequence enrichment incredibly long (7 pages of text) and overwhelmingly descriptive without a view of what the conclusions would be. Sequence motifs in the context of otherwise disparate intron and exon sequences can be suggestive of a mechanism; but, in the end, confirmation of these sequence effects requires experimental testing within a constant gene sequence. This is necessary to make any solid conclusion based on rigorous science. These are critical experiments that are missing in this manuscript.</p><p>8. The model seems to be that U5 and U6 RNAs contribute to a platform for recognition of 5'SSs: a 5'SS must interact sufficiently with this platform in order to make it through splicing; stronger interaction as some positions can compensate for weaker interactions at other positions. I don't think that there's anything new here in terms of mechanism. m6A in U6 contributes to stability; this was already postulated in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> system (Ishigami et al. 2021). Is this biologically important? Does FIO1 expression change developmentally? or, is it a constitutive feature of U6-5'SS interaction? These questions are not addressed or even raised in this manuscript.</p><p>9. p 18. The authors state that &quot;FIO1 buffers spicing fidelity&quot; and &quot;that FIO1 function calibrates the temperature range over which MAF2 alternative slicing occurs&quot;, but I don't see any data that directly support these assertions. These seem like extrapolations of the current data that require experimental tests to support them.</p><p>10. The authors refer to the &quot;cooperative roles for U5 and U6 snRNA in splice site selection&quot; in the abstract. I don't see any evidence for interactions with U5 in this manuscript, and the proposed role of U6 is not tested experimentally. These two deficits are the most disappointing aspects of this work.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1. The main text goes on for 31 pages, &gt;12,000 words (not including Figure Legends or References). While there are no strict limits on the length of Research Articles, the <italic>eLife</italic> Author Guide suggests to &quot;try not to exceed 5,000 words in the main text&quot;. The text could be shortened significantly; conciseness would greatly benefit the readability of the manuscript.</p><p>The Discussion, at &gt;7 pages, is excessively long and does not critically evaluate the data or conclusion presented in this manuscript.</p><p>2. p 7 and Figure 2B. What is the experimental basis of Figure 2B? The authors do not state the experimental data: is it RNA-seq or RT-PCR? In either case, some examples of the primary data for this should be shown.</p><p>3. p 6, second paragraph of the Results: &quot;We used bulked segregant analysis and the software tool artMap (Javorka et al., 2019) to identify the causative mutation…&quot;. The authors should explain this more explicitly, for non-specialist readers. There are a number of ways in which this could have been done, but the authors do not specify what exactly was the data that led to the determination of the mutation.</p><p>4. Figure 4B. This is a comparison of fio1-3 with Col-0. I would like to see volcano plots for all the five splicing events with log2FC on the x-axis and enrichment/significance on the y axis. These bar charts with percentages are too confusing to depict what the authors are actually trying to convey and do not depict the spread of the primary data.</p><p>5. Figure 4E shows &quot;absence of change&quot; in MAF2 intron 5, but this intron is clearly efficiently spliced, so the comparison to inefficiently-spliced intron 3 is not particularly meaningful. A more meaningful comparison would be to a different intron that is also inefficiently spliced.</p><p>6. Figure 5. Seq logos are shown for 5'SSs that are sensitive to or that are used better in fio1-1 mutants. These can only be meaningful if they are compared to the seq logo of the overall 5'SS in A.t., which is not shown or discussed.</p><p>7. Figure 5. Why only show out to pos -2 in the exon? More positions than that can pair with U5.</p><p>8. Some of the fonts in the figures are so small as to be unreadable or nearly unreadable, e.g. Figure 4-Figure sup 1 and Figure 5-Figure sup 1.</p><p>9. ALKBH10B is a demethylase that affects early flower phenotype. Does this protein also mediate the demethylation of U6 m6A?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78808.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A previous report suggested limited splicing changes in the fio1 mutant. The authors should add a comparison and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this suggestion. We have completed a re-analysis of recently published data that confirms the effect on splicing that we report here. We have added a new sub-section in the Results that incorporates this comparison and added new content to the Discussion that addresses this issue. We have summarised the analysis we performed below, as well as attempting to provide some additional insight into why other research groups overlooked splicing changes in their RNA-seq data.</p><p>A major finding from our study is that FIO1-dependent modification of U6 snRNA plays a significant role in defining splice site usage. This directly contradicts two recently published studies, referred to by the reviewer (Wang et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022). Wang et al., 2022 claims that “disruption of FIONA1 does not affect global alternative splicing” and Xu et al., 2022 states “FIO1-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A methylation … has a limited effect on alternative splicing”. We show that these conclusions are wrong and that FIO1-induced methylation of U6 snRNA influences global splice site selection.</p><p>The Wang et al. study used two replicates per condition of Illumina RNA-seq, with ~35-45 million reads per replicate. Xu et al. used three replicates per condition of nanopore direct RNA sequencing, with ~0.5-1.2 million reads per replicate. Our study used 6 replicates per condition with four temperature treatments per genotype, for a total of 24 replicates per genotype, and a minimum of 50M pairs of 150bp Illumina RNA-seq reads per replicate (3.6 billion mapped reads in total). Consequently, our study has much greater statistical power to detect splicing changes in <italic>fio1</italic> mutants, compared to the previous two reports. For the purpose of this response, we have now performed a re-analysis of the previously published data, to explain the basis of the different conclusions reached in these studies.</p><p>Wang et al. performed splicing analysis using two replicates per genotype of 150bp paired-end Illumina RNA-seq, with ~35-45 million reads per replicate and used the software tool rMATs (Shen et al., 2014) to perform alternative splicing analysis. rMATs requires a transcriptome annotation file to guide splice site quantification. In contrast to our approach, Wang et al., did not generate a condition-specific transcriptome assembly for alternative splicing quantification, and presumably used the TAIR10 or Araport11 reference annotation (this is not specified in the methods section of their paper). This is important because these annotations would not include the majority of the novel alternative 5’ splice sites and intron retention events that we identified in the <italic>fio1</italic> mutant, and so these would not be considered in the analysis. For example, we discover ~70% fewer significant alternative splicing events when we perform splicing analysis on our own data using the reference annotation, rather than the condition-specific assembly that we generated (which includes novel splice isoforms used in <italic>fio1</italic> mutants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and Figure 3B). Consequently, the impact of FIO1 on splicing is likely to be underreported in the Wang et al. study.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Barplots showing the proportion of splicing events of each class, as labelled by SUPPA, which have significantly different usage (FDR &lt; 0.05) in the <italic>fio1-3</italic> mutant, that are discovered when performing differential splicing analysis using the Araport11 reference annotation.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78808-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We downloaded the data from Wang et al. and performed splicing analysis using our condition-specific transcriptome annotation. We found that the Wang et al. data were of poor quality because only ~38% of reads were mappable to the Arabidopsis transcriptome. In particular, the first WT Col-0 replicate was unusable and had to be discarded because of PCR amplification bias, which can be seen in the extreme GC-content bias of sequenced reads (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). However, we were still able to identify 384 alternative 5’SS usage events from the dataset using the software tool SUPPA2 (Trincado et al., 2018), from which we found 58% of <italic>fio1-</italic>sensitive 5’SSs had an A at the +4 position, compared to only 36% of 5’SSs with increased usage in the <italic>fio1</italic> mutant (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, Chi2 p =3×10<sup>-9</sup>). We conclude that the reported limited splicing changes in the Wang et al. publication result from an underpowered dataset compounded by methodological choices in analysis.</p><p>Xu et al. performed splicing analysis using three replicates per genotype of nanopore direct RNA sequencing and used the software tool FLAIR (Tang et al., 2020) to identify differentially spliced transcripts. In our manuscript, we chose not to use nanopore direct RNA sequencing to analyse splicing because the low number of reads mean it is underpowered for splicing analysis and because the relatively high sequence error rates make the identification of splice junctions more complex (Parker et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2020). This is particularly problematic in the <italic>fio1</italic> mutant where cryptic alternative 5’SSs are mostly only a very short distance from the canonical 5’SS (see Page 8 and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A in the revised manuscript). Tools like FLAIR perform post-alignment “correction” of unannotated splice junctions to nearby annotated splice junctions. This would incorrectly assign mRNAs originating from the cryptic splice sites used in the <italic>fio1</italic> mutant to the reference splice junction and may partly explain why alternative splicing was overlooked in this study.</p><p>We were previously able to validate splicing examples detected in our Illumina RNA-seq dataset with our own nanopore direct RNA sequencing data (Figure 4E, 5D, 6F in the revised manuscript). To confirm whether these splicing changes are also detectable in the data from Xu et al., we downloaded their basecalled data and realigned it using minimap2. We found that we could indeed identify the splicing defects we previously reported in our submitted manuscript, such as alternative 5’SS selection in <italic>AtSAR1</italic> intron 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>), and intron retention in <italic>WNK1</italic> intron 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). We conclude that, like the Wang et al. study, the reported limited splicing changes in the Xu et al. publication results from an underpowered dataset compounded by methodological choices.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>(A) Gene track showing alternative 5’SS selection at <italic>AtSAR1</italic> intron 21 in <italic>fio1-2</italic>, identified using nanopore DRS read alignments reanalysed from Xu et al.2022.

Sun et al. did not perform any splicing analysis on their data. We downloaded and reanalysed the data from Sun et al. using the same approach described above for the Illumina RNA-seq data from Wang et al. 2022. Although there were only two replicates, with a low sequencing depth per replicate, we found that these data were of a higher quality than the Wang et al. dataset, with a much higher mappability rate (~95%). We were able to use these data to identify 923 alternative 5’SS events caused by the <italic>fio1-1</italic> mutation, and 947 alternative 5’SS events caused by the <italic>fio1-5</italic> mutation. There was a clear preference for A<sub>+4</sub> in <italic>fio1</italic>-sensitive 5’SSs, and for U<sub>+4</sub> in 5’SSs with increased use in the <italic>fio1</italic> mutants (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-B). There were 669 events that were common to both genotypes tested by Sun et al., and of these, 556 were also identified in our own RNA-seq analysis as alternatively spliced in <italic>fio1-3</italic> mutants (Figure 6—figure supplement 3C).</p><p>Sun et al., also performed one replicate each of nanopore DRS for Col-0, <italic>fio1-1</italic> and <italic>fio1-5.</italic> We could identify splicing changes in <italic>AtSAR1</italic> and <italic>WNK1</italic> using these data as well (Figure 6—figure supplement 4), confirming the findings we reported in our submitted manuscript.</p><p>Overall, we find that data from recently published studies support the impact of FIO1 on splicing. We have revised our manuscript to address this issue in a new Results sub-section entitled “Reanalysis of RNA-seq data from independent <italic>fio1</italic> alleles confirms disruption to splicing” and in the Discussion subsection entitled “FIO1-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A modification of U6 snRNA determines splicing accuracy and efficiency”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, FLC mRNA can be m6A methylated. The authors appear to suggest the effect is secondary. More analysis and explanation are required.</p></disp-quote><p>There seems to be a slight misunderstanding here. We suggest in our manuscript that because there is no change in splicing of <italic>FLC</italic> in the <italic>fio1</italic> mutant, the impact of loss of FIO1 on <italic>FLC</italic> expression levels occurs indirect of the methylation of U6 snRNA by FIO1 (see the context on page 19 of our submitted manuscript). We do not make any statements about the methylation of <italic>FLC</italic> directly, either by FIO1 or the MTA-writer complex. To avoid potential confusion to the reader, we have removed this phrase from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, the authors could measure m6A level on FLC in fio1 mutants and mta mutants, and compare them with that of wild tpye.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that two recent studies (Sun et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022) reported FIO1-dependent methylation of <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA, but neither study examined whether the reported <italic>FLC</italic> modification depended upon the MTA-writer complex and neither tested the direct functional impact of the modification by mutation of the modified base(s). We have previously published in <italic>eLife</italic> that there is a major reduction in detectable expression of sense and antisense RNAs at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus in mutants defective in the MTA-writer complex component, VIRILIZER (Parker et al., 2020). In the original submitted version of this manuscript, we report a similar finding in <italic>fio1-3</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 2H-J). Consequently, we are unable to confirm the presence of m<sup>6</sup>A on <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA because the lack of <italic>FLC</italic> read coverage in mutants defective in either FIO1 or MTA-writer complex components means that we do not have the statistical power to do so using a comparative approach with nanopore DRS. In our view, the low levels of <italic>FLC</italic> transcripts also pose a technical barrier to the meaningful measurement of <italic>FLC</italic> m<sup>6</sup>A using m<sup>6</sup>A-IP (MeRIP) in <italic>fio1</italic> and <italic>mta</italic> mutant backgrounds. Both Wang et al., 2022 and Sun et al., 2022 (who also reported reduced <italic>FLC</italic> expression in <italic>fio1</italic> mutants) used m<sup>6</sup>A-IP-qPCR to address this question, but while Wang et al. reported that they used an m<sup>6</sup>A modified oligo spike-in to control for m<sup>6</sup>A levels, neither study reported how they controlled for the major difference in <italic>FLC</italic> input levels between wild type and <italic>fio1</italic> mutants. Sun et al. were not able to confirm the methylation of <italic>FLC</italic> using nanopore DRS. Previous studies do not agree on which methylase complex targets <italic>FLC</italic>, with Wang et al. &amp; Sun et al. suggesting that FIO1 is responsible (Sun et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022), and a third study suggesting that the MTA-complex is responsible (Xu et al., 2021). Overall, our analysis of mRNA methylation in <italic>fip37-4</italic> and <italic>fio1</italic> backgrounds indicates that FIO1-dependent mRNA methylation is rare or absent; we do not have evidence to indicate that <italic>FLC</italic> is an exception.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have now prepared a re-analysis of the data from our bulk segregant sequencing and updated the Results, Methods, and figures accordingly. 15,000 EMS M2 seeds were screened using a two-step procedure. The earliest flowering 100 EMS lines at 16°C were selected for splicing analysis by RT-PCR. This approach identified two lines that had increased retention of <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3. We focussed this study on EMS129. The causal mutation for the early flowering phenotype of EMS129 was mapped by backcrossing to the M0 parental line to generate a segregating population. Early flowering plants and aphenotypic sisters were grouped into separate pools for genomic DNA sequencing. We identified G to A transitions caused by EMS mutations using a SNP-calling pipeline, which is now described in greater detail in the revised Methods section. 19 SNPs in a 2.6Mb region on Chromosome 2 were identified as significantly associated with the early flowering phenotype (G test FDR &lt; 0.05, allele fraction 100%). These SNPs and the associated allele fractions are shown in revised Figure 1B in the revised manuscript. No other associations were found on other chromosomes.

MAF2 represses flowering at low ambient temperature. We wanted to identify factors required for the efficient splicing of <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 at low ambient temperature. We reasoned that if <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 was spliced less efficiently, the level of MAF2 flowering repressor activity would be reduced and hence plants would flower earlier. In step 1, we screened 15,000 EMS mutants for early flowering individuals grown at 16°C. In step 2, we re-screened the earliest flowering 100 mutant individuals for changes in <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 splicing by RT-PCR. Although the difference in <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 processing is indeed relatively modest, we report multiple changes in the splicing and expression of other genes controlling flowering time in <italic>fio1</italic> mutants in our manuscript. Consistent with this, <italic>fio1</italic> mutants have a very clear early flowering phenotype, and indeed, it was through an early flowering mutant screen that Hong Gil Nam’s lab first isolated the <italic>fio1-1</italic> mutant allele (Kim et al., 2008). In the second step of the screen, we used RT-PCR to analyse <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 splicing in RNA purified from these 100 early flowering mutants. Two of these 100 early flowering individuals showed increased levels of <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 retention, one of which is the <italic>fio1-4</italic> allele that we describe here. Although the difference in <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 splicing is relatively small, it is clearly identifiable by RT-PCR (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) and confirmed by our RT-qPCR analysis of other alleles (Figure 1D) and Illumina RNA-seq of another allele (see Figure 3 C and D in the revised manuscript).</p><p>We believe that the Reviewer’s suggestion to include a schematic on the mutant screen helps to clarify how this two-step screen could identify mutants with relatively small differences in the splicing of <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 and clarifies this point for the reader.

These phenotypes were scored visually at the time of allelism testing and leaf count data were not recorded. Our U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A analysis reveals that all the alleles studied here (<italic>fio1-1</italic>, <italic>fio1-3</italic> and <italic>fio1-4</italic>) are defective in U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A, independently confirming the allelism test of flowering phenotype, and these data are reported later in the manuscript text (Figure 2D of our revised manuscript). Our global RNA analyses are based on sequencing of both <italic>fio1-1</italic> and <italic>fio1-3</italic> alleles, which independently validate our conclusions on the impact of FIO1 on splicing.

We have cut 347 words from the SS enrichment section.</p><p>We deliberately chose to submit this work to <italic>eLife</italic> because of its objectives around transparency, open access and transforming academic publishing. It is difficult to interpret “overwhelmingly descriptive” in the context of the series of novel findings that we report in this section. Eve Marder, who was a Deputy Editor of <italic>eLife</italic> 2015-2019, published an essay in <italic>eLife</italic> remarking how in manuscript reviews, terms like “mechanism” and “descriptive” are often used as pejoratives without meaning (Marder, 2020). Consequently, it is disappointing to see such expressions reach through to this stage of an <italic>eLife</italic> review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sequence motifs in the context of otherwise disparate intron and exon sequences can be suggestive of a mechanism; but, in the end, confirmation of these sequence effects requires experimental testing within a constant gene sequence. This is necessary to make any solid conclusion based on rigorous science. These are critical experiments that are missing in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manuscript does report an experimental test within a constant gene sequence. Our <italic>fio1</italic> mutant alleles lack m<sup>6</sup>A modification of U6 snRNA but the nucleotide sequence of splice sites that are used in WT or <italic>fio1</italic> mutant alleles are unchanged between these genetic backgrounds genome-wide. We measured splicing that occurred in vivo in otherwise controlled conditions, in multiple cell types of whole organisms exposed to different environmental temperature regimes. High throughput in vivo analyses like ours show that effects which are identifiable in individual introns, like <italic>MAF2</italic> intron 3 or <italic>AtSAR1</italic> intron 21, are explainable by simple changes in nucleotide preference which generalise across thousands of different contexts. Similar perturbations of the U5 snRNA have previously been reported: as we described on p20 of our submitted manuscript “…defective splicing of specific introns in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe mtl16</italic> mutant strains can be experimentally rescued by expression of mutated U5 snRNAs designed to strengthen U5 loop 1 interactions with the upstream exon (Ishigami et al., 2021)”. Importantly, these “genetic complementation” experiments are consistent with the statements that we make with respect to the global distinction of two 5’SS classes. Therefore, there is already orthogonal experimental support for our model.</p><p>An alternative interpretation of the reviewer’s comment (“experimental testing within a constant gene sequence”) could be the use of single transgene reporters with base substitutions e.g. at the +4 position of the 5’SS. While we recognise the value of different experimental approaches, our view is that our unbiased global approach is more “rigorous”, because in reality it is not so simple to derive broad conclusions from testing individual reporter genes. This is because splicing outcomes are the result of complex combinatorial inputs, and so the impact of changes in an example reporter gene may not be generalisable to other sequence contexts. Several recent publications illustrate this point:</p><p>First, we cited the high throughput study from Adrian Krainer’s lab (Wong et al., 2018), which used a massively parallel splicing assay with minigene constructs to determine the efficiency of all possible 9 nt 5’SS sequences (32,678 sequences) in three different intron contexts. A major conclusion of this comprehensive analysis is that 5’SS preferences were different depending on the broader context of the minigene.</p><p>Second, a recent study from Stirling Churchman’s lab (Choquet et al., 2022) used nanopore direct RNA sequencing analysis of human chromatin-associated poly (A)+ RNA to reveal that post-transcriptional splicing of multiple introns within the same transcript follows a defined or preferred order. This illustrates that testing sequences in one intron can be confounded by the combinatorial impact that other introns in the same transcript have on the splicing of the intron under experimental examination (this was also a conclusion of the study from the Krainer lab).</p><p>Third, a recent study from Jean Beggs’ lab (Aslanzadeh and Beggs, 2020) shows that the efficiency of splicing is influenced by the rate of RNA Polymerase II (PolII) elongation. Jean Beggs’ study is particularly pertinent here because she looked at <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> ribosomal protein genes which possess a C, rather than the consensus U at the 5’SS+4 position. Compared to WT, in lines with a slow elongating PolII mutant, non-consensus 5’SS introns were spliced more efficiently, but in lines with a fast-elongating PolII mutant, such introns were spliced less efficiently. Consequently, interpreting the impact of individual positions in 5’SSs could be confounded not only by cis-elements in the test RNA but by the promoter used to drive the expression of otherwise constant gene sequences.</p><p>An expectation from the <italic>eLife</italic> review process is that “extra experiments, analyses, or data collection are only requested if they are essential and can be reasonably completed within about two months”. Because the critical experiments are not specified, it is unclear whether they could be completed in Arabidopsis in such a time frame. For example, the production of stable transgenic Arabidopsis reporter lines takes several months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The model seems to be that U5 and U6 RNAs contribute to a platform for recognition of 5'SSs: a 5'SS must interact sufficiently with this platform in order to make it through splicing;</p></disp-quote><p>A key tenet of our study is indeed that U5 and U6 snRNAs act together as a platform in which stronger interactions with either U5 or U6 can compensate for weaker interactions with the other. We demonstrate this through global RNA-Seq analyses using <italic>fio1</italic> mutants that alter the sequence preference of U6 snRNA. We show that the use of 5’SSs that have weaker U6 snRNA interactions in <italic>fio1</italic> mutants is less affected when these 5’SSs have stronger U5 interacting sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Stronger interaction as some positions can compensate for weaker interactions at other positions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not completely correct. Rather than finding that changes in any 5’SS position can compensate for weaker interactions resulting from loss of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A, we find specific changes (namely, a change in nucleotide preference at the +4 position and a stronger U5 interacting potential at the –2 and –1 positions) define the altered 5’SS motif for sites used in the <italic>fio1</italic> mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think that there's anything new here in terms of mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Interpretation of this statement is difficult because it is unclear what level of understanding constitutes new “mechanistic” insight (Marder, 2020). Our study expands upon previous work by extending the model of U5/U6 compensation from intron retention events to more complex forms of alternative splicing with two or more competing 5’SSs. This includes not only alternative 5’SSs, but exons with increased and decreased skipping. In each case we show that the model of compensatory U5 and U6 interactions can be used to explain splicing changes. Furthermore, we show that increases in upstream and downstream alternative 3’SS preference can also be explained by a weakening or strengthening of the 5’SS:U6 interaction, respectively. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of available cryo-EM data to contextualise these findings. We have restructured the Discussion section of the revised manuscript to make these points more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>m6A in U6 contributes to stability; this was already postulated in the S. pombe system (Ishigami et al. 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that Ishigami et al. postulated that m<sup>6</sup>A contributes to the stability of U6 – 5’SS interactions. However, our cryo-EM analysis provides a more detailed interpretation of how this might occur and goes further to incorporate our novel finding on U6 snRNA affecting 3’SS usage. We report that U6<sub>A43</sub> faces 5’SS A<sub>+4</sub> in a trans Hoogsteen sugar edge interaction that could stabilise the U6/5’SS helix in B complex by capping. We show that this stabilisation may be particularly important in B but not B<sup>act</sup> complex because in B<sup>act</sup> the U6/5’SShelix is now capped by 5’SSA<sub>+3</sub> interacting with U6 snRNA G44. We then report that this helix capping property of A43 becomes important again in C* complex consistent with our RNA-Seq data that reveal an impact of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification on 3’SS usage. None of these insights are included in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> study reported by Ishigami et al., or any other study to date.</p><p>The agreement between our manuscript and the <italic>S. pombe</italic> study by Ishigami et al. is an important strength of our manuscript because together we establish that the conserved role of METTL16/FIONA1 is to methylate U6 snRNA and that this has demonstrable and consistent impacts on pre-mRNA splicing. This is important because recent studies have suggested an alternative role for FIO1 in methylating mRNA that is not supported by our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this biologically important?

The final Results section on page 18 of the submitted manuscript addresses this: we show that pairs of alternative 5’SSs in Arabidopsis, humans, and other species tend to have opposing U5 and U6 interaction potential, which could be used to modulate alternative splicing. In addition, we dedicated the entire final section of the Discussion to the question of regulation – see page 24 headed “A regulatory or adaptive role for U6 snRNA modification?”</p><p>Analysis of publicly available Arabidopsis community resources (eg.: bar.utoronto.ca) suggests that <italic>FIO1</italic> mRNA is constitutively expressed (Waese et al., 2017). This does not preclude a condition-specific impact of FIO1 on splicing. Furthermore, constitutive expression of <italic>FIO1</italic> mRNA does not preclude regulation of the protein’s activity or targeting. Consequently, it remains an open question as to whether m<sup>6</sup>A levels of U6 snRNAs vary.</p><p>U6 snRNA methylation may be a constitutive feature of the U6:5’SS interaction. Nevertheless, its loss has very specific phenotypic impacts, for example on flowering time. Consequently, it is biologically important, regardless of whether it is constitutive or not. Likewise, an example from the splicing field is that mutation of the Brr2 constitutive splicing factor leads to a very specific human disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa (Zhang et al., 2009). Furthermore, whilst loss of m<sup>6</sup>A from U6 aided in the identification of opposing interaction potential of alternative 5’SS pairs, it does not mean that this is the only mechanism by which U5 and U6 interactions could be regulated.</p><p>As we discussed in our submitted manuscript, Arabidopsis flowering time GWAS analyses point to a functional impact of natural variation in the sequence of <italic>FIO1</italic> genes (Price et al., 2020; Sasaki et al., 2015).

The authors refer to the &quot;cooperative roles for U5 and U6 snRNA in splice site selection&quot; in the abstract. I don't see any evidence for interactions with U5 in this manuscript,</p></disp-quote><p>Our global analyses document 1000s of splicing events sensitive to FIO1 mutation that can be distinguished by the base identities of 5’SS-U5 snRNA interacting positions. The recognition of –1 and –2 exon positions at 5’SSs by U5 snRNA has been established over a period of approximately 40 years, using techniques ranging from genetic analysis with yeast to cross-linking studies, high-throughput sequencing experiments and direct visualisation using cryo-EM (Wilkinson et al., 2020). It is well established that the –2 and –1 positions interact with the U5 snRNA, and that an AG motif at the –2 to –1 positions of the 5’SS leads to more efficient splicing (Wong et al., 2018). It is similarly uncontroversial that the +3 to +5 positions are important for the interaction with U6 snRNA, and that an RAG motif at the +3 to +5 positions leads to more efficient splicing (Wong et al., 2018). Our analyses of all genomic 5’SS sequences (in Arabidopsis and a range of metazoans) show that when 5’SSs have an AG motif at the –2 to –1 positions of the 5’SS, the requirement for an RAG motif at the +3 to +5 positions is relaxed. This finding is presented in Figure 7C of our manuscript. Furthermore, our RNAseq data shows that the presence of an AG motif at the –2 to –1 positions is able to compensate for a weakened interaction with the U6 snRNA caused by loss of U6 snRNA methylation in <italic>fio1</italic> mutants. We showed this using the effect size of alternative splicing changes classified by motif at the –2 to –1 positions, which we presented in Figure 4H of the manuscript. The –2 to –1 positions interact with the U1 and U5 snRNAs, and the interaction with U1 snRNA occurs prior to handover to U5/U6 and hence should be unaffected by loss of U6 snRNA methylation. Therefore, our findings can be explained by stronger U5 snRNA interactions compensating for weakened U6 interactions, supporting a model of cooperative and compensatory roles for U5 and U6 snRNAs in splice site selection. A similar result was also recently reported in <italic>S. pombe</italic> by Ishigami et al. using RNA-seq data and validated using genetic suppression experiments with modified U5 loop 1 sequences (Ishigami et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and the proposed role of U6 is not tested experimentally. These two deficits are the most disappointing aspects of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>This phrasing is somewhat ambiguous because our study is focused on the role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of U6 snRNA. The role of the U6 snRNA in 5’SS recognition is well established (Wilkinson et al., 2020). The methylation of the central adenosine of the ACAGA box by METTL16 is well established in other eukaryotes (Epstein et al., 1980; Kiss et al., 1987), and we have used m6A-IP qPCR experiments to demonstrate that this methylation is conserved in the Arabidopsis U6 snRNA and directed by the METTL16 homolog FIONA1. We have performed RNA-seq experiments with extremely high levels of depth and replication to dissect the consequences of the loss of U6 snRNA methylation on splicing, and provide multiple in-depth analyses to show that in all cases these consequences can be explained by changes in sequence preference at the +4 position of the 5’SS. We provide multiple lines of evidence from our RNA-seq and 5’SS sequence analyses to show that there are compensatory interactions between U5 and U6 snRNAs in their role in 5’SS recognition. Consequently, it is unclear which aspect of the “proposed role of U6” we have failed to test.</p><p>We have used a detailed analysis of the arrangement of the U5 and U6 snRNAs in multiple cryo-EM datasets to interpret the findings of our RNA-seq analyses. A potential follow-up experiment is cryoEM analysis of human spliceosomes prepared with U6 snRNA lacking m<sup>6</sup>A modification (in vitro splicing assays and cryo-EM using Arabidopsis spliceosomes is currently not possible).

The overall length of the main text is now 8,208.</p><p>Our manuscript is relatively long because of the range of subjects addressed:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Temperature-sensitive control of flowering</p></list-item><list-item><p>FIO1-dependent modification of U6 snRNA and poly(A)+ mRNA</p></list-item><list-item><p>Explanation of the early flowering phenotype of <italic>fio1</italic> mutants</p></list-item><list-item><p>Impacts of U6 m<sup>6</sup>A on splicing</p></list-item><list-item><p>Definition of two classes of 5’ SS in diverse eukaryotes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interpretation of cryo-EM to explain the role of U6 m<sup>6</sup>A in 5’SS and 3’SS usage</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clarification of recently published studies that mistakenly report no effect of loss of U6snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification on splicing</p></list-item></list><p>And the different experimental approaches used:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Arabidopsis mutant screening, mapping and phenotyping</p></list-item><list-item><p>Molecular analysis of RNA (RT-PCR, Immunoprecipitation of RNP complexes)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Illumina RNA-seq, nanopore direct RNA-sequencing with splicing and RNA modification analysis</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cryo-EM</p></list-item></list><p>This is a rare combination of subjects and approaches that requires attention in the Introduction and Discussion sections.

We do not agree that the Discussion fails to “critically evaluate the data or conclusion”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. p 7 and Figure 2B. What is the experimental basis of Figure 2B? The authors do not state the experimental data: is it RNA-seq or RT-PCR? In either case, some examples of the primary data for this should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this oversight. The data derive from RT-qPCR analysis. We have revised the labelling of the Figure and associated Figure Legend to make this clear. The raw source data for this figure was shared at the time of submission and is available associated with the bioRxiv pre-print. In the current version of the manuscript, it is Figure 1 source data 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. p 6, second paragraph of the Results: &quot;We used bulked segregant analysis and the software tool artMap (Javorka et al., 2019) to identify the causative mutation…&quot;. The authors should explain this more explicitly, for non-specialist readers. There are a number of ways in which this could have been done, but the authors do not specify what exactly was the data that led to the determination of the mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have updated the Methods and Results sections to explain the screen and the processing of the bulk segregant analysis data more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 4B. This is a comparison of fio1-3 with Col-0. I would like to see volcano plots for all the five splicing events with log2FC on the x-axis and enrichment/significance on the y axis. These bar charts with percentages are too confusing to depict what the authors are actually trying to convey and do not depict the spread of the primary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the bar chart is a high-level visualisation of the data which does not allow readers to interpret effect sizes or significance levels. We have taken the advice of the reviewer and created volcano plots for the four main alternative splicing event types that are focused on in the paper. These volcano plots also show that the most significant effects of loss of FIO1 are changes in alternative 5’SS usage and increases in intron retention. We have included these volcano plots as Figure 3—figure supplement 1B in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4E shows &quot;absence of change&quot; in MAF2 intron 5, but this intron is clearly efficiently spliced, so the comparison to inefficiently-spliced intron 3 is not particularly meaningful. A more meaningful comparison would be to a different intron that is also inefficiently spliced.</p></disp-quote><p>This comparison was intended to exemplify that FIO1 is not required for the splicing of all introns, by comparison to another intron in the same gene (<italic>MAF2</italic>). However, we agree that this is not a particularly useful control since efficiently spliced introns may not be as sensitive to splicing perturbations. Consequently, we have removed this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5. Seq logos are shown for 5'SSs that are sensitive to or that are used better in fio1-1 mutants. These can only be meaningful if they are compared to the seq logo of the overall 5'SS in A.t., which is not shown or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the sequence logo of all annotated 5’SSs in the condition-specific assembly as Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B in the revised manuscript. Sequence logos for 5’SSs can now be compared to this overall logo. However, we also intend for comparisons to be drawn directly between 5’SSs that are used more in the <italic>fio1-3</italic> mutant and their cognate 5’SSs that are used less. As a control to show that the strong difference in sequence preference caused by loss of U6 snRNA methylation is unusual, we included sequence logos and heatmaps for alternative 5’SSs that are used more at high temperatures and cognate sites that are preferred at low temperatures (compare Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C-D in the revised manuscript). These two sets of matched 5’SSs show no overall difference in sequence preference as reported on page 11 of our submitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 5. Why only show out to pos -2 in the exon? More positions than that can pair with U5.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that more positions can base pair with U5 snRNA loop 1. In the original submitted version of our manuscript, we tried to consider this carefully with regard to both the sequence logos and the heatmaps of U5 and U6 interacting sequences. Although the -3 position of the 5’SS can pair with U5, we found that the information content of the -3 position in annotated Arabidopsis 5’SSs is low with only 0.10 bits of entropy compared to 0.49 and 0.85 bits for the -2 and -1 positions respectively. The entropy of the -4 position is even lower (0.04 bits) suggesting almost no sequence preference at this position. We found that when aggregating data into U5 and U6 heatmaps, the -3 position did not contain important information, making the heatmaps more complex to interpret (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> for an example). Hence, we chose to exclude the -3 position from heatmaps and sequence logos in our submitted manuscript. However, we recognise that it is standard practice to display 5’SS sequence logos from the -3 position to +5 position, and this does not overly complicate sequence logo interpretation. We have therefore redrawn sequence logo figures to include the -3 position of the 5’SS in Figures throughout the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Heatmaps showing the distribution of U5 snRNA and U6 snRNA interacting sequence classes for 5’SSs of introns which have increased (left) and decreased (right) retention in <italic>fio1-3</italic>.

ALKBH10B is a demethylase that affects early flower phenotype. Does this protein also mediate the demethylation of U6 m6A?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this interesting suggestion, and we have incorporated it into the revised Discussion section. It is true that <italic>alkbh10b</italic> mutants have been reported to be late flowering (Duan et al., 2017). It is plausible that ALKBH10B could demethylate U6 snRNA, since a related human protein, FTO, has been shown to remove TMG-cap adjacent m6Am modifications from snRNAs (Mauer et al., 2019). To experimentally test this, however, would require an <italic>alkbh10b</italic> mutant, which we currently do not have. This line of research is therefore not feasible in a 2-month period but it will be interesting to examine in the future.</p><p>References</p><p>Aslanzadeh V, Beggs JD. 2020.
