The potential for such encounters to have long-term beneficial consequences in recipient cells has not been investigated. Here, we examined the effects of intoxication by DddA, a cytosine deaminase delivered via the type VI secretion system (T6SS) of <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic>. Despite its killing potential, we observed that several bacterial species resist DddA and instead accumulate mutations. These mutations can lead to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, indicating that even in the absence of killing, interbacterial antagonism can have profound consequences on target populations. Investigation of additional toxins from the deaminase superfamily revealed that mutagenic activity is a common feature of these proteins, including a representative we show targets single-stranded DNA and displays a markedly divergent structure. Our findings suggest that a surprising consequence of antagonistic interactions between bacteria could be the promotion of adaptation via the action of directly mutagenic toxins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Burkholderia</kwd><kwd>type vi secretion system</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM128191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiggins</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI080609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mougous</surname><given-names>Joseph D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mougous</surname><given-names>Joseph D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEMORA18F0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Moraes</surname><given-names>Marcos H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mougous</surname><given-names>Joseph D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK089507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Moraes</surname><given-names>Marcos H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SINGH19RO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Moraes</surname><given-names>Marcos H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interbacterial interactions can promote mutagenesis, and possibly adaptation, when intoxicated cells survive exposure to type VI secretion-delivered DNA deaminase toxins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pathways for the delivery of toxins into contacting cells are widespread in bacteria. These include the type IV-VI secretion systems (T4-T6SS) in Gram-negative bacteria, the Esx secretion system of Gram-positives, and a number of specialized mechanisms that display a more limited distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">GarcÃ­a-Bayona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jamet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koskiniemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vassallo et al., 2017</xref>). Although most interbacterial toxins promote the competitiveness of producing organisms, the precise impact that they have on recipient cells can vary considerably. For instance, toxins that degrade the cell wall through amidase or muramidase activity lead to cellular lysis, whereas others such as nucleases cause cell death without the release of cellular contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Russell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whitney et al., 2013</xref>). Yet others, including NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolases and small ion-selective pore-forming toxins, cause growth arrest without killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LaCourse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Whitney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mariano et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond these outcomes that are detrimental to recipient cells, there are also scenarios in which toxin delivery could provide a transient benefit. Within populations of toxin-producing strains, self-intoxication is prevented through the production of specific immunity determinants that neutralize individual toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>). Toxins inactivated by immunity proteins in this manner are generally assumed to have no or little impact. However, in <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis,</italic> it was demonstrated that a toxin delivered by the contact-dependent inhibition pathway (CDI) causes increased expression of more than 30 genes in resistant cells, including those encoding exopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and a T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). This is associated with an increase in cellular aggregation and colony morphology changes. A separate study found that within a population of CDI toxin-producing bacteria, some cells fail to completely neutralize incoming CDI toxins delivered by their neighbors, leading to induction of the stringent response, and ultimately to enhanced antibiotic tolerance via growth arrest of this sub-population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2018</xref>). The above examples highlight how interbacterial toxins can have short-term beneficial effects. Whether toxin delivery can impact the long-term evolutionary landscape of target cell populations has not been explored.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the consequences of cellular intoxication by an interbacterial toxin that acts as a cytosine deaminase. Proteins that catalyze the deamination of bases in nucleotides and nucleic acids are found in all domains of life and play essential roles in a range of physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, deaminases that target free nucleotides and nucleosides contribute to cellular homeostasis of these molecules and can be involved in the biosynthesis of modified nucleic-acid-derived secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumasaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MagalhÃ£es et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weiss, 2007</xref>). RNA-targeting deaminases include the tRNA adenosine deaminase family of proteins (TAD) that contribute to tRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wolf et al., 2002</xref>), the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes that affect gene regulation through the editing of mRNA and small non-coding RNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nishikura, 2010</xref>), and mRNA-editing cytosine deaminases APOBEC1 and members of the DYW family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc and Davidson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayes and Santibanez, 2017</xref>). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and APOBEC3 both target cytosine residues in single-stranded DNA and contribute to the generation of antibody diversity or control of retroviral or other retroelement replication, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris and Dudley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Bioinformatic analyses of the origins of the deaminase fold led to the surprising finding that a large and diverse collection of predicted bacterial and archaeal deaminases exhibit hallmarks of substrates of antibacterial toxin delivery pathways, including the T6SS, the Esx secretion system, and the CDI pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Makarova et al., 2019</xref>). We recently demonstrated that one of these proteins, a substrate of an interbacterial toxin-delivering T6SS of <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic>, acts as a double-stranded DNA-targeting cytosine deaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mok et al., 2020</xref>). This unusual activity stands in contrast with all previously characterized DNA-targeting deaminases, which act preferentially on single-stranded substrates. We also showed that unlike the housekeeping deaminases APOBEC3G, TadA, and Cdd, this protein, which we named DddA (double-stranded DNA deaminase A), is highly toxic when expressed heterologously in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The mechanism by which DddA intoxicates cells was not determined.</p><p>Here, we report the discovery that DddA is a potent, direct mutagen of otherwise resistant target bacterial populations. Furthermore, we find that despite considerable differences in sequence, structure, and preferred substrates, deaminase toxins representing other subfamilies similarly possess mutagenic capacity. These results expand the range of outcomes which can result from interbacterial interactions and suggest that deaminases could play a significant role in generating genetic diversity in bacterial populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DddA mediates chromosome degradation and DNA replication arrest</title><p>We previously demonstrated that DddA is a <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> H111 T6SS-1 substrate that deaminates cytosine in double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mok et al., 2020</xref>). Cytosine deamination generates uracil, which is removed from DNA by the base excision repair (BER) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wallace, 2014</xref>). This process generates abasic sites and previous reports indicate that the presence of these lesions in close proximity on opposite strands can lead to double-strand DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'souza and Harrison, 2003</xref>). Thus, to begin dissecting the mechanism by which DddA leads to killing, we examined the impact of the toxin expression on chromosome stability in <italic>E. coli</italic>. DAPI staining coupled with fluorescence microscopy revealed that the nucleoids of cells exposed to DddA rapidly disintegrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We therefore investigated how cells lacking Ung activity (â<italic>ung</italic>) respond to DddA expression. The level of uracil in genomic DNA can be measured by treating fixed cells with a fluorescently conjugated, catalytically inactive Ung protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">RÃ³na et al., 2016</xref>). Employing this tool, we found that, as predicted, Ung inactivation leads to the accumulation of uracil in the DNA of DddA-intoxicated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, Ung inactivation alleviated both nucleoid disruption and DNA fragmentation in <italic>E. coli</italic> populations expressing DddA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>). In contrast, deletions of genes encoding the endonucleases Xth and Nfo, which operate downstream of Ung in BER by removing DNA abasic sites, had no impact on DddA-induced nucleoid disintegration. These findings collectively link the effects of DddA on chromosome integrity to uracil removal from DNA by the BER pathway.</p><p>If Ung-catalyzed removal of uracil from DNA and subsequent chromosome fragmentation is responsible for DddA-mediated killing, we reasoned that Ung inactivation should affect susceptibility to DddA. However, we found that <italic>E. coli</italic> wild-type and Î<italic>ung</italic> were equally susceptible to intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It was previously demonstrated that starvation for thymine, which leads to an increase of uracil incorporation in DNA, can disrupt DNA replication complexes, killing cells in a process known as thymineless death (TLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khodursky et al., 2015</xref>).

The mutagenic activity of <italic>P. syringae</italic> WP_011168804.1 suggested that contrary to other DYW proteins, the substrate range of this BaDTF2 member could include DNA. To examine this biochemically, we expressed and purified the toxin domain of the <italic>P. syringae</italic> enzyme and performed in vitro deamination assays on single-stranded and double-stranded DNA templates. Unlike DddA, the BaDTF2 protein exhibited potent cytosine deaminating activity toward ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Cytosine residues in dsDNA were also targeted, but with considerably lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

The structure of SsdA exhibits the basic characteristics of deaminase enzymes, including active site histidine and cysteine residues in position to coordinate a zinc ion, and the five Î²-strands (S1-5) and three Î±-helices (H1, H3, and H4) that constitute the core fold of deaminase superfamily enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>). More specifically, SsdA groups with the C-terminal hairpin division of the superfamily, and consistent with this assignment, S4 and S5 of SsdA are antiparallel. This is a notable divergence from all other characterized deaminases that act on ssDNA, for instance members of the APOBEC family, wherein these strands are parallel. Outside of its basic fold, SsdA bears little structural homology with characterized deaminases, including DddA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6CâE</xref>). Indeed, SsdA bears most overall structural similarity with the folate-dependent transformylase domain of PurH (DALI; Z score, 7.7), which contains the deaminase fold despite its sequence and functional divergence from deaminase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wolan et al., 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The structure of BaDF2 member single-strand DNA deaminase toxin AÂ (SsdA) bears little resemblance to double-stranded DNA deaminase AÂ (DddA) and reveals motifs differentiating toxins from RNA-targeting DYW proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram depiction of the SsdA<sub>tox</sub>-SsdA<sub>I</sub> structure.

Much of the SsdA-interacting surface of SsdA<sub>I</sub> is composed of a protrusion that includes an extended loop and two short helical segments that project residues into the active site cavity of SsdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Interestingly, these residues contact a conserved Ser-Gly-Trp (SGW) motif that resides in close proximity to the active site of SsdA and is unique to the BaDTF2 members of the DYW subgroup.</p><p>SsdA represents the first member of proteins classified into the DYW-family to be structurally characterized, precluding a direct comparison with proteins from this family known to target mRNA. However, the fact that SsdA displays a substrate preference distinct from the related plant and protist proteins led us to search for sequence elements that differ between BaDTF2 members and canonical DYW proteins. Our search revealed several conserved features of DYW proteins previously demonstrated to be important for mitochondrial or chloroplast gene editing in vivo that are absent from the BaDTF2 proteins. These include the eponymous C-terminal DYW residues, a CxC motif believed to be important for coordinating a second Zn<sup>2+</sup> atom, and a proline-glycine (PG) motif located within a characteristic insertion between S2 and H2 of the deaminase fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boussardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagoner et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, BaDTF2 proteins contain the aforementioned SGW motif within this insertion. Given the significant divergence of functionally critical regions between DYW and BaDTF2 proteins, we propose that BaDTF2 members constitute a new deaminase subfamily. The universal link of BaDTF2 proteins to interbacterial antagonism pathways leads us to speculate that BaDTF2 proteins beyond SsdA are likely to target ssDNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have shown that interbacterial deaminase toxins can act as potent mutagens of target cells. This discovery provides a previously unrecognized, and potentially widespread mechanism by which bacteria can acquire genetic diversity that allows them to adapt to changing environmental conditions. This can have important phenotypic consequences; for example, we found that a deaminase toxin can increase the frequency of rifampicin resistance. The ecological ramifications of mutagenesis by deaminase toxins are not yet understood. There are myriad sources of single-nucleotide substitutions within bacterial populations. These include endogenous cellular maintenance activities such as replication and metabolism, and environmental stresses including xenobiotics and ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schroeder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>). Studies often report Câ¢G-to-Tâ¢A transitions as the most common mutation type observed within evolving bacterial populations. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies are performed on monocultures of in vitro grown bacteria, limiting their applicability to our understanding of deaminase toxins delivered between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dettman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wielgoss et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, they do provide some insights into the origins of cytosine mutations in natural contexts, as they implicate spontaneous cytosine deamination in the GC skew observed between leading and lagging strands on bacterial chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhagwat et al., 2016</xref>). Relative to spontaneous cytosine deamination, the global contribution of cytosine deaminase toxins to the landscape of cytosine mutations is likely minor. However, under certain circumstances, cytosine deaminase toxins could significantly impact evolutionary outcomes. For instance, based on the ability of DddA to install multiple mutations on a single genome during one intoxication event, deaminase toxins may facilitate the emergence of phenotypes that are otherwise slow to evolve. This could be clinically relevant to the treatment of polymicrobial infections, where bacteria that possess deaminase toxins are present and the resistance to certain antibiotics requires a succession of mutagenic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van der Putten et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our study leads us to question whether mutagenesis of target cells by deaminase toxins occurs opportunistically, or whether this phenomenon could be an evolutionarily selected property of the toxin in certain instances. There is strong evidence that under certain circumstances hypermutator phenotypes proliferate within bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrick and Lenski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denamur et al., 2000</xref>). In such cells, the fitness contribution of beneficial mutations outweighs the reduction on fitness by other, deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denamur and Matic, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jayaraman, 2011</xref>). In spatially structured, cooperating bacterial systems, it is conceivable that such hypermutator phenotypes could be transiently achieved with the aid of neighboring cells via the delivery of a mutagenic toxin. Additionally, our data show that the same deaminase toxin can mutagenize certain bacteria while causing death in others. Therefore, a toxin that acts as a mutagen of a cooperating bacterium could also remain as a component of the antibacterial arsenal of the producer.</p><p>With a relatively small sampling of bacterial diversity, we found both species that are highly susceptible to DddA and others that are completely resistant to the toxin. This suggests that the determinants of cell fate following intoxication by DddA frequently vary between species. DNA repair pathways may provide one relevant source of diversity. Although our work did not implicate BER in susceptibility to DddA, we cannot rule out that the documented differences within this pathway could be responsible for at least part of the variability we observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van der Veen and Tang, 2015</xref>). Our data show that Ung effectively removes the uracil resulting from DddA activity. However, the bulk uracil measurement methods we employed may not capture small changes in uracil levels distributed across bacterial chromosomes, or localized hotspots of uracil accumulation. Thus, it remains possible that levels of other glycosylases that act on uracil to initiate BER, such as mismatched uracil glycosylase (Mug), may influence cell fate following exposure to DddA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mokkapati et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>mug</italic> orthologs are not universal among bacteria; the gene is present across Enterobacteriaceae, but it is not found in most Pseudomonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunder and Karch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silby et al., 2011</xref>). Another pathway that varies widely in bacteria and is implicated in uracil removal is mismatch repair (MMR). This pathway does not play a role in the removal of misincorporated uracils; however, those that derive from cytosine, and thus generate a mismatch, are potential substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krokan et al., 2014</xref>). There is strong evidence linking MMR to uracil removal from Uâ¢G mismatches in eukaryotes, but the sparsity of comparable data in bacterial systems renders it challenging to estimate the extent to which MMR influences susceptibility to DddA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LÃ³pez-Olmos et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Other explanations for the variable effects of DddA on recipient cells may be unrelated to DNA repair entirely. Killing of target cells by interbacterial antagonistic systems can rely on the delivery of exceedingly small numbers of toxin molecules â in some cases as few as one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cascales et al., 2007</xref>). We posit that the dependence on so few proteins could leave the fate of recipient cells subject to stochastic behavior. Recognition and turnover of DddA via cellular proteolytic machinery is one potential source of this stochasticity. In the majority of cells belonging to a resistant species, proteolytic machinery may fortuitously and effectively deplete DddA; however, in a small subset of these cells, this machinery might fail to act before DddA installs one or more mutations. In such a scenario, a species sensitive to the toxin would be expected to lack a pathway for DddA degradation altogether. This offers an explanation for our inability to detect mutations within surviving cells of bacteria sensitive to DddA; these may constitute a subpopulation that was not directly exposed to DddA. It is also possible that across a broader range of species, there exists a continuum of DddA intoxication outcomes. Interbacterial competition studies between <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> and a more expansive range of species will be informative in this regard.</p><p>Based on the inferred relationship between SsdA and DYW proteins, we were surprised to find that SsdA targets DNA, and not RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>). Our data suggest that there may be a mosaic of substrate specificities even within relatively closely related clades of deaminases. Analyses performed by Aravind and colleagues provide support for the evolutionary origins of DYW proteins in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>). Although there is substantial evidence implicating DYW proteins in RNA editing, little of this is direct and to our knowledge the activity of only one DYW protein has been reconstituted in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayes and Santibanez, 2017</xref>). Therefore, it will be of interest to better understand whether DYW family members target RNA exclusively, or whether some might play roles in DNA editing. In this regard, our structure of the SsdAâSsdA<sub>I</sub> complex likely provides some insights. For example, it places the PG motif region, which differs markedly between BaDTF2 and DYW proteins, in position to engage substrate. Our structure also permits an initial comparison between bacterial deaminase toxins that target dsDNA (DddA) versus ssDNA (SsdA). Despite the predicted shared ancestry of DddA and SsdA, DddA displays significantly greater structural relatedness to eukaryotic deaminases targeting ssDNA (AID/APOBEC) than it does to SsdA. Taken together, this suggests that cytosine deaminases targeting ssDNA evolved at least twice from the ancestral deaminase fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the differing target specificities of DddA and SsdA suggest that both ds and ssDNA may be effective targets for toxic deaminases. Given that ssDNA represents only a fraction of total genetic material typically present in a bacterial cell, this finding seems counterintuitive. One explanation may be that because highly transcribed genes are more likely to exist in a single-stranded state, the toxicity of SsdA could result from the targeting of these specific regions. Alternatively, the lower level of dsDNA targeting by SsdA that we observe in vitro may represent the physiologically relevant activity of the protein during cellular intoxication.</p><p>While nutrient deprivation typically results in growth arrest, thymine starvation induced through genetic inactivation or chemical inhibition of thymine biosynthesis leads to cell death in organisms from <italic>E. coli</italic> to humans, in a process known as TLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khodursky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanawalt, 2015</xref>). There remains no consensus on the precise mechanism of TLD, but it is nevertheless possible to draw parallels between TLD and DddA intoxication. Both processes involve the incorporation of uracil into DNA and produce complex phenotypes including DNA replication arrest and chromosome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khodursky et al., 2015</xref>). Also, for both TLD and DddA intoxication, the removal of uracil incorporated into DNA does not rescue cells from intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sangurdekar et al., 2010</xref>). More generally, suppressor mutants resistant to killing by TLD appear to be difficult to obtain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fonville et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">GuzmÃ¡n and MartÃ­n, 2015</xref>). Our finding that Ung inactivation alleviates the phenotype of nucleoid degradation, yet Ung-deficient strains remain as sensitive to intoxication as the wild type, indicates that redundancy built into the mechanism by which DddA kill cells could similarly prevent suppressor mutant emergence. For TLD, this property has enabled the development of anticancer and antimicrobial drugs that induce TLD by acting as thymine analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomson and Lamont, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsesmetzis et al., 2018</xref>); for DddA, difficulties associated with developing resistance to toxin activity may explain why toxins predicted to act as deaminases have become prevalent in the bacterial kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our studies of the mutagenic potential of deaminase toxins suggest these proteins may play an important role in the generation of diversity in microbial communities. Although researchers have overcome many hurdles to deciphering the intricate mechanistic details of interbacterial toxin delivery systems in vitro, it has remained difficult to extrapolate these results to the broader impact of the systems on bacterial ecology. In this regard, the indelible signature that deaminase toxins leave within the genomes of target cells offers a unique opportunity. Future studies aimed at mining genomic and metagenomic datasets for sequence signatures indicative of deaminase toxin activity have the potential to provide heretofore unobtainable insights into the complexities of bacterial interactions in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and culture methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, bacterial strains used in this study were cultivated in Lysogeny Broth (LB) at 37Â°C with shaking or on LB medium solidified with agar (LBA, 1.5% w/v, except as noted).

deaminase DddA in <italic>Burholderia cenocepacia</italic> on a variety of other bacteria, the role of its orthologs in other species, and a compelling survey of the previously unappreciated gene family. DddA deaminates cytosine to generate uracil, which is highly toxic to some bacteria, but other are resistant. This manuscript focuses on the identification and characterization of both the toxic and mutagenic capacity of DddA in susceptible and resistant cell populations, respectively. The authors show an increase in antibiotic resistance consistent with high mutagenesis rates. Both resistant and susceptible (those bacteria that survive competition) bacterial populations accumulate mutations. The authors go on to characterize additional classes of DddA like toxins and identify newly named SsdA1 from P. syringae as a DNA targeting deaminase. This study includes the structure of SsdA1 that indeed confirms its evolutionary relationship within this deaminase family, whose evolutionary origins are fascinating to ponder.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An interbacterial DNA deaminase toxin directly mutagenizes surviving target populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Vaughn S Cooper as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and George Perry as the Senior Editor.

Indeed, Figure 4 was devoted to this point. These data included: (i) uracil accumulation on the genome of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> during interbacterial competition with <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> containing DddA (Figure 4A and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1), (ii) mutation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> â<italic>ung</italic> during interbacterial competition with <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> containing DddA (Figure 4B-D), and <italic>iii</italic>) the demonstration that wild-type and â<italic>ungP. aeruginosa</italic> are equally susceptible to intoxication by DddA (Figure 4E).</p><p>Nevertheless, in our revised manuscript, we have added to these data, demonstrating that expression of DddA leads to nucleoid degradation in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a similar manner to its effect in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 3âfigure supplement 3).

I realise the authors are aware of the difference, but an estimate on how different these levels are would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The precise levels of T6SS effectors delivered to target cells has been difficult to quantify, as these proteins are recalcitrant to fusions, present at low levels, and it is technically challenging to separate target and donor cell populations on a rapid enough time-scale to make meaningful measurements. It is generally believed that very few molecules of any individual effector are delivered to a recipient cell via the T6SS. Single delivery (sheath contraction) events can be monitored by time-lapse microscopy and after just one or two of these events a target cell can be observed succumbing to intoxication (e.g. Basler et al., 2013, Gerc et al., 2015). If our current structural model of T6SS is correct, each assembled T6SS harbors only a few VgrG associated effectors, the class of effectors to which DddA belongs (Cherrak et al., 2019). This is obviously less than can be achieved through heterologous expression. However, as noted in the response to point #1, our studies of the outcome of effector delivery via the T6SS to a susceptible recipient (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) support our assertion that the heterologous expression studies we present mirror the natural intoxication process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why didn't you sequence WT genomes exposed for less time or concentration of DddA?

As background, we cannot sequence highly intoxicated wild-type bacteria owing to the BER-dependent nucleoid degradation that we document in this manuscript. However, a version of the experiment described by the reviewer is feasible and was reported in our initial study describing DddA. In short, we provided low level exposure of <italic>E. coli</italic> to DddA (by careful immunity titration) for a series of passages that included clonal bottlenecking. Our results indicated Câ¢G-to-Tâ¢A transitions in a 5â-TC-3â context accumulate disproportionately under these conditions (Mok et al., 2020).

With respect, we question the relevance of the study to the manuscript at hand. To our knowledge, there is no evidence that T6S effectors intoxicate cells in monoculture, which are the conditions employed in the study cited. Effector-producing strains are protected by cognate immunity proteins, limiting target cells to other species or to strains of the same species that possess different effectorâimmunity pairs (e.g. Diniz et al., 2015, Russell et al., 2014). Additionally, the <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> strain in the reviewerâs published work does not encode a homolog of DddA.</p><p>The spectrum and probability of spontaneous mutations under neutral selection in bacteria more broadly is relevant to our work and we cite such studies where appropriate.

As we note above (response #4), there is no evidence â and a wealth of direct and indirect negative data to refute â that endogenous production of the toxin leads to unchecked activity within the producing strain. Instead, our data clearly show that mutagenic activity of the toxin can occur when it is delivered via the T6SS (Figure 4). In this context, we see an increase of mutation frequency in the recipient population, and sequencing results combined with statistically analyses provide strong evidence that these mutations are attributable to DddA activity (they are enriched in Câ¢G-to-Tâ¢A transitions in a 5â-TC-3â context far above the rate at which this mutation arises spontaneously in the recipient species under investigation) (Figure 4B). Thus, we believe we have provided convincing evidence that DddA can exert mutagenic activity in a native context (when delivered to a contacting bacterium via the T6SS) and do not see a benefit to studying the effects of the toxin when over-expressed in the producing organism, a non-natural scenario.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion.

However, the scenario we are describing here is different from the classical problem of how mutator alleles become selected in populations. Specifically, we have shown that a toxin produced by one bacterial species can mutagenize a second species, thus transiently increasing its mutation rate. If this leads to an increase in the rate at which beneficial mutations arise in the recipient organism (as would be observed if that organism acquired a mutator allele), then we would argue that the toxin producer might indirectly benefit if the recipient organism is a cooperator.</p><p>We have revised this paragraph in our discussion in an attempt to clarify this reasoning (Discussion) and tone down our speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection âBacterial strains and culture methodsâ.

To this end, we have added competition results and mutagenesis assays for several additional competitor species to the manuscript (see Figure 3 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). While to date we have only observed mutagenesis of species resistant to intoxication, we acknowledge the possibility that in certain recipient species, delivery of DddA could result in killing of some cells and mutagenesis of others.

Several aspects of our protocol lead us to conclude that we can reliably detect multiple mutations conferred simultaneously by DddA in a single cell, and that our mutation frequency calculations are not impacted by jackpot effects. First, DddA-mediated intoxication experiments take place on a short time scale (one hour) and are initiated with bacterial populations in stationary phase. We have confirmed there is no significant growth of the intoxicated population under these conditions. To assess mutations conferred by DddA in single cells, we plate the intoxicated populations for single colonies, and then perform whole genome sequencing on individual clones, a standard microbiological technique for assaying traits in a clonal population deriving from a single cell. From the genome sequences of clones isolated in this manner, we detect 50 SNPs with a signature of DddA activity (Câ¢G-to-Tâ¢A transitions in a 5â-TC-3â context) across 11 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> clones and 82 such SNPs across seven EHEC clones. Additionally, in each case, the SNPs detected were present at near 100% frequency in the population, indicating they are unlikely to have arisen during the outgrowth period. Together, these results clearly indicate that multiple mutations are installed by the activity of DddA in single cells during their brief period of exposure to the toxin (subsection âDiverse deaminase toxins have mutagenic activityâ). In calculating the mutation frequencies reported in Figure 4, we similarly employed a short period of intoxication during which no detectable growth of intoxicated populations occurred, and thus jackpot effects of early mutations are avoided.</p><p>We have added a clarification to the text indicating that coculture experiments from which mutation frequencies were calculated or clones isolated for WGS were only performed for a single hour, thus limiting accumulation of mutations over multiple generations (subsection âBacteria resistant to DddA-mediated intoxication accumulate DddA-catalyzed mutationsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) On point 1, this argument is featured in the Abstract, which indicates that this remains a major claim of the paper, but it's unfounded.
