Prior studies primarily focus on the function of cell surface expressed Cx43 channels. Here, we reported a new role of mitochondrial Cx43 (mtCx43) and hemichannels (HCs) in modulating mitochondria homeostasis and function in bone osteocytes under oxidative stress. In murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 cells, the translocation of Cx43 to mitochondria was increased under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the mtCx43 level accompanied by elevated mtCx43 HC activity, determined by dye uptake assay. Cx43 knockdown (KD) by the CRISPR-Cas9 lentivirus system resulted in impairment of mitochondrial function, primarily manifested as decreased ATP production. Cx43 KD had reduced intracellular reactive oxidative species levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, live-cell imaging results demonstrated that the proton flux was dependent on mtCx43 HCs because its activity was specifically inhibited by an antibody targeting Cx43 C-terminus. The co-localization and interaction of mtCx43 and ATP synthase subunit F (ATP5J2) were confirmed by Förster resonance energy transfer and a protein pull-down assay. Together, our study suggests that mtCx43 HCs regulate mitochondrial ATP generation by mediating K<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, and ATP transfer across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the interaction with mitochondrial ATP synthase, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial redox levels in response to oxidative stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>connexin 43</kwd><kwd>ATP synthase</kwd><kwd>proton</kwd><kwd>osteocytes</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA148724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acosta</surname><given-names>Francisca M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AR072020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AQ-1507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial Cx43 hemichannels regulate ATP generation by mediating K+, H+, and ATP transfer across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the interaction with mitochondrial ATP synthase, contributing to maintenance of mitochondrial redox and cell protection under oxidative stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The connexins (Cxs) family comprises 20 members in mice and 21 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Söhl and Willecke, 2004</xref>). Six Cx subunits form a hexamer as a hemichannel (HC), allowing molecules less than 1 kDa to pass through (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodenough and Paul, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>). HCs function as a gate for molecular communication between intracellular and extracellular spaces, allowing the passage of molecules and the exchange of information across the membrane. Two HCs in adjacent cells can form a gap junction, which assists in cell-cell communication directly from the cytoplasm of adjoining cells, thus synchronizing cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iyyathurai et al., 2013</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, undocked Cx HCs remain mainly closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sáez et al., 2010</xref>). However, pathophysiological conditions, such as injury or disease, drive their opening, leading to the augmentation of certain pathological conditions, such as increased inflammatory reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2022</xref>). HC opening is stimulated by many factors like low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, oxidative stress, mechanical signals, and extracellular alkalinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burra and Jiang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decrock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Francis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gault et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leithe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schalper et al., 2010</xref>). The opening of Cx43 HCs also exhibits a positive impact on cells, especially in bone osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Cx 43 (Cx43) is the most ubiquitously expressed Cx in various cell types such as endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, astrocytes, etc. It is also expressed in cellular organelles like mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Mitochondrial Cx43 (mtCx43) is orientated with the C-terminus facing the mitochondrial intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miro-Casas et al., 2009</xref>). The physiological role of Cx43 in mitochondria remains largely elusive. Some data suggest that mtCx43 regulates K<sup>+</sup> influx to the mitochondrial matrix, increasing mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boengler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miro-Casas et al., 2009</xref>). The protective role mtCx43 plays in pre-conditioning may be benefited from the channel property of Cx43 HCs. Many ion channels located in mitochondria are involved in ensuring the ion exchange between mitochondrial membranes. Ions, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, etc., not only participate in preserving normal mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) but are also involved in regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O’Rourke, 2007</xref>). Thus, the ion-permeable channels are very important to normal mitochondrial function, especially ATP production. In mitochondria, the permeability of mtCx43 HCs for ions and molecules is dedicated to a mild uncoupling of the mitochondrial inner membrane, which eventually causes protection for the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruiz-Meana et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Osteocytes are the most abundant cell in bone, occupying 90–95% of adult total bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonewald, 2011</xref>). Cx43 HCs, richly present in osteocytes, prominently mediate the anabolic action of mechanical loading and regulate the response to mechanical loading and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hua et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Oxidative stress causes apoptosis, further affecting the normal function of the osteocytic network. Cx43 HC is reported to reduce cell death induced by oxidative stress in osteocytic murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 (MLO-Y4) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kar et al., 2013</xref>). Plasma membrane Cx43 HCs open under oxidative stress, which protects osteocytes from apoptosis. Oxidative stress induces the accumulation of membrane Cx43 HCs at the cell surface, alleviating the oxidative stress caused by the oxidant stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kar et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of prior studies focused on Cx43 HCs on the plasma membrane, while mtCx43 function in osteocytes under oxidative stress remains largely unexplored. This study provides new mechanistic insight into the role of mtCx43 and HCs in regulating mitochondria function and protecting cells against oxidative damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cx43 translocates to mitochondria and forms functional HCs</title><p>To elucidate the role of Cx43 in osteocytes under oxidative stress, we treated osteocyte MLO-Y4 cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and investigated the cellular distribution of Cx43. We found that the mitochondrial localization of Cx43 was increased by its fluorescence signal overlap with MitoTracker, a mitochondrial specific dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Manders’ overlap coefficiency analysis indicated a significant increase in co-localization between Cx43 and MitoTracker with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For further confirmation, succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA), a component of mitochondrial complex II, was also used as a marker for mitochondria as well. High-magnification images of isolated mitochondria further confirmed a clear overlap of SDHA and Cx43 fluorescence signals (yellow area; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis further showed the accumulation of Cx43 protein in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with a significant increase after 2 hr of treatment, peaking after 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Purify of mitochondria preparation was examined using different organelle markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess if the mtCx43 formed functional HCs, a dye-uptake assay was performed. Lucifer yellow (LY) dye (425 Da), which can permeate Cx43 HCs, was used as an indicator of active HCs, while tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-dextran (10 kDa), which is too large to pass through HCs, was used as a control to exclude non-specific dye uptake. The HC function was indicated by the ratio of LY/TRITC-dextran. Under standard conditions (Veh), the dye uptake in isolated mitochondria, following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To further confirm that functional mtCx43 HCs caused the increase in dye uptake induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, carbenoxolone (CBX), a conventional Cx channel blocker, and Cx43 C-terminal (CT) antibody, which specifically binds to Cx43 C-terminus, were used. We used Cx43(CT) antibody to assess mtCx43 HCs because the C-terminus of mtCx43 faces the mitochondrial intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boengler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miro-Casas et al., 2009</xref>). Cx43(E2) antibody, a specific Cx43 HC inhibitor targeting the extracellular loop of Cx43, and rabbit IgG, were used as controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siller-Jackson et al., 2008</xref>). We found that the LY uptake increment was inhibited by CBX and the Cx43(CT) antibody in mitochondria isolated from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, while Cx43(E2) and IgG antibodies had no effect on mtCx43 HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further confirmation was done with another cell line, osteoblastic cell, MC3T3-E1. We observed the similar translocation phenotype in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that Cx43 migrates to mitochondria, and mtCx43 HCs open in response to oxidative stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Connexin 43 (Cx43) translocated to mitochondrial and formed functional hemichannels (HCs) induced by oxidative stress in osteocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment induced the translocation of Cx43 to mitochondria in the murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 (MLO-Y4) cells.

The process works by pH-insensitive blue fluorescent protein mTagBFP being fused before the N-terminus of pHluorin as a calibration, and the signal ratio of GFP/BFP increasing during the increment of pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). mTagBFP-pHluorin was not specifically localized, primarily in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Cx43-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and ATP5J2-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) were co-transfected into MLO-Y4 cells. CFP and YFP form a FRET pair in which CFP works as the donor and YFP as the acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyawaki et al., 1997</xref>). The FRET signal was detected when the two fluorescent proteins were in proximity of less than 10 nm to each other. ATP5J2-EYFP signal was primarily detected in the mitochondria region, while the Cx43-CFP signal was also detected in other parts of the cell. However, the FRET signal was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that Cx43 and ATP5J2 physically interacted with each other in the mitochondria.

Moreover, the direct physical interaction between mtCx43 and mitochondrial ATP5J2 demonstrated the coupling of mtCx43 with a subunit of ATP synthase, the mitochondrial complex V. This interaction is likely to have a positive impact on transferring ATP generated by complex V via mtCx43 HCs to increase ATP supply in the cytosol, a critical step for protecting cells against oxidative stress. Together, our data unveiled a new mechanism concerning the unique role of mtCx43 HCs in mitochondria function, ATP generation, and transport under oxidative insults.</p><p>Osteocytes, as the most abundant bone cell types, are dynamic and responsive cells, forming a network in the skeleton to orchestrate bone modeling and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonewald, 2011</xref>). Oxidative stress is a major insult to bone tissue, and increased oxidative stress during postmenopausal or glucocorticoid medication is one of the major underlying causes of bone loss and osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Domazetovic et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we observed that when an acute oxidant stimulus occurs, Cx43 is rapidly translocated into the mitochondria inner membrane. We used Cx43 KD MLO-Y4 cells to explore the role of mtCx43 and found that mtCx43 expression was tightly correlated with ATP generation. Decreased OCR in permeabilized Cx43 KO MLO-Y4 cells indicated the role of Cx43 in coupling the mitochondrial inner membrane and ATP production. Mitochondria are the fuel factory for cells, producing the bioenergetic fuel ATP for cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spinelli and Haigis, 2018</xref>). Mitochondrial electron transport complexes I–V are responsible for ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Accompanied by transporting electrons, mitochondrial electronic complexes generate a proton gradient between the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the mitochondrial inner matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). ATP synthase, also known as complex V, utilizes this proton gradient to produce ATP from ADP to preserve the normal homeostasis and function of cells.</p><p>Given the vital role of protons in mitochondria, we utilized pHluorin, as a proton indicator, to investigate the impact of mtCx43 on local proton activity indicated by pH changes. Cx43KD MLO-Y4 cells had reduced pH changes in both cellular and mitochondrial compartments. It has been reported that plasma membrane Cx43 channels permeate protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swietach et al., 2007</xref>). If mtCx43 HCs mediate proton transfer between the intermembrane space and matrix, we would expect to observe an increased proton gradient in Cx43KD cells. Instead, we observed decreased ATP5J2-pHluorin signal and pH gradient in Cx43KD cells. The reduced proton level in the intermembrane space and pH gradient was also detected when mtCx43 HCs were inhibited by Cx43(CT) antibody. Cx43 has four transmembrane domains with a long cytosolic CT. Due to the orientation of mtCx43 HCs with the CT facing the mitochondrial intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boengler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miro-Casas et al., 2009</xref>), Cx43(CT) specific antibody, rather than Cx43(E2) antibody, functioned as the gating inhibitor for mtCx43 HCs. The addition of PMP, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane, permits the entry of the Cx43(CT) antibody into the cell and targets the mtCx43 in intact mitochondria. The consistent results obtained with Cx43KD and treatment with Cx43(CT) antibody also reduced protons at the intermembrane space and the pH gradient. These results indicate that mtCx43 HCs may not primarily act as leaky proton channels but may instead regulate the ion transport that indirectly increases the proton transport against the proton gradient. Indeed, the mitochondrial membrane potential measured by TMRE was decreased in Cx43KD cells.</p><p>In mitochondria, both H<sup>+</sup> and <sup>∙</sup>OH gradients across the intermembrane space are essential for the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee, 2019</xref>). If taking the small pH chemical gradient into account, the mitochondrial membrane potential is, more correctly, a proton motive force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nicholls, 2002</xref>). The electric membrane potential of mitochondria ranges from –150 to 180 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santo-Domingo and Demaurex, 2012</xref>). Wide-range changes of H<sup>+</sup> influx will cause the depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The opening of mPTP causes a propagated loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Meanwhile, mPTP opening can be triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ong and Gustafsson, 2012</xref>). mtCx43 is reported to engage in the inhibition of mPTP opening, ultimately resulting in the maintenance of ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferko et al., 2019</xref>). Azarashvili et al. also revealed that CBX shortened the lag time before mPTP opening and accelerated the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced permeability transition in synaptic and non-synaptic rat brain mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azarashvili et al., 2011</xref>). In adipose tissue, specific KD of Cx43 leads to a significantly lower expression of components on mitochondrial complexes II, III, and V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). The decrease in associated proteins in the ETCs may contribute to the lower energy expenditure.</p><p>Cx43 HCs have a large conductance (~220 pS) with relatively low ion selectivity, allowing the passage of ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Smet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies indicated the permeability of mtCx43 HCs to K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boengler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miro-Casas et al., 2009</xref>). The submaximal K<sup>+</sup> entry into the mitochondria matrix enhances electron flow with a preserved membrane potential and production of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heinen et al., 2007</xref>). To counter the K<sup>+</sup> influx, mitochondrial ETC complexes I, III, and IV pump protons out, into the intermembrane space to enhance the proton gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nolfi-Donegan et al., 2020</xref>). mtCx43 HCs, thus, are likely to mediate the transfer of K<sup>+</sup> from the intermembrane space into the matrix. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of the passage of protons following the gradient from the intermembrane space to the matrix. In the intermembrane space, K<sup>+</sup> concentration is about 140 mM, while H<sup>+</sup> is around 0.1 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garlid and Paucek, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the amount of K<sup>+</sup> passed through mtCx43 HCs from the intermembrane space to the matrix driven by electrical gradient is expected to be proportionally much greater than that of H<sup>+</sup>. We did observe the reduction of proton leak in Cx43KD mitochondria, indicating the relatively minor role of mtCx43 HCs in transferring H<sup>+</sup> from intermembrane space. pHluorin is a pH sensitive GFP variant, and the use of a fusion protein by linking pHluorin with Cx43 CT permits the detection of proton changes close to Cx43 in the intermembrane space. The local Cx43-pHluorin signal in the mitochondria region displayed an oscillation pattern, suggesting that there is proton flux activity close to mtCx43. Cx43(CT) antibody abolished this oscillation, suggesting mtCx43 HCs regulate proton flux in the intermembrane space. Taken together, the mtCx43 HCs are likely to play a predominant role in transferring K<sup>+</sup> into the matrix, thus the proton output into the intermembrane space through electron transport complexes is more significant than proton influx into the matrix, therefore increasing membrane potential, proton gradient, and ultimately generating more ATP.</p><p>The majority of the proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane is thought to be correlated to the adenine nucleotide translocase and uncoupling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Divakaruni and Brand, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jastroch et al., 2010</xref>). Proton leak is tightly linked to ROS generation; increased mtROS generated from ETC induces a proton leak, and the proton leak suppresses ROS production as a feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). There are conflicting studies on proton leak and ROS generation; few reports suggest an increased ROS level after a proton leak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boveris and Chance, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Starkov and Fiskum, 2003</xref>), while most studies corroborate the positive feedback loop of proton leak and ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brookes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Echtay et al., 2002</xref>). The controversy may be caused by the amplitude of the proton leak, for a mild-moderate proton leak is reported to be protective during I/R injury in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nadtochiy et al., 2006</xref>). In our case, the proton leak mediated by mtCx43 HCs appears to be at mild-moderated levels and, thus, may play a protective role on osteocytes.</p><p>Under normal conditions, few mtCx43 are present in the mitochondria, while under oxidative stress, the accumulation of Cx43 in the mitochondria inner membrane and functional mtCx43 HCs appears to play significant roles in enhancing the ATP generation as well as export of ATP into the cytosol. We showed a significant reduction of ATP in both mitochondria and cytosol with the deletion of Cx43 in osteocytes. Cx43 HCs have been reported to mediate the transport of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis in mouse hearts indicated the new interaction between Cx43 with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and the beta-subunit of the electron-transfer protein (ETFB). AIF and ETFB are typical proteins regulating mitochondria OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denuc et al., 2016</xref>). We showed that mtCx43 co-localized and interacted with a subunit of ATPase, ATP5J2 in complex V, and the ATP level in the cytosol was reduced in Cx43KD. It is likely that mtCx43 HCs may enhance the transport of the freshly generated ATP by complex V to the inner membrane space and cytosol. Cx43KD had no effect on the expression of the <italic>Slc25a5</italic> gene, an ATP/ADP translocase, suggesting that increased ATP level in the cytosol is not caused by the impact of mtCx43 on this transporting mechanism. Thereby, the close physical interaction may help accelerate the export of ATP synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix by complex V. The increased ATP level in cytosol will protect the cells against oxidative damage since oxidative stress depletes cytosolic ATP, leading to cell apoptosis. mtCx43’s protecting role on a cardiac pre-condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodríguez-Sinovas et al., 2018</xref>) may also benefit from these mechanisms. At this stage, we cannot exclude other possible roles of mtCx43 that ought to be investigated in the future.</p><p>Together, the translocation of Cx43 to mitochondria in osteocytes after oxidative stress acts as a cell ‘rescue mission’ by promoting ATP production through increased mitochondrial membrane potential and proton gradient through activation of mitochondrial complexes. The localization and interaction of complex V ATPase may aid in the transfer of ATP into the cytosol in protecting cells against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure

Specifically, we performed western blot to identify the components within the isolated mitochondria fraction and used protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) as the marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and SDHA for mitochondria, and syntaxin 6 (STX6) for Golgi. The result showed some contamination of ER and Golgi in mitochondrial fractions. Considering the clear enrichment in the mitochondrial fraction indicated by SDHA, we then performed direct staining in isolated mitochondria using fluorescent dyes for different organelles and the amount of fluorescence was examined by confocal imaging. The result indicated that the isolated mitochondrial component was mostly pure with minimal ER contamination (Figure 1—figure supplement 1BandC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please explain how the anti-Cx43 reaches the C-termini in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The manuscript would also benefit from additional detail related to the PMP protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We used PMP as a plasma membrane permeabilizer, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane. Meanwhile, PMP has a 6x higher affinity efficiency with the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) compared to the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM), according to the manufacturer. In addition, MOM has much higher permeability than MIM. It is likely that the antibody can reach the intermembrane space. To prove this, we conducted new experiments using PMP-treated MLO-Y4 cells and treated cells with IgG, CT and/or E2 antibodies. After staining with Alexa 488 conjugated anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody, we directly observed the signal under a confocal microscope (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). Cx43 CT signal was overlapped with the MitoTracker signal (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B), IgG group did not have any signal, and Cx43(E2) treated group have some signals, but they are not co-localized in mitochondria. From this observation, we proved the localization of the Cx43(CT) antibody at mitochondria as well as the orientation of mtCx43 with CT facing the intermembrane space/cytosolic side. We clarified the detailed concentration of PMP used in the MandM section. We observed that membrane was permeabilized soon after PMP treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide figure 1 with better resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the previous images with new confocal images of higher magnification and resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If experimental evidence is missing, please avoid overstatements.
