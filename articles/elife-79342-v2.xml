On the other hand, Tregs promote tumor growth by inhibiting anticancer immunity. In this study, we identified that Tregs increase the quorum of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells required for the induction of experimental autoimmune diabetes in mice. Their major suppression mechanism is limiting available IL-2, an essential T-cell cytokine. Specifically, Tregs inhibit the formation of a previously uncharacterized subset of antigen-stimulated KLRK1<sup>+</sup> IL-7R<sup>+</sup> (KILR) CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, which are distinct from conventional effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. KILR CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show superior cell-killing abilities in vivo. The administration of agonistic IL-2 immunocomplexes phenocopies the absence of Tregs, i.e., it induces KILR CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, promotes autoimmunity, and enhances antitumor responses in mice. Counterparts of KILR CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were found in the human blood, revealing them as a potential target for immunotherapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>As well as protecting us from invading pathogens, like bacteria or viruses, our immune system can also identify dangerous cells of our own that may cause the body harm, such as cancer cells. Once detected, a population of immune cells called cytotoxic T cells launch into action to kill the potentially harmful cell. However, sometimes the immune system makes mistakes and attacks healthy cells which it misidentifies as being dangerous, leading to autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Special immune cells called T regulatory lymphocytes, or ‘Tregs’, can suppress the activity of cytotoxic T cells, preventing them from hurting the body’s own cells. While this can have a positive impact and reduce the effects of autoimmunity, Tregs can also make the immune system less responsive to cancer cells and allow tumors to grow. But how Tregs alter the behavior of cytotoxic T cells during autoimmune diseases and cancer is poorly understood. While multiple mechanisms have been proposed, none of these have been tested in living animal models of these diseases.</p><p>To address this, Tsyklauri et al. studied Tregs in laboratory mice which had been modified to have autoimmune diabetes, which is when the body attacks the cells responsible for producing insulin. The experiments revealed that Tregs take up a critical signaling molecule called IL-2 which cytotoxic T cells need to survive and multiply. As a result, there is less IL-2 molecules available in the environment, inhibiting the cytotoxic T cells’ activity. Furthermore, if Tregs are absent and there is an excess of IL-2, this causes cytotoxic T cells to transition into a previously unknown subset of T cells with superior killing abilities.</p><p>Tsyklauri et al. were able to replicate these findings in two different groups of laboratory mice which had been modified to have cancer. This suggests that Tregs suppress the immune response to cancer cells and prevent autoimmunity using the same mechanism. In the future, this work could help researchers to develop therapies that alter the behavior of cytotoxic T cells and/or Tregs to either counteract autoimmune diseases, or help the body fight off cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>IL-2</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic</kwd><kwd>immune suppression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FunDiT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stepanek</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union - Next Generation EU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LX22NPO5103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stepanek</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union - Next Generation EU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LX22NPO5102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-03435Y</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stepanek</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-20548S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Fund for Young Scientists at the University of Basel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS2336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stepanek</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles University Grant Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1706119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsyklauri</surname><given-names>Oksana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-18046S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stepanek</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulatory T cell suppress cytotoxic T cells in autoimmunity and cancer by taking up IL-2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physiological immune responses aim at invading pathogens, but not at healthy tissues. There are two major principles of controlling self-reactive lymphocytes: clonal deletion (central tolerance) and suppression (peripheral tolerance). FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a major force of peripheral tolerance as they regulate homeostasis and immune responses of conventional T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Josefowicz and Rudensky, 2009</xref>). The absence of Tregs in FOXP3-deficient individuals leads to a severe autoimmune condition called immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunkow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wildin et al., 2001</xref>). On the other hand, Tregs inhibit antitumor immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Togashi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although most studies have focused on how Tregs suppress conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are also regulated by Tregs. At steady state, Tregs suppress the proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chinen et al., 2016</xref>) and prevent the spontaneous differentiation of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laidlaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalia et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, Tregs suppress antigenic responses of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kastenmuller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pace et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple mechanisms of Treg-mediated suppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been proposed, such as reducing the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC) via CTLA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kastenmuller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schildknecht et al., 2010</xref>), limiting the availability of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kastenmuller et al., 2011</xref>), production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laidlaw et al., 2015</xref>) and TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Green et al., 2003</xref>), and limiting the production of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 chemokines by APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pace et al., 2012</xref>). However, none of these studies investigated the interaction between Tregs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in an autoimmune model. Thus, it is still unclear which of these mechanisms is the most important for preventing self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from inducing an autoimmune disease.</p><p>A single study addressed how Tregs suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses with various affinities to the cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pace et al., 2012</xref>). The authors concluded that Tregs inhibit CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation by low-affinity, but not high-affinity, antigens. In such a case, Tregs would not correct errors of central tolerance by suppressing highly self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that escape negative selection in the thymus. Their tolerogenic role would be limited to increasing the antigen-affinity threshold in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">King et al., 2012</xref>) by suppressing positively selected CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with intermediate to low affinity to self-antigens.</p><p>In this study, we focused on Treg-mediated peripheral tolerance, which prevents self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from inducing an autoimmune pathology. We found that Tregs increase the number of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells required to trigger experimental diabetes across a wide range of their affinities to self-antigens. In addition, we observed that excessive IL-2 prevents Tregs from suppressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro as well as during autoimmune and antitumor responses in vivo. Moreover, Treg depletion, as well as high IL-2 levels, induces the expansion of an unusual population of potent cytotoxic KLRK1<sup>+</sup> IL-7R<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence that the major mechanism of Treg suppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is limiting the availability of IL-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tregs increase the quorum of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for inducing an autoimmune pathology</title><p>To study the potential role of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the autoimmune response of self-reactive T cells, we employed a model of experimental autoimmune diabetes based on the transfer of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific OT-I T cells into double-transgenic mice expressing ovalbumin in pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurts et al., 1998</xref>) and diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Most of the experiments were performed using RIP.OVA DEREG mice carrying a random insertion of a transgene encoding for DTR-GFP fusion protein under the control of <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lahl et al., 2007</xref>), but some experiments were performed using <italic>Foxp3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> RIP.OVA strain with DTR-GFP knocked-in into the 3' untranslated region of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequent priming of OT-I T cells induced the formation of effector T cells and eventual destruction of pancreatic β-cells. Administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) selectively depleted Tregs uncovering their role in this autoimmune pathology. The major advantages of this model are (i) known etiology – the pathology is triggered by self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, (ii) control of key parameters (number of transferred OT-I T cells, affinity of the priming antigen, presence of Tregs, etc.), and (iii) the bypass of central tolerance, allowing us to study the mechanisms of peripheral tolerance separately from the central tolerance.</p><p>The induction of diabetes in the majority of Treg-replete mice required 10<sup>6</sup> adoptively transferred OT-I T cells followed by priming with OVA peptide and LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). This revealed efficient mechanisms of peripheral tolerance preventing the self-reactive T cells from destroying the insulin-producing cells. After the depletion of Tregs, the number of transferred OT-I T cells, sufficient to induce diabetes in the vast majority of animals, dropped dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observed that increased glucose levels in the urine and blood are preceded by abnormal morphology of the pancreatic islets and loss of insulin production together with the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the islets on day 4 post immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Accordingly, the expansion of OT-I T cells in the spleen was enhanced in Treg-deficient mice compared with Treg-replete mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). When 10<sup>6</sup> OT-I T cells were transferred, 50% of Treg-depleted mice developed diabetes, even though they were primed with LPS alone without the cognate peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This was possible because the small amount of endogenous OVA was sufficient to prime OT-I T cells in the absence of Tregs, as revealed by more robust expansion and CD44<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>-</sup> effector T-cell formation in <italic>Foxp3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> RIP.OVA than in <italic>Foxp3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Overall, these results revealed that Tregs represent an important mechanism of peripheral tolerance that prevents the induction of diabetes by self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Depletion of Tregs decreases the quorum of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells required for diabetes induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of RIP.

IL-2ic have markedly increased biological activity in comparison to IL-2 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyman et al., 2006</xref>). We used IL-2ic with JES6 antibody clone, which selectively promotes IL-2 signaling in T cells expressing high-affinity IL-2Rαβγ trimeric IL-2 receptor, or with the antibody clone S4B6, which promotes IL-2 signaling irrespective of IL-2Rα expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spangler et al., 2015</xref>). Both clones of IL-2ic broke the peripheral tolerance and induced the onset of autoimmune diabetes similarly to the Treg-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). IL-2ic promoted the formation of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector OT-I T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), despite a dramatic IL-2-dependent expansion of Tregs at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Overall, these results showed that Tregs are unable to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the excess of IL-2 signal, although Tregs themselves expand dramatically, which should augment their overall suppressive capacity with the exception of the limiting IL-2 mechanism. This supports the hypothesis that the major mechanism of Treg-mediated suppression of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is the reduction of IL-2 availability. This IL-2-dependent mechanism might be specific for the suppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells since antigen-activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were much more responsive to IL-2 than activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Tregs suppress formation of a unique subset of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells</title><p>To study how Treg-mediated suppression alters the gene expression profiles of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we analyzed the transcriptomes of OT-I T cells primed in the presence or absence of Tregs on a single-cell level.

Unsupervised clustering highlighted five distinct activated OT-I T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Based on their gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and comparison with CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets formed during an antiviral response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we identified clusters 0 and 1 as early effector T cells, cluster 2 as memory T cells precursors, and cluster 3 as precursors of exhausted T cells. Cluster 4, on the other hand, did not match to any established CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subset. It was characterized by the expression of a natural killer (NK) cell activation receptor gene <italic>Klrk1</italic> (alias <italic>Nkg2d</italic>), <italic>Gzmb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and by the overall similarity to the NK cell gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, these cells occurred almost exclusively in the absence of Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). This cluster could be further divided into two subsets.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of IL-2/JES6 immunocomplexes which were previously considered tolerogenic, in a BCL1 leukemia model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

On the contrary, our data shows that it promotes antitumor response of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, particularly in the combination with the immunogenic chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Obeid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Kin, 2021</xref>), and that this anti-tumor activity is not counteracted by Tregs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated how Tregs prevent CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell mediated autoimmune pathology. Using a well-controlled system based on the transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for a pancreatic neo-self-antigen, we revealed that regulatory T cells substantially increase the quorum of self-reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 2017</xref>) required to induce the autoimmune pathology.</p><p>We observed that Tregs do not alter the antigen-affinity discrimination as they suppress both high-affinity and low-affinity CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is in an apparent contrast with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pace et al., 2012</xref>) concluding that Tregs suppress exclusively low-affinity T-cell responses. The most possible explanation is that the previous study focused on the role of Tregs in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, where the presence or depletion of Tregs might regulate the kinetics of pathogen clearance and thus the dose of bacterial antigens. Contrary to that, the dose of the priming antigen was constant in our experimental diabetes.</p><p>We have identified the reduction of available IL-2 as the major mechanism of Treg-mediated tolerance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The evidence is that Treg depletion increases IL-2 signaling in these cells, i.e., pSTAT5 levels and expression of IL-2-responsive genes, and that the administration of IL-2 and IL-2ic mimics the absence of Tregs in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Strong exogenous IL-2 signals stimulate the expansion of Tregs and the expression of their effector molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tomala and Kovar, 2016</xref>), which should enhance all their potential suppression mechanisms with the notable exception of IL-2 sequestration. However, as this exogenous IL-2 signal mimics the effect of Treg depletion in our model, mechanisms non-targeting IL-2 do not seem to contribute substantially to the suppression of self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This conclusion is in line with some previous studies of Treg-mediated suppression of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNally et al., 2011</xref>) and with the importance of IL-2Rα expression in self-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for the infiltration of pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marchingo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It has been found that the biological activity of IL-2ic is dictated by the anti-IL-2 mAb clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spangler et al., 2015</xref>). IL-2/JES6 immunocomplexes selectively stimulate cells expressing the high-affinity trimeric IL-2 receptor and were considered as an immunosuppressive agent acting via the expansion of Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tomala and Kovar, 2016</xref>). In contrast, our conclusion that IL-2 restriction is the major mechanism of Treg-mediated suppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells implies that the administration of IL-2/JES6 should release antigen-activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the Treg control. Indeed, IL-2/JES6 in combination with chemotherapy significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice in two different tumor models in a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-dependent manner. Accordingly, the administration of IL-2/JES6 after priming, but not before the transfer of self-reactive T cells, decreased the T-cell quorum for the induction of experimental diabetes. Collectively, these results reveal that a strong sustained IL-2 signal, even if selective for IL-2Rα<sup>+</sup> cells, potentiates antigen-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell antitumor immunity and autoimmunity despite its concomitant stimulatory effects on Tregs. Recently, a combinational therapy of in vitro expanded polyclonal Tregs and low-dose IL-2 was tested in patients with type I diabetes in a phase I clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2021</xref>). The authors of the study did not observe a benefit of this intervention for the patients but they reported an expansion of Tregs along with activated NK and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which corresponds to our conclusions.</p><p>Our finding that IL-2 restriction is the major mechanism of Treg-mediated regulation of self- and tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells does not exclude the involvement of additional mechanisms regulating other immune cell types, such as conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. On the contrary, there is substantial evidence that Tregs suppress conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells largely via mechanisms not dependent on IL-2 sequestration. First, we show that antigen-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are less sensitive to IL-2 signals than CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo, which limits the potential impact of the IL-2 restriction on them. Second, it has been shown that Tregs lacking the high-affinity IL-2 receptor, implied in IL-2 sequestration, can still control the homeostasis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chinen et al., 2016</xref>). Third, it has been shown that Tregs suppress conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by depleting their cognate peptide-MHCII from APC, which is not applicable for the suppression of MHCI-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkaya et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, a recent study proposed that self-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produce IL-2 locally attracting Tregs to their close proximity, which leads to the suppression of later phases of self-reactive T-cell activation at least partially via limiting IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Antigenic stimulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of excessive IL-2, induced by depletion of Tregs or by administration of exogenous IL-2R agonists, leads to the formation of a previously uncharacterized subset of KILR effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. They express high levels of cytotoxic molecules, such as granzymes, but unlike conventional effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, they also express high levels of IL-7R. Moreover, they express several NK receptors, including KLRK1/NKG2D, which is involved in target cell killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prajapati et al., 2018</xref>). Since these cells show superior cytotoxic properties in vivo, suppression of their formation is probably a major mechanism of Treg-mediated self-tolerance. On the other hand, the existence of the KILR effector gene expression program suggests the possibility that these cells might arise naturally in specific immunological conditions, such as some type of infection. Indeed, it has been shown that the infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus induces a transient drop in Treg numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schorer et al., 2020</xref>), which might alleviate the Treg-mediated suppression of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the early phase of the immune response. However, we could not find KILR effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in any scRNAseq dataset from the course of mouse infection, suggesting that such KILR effector-inducing conditions would be rather rare. On the other hand, we found increased frequencies of KILR cells in the spleens and tumors in mice with cancer treated with Dox and IL-2ic. The antigenic stimulation was probably provided by tumor-associated antigens released from cancer cells undergoing the immunogenic cell death induced by Dox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Obeid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Kin, 2021</xref>). The expression of IL-7Rα in KILR effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is striking as conventional effector T cells are characterized as IL-7R<sup>-</sup>, which is associated with their short lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaech et al., 2003</xref>). A previous study showed that antigenic stimulation together with activating antibodies to OX40 and 4-1BB TNF-family receptors induced IL-7R<sup>+</sup> effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). These cells produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in an IL-7-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Since 4-1BB signaling has been shown to enhance IL-2 production and IL-2Rα expression in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barsoumian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oh et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that those IL-7R<sup>+</sup> effector cells were induced via a strong IL-2 signal. However, as the gene expression profile of OX40/4-1BB-induced IL-7R<sup>+</sup> effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells has not been analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), it is not clear whether or not these cells have other similarities to KILR effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Our reanalysis of publicly available datasets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells revealed KILR-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the human peripheral blood. These cells show patterns of KILR T-cell gene expression, but they do not express high levels of cytotoxic molecules, probably because they lack recent antigenic/IL-2 stimulation. Therefore, future studies are needed to resolve their phenotype and function. In any case, the potent cytotoxic capacity and their expansion by IL-2 agonists make KILR effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells a promising clinical target in cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies, peptides, and dyes</title><p>Antibodies to the following antigens were purchased from BioLegend and used for flow cytometry: CD4 BV650 (RM4-5, #100545), CD4 Alexa Flour 700 (RM4-5, #100536), CD4 APC-Cy7 (GK15, #100414), CD4 APC (RM4-5, #100516), CD8a BV421 (53-6.7, #100738), CD8a PE (53-6.7, #100708), CD11c Alexa Flour 700 (N418, #117319), CD25 Alexa Fluor 700 (PC61, #102024), CD25 BV605 (PC61, #102036), CD25 BV650 (PC61, #102038), CD25 PE-Cy7 (PC61, #102016), CD44 BV 650 (IM7, #103049), CD45.1 Alexa Fluor 700 (A20, # 110723), CD45.1 BV650 (A20, #110735), CD45.1 FITC (A20, #110706), CD45.1 PerCP-Cy5.5 (A20, #110728), CD45.2 Alexa Fluor 700 (104, #109822), CD45.2 APC (104, #109814), CD49d APC (R1-2, #103622), CD49d PE-Cy7 (R1-2, #103618), CD62L FITC (MEL-14, #104406), CD80 PerCP-Cy5.5 (16-10A1, #104722), CD86 Alexa Fluor 700 (GL-1, #105024), CD103 PerCP-Cy5.5 (2 E7, #121416), CD127 PE-Cy7 (A7R34, #135013), TCRβ APC (H57-597, #109212), TCRβ PE (H57-597, #109208), and KLRG1 BV510 (2F1/KLRG1, #138421).

No randomization was performed when the experimental groups were based on the genotype of the mice; otherwise mice were assigned to experimental groups randomly (defined by their ID numbers) prior to the contact between the experimenter and the mice. The experiments were not blinded since no subjective scoring method was used. The estimation of the sample size was based on our previous experience. We typically aimed at having 12 animals per group in three independent experiments. The final number of mice per group depended on the number of available mice with required genotype, number of isolated T-cells for adoptive transfers, and unpredictable events (e.g., mouse death). In cancer experiments, we aimed at 16 mice per group in two independent experiments.</p><p>ARRIVE Essential10 guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arriveguidelines.org/">https://arriveguidelines.org/</ext-link>) were followed.

The reason was that we did not stress the animals too much and that we know from 23 experiments and 427 mice that there is near perfect correlation between the urine and blood glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The blood glucose as well as urine glucose levels are largely digital. In most cases the urine glucose is 0 or &gt;1000 mg/dl.

Thus, the growth curve would be heavily influenced by the removal of mice with the largest tumors. There were also some technical issues. Although we measured the tumor sizes during the course of the experiment, we did not get matched data, so we could not analyze the growth of individual tumors. Moreover, we measured the tumor sizes on slightly different days in each of the two independent experiments. We admit that the experimental design was not perfect, but we decided not to repeat these experiments for ethical reasons.</p><p>We did our best to address this comment by showing two datasets – first, we are showing the tumor size (Fig. S7D) on day 13 or 14, when there were the majority of mice are still in the experiment (this is from the previous experiment shown in Fig. 7E). This shows clear differences between the tumor sizes among the experimental groups, which correlates with the survival. Second, we are showing the tumor growth up to day 11 (Fig. S7E) from the new experiments, when the mice were sacrificed for the analysis of splenic and tumor-infiltrating cells (Fig. 7F-H). These data show similar tumor sizes in the experimental groups before and during the treatment. It also shows differences in the tumor size between untreated control and the DOX or DOX/IL-2 treated mice after the treatment (Fig. S7D). The difference between DOX and DOX/IL-2 starts to appear only on day 11, although it is still small and not significant at this time point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
