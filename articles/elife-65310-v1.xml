DNA methylation levels and gene expression, might help the biological interpretation of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We aimed to identify autosomal cis eQTMs in children’s blood, using data from 832 children of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with the Illumina 450K and the Affymetrix HTA v2 arrays, respectively. The relationship between methylation levels and expression of nearby genes (1 Mb window centered at the transcription start site, TSS) was assessed by fitting 13.6 M linear regressions adjusting for sex, age, cohort, and blood cell composition.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 39,749 blood autosomal cis eQTMs, representing 21,966 unique CpGs (eCpGs, 5.7% of total CpGs) and 8,886 unique transcript clusters (eGenes, 15.3% of total transcript clusters, equivalent to genes). In 87.9% of these cis eQTMs, the eCpG was located at &lt;250 kb from eGene’s TSS; and 58.8% of all eQTMs showed an inverse relationship between the methylation and expression levels. Only around half of the autosomal cis-eQTMs eGenes could be captured through annotation of the eCpG to the closest gene. eCpGs had less measurement error and were enriched for active blood regulatory regions and for CpGs reported to be associated with environmental exposures or phenotypic traits. In 40.4% of the eQTMs, the CpG and the eGene were both associated with at least one genetic variant. The overlap of autosomal cis eQTMs in children’s blood with those described in adults was small (13.8%), and age-shared cis eQTMs tended to be proximal to the TSS and enriched for genetic variants.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This catalogue of autosomal cis eQTMs in children’s blood can help the biological interpretation of EWAS findings and is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://helixomics.isglobal.org/">https://helixomics.isglobal.org/</ext-link> and at Dryad (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0">10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>The study has received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-206) under grant agreement no 308333 (HELIX project); the H2020-EU.3.1.2. - Preventing Disease Programme under grant agreement no 874583 (ATHLETE project); from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 733206 (LIFECYCLE project), and from the European Joint Programming Initiative “A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life” (JPI HDHL and Instituto de Salud Carlos III) under the grant agreement no AC18/00006 (NutriPROGRAM project).

One well-known example of such ‘epigenetic tags’ is DNA methylation, whereby a methyl group is added onto particular positions in the genome. Many factors – including environmental effects such as diet – control DNA methylation, allowing an organism to adapt to ever-changing conditions.</p><p>An expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) is a specific position of the genome whose DNA methylation status regulates the activity of a given gene. A catalogue of eQTMs would be useful in helping to reveal how the environment and disease impacts the way cells work. Yet, currently, the relationships between most epigenetic tags and gene activity remains unclear, especially in children.</p><p>To fill this gap, Ruiz-Arenas et al. studied DNA methylation in blood samples from over 800 healthy children across Europe. Amongst all tested DNA methylation sites, 22,000 (5.7% of total) were associated with the expression of a gene – and therefore were eQTMs; reciprocally, 9,000 genes (15.3% of all tested genes) were linked to at least one methylation site, leading to a total of 40,000 pairs of DNA methylation sites and genes. Most often, eQTMs regulated the expression of nearby genes – but only half controlled the gene that was the closest to them. Age and the genetic background of the individuals influenced the nature of eQTMs.</p><p>This catalogue is a useful resource for the scientific community to start understanding the relationship between epigenetics and gene activity. Similar studies are now needed for other tissues and age ranges. Overall, extending our knowledge of eQTMs may help reveal how life events lead to illness, and could inform prevention efforts.</p></abstract><kwd-group

individual, although sharing the same genome sequence, differentiate into diverse lineages that finally give place to specific cell types with unique functions. This is orchestrated by the epigenome, which regulates gene expression in a cell/tissue- and time-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavalli and Heard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lappalainen and Greally, 2017</xref>). Besides its central role in regulating embryonic and fetal development, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and silencing of repetitive DNA elements, the epigenome is also responsible for the plasticity and cellular memory in response to environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavalli and Heard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lappalainen and Greally, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Massive epigenetic alterations, caused by somatic mutations, age, injury, or environmental exposures, were initially described in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinberg, 2018</xref>). The paradigm of environmental factors modifying the epigenome and leading to increased disease risk was then extrapolated from cancer to a wide range of common diseases. Consequently, in recent years, a high number of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have been performed, investigating the relation of prenatal and postnatal exposure to environmental factors with DNA methylation, and of DNA methylation with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lappalainen and Greally, 2017</xref>). EWAS findings have been inventoried in two catalogues: the EWAS catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battram et al., 2021</xref>) and the EWAS Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The latter includes 0.5 M associations for 498 traits from 1216 studies, including 155 different cells/tissues.</p><p>Despite the success of EWAS in identifying altered methylation patterns, various challenging issues still must be solved: the role of genetic variation; the access to the target tissue/cell; confounding reverse causation; and biological interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lappalainen and Greally, 2017</xref>). Regarding the latter, most studies do not have transcriptional data to test the effect of DNA methylation on gene expression. When these data are not available, a common approach is to assume that CpG DNA methylation affects the expression of the closest gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharp et al., 2017</xref>). Although this approach is easy to implement, it is limited. Indeed, CpG DNA methylation might regulate distant genes or might not regulate any gene at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lappalainen and Greally, 2017</xref>). Another approach to elucidate the effect of DNA methylation on gene expression when transcriptional data are not available is to rely on previous expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) studies. These are genome-wide studies investigating the associations between the levels of DNA methylation and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gondalia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Küpers et al., 2019</xref>). Several eQTM studies have been performed in diverse cell types/tissues: whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>), monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Husquin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), lymphoblastoid cell lines, T-cells and fibroblasts derived from umbilical cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2013</xref>), fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonder et al., 2014</xref>), skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>), nasal airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), and placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delahaye et al., 2018</xref>). As most of the EWAS are conducted in whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Felix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>), there is a need for comprehensive eQTM studies in this tissue. To date, available eQTM studies in whole blood only cover samples from adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>) and their validity in children has not been assessed.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation and gene expression data from the Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project to generate an autosomal cis eQTM catalogue in children’s blood (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://helixomics.isglobal.org/">https://helixomics.isglobal.org/</ext-link>). We analyzed the proportion of cis eQTMs captured through annotation to the closest gene, characterized them at the functional level, assessed the influence of genetic variation and compared them with eQTMs identified in adults.

Next, (3) we evaluated the proportion of eGenes potentially inferred through annotation of eCpGs to the closest gene.

Some other SNPs were filtered out during the matching between data and reference panel before imputation (N = 14,436).</p><p>Imputation of the GWAS data was performed with the Imputation Michigan server (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_017579">SCR_017579</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2016</xref>) using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) cosmopolitan panel, Version r1.1 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCarthy et al., 2016</xref>). Before imputation, PLINK GWAS data was converted into VCF format and variants were aligned with the reference genome. The phasing of the haplotypes was done with Eagle v2.4 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_017262">SCR_017262</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loh et al., 2016</xref>) and the imputation with minimac4 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_009292">SCR_009292</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchsberger et al., 2015</xref>), both implemented in the code of the Imputation Michigan server. In total, we retrieved 40,405,505 variants after imputation. Then, we applied the following QC criteria to the imputed dataset: imputation accuracy (R2) &gt;0.9, MAF &gt;1%, HWE p-value &gt; 1e-06; and genotype probabilities were converted to genotypes using the best guest approach. The final post-imputation quality-controlled dataset consisted of 1,304 samples and 6,143,757 variants (PLINK format, Genome build: GRCh37/hg19,+ strand).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Identification of autosomal cis eQTMs in children’s blood</title><p>To test associations between DNA methylation levels and gene expression levels in cis (cis eQTMs), we paired each Gene to CpGs closer than 500 kb from its TSS, either upstream or downstream. For each Gene, the TSS was defined based on HTA-2.0 annotation, using the start position for transcripts in the + strand, and the end position for transcripts in the - strand. CpGs position was obtained from Illumina 450 K array annotation. Only CpGs in autosomal chromosomes (from chromosome 1–22) were tested. In the main analysis, we fitted for each CpG-Gene pair a linear regression model between gene expression and methylation levels adjusted for age, sex, cohort, and blood cell type composition. A second model was run without adjusting for blood cellular composition and it is only reported on the online web catalog, but not discussed in this manuscript. Although some of the unique associations of the unadjusted model might be real, others might be confounded by the large methylation and expression changes among blood cell types.</p><p>To ensure that CpGs paired to a higher number of enes do not have higher chances of being part of an eQTM, multiple-testing was controlled at the CpG level, following a procedure previously applied in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamazon et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, our statistic used to test the hypothesis that a pair CpG-Gene is significantly associated is based on considering the lowest p-value observed for a given CpG and all its paired Gene (e.g. those in the 1 Mb window centered at the TSS). As we do not know the distribution of this statistic under the null hypothesis, we used a permutation test. We generated 100 permuted gene expression datasets and ran our previous linear regression models obtaining 100 permuted p-values for each CpG-Gene pair. Then, for each CpG, we selected among all CpG-Gene pairs the minimum p-value in each permutation and fitted a beta distribution that is the distribution we obtain when dealing with extreme values (e.g. minimum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudbridge and Gusnanto, 2008</xref>). Next, for each CpG, we took the minimum p-value observed in the real data and used the beta distribution to compute the probability of observing a lower p-value. We defined this probability as the empirical p-value of the CpG. Then, we considered as significant those CpGs with empirical p-values to be significant at 5% false discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini-Hochberg method. Finally, we applied a last step to identify all significant CpG-Gene pairs for all eCpGs. To do so, we defined a genome-wide empirical p-value threshold as the empirical p-value of the eCpG closest to the 5% FDR threshold. We used this empirical p-value to calculate a nominal p-value threshold for each eCpG, based on the beta distribution obtained from the minimum permuted p-values. This nominal p-value threshold was defined as the value for which the inverse cumulative distribution of the beta distribution was equal to the empirical p-value. Then, for each eCpG, we considered as significant all eCpG-Gene variants with a p-value smaller than nominal p-value.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Characterization of the child blood autosomal cis eQTM catalogue</title><p>Wilcoxon tests were run to compare continuous variables (e.g. methylation range, CpG probe reliability, etc.) vs. categorical variables (e.g. low, medium, and high categories of methylation levels, eCpGs vs non eCpGs, etc.).

Given that CpGs and enes could be annotated to several genes, we considered that a CpG-Gene pair was annotated to the same gene if at least one of the genes annotated to the CpG was present among the genes in the HTA-2.0 array. In total, we identified 327,931 CpG-Gene pairs annotated to the same gene, and thus that could be compared. Then, a Chi-square test was applied to compute whether eQTMs were enriched for these 327,931 comparable CpG-Gene pairs, using as background all 13 M CpG-Gene pairs.</p><p>Next, we evaluated whether the relative position of the CpG in the genic region was related to the expression of the paired Gene. To do so, the comparable 327,931 CpG-Gene pairs were expanded to 383,672 entries. Each entry represented a CpG-Gene pair annotated to a unique gene relative position. Thus, for instance, a CpG-Gene pair with the CpG annotated to two relative gene positions of the same gene was included as two entries, each time annotated to a different gene relative position. In this expanded CpG-Gene pair set, Chi-square tests were run to test the enrichment of eQTMs for gene relative positions, using the 383,672 entries as background.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Evaluation of the genetic contribution on child blood autosomal cis eQTMs</title><p>We used two approaches to evaluate the influence of genetic effects in child blood autosomal cis eQTMs. First, we analyzed heritability estimates of CpGs computed by Van Dongen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Dongen et al., 2016</xref>).

DNA methylation was assessed with the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (Illumina) in the three cohorts. In HELIX, gene expression was assessed with the Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 ST arrays (HTA 2.0) (Affymetrix), and in GTP and MESA with the HumanHT-12 v3.0 and v4.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina).</p><p>For the comparison of eQTMs between adults and children, eGenes in the two studies were annotated to a common gene nomenclature, by using the Gene Symbol annotation provided by the authors form GTP and MESA, and the Gene Symbol provided by the Affymetrix annotation in HELIX. Some eQTMs involved transcript clusters (HELIX) or gene probes (GTP and MESA) annotated to more than one gene (Gene Symbol); and also different enes (HELIX) or gene probes (GTP and MESA) were annotated to the same Gene Symbol. To handle this issue, we split our comparison in two analyses.</p><p>First, we checked whether CpG-gene pairs reported in GTP and MESA were eQTMs (significant CpG-gene pairs) in HELIX. By doing this, the comparison was restricted to cis effects (as HELIX only considered cis effects). When a CpG-gene pair in GTP or MESA mapped to multiple CpG-gene pairs in HELIX, we only considered the CpG-gene pair with the smallest p-value in HELIX. Next, Pearson’s correlations between the effect sizes of the different studies were computed.</p><p>Second, we explored whether HELIX eQTMs were also present in GTP and/or MESA. When a CpG-gene pair in HELIX mapped to multiple CpG-gene pairs in GTP and/or MESA, we only considered the CpG-gene pair with the smallest p-value in these cohorts. As a result, HELIX eQTMs were classified in age-shared (if present in adults at p-value &lt; 1e-05, in GTP and/or MESA) and children-specific (absent in adult cohorts). For these two subsets of eQTMs, enrichment for ROADMAP chromatin states, methylation measurement error, and distance from the eCpG to the eGene’s TSS, was tested as explained above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>The raw data used to generate the eQTM catalogue are not publicly available due to privacy restrictions but are available from the corresponding author on request.

Thus, we will refer TCs to enes indistinctively. According to Affymetrix annotation, 23,054 of the enes encoded a protein. To detect cis effects, we paired each ene to all CpGs closer than 0.5 Mb from its transcription start site (TSS), either upstream or downstream (1 Mb window centered at the TSS).

These eQTMs comprised 21,966 unique CpGs (5.7% of total CpGs) and 8,886 unique enes (15.3% of total enes), of which 6288 were annotated as coding genes. For simplicity, we will refer to them as eQTMs (statistically significant associations of CpG-Gene pairs), eCpGs (CpGs involved in eQTMs), and eGenes (enes involved in eQTMs). 23,355 eQTMs (58.8% of total) showed inverse associations, meaning that higher DNA methylation was associated with lower gene expression. In eQTMs, each eGene was associated with a median of 2 eCpGs, while each eCpG was associated with a median of 1 eGene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). eCpGs presented higher methylation variability in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and had higher intraclass correlation coefficients, a proxy of low technical error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

In both databases, positive and inverse eCpGs showed stronger ORs for CpGs with increased and decreased methylation levels over age, respectively. After excluding CpG probes with unreliable measurements (ICC &lt; 0.4), MeDALL enrichments were reduced to the magnitude of Epidelta enrichments, while the differences between positive and inverse eCpGs were more evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Influence of age on autosomal cis eQTMs in children’s blood.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enrichment of eCpGs for CpGs whose methylation levels change with age, in comparison to non eCpGs. eCpGs were classified in all (grey); inverse (yellow); and positive (green).

For this, we used data from the study of autosomal cis and trans eQTMs in adults’ blood based on two cohorts: (1) GTP, whole blood and 333 samples; and (2) MESA, monocytes and 1,202 samples, by Kennedy and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>). The catalogue contains the summary statistics of all autosomal cis ( &lt; 50 kb from the TSS) and trans (otherwise) CpG-gene pairs at p-value &lt; 1e-5, although only CpG-gene associations at p-value &lt; 1e-11 were considered significant eQTMs in their study.

More than 90% of age-shared eQTMs have the same direction in GTP/MESA than in HELIX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>).

We explored whether eQTMs identified both in HELIX children and in adults (age-shared eQTMs) had different characteristics compared to eQTMs only found in children (child-specific eQTMs). Age-shared eQTMs involved 4364 eCpGs and 1689 eGenes, whereas children-specific eQTMs involved 19,584 eCpGs and 8429 eGenes. Age-shared eCpGs had higher reliability (higher ICC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and tended to be closer to the TSS than child-specific eCpGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The enrichment for ROADMAP blood chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>) of age-shared and child-specific eCpGs in comparison to non eCpGs was quite similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Nonetheless, age-shared eCpGs showed higher ORs of enrichment for proximal promoters.

We identified 39,749 eQTMs, representing 21,966 unique eCpGs and 8886 unique eGenes (6288 of which were coding). 23,355 eQTMs (58.8% of all eQTMs) showed inverse associations. A substantial fraction was influenced by genetic variation, and the overlap with eQTMs reported in adults was small.</p><p>The characteristics of the autosomal cis eQTMs in children’s blood were highly consistent with patterns previously described in other studies. Most of the eCpGs tended to be proximal to the eGene’s TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). The magnitude of the effect seemed to be proportional to the distance between the eCpG and the eGene’s TSS, but this association was weak. Although higher DNA methylation is assumed to lead to lower expression, we found that around 40% of eQTMs were positively associated with gene expression. This percentage is in line with previous results from different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Küpers et al., 2019</xref>). Inverse and positive eCpGs tended to be localized in enhancers and other active regulatory regions and not in CpG islands, a pattern that was also previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Küpers et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these common locations, inverse eCpGs were specifically found around active TSSs (including the distal promoter and the 5’UTR), while positive eCpGs were localized in gene body regions. These results highlight the importance of the genomic context to infer the direction of the association between DNA methylation and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>). We want to point out that the causal relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression cannot be definitely inferred from our study. Indeed, there is some evidence suggesting that DNA methylation could be a consequence of gene expression, as opposed to the often assumed concept that regulation of gene expression is mediated by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). eQTMs can be influenced by genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). In HELIX, eCpGs linked to the expression of several eGenes had higher heritabilities and were associated with a higher number of meQTLs than non eCpGs. This could suggest that eCpGs that regulate the expression of several genes, the so-called master regulators, are more prone to be themselves regulated by genetic variation. We, then, searched for SNPs simultaneously associated with DNA methylation (meQTLs) and gene expression (eQTLs) in our data. We identified 1.3 M SNP-CpG-Gene trios with consistent direction of the effect. Interestingly, the number of GO-BP terms related to immune and cellular functions was reduced for eGenes under genetic control, in comparison to all eGenes; on the contrary, the number of GO-BP terms involving metabolic processes was maintained. This may suggest that the influence of environmental factors is more relevant for immune pathways, while genetic factors might be more determinant in regulating metabolic processes in blood cells. Given the non-negligible effect of genetics in eQTMs, we would advise studying the effect of genetic variants on the association between environmental factors or phenotypic traits and DNA methylation.</p><p>In order to know how eQTMs behave along life-course, we compared blood autosomal cis eQTMs identified in HELIX children with cis and trans eQTMs reported by Kennedy and colleagues in whole blood and monocytes from adult populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>). We found that only 13.8% of the autosomal eQTMs in children’s blood were also reported in adults. Similarly, a modest proportion of adult blood eQTMs was present in children (58% from GTP and 35% from MESA). This small overlap between adult and child eQTMs has different explanations: methodological issues, such as gene expression platforms with low overlap; statistical methods and statistical power; cohort-specific environmental exposures; and cellular composition. Unsurprisingly, HELIX and MESA presented the highest divergence, as HELIX assessed eQTMs in whole blood and MESA in monocytes. Despite the effect of these methodological and confounding factors, it is known that DNA methylation and gene expression change with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melé et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mulder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2017</xref>); consequently, we could expect only partial overlap between adult and child eQTMs. The short list of age-shared eCpGs tended to encompass CpGs located in promoters and regulated by genetic variants. Moreover, the overall location of eQTMs in regulatory elements was similar between adults and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Küpers et al., 2019</xref>). This could represent a specific characteristic of eQTMs that are persistent over time. An alternative explanation is that this kind of eQTMs (genetically regulated and close to the TSS) are easier to be detected and shared among any two studies because they show stronger effects. Finally, we observed that HELIX eQTMs usually involved CpGs whose methylation varied between birth and childhood/adolescence, and they tended to activate rather than inactivate transcription over this period. Also, they were enriched for CpGs found to be related to environmental factors and phenotypic traits in the EWAS Atlas and EWAS Catalog.</p><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugden et al., 2020</xref>), CpG probes have different measurement error and thus different reliability and reproducibility. Consequently, CpGs measured with less error have more chances of being found associated with traits and thus reported in EWAS catalogues. In HELIX, we found that CpG probe ICC was higher for these different cases: for eCpGs, in comparison to non eCpGs; for age-shared eCpGs, in comparison to children-specific eCpGs; and for eCpGs with meQTLs, in comparison to eCpGs without meQTLs. In this line, enrichments of eCpGs for CpGs listed in the EWAS Atlas or in the MeDALL project were markedly attenuated when only considering CpGs measured with good reliability. Moreover, CpG probe reliability is dependent on DNA methylation level and variance (highly unmethylated or highly methylated CpGs, which tend to have low variances, are measured with more error); and genomic regulatory elements are characterized by particular methylation levels. Therefore, this biased the enrichments for regulatory elements. For instance, after considering only reliable probes, the distribution of eQTMs in CpG island relative positions changed completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the enrichments for active chromatin states were amplified and differences between inverse and positive eCpGs attenuated.</p><p>Our study of autosomal cis eQTMs in children’s blood has several strengths compared to previous eQTM studies. First, we report all CpG-gene pairs we tested in our analysis, as opposed to existing blood eQTM catalogues which only reported pairs passing a given p-value threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>). Reporting all pairs tested allows replication and meta-analyses, reducing publication bias. Second, we report which eQTMs are influenced by genetic variation, and researchers can take this into account when exploring the relationship between methylation and expression in their data. Finally, as others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), we describe that only around half of the CpG-Gene relationships are captured through annotation to the closest gene. Therefore, our eQTM catalogue becomes an essential and powerful tool to help researchers interpret their EWAS, with a particular focus on childhood.</p><p>The catalogue also has some limitations. First, it only covers a fraction of all CpG-Gene pairs, as both the methylation and gene expression arrays have limited resolution. Nonetheless, the catalogue will be useful for most researchers as the methylation array is widely used, and the gene expression array covers almost all the coding genes. Second, the catalogue does not include sex chromosomes which require more complex analyses to address X-inactivation and sex-specific effects that will be addressed in future studies. Third, due to statistical power limitations, only cis effects were tested. Despite that, we observed that eCpGs tended to be close to the gene they regulate, so the catalogue is expected to cover most of the CpG-Gene associations. Fourth, effect sizes should be considered with caution as the association between DNA methylation and gene expression might be non-linear, and the effect of outlier values was not systematically explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). Fifth, models were adjusted for blood cell type composition and, while this has allowed us to control for major differences in methylation and gene expression among blood cell types, it might also have resulted in over-adjustment in some CpG-Gene pairs. Moreover, the analysis of bulk data might have limited the identification of eQTMs specific to a subset of blood cell types, the identification of which would need more sophisticated statistical and/or experimental methods. Finally, we acknowledge that the catalogue will be useful for biological interpretation of EWAS if it is true that DNA methylation is not a mere mark of cell memory to past exposures (without transcriptional consequences or with time-limited ones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, besides characterizing child blood autosomal cis eQTMs and reporting how they are affected by genetics and age, we provide a unique public resource: a catalogue with 13.6 M CpG-gene pairs and of 1.3 M SNP-CpG-gene trios (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://helixomics.isglobal.org/">https://helixomics.isglobal.org/</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Matthew Suderman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Gene-CpG associations should only be reported for the model adjusting for cellular composition. By failing to account for cellular composition, the associations identified by this model are difficult to interpret as they may be driven by the extensive gene expression and DNA methylation differences between cell types, true biological dependencies between CpG sites and genes within one or more cell types, or a combination of both.</p><p>The authors incorrectly claim that associations identified in the unadjusted model but not in the adjusted model are cell-type-specific associations (e.g. line 417). While possible, it is more likely that the associations are entirely due to differences between cell types (which tend to be large) with little or no association within any specific cell type (which tend to be much smaller). The supporting F-statistic analysis actually provides support for the former possibility, not the latter as claimed in the text. This argument should be removed or revised.</p><p>2. Methods used for calculating empirical p-values/significance thresholds need to be clarified and possibly corrected. The authors claim to have applied the approach used by Bonder et al. and first described by Westra et al. (Nat Genet 2013), but the brief description of the approach in the paper is not consistent with Westra et al.</p><p>3. Several of the reported enrichments could be driven by variation in probe quality across the DNA methylation arrays. For example, enrichment for eQTM CpG sites among those that change with age could simply be due to the fact that age and eQTM effects are more likely to be observed for CpG sites with high quality probes than low quality probes. This possibility should at least be acknowledged for specific enrichment results likely to be affected.</p><p>4. The manuscript in several places does not summarize results well. Long lists of items already provided in tables and figures should be replaced with more readable summaries. Details of less important findings should be moved to the supplementary and replaced with summarizing text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Major weakness 1 – With regard to the models used to find eQTMs:</p><p>This issue is easily resolved, as the authors already have the results from the fully adjusted model in hand. The authors state that the results of the fully adjusted model are a subset of the unadjusted model, with limited exceptions (line 424). With their cell-type adjusted results being robust, it would be prudent and more widely accepted (and my recommendation) to use the cell-type proportion adjusted model as their main model, that is used in all of the follow-up analyses.</p><p>Major weakness 2 – With regard to the authors hypothesis of eQTM associations unique to models unadjusted for cell-type proportion variability across samples:</p><p>1) I recommend that the issue of cell-specific vs general CpG-gene associations in unadjusted models should be removed from this manuscript and peer reviewed on its own in a separate manuscript. A new method (or a novel application of a previous method) should not be embedded in an applied paper with little statistical support. If the authors hypothesis is correct and the associations found in an unadjusted model represent cell-type-specific associations – that result would have wide-ranging implications and deserves more focus than it gets in this manuscript.</p><p>2) If it is the authors wish to keep this section in this manuscript (which I still do not recommend), it could work as a follow-up analysis with the use of a previously peer reviewed method that is meant specifically to find cell-specific associations. A method that comes to mind is TOAST 1.</p><p>1. Li Z, Wu H. TOAST: improving reference-free cell composition estimation by cross-cell type differential analysis. Genome Biol. 2019 Sep 4;20(1):190. PMCID: PMC6727351</p><p>Major weakness 3 – p-value adjustment:</p><p>If the authors generated an empirical FDR as Bonder and Westra did, I request that they adjust their written methods to make it clear that their methods were the same as those cited. However, if their method is a significant deviation from the methods used by Bonder and Westra, I think the authors should either use an established method for FDR, or at the very least compare their results to a traditional method, as suggested by another reviewer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Report only results from the cell-type adjusted models.</p><p>2. Enrichments prone to probe quality bias should be omitted or flagged in the text.</p><p>3. Much of the paper is unnecessarily difficult to read. Many sections contain high levels of detail which could easily be summarized and the details looked up in provided tables or figures (e.g. &quot;CpGs in eQTMs are enriched for blood active chromatin states and medium methylation levels&quot; and &quot;Annotating CpGs to the closest gene only partially captures eQTMs&quot;).</p><p>4. The Discussion section contains a lot of awkward phrases making it difficult to read.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of autosomal cis expression quantitative trait methylation (cis eQTMs) in children's blood&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please respond to the comments from reviewer 2 below. However, we do <italic>not</italic> require any new analyses (e.g. mediation) or replications to be performed. You also do <italic>not</italic> need to move any text or results to supplementary materials.</p><p>2) There was some initial confusion about accessing the data on the website. Perhaps data access information on the website could be made clearer.</p><p>3) Reviewer 2 found the &quot;Enrichment for age-variable eQTMs&quot; section difficult to understand. In particular, it could be made clearer that the age-associated CpG sites were identified in previously published studies (MeDALL and Epidelta) and were not the results of your own analyses.</p><p>4) The references to &quot;variable methylation&quot; in this section is misleading because it suggests variation that has not been accounted for. However, the variation here is explained by associations with age.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, &quot;Identification of autosomal cis expression quantitative trait methylation (cis eQTMs) in children's blood&quot;, the authors describe the landscape of DNA methylation, in relation to proximal gene expression. In addition to providing a useful resource for researchers conducting EWAS in children's whole blood, the authors do a really great job building on the work that others have done before. I believe the authors have sufficiently responded to reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors replied to reviewers' comments well.</p><p>Website is still PW protected.</p><p>Suggest defining autosomal in abstract and introduction.</p><p>General comments: Try to include all results you made to respond the reviewers' comments in either the main manuscript or supplementary material. Readers may have the same question as the reviewers. For example, include a figure where x-axis is the distance between the CpG site and TC TSS and y-axis is p-value in Supplementary material.</p><p>Comments on the manuscript:</p><p>Great improvement on writing. Now the manuscript is readable, and now I can see thoroughness of your analysis.</p><p>In general, you still have too many results with too many details. Consider moving some of the findings to supplementary. I suggested several results to move to supplementary materials. Move figure and tables that are included in the text to supplementary materials as well.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. Including results with ICC&lt;0.4 in addition to the main results (without the screening) throughout the manuscript are disturbing. You can choose either all eQTM results or eQTM with ICC&lt;0.4 result throughout the manuscript and move the other result to supplementary material.</p><p>2. Line 645-646: &quot;we identified 1,368,613 SNP-CpG-Gene trios with consistent direction of effect, and 12,799 with inconsistent direction – Did you do mediation analysis? If you did not, conduct mediation analysis (such as Baron and Kenny or Sobel) and rewrite this paragraph based on the mediation analysis result. Also make it clear what are consistent direction and inconsistent directions are if you decide this sentence in the manuscript.</p><p>3. The section &quot;Enrichment for age-variable eQTMs&quot; is very confusing.</p><p>a. Did you conduct EWAS of age in the cohort?</p><p>b. Term &quot;variable methylation is confusing&quot;. If you did EWAS, then call EWAS methylation.</p><p>c. How many methylation CpGs did you test in each cohort?</p><p>d. The results from Epidelta data is not very interesting. Move this result to supplementary section.</p><p>4. You did replication of eQTMs in adults' cohorts only. I wonder if you can find a children's cohort and try to replicate your eQTMs results in that cohort.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65310.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Summarized results of the eQTM catalogue are in the homepage of the website, which is open. However, according to the comment of the reviewer it seems they are not visible. We will amend this by moving them to another place on the website to gain visibility. In addition, the results are publicly available in Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggest defining autosomal in abstract and introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We think autosomal chromosomes does not need a definition.

In this section, we did not run EWAS of age in HELIX, but compared the eCpGs we identified with CpGs whose methylation change from birth to childhood or adolescence, according to previous publications. We have modified the paragraph to clarify this point (page 28, line 656):</p><p>“To understand the association between changes in methylation and gene expression throughout life, first we evaluated whether eCpGs were enriched for CpGs whose methylation levels change from birth to childhood/adolescence according to the literature. To this end, we retrieved the CpGs that vary with age from two databases (RH et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2017)”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the term variable methylation can be confusing in this context. Therefore, we have changed the age-variable CpGs by CpG whose methylation levels change with age in the subheading (now is Enrichment for CpG whose methylation change with age), the paragraph and Figure 5 caption.</p></body></sub-article></article>
