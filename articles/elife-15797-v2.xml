Although the basic cellular machinery generating mechanical tension appears largely conserved, tensions propagate in unique ways within each tissue. Here we use the vertebrate eye as a paradigm to investigate how tensions are generated and transmitted during the folding of a neuroepithelial layer. We record membrane pulsatile behavior and actomyosin dynamics during zebrafish optic cup morphogenesis by live imaging. We show that retinal neuroblasts undergo fast oscillations and that myosin condensation correlates with episodic contractions that progressively reduce basal feet area. Interference with <italic>lamc1</italic> function impairs basal contractility and optic cup folding. Mapping of tensile forces by laser cutting uncover a developmental window in which local ablations trigger the displacement of the entire tissue.

Networks of fibres made from actin and myosin proteins generate these forces, and because the fibres can assemble in many different ways inside cells, they allow the cells to move and change shape in many different ways.</p><p>Forces in some tissues can cause flat sheets of cells to bend. These sheets of cells are attached on one side (their “basal” surface) to a collection of membranes and molecules that are known as the extracellular matrix. When the cells in the sheet progressively shrink at their basal surface, causing the sheet to bend towards the extracellular matrix, this is known as basal constriction.</p><p>Nicolás-Pérez et al. have used high-resolution imaging to record how basal constriction helps the optic cup – the main chamber of the eye – to form in zebrafish embryos. This imaging confirmed that a sheet of precursor cells progressively bends towards its basal surface to form the curved shape of the eyeball. Further analysis revealed that this basal constriction happens when myosin fibres accumulate in clusters along the basal surface of some of the precursor cells. The resulting contraction of the basal surface of the cells relies both on the tension generated by myosin inside the cell and on the cells being attached properly to the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Using a laser beam, Nicolás-Pérez et al. also destroyed small parts of the basal surface of the retina. This procedure allows the mechanical tension distribution throughout the developing eye to be mapped. Laser ablations revealed a narrow time window during development when destroying small parts of the basal surface can cause the entire sheet of cells to relax, preventing it from curving to form the shape of the eye.</p><p>Sheets of precursor cells are important building blocks of the nervous system, yet researchers only have limited knowledge of the processes that enable them to fold or bend into a final shape. As such, the findings of Nicolás-Pérez et al. will contribute to a wider understanding of how cells and tissues behave while the brain is forming.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15797.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15797.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>optic cup</kwd><kwd>epithelial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>actomyosin dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2011-22916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martínez-Morales</surname><given-names>Juan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P11-CVI-7256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martínez-Morales</surname><given-names>Juan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-53765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martínez-Morales</surname><given-names>Juan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-55738-REDT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martínez-Morales</surname><given-names>Juan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution live imaging analysis shows a constriction mechanism that drives zebrafish optic cup morphogenesis and highlights the role of the extracellular matrix in transmitting tensions beyond the cellular level.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The shape of animal organs evolved by natural selection under constrains imposed both by organ physiology in the adult and tissue mechanics during embryogenesis. Throughout development, genetic programs coordinate the behavior of single cells allowing the self-assembly of coherent tissues and tridimensional organs. Regardless of the nature of the process (i.e. either cell migration, epithelial bending or cell intercalation), mechanical tensions need to be transmitted at a supra-cellular scale for organ morphogenesis to occur. Mechanical forces, however, are generated by the contractile cytoskeleton of the constituent cells of a tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mammoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heisenberg and Bellaiche, 2013</xref>). The main force generator during morphogenesis results from the molecular interaction between myosin II motors and the actin filaments at the cellular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>). This actomyosin contractile apparatus sustains cortical tension, pulling cells into shape during development and tissue homeostasis. Contractile forces are then transmitted to neighboring cells and to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through cadherin and integrin receptors, allowing individual cell contributions to be integrated into tensions at the tissue/organ level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papusheva and Heisenberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>). Regardless the morphogenetic context, actomyosin contractile forces are resisted both by cellular adhesions and by the compression of the internal cytoskeleton itself. This results in a balance of forces that stabilizes transiently cell and tissue shapes for each stage of the developmental program that builds up a given organ.</p><p>Live-imaging studies have examined actomyosin architecture and dynamics in different morphogenetic models. The emerging picture reveals a wide variety of cortical actomyosin behaviors and localizations depending on the tissue context. Initial reports, focused in epithelial constriction processes, revealed pulsatile myosin flows preceding the periodic contraction of the cellular cortex. This has been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia either at the apical cortex, during mesoderm invagination or germ-band extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorfinkiel and Blanchard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roh-johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>), or at the basal surface during egg chamber elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2010</xref>). Oscillatory actomyosin flows can be coupled to the stabilization of the cells in a 'constricted' state after each pulse, thus resulting in a progressive (i.e. ratcheted) reduction of the cellular apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, the cell cortex may oscillate, contracting and relaxing, without a net reduction of the area over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Solon et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, actomyosin flows may direct epithelial morphogenesis operating in a continuous non-pulsatile manner, as described during zebrafish epiboly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrndt et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the actomyosin network localizes in circumferential (i.e. junctional) belts in the vertebrate neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>), instead of medio-apically as observed in several <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorfinkiel and Blanchard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2009</xref>) and in gastrulating cells in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim and Davidson, 2011</xref>). In the context of the current study, although actomyosin distribution has been analyzed during optic cup morphogenesis in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauhan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-morales et al., 2009</xref>), its dynamics has not been examined in vivo.</p><p>Vertebrate eye development has been a common subject of interest for classical embryologists as well as modern developmental geneticists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spemann, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuhrmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sinn and Wittbrodt, 2013</xref>). The process entails first the protrusion of the eye progenitors to form the lateral optic vesicles, and subsequently the infolding of this tissue into bi-layered optic cups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmitt and Dowling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hilfer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schook, 1980</xref>). Live imaging followed by cell tracking of retinal progenitors in zebrafish revealed that optic vesicle bulging is driven by the rearrangement and epithelialization of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rembold et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">England et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivanovitch et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to teleosts, in amniotes and cartilaginous fishes optic vesicles develop by epithelial folding from an already hollow neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowery and Sive, 2004</xref>). The morphogenesis of the vertebrate optic cup has also been examined in live imaging studies, both in teleost models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-morales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Picker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in self-organized organs from ES-cultured cells in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>). Although optic cup formation seems less divergent among vertebrates than vesicles’ evagination, some particularities in cell behavior have been observed and different mechanisms proposed. In mouse embryos, contractile filopodia connecting neural retina and lens epithelia have been shown to adjust the final curvature of both epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauhan et al., 2009</xref>). However, optic cup development can be recapitulated in vitro in ES cells aggregates suggesting that the morphogenetic program is to a large extent intrinsic. Using this in vitro model, it has been hypothesized that optic cup invagination is driven by the apical constriction of the neuroepithelial cells located at the rim between the presumptive retina and RPE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2012</xref>). Tracking of individual cells in zebrafish has shown that epithelial flow through this rim contributes to neural retina expansion (i.e. at the expenses of the RPE) and optic cup folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Picker et al., 2009</xref>). Whether cell involution and apical constriction at the rim are species-specific mechanisms or operate coordinately in the same organism is still an open question. Finally, we previously postulated the basal constriction of the neuroblasts as an active mechanism contributing to optic cup morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martinez-Morales and Wittbrodt, 2009</xref>). The polarized trafficking of integrin receptors toward the basal surface of the epithelial cells plays an essential role during retinal morphogenesis in teleosts. We showed that this process is controlled by the molecular antagonism between the trans-membrane protein opo and the clathrin adaptors numb and numb-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogdanovic et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>opo</italic> medaka mutants, basal feet appear wider and disorganized in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-morales et al., 2009</xref>). Although this observation suggests a progressive reduction of the neuroblasts feet, the constriction process has not been formally examined in vivo.</p><p>Through quantitative imaging, here we characterize the pulsed contractile behavior of the retinal neuroblasts during optic cup folding in zebrafish. We explore actomyosin dynamics and show that accumulation of myosin foci in scattered cells is associated with contraction of the cellular feet. We show that interference with myosin II function or laminin-mediated basal attachment impairs cell contractility and affect retina folding. To further characterize this morphogenetic process at tissue level, we locally ablate the neuroepithelium to map mechanical tensions through development. This approach identified a narrow developmental window in which local ablation of the retina at its basal surface triggers the global displacement of the retinal epithelium. Our work shows that the myosin-dependent generation of constrictions forces in individual neuroblast and their transmission at a supra-cellular scale play an essential role during optic cup folding in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Retinal precursors undergo basal constriction and display oscillatory contractions during optic cup folding</title><p>To formally show that basal constriction is taking place as the optic cup forms, we investigated the behavior of retinal precursors by live-imaging analysis. Retinae from the zebrafish line <italic>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax)</italic>, in which precursors’ plasma membrane is uniformly labeled, were imaged through morphogenesis starting at 17 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Tissue recordings evidenced a complete epithelial organization shortly after 17 hpf, with mitotic rounding happening apically throughout the entire folding process. In agreement with previous reports, cell involution was also observed at the rim between the RPE and neural retina, particularly from 20 hpf on and at the posterior (i.e. temporal) border of the cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Picker et al., 2009</xref>). As morphogenesis proceeds, GFP-caax signal become brighter at the basal side in the central retina, suggesting an increased membrane density in this region. Moreover, whereas the length of the apical edge of the retina increased significantly, the basal length remained invariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This observation, in conjunction with the previously reported increase (1.5x) in retinal cells number within this developmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>), suggests a progressive narrowing of the basal feet between 17 and 24 hpf. Cell elongation, a common phenomenon in many constricting epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sawyer et al., 2010</xref>), does not occur during retinal folding, as the width of the tissue remained constant (≈50 µm) through the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15797.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Folding of the retinal epithelium in zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A–H</bold>) Time series of optical sections show the progression of retinal morphogenesis starting at 17 hpf (dorsal view) in a tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax) embryo.

As previously reported for vertebrate neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>), actin accumulated circumferentially (i.e. junctional) rather than medially as observed in constricting <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2010;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). In addition, we observed that actin accumulated at the basal surface and oscillated with a frequency similar to membrane pulses (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). To detect whether there is a relationship between cortical actin accumulation and basal area changes, both parameters were quantified after segmentation and a cross-correlation analysis was performed. This analysis showed a positive association between actin accumulation and basal area expansion, with a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.40 ± 0.16 (median 0.35), as calculated for 26 cells from three different experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). In order to evaluate the significance of our results, we compared our experimental data with simulated random and sinusoidal signals of similar statistical properties. Coefficients of simulated random data were significantly lower than our observations in vivo, indicating that the cells display a significant positive correlation between actin accumulation and basal area changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Hence, cell area expansion and actin accumulation occur simultaneously or with time lags shorter than 5 s (i.e. our sampling rate limitation). Furthermore, when we plotted cross-correlation coefficients as a function of the actin intensity, we observed higher coefficients corresponding to cells with higher actin intensity rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the molecular mechanism responsible for the fast oscillations in the vertebrate retina differs in important aspects from that controlling the pulsatile behavior in constricting epithelia in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

In order to visualize membranes displacement during tension release, local ablations were carried out in <italic>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax)</italic> embryos, either at the apical or at the basal surfaces of the tissue. Laser-induced cuts trigger a limited expansion of the wounded area and a local relaxation of the tissue, as determined by optical flow analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). For most of the stages analyzed, tissue relaxation affected only neuroblasts immediately adjacent to the wounded area. However, laser ablations within a developmental window corresponding to a 125°–140° opening of the optic cup resulted in a global tissue relaxation that affected bending of the entire epithelium (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). At this specific stage, tension release triggered a noticeable folding of the retinal tissue toward its basal surface. To quantitatively investigate membrane displacement after laser ablation in retinal tissues, we carried out an optical flow analysis of the movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>), which allow determining retraction speeds at different stages and locations within the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Statistical analysis of optical flow data confirmed that maximum retraction speeds are significantly higher only for retinas displaying a 125º–140º bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>). This observation indicates that the balance between tensile forces and tissue resistance that maintains organ shape is particularly unstable within a narrow developmental window that coincides with the acute constriction of the basal feet at 19 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast to the global reaction observed upon basal ablation, which triggers the displacement of the peripheral retina, apical ablation only affected the morphology of the central retina but no peripheral retraction was observed (Movie 11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that retinal neuroblasts undergo a progressive constriction of their basal surface. Previous reports have described the involution of outer layer progenitors into the presumptive neural retina domain as a mechanism driving the formation of the eye chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Picker et al., 2009;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwan et al., 2012;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>). Our observations are also consistent with these reports, thus suggesting that basal constriction and cell involution cooperate during eye morphogenesis in zebrafish. Comparative analysis of our data and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>) indicate that, although both mechanisms overlap substantially, they are staggered events. Whereas basal constriction occurs mainly during the primary folding of the retinal epithelium between 18 and 20 hpf, cell involution through the rim is limited during this period and becomes more prominent at later stages between 20 and 24 hpf. It is tempting to speculate that these mechanisms might be coupled. Thus, basal constriction may generate centripetal tensions facilitating cell involution and, conversely, cell involution may relieve tissue resistance supporting a constriction-dependent optic cup folding. However, the precise cellular mechanisms driving cell involution are currently unknown, and hence exploring this possibility will require further investigation.</p><p>Here, we have described that retinal precursors undergo fast pulsations both at their apical and basal surfaces. We then examined both membrane and actomyosin dynamics at the basal surface, where the progressive constriction takes place. Although, in principle, the neuroblasts’ periodic pulsations share some features with the oscillations observed in other constricting epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim and Davidson, 2011;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2009;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roh-johnson et al., 2012;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Solon et al., 2009</xref>), there are fundamental differences. In most epithelial cells, pulsations are more regular in frequency and amplitude than in retinal precursors, and their average oscillation frequency range between 1 and 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorfinkiel and Blanchard, 2011</xref>). This is in contrast to irregular fast oscillations (≈20 s) here described in the zebrafish retina. A second fundamental difference concerns the organization of the actomyosin fibers in the shrinking surface of the tissue. In most of the constricting epithelia so far examined, contractile actomyosin fibers accumulate in a medioapical domain. From this domain, centripetal tension responsible for cell contraction is generated and transmitted to surface junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2009;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roh-johnson et al., 2012;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, F-actin turnover is required for this medioapical localization of the actomyosin meshwork, its efficient attachment to cellular junctions, and the generation of centripetal tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jodoin et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, our data show that both actin and myosin fibers accumulate at the cellular cortex in the zebrafish retina. Cortical distribution of actomyosin fibers has also been described in the folding neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>), thus suggesting that it may be a common feature in elongated neuroepithelial cells regardless the tissue is bending toward its apical o basal surface.</p><p>It has been shown that medial and cortical actomyosin pools have different mechanical properties in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>). In the light of this finding, our observation that the molecular mechanism driving fast oscillations in retinal neuroblasts differs substantially from that previously reported in constricting epithelia is not surprising. Whereas medioapical accumulations of actomyosin precede periodic cellular contractions in most epithelia analyzed, we observed that cortical actin accumulation correlates positively with basal membrane expansion in retinal precursors. Local actin assembly at the leading edge has been described as a positive force driving membrane extension in lamellipodia and axonal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollard and Borisy, 2003;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medeiros et al., 2006</xref>). Our data may suggest a similar mechanism as responsible for the pulsatile behavior of the retinal precursors, but confirming this hypothesis will require further analysis.</p><p>Here, we show that cortical myosin accumulation does not correlate in time with the fast oscillations of the membrane. In spite of this, our data does not allow to rule out a myosin role in the maintenance of the pulsatile state. On the contrary, blebbistatin treatment severely impaired membrane pulses, suggesting that myosin basal activity is necessary to maintain the fast oscillatory behavior. Our data also show that myosin accumulates at the basal cortex in discrete foci, which have an average stability of approximately 4 min and are distributed in scattered cells across the epithelial field. Remarkably, a large proportion of the retinal cells accumulating basal myosin foci are contracting both along the apico-basal and basal plane axes. These episodic contractions at the basal surface can be inhibited either by blocking myosin activity or by interfering with the adhesive properties of the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Taken together, our observations suggest a working model for the ratcheted constriction of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). According to this hypothetical model, retinal precursors would experience non-ratcheted fast membrane oscillations. Pulsatile behavior without a net reduction of cell area has also been reported in several epithelial contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2010;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Solon et al., 2009;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roh-johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Superimposed to these fast oscillations, the episodic accumulation of myosin at the basal surface in scattered cells would mediate their progressive (i.e. ratcheted) constriction. Then, individual contributions would add up over time to cause the constriction of the entire neuroepithelium. At a tissue level, our laser ablation experiments indicate that the global balance between mechanical tensions and tissue resistance becomes transiently unstable within a limited developmental window (19–20 hpf). This critical period, in which local ablations at the basal surface trigger global tissue rearrangement, coincides with the acute bending of the optic cup epithelium and the active constriction of the neuroblasts’ feet. Upon <italic>lamc1</italic> knockdown both basal contractility and global tissue response to laser ablation are attenuated. This suggests that the ECM plays a fundamental role in the transmission of mechanical tensions generated by individual cells at the tissue level. In agreement with this concept, previous reports have shown that optic cup morphogenesis largely depends on integrin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-morales et al., 2009;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogdanovic et al., 2012;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15797.034</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A working model for the basal constriction of the retinal epithelium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of the retinal epithelium during eye morphogenesis showing the distribution of cortical actomyosin, integrins and ECM at the basal surface of the tissue.

Optical sections containing either apical or basal surfaces were identified by z-stacks in resonant mode throughout the entire retinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine the orientation of the neuroepithelium along the apico-basal axis and the position of apical and basal surfaces, a z-stack (with 1µm spatial resolution) was taken across the entire retina at the beginning and at the end of each time series. We used this information to establish confocal planes for live imaging 1–3 µm below the surfaces. Then small z-stacks (3 planes over a total of 1 µm) were recorded every 5 or 8 s at the selected planes, 1 µm below the apical or basal surfaces. Long-term recordings along the apico-basal axis were performed using the galvano scanner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image processing and segmentation</title><p>Time-lapse images were processed using Fiji (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Analysis of cellular behavior and cytoskeletal dynamics reveal a ratchet-like mechanism driving optic cup morphogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom Suzanne Eaton (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors have made many interesting and novel observations and the data generally support a model in which laminin- and myosin-dependent basal constriction contributes to morphogenesis of the optic cup. However the reviewers agreed that many aspects of the quantitative analysis need to be explained in more detail before the paper would be suitable for publication. These are outlined below. One concern was that it was not clear from how many different embryos the data was derived. Of course it is important that these results are consistent over multiple embryos, and if only one has been examined for each type of experiment, then additional data needs to be provided from several others. Otherwise, no additional experiments are needed. All reviewers were unsatisfied with the use of the term &quot;rachet-like&quot; mechanism and thought the data didn't necessarily support such a specific description – this term should be removed from the title, although it would be reasonable to raise the possibility in the discussion.</p><p>Improvement to explanation and presentation of data:</p><p>1) The authors perform laser ablation experiments to look at tension at the basal side over time, both in wild type and in lamc morphants. They suggest that basal tension is dependent on lamc and is highest at the time that cells are contracting the most – at this time, ablation can affect the global shape of the cup. But <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which presents this data, is very hard to understand. In particular, the direction that the cells move after laser ablation is impossible to see. The image has been color coded in a way that is said to represent &quot;motion vectors&quot;, but it isn't clear whether the color represents the magnitude or the direction of the vectors. Showing a velocity flow field for the tissue would be a better way of presenting the global effects of laser ablation, and it is essential to show a higher magnification view of the cut site itself so that it is clear that tissue retracts after cutting.</p><p>2) Most of the authors' experiments rely on rapid imaging of small sets of z-slices near the apical and basal surfaces of the neuroepithelium. It is difficult to tell from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> how the authors can tell if they are imaging exactly at the basal surface. A slight tilt in the axis of the eye or embryo would skew the precise measurements being taken: the area would not represent the basal surface, but instead, an oblique section nearby. Can the authors clarify their methods to state how z-slices were selected and validated?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, apical and basal length measurements: Can the authors add a short description to the methods section as to how this was carried out? How was the single optical section within the z-stack selected for the measurement?</p><p>4) Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: &quot;Cell elongation[…]does not occur during retinal folding&quot;. I find this comment a bit confusing. These measurements were performed between 19 hpf and 22 hpf. But as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>, some amount of retinal folding seems to occur between 17 and 19 hpf. Can the authors clarify how they defined the period of retinal folding?</p><p>5) In the same section: &quot;basal areas shrank significantly (40%) and irreversibly[…]&quot; Can the authors clarify the evidence (particularly at this point in the manuscript) for irreversibility of the phenomenon?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>: The authors note that for each timepoint, 24 cells were monitored. Were these the same 24 cells at each timepoint? How many embryos were used for these measurements?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3: I</xref> understand why the authors might have chosen to move to length measurements here, as opposed to the area measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. However, I have concerns about how this was done: are the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref> (and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) z-projections to ensure that the entire depth of the cells (and therefore width) can be accounted for? In addition, how does the variance in length compare to the variance seen in the area measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? Was it not possible to acquire z-stacks to measure the 2-dimensional area of apical and basal surfaces, perhaps after 3-dimensional rendering? Finally, in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, there appears to be a protrusion at the basal end of the cell – was this taken into account for the analysis?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>: Were these mitotic cell measurements performed within a single optical section? Is it possible that there was displacement of neighboring cells in the z-axis?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: Can the authors provide supplemental images to demonstrate how angles of invagination were measured? I am having a hard time seeing 120 degrees in B and 45 degrees in C.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D-G</xref>: How were the regions selected for optical flow quantification? A representative image at each age with central and distal points marked would be helpful in understanding the quantifications here.</p><p>11) The data presented show very little statistics. In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, only 3 cells are represented and a couple of cells in supplemental figure. Similar observation can be made on the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were only quantifications for 1 clone are shown or for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> on the correlation between axis shortening and myosin accumulation. The authors should increase the number of cells analyzed in these figures, (for example in supplemental figures).</p><p>12) The oscillations observed and quantified by the authors have rather small amplitude. It is difficult to identify the osciilations on the videos and to evaluate the precision of the segmentation. The authors should modify the suppl. Video showing apical and basal oscillations to include also the segmented cell. In that way we could evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation and measurements.</p><p>13) About the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and the correlations between actin levels and cell area. The details of the analysis of the actin levels are missing. It is difficult to assess exactly what the authors are measuring. For instance, I wonder whether the fluctuations in actin levels are not coming to changes in cell perimeter or perimeter to surface ratio. The authors should clearly explain the methodology used to extract fluorescence levels.</p><p>14) In the cases of Blebbistatin and laminin morpholino experiments, quantification of basal or apical cell surface areas are missing. The authors should show the effect of these treatments on the oscillations.</p><p>Changes to the text/discussion:</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;We then examined[…] where the irreversible constriction takes place.&quot; As noted above, can the authors clarify the evidence for irreversibility? Is the constriction irreversible if embryos are manipulated in a different way (e.g. with latrunculin to depolymerize actin filaments)?</p><p>Subsection “Analysis of tension distribution during optic cup morphogenesis by laser ablation.2 and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>: &quot;Tissue ablations at the apical surface did not seem to affect the global geometry of the retina.&quot; It seems to me that <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref> shows that upon apical ablation, the retina appears to recoil toward the basal side, causing some amount of retinal flattening; this seems to be similar to the way that the basal retina recoils toward the apical side upon basal ablation, though basal ablation leads to the opposite effect (increased folding). This suggests that the apical surface is under tension as well, which is interesting. Additionally, the prospective retinal pigmented epithelium is in close proximity to the apical surface of the neural retina: are those cells being ablated during the apical ablation?</p><p>In the first sentence of the Abstract the authors mention: &quot;Tissue morphogenesis depends on the dynamic flow of contractile actomyosin networks&quot;. This is too strong. Some morphogenetic rearrangements associate with actomyosin flow but this is far to be clear that epithelial morphogenesis depends on actomyosin flow.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Analysis of cellular behavior and cytoskeletal dynamics reveal a constriction mechanism driving optic cup morphogenesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below by the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>et al.The authors' revised manuscript addresses most of my concerns raised during initial review, and the revisions and clarifications strengthen their conclusions. I still have a few minor comments to be addressed, simply related to further clarifications required and concerns about statements made in the text.</p><p>1) In the rebuttal #13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the authors have clarified for me how the actin quantification was done. However, I feel that the wording in the methods section is still very general, and when reading through the methods, it was still not clear to me that this was actually the procedure used to quantify actin signal, and that it was quantified averaged per unit cell area (if I am interpreting the authors correctly). I would request that the authors please add a note of clarification to the methods that this was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and how quantifications specific to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were performed.</p><p>2) Results section: &quot;[…]whereas the active oscillatory behavior at the basal side resulted in a progressive reduction of cell area[…]&quot; At this point in the manuscript, the authors have not shown that oscillatory behavior is causative, merely that it correlates with reduction in cell area.</p><p>3) Results section: &quot;[…] suggesting than [sic] actin needs to accumulate over a threshold to have an effect on cell size.&quot; This statement suggests a causal relationship between actin accumulation and cell size, and such a relationship has not been shown; this is correlative. Experiments in which actin depolymerizing agents are used would help to establish that relationship.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D: the statistical comparisons being made in the graph are confusing to me; it is not clear from the positioning of the asterisks which comparisons are being considered statistically significant. A simple repositioning of the asterisks would help here.</p><p>5) Subsection “<italic>Lamc1 function is required for efficient cell contractility, basal constriction and optic cup folding”</italic>: the authors refer to embryos injected with lamc1 morpholino as &quot;adhesion-deficient embryos&quot;.

This could be included in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15797.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Improvement to explanation and presentation of data:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors perform laser ablation experiments to look at tension at the basal side over time, both in wild type and in lamc morphants. They suggest that basal tension is dependent on lamc and is highest at the time that cells are contracting the most – at this time, ablation can affect the global shape of the cup. But <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which presents this data, is very hard to understand. In particular, the direction that the cells move after laser ablation is impossible to see. The image has been color coded in a way that is said to represent &quot;motion vectors&quot;, but it isn't clear whether the color represents the magnitude or the direction of the vectors. Showing a velocity flow field for the tissue would be a better way of presenting the global effects of laser ablation, and it is essential to show a higher magnification view of the cut site itself so that it is clear that tissue retracts after cutting.</italic> </p><p>We have made an effort to improve the quality of the overlays between the membrane signal and the particle tracking analysis in the ablation experiments. This has improved the signal to noise ratio in panels A-C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> as well as in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>. In addition a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) has been generated to make clear the color code used for particle tracking: i.e. different colors corresponding to the direction of the displacement and color intensity to the magnitude of the displacement (this explanatory sentence is now also included in the figure legends). Higher magnification views of the cut sites are also provided in this new supplementary figure.</p><p>We are confident that the updated version of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and the <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>, as well as the new supplementary figure will be sufficient to answer all the concerns on this issue.</p><p><italic>2) Most of the authors' experiments rely on rapid imaging of small sets of z-slices near the apical and basal surfaces of the neuroepithelium. It is difficult to tell from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> how the authors can tell if they are imaging exactly at the basal surface. A slight tilt in the axis of the eye or embryo would skew the precise measurements being taken: the area would not represent the basal surface, but instead, an oblique section nearby. Can the authors clarify their methods to state how z-slices were selected and validated?</italic> </p><p>To determine the orientation of the retinal neuroepithelium along the apico-basal axis and the position of apical and basal surfaces, a z-stack (with 1µm spatial resolution) was taken across the entire retina at the beginning and at the end of each time series (similarly to what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used this information to establish confocal planes for imaging between 1-3 µm below the apical or basal surfaces. (Note: the size and regular geometry of the retinal primordium, together with its relatively smooth surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), facilitate the identification of the terminal planes).</p><p>To clarify this point, we have now included the following information in the paragraph of the methods section live-imaging: “Optical sections containing either apical or basal surfaces were identified by z-stacks in resonant mode throughout the entire retinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). […]Then small z-stacks (3 planes over a total of 1 µm) were recorded every 5 or 8 seconds at the selected planes”</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, apical and basal length measurements: Can the authors add a short description to the methods section as to how this was carried out? How was the single optical section within the z-stack selected for the measurement?</italic> </p><p>Apical and basal edges indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with dotted lines were measured using the tool freehand line (Fiji) to outline the retinal borders. For these measurements an optical plane was selected at the central retina using as a reference the maximum lens vesicle diameter. To clarify this point, we have now included the information in the methods section Imaging processing and segmentation: “To measure the length of the apical and basal edges of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) we selected a single stack at the central retina and outlined tissue borders using the Fiji tool freehand”</p><p><italic>4) Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: &quot;Cell elongation[…]does not occur during retinal folding&quot;. I find this comment a bit confusing. These measurements were performed between 19 hpf and 22 hpf. But as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>, some amount of retinal folding seems to occur between 17 and 19 hpf. Can the authors clarify how they defined the period of retinal folding?</italic> </p><p>The complete epithelialization of the retinal precursors is achieved around 16-17 hpf, when all the neuroblasts orient their a-b axis towards the lens primordium (Kwan et al. 2012, Ivanovitch et al. 2013, and our own observations). We define the retinal folding period from this moment until 22-23 hpf when optic cup morphogenesis is completed; as included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-H</xref>. Our observations indicate that the width of the retinal epithelium remains invariant throughout all this process, spanning approximately 50 µm. It is true that the measurements provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> correspond only to time-lapse series between 19 hpf and 22 hpf. These measurements derive from three long recordings taken exclusively for that purpose with identical confocal settings.</p><p>To rule out changes in epithelial width at earlier stages we have performed new measurements at 17 hpf from 6 videos. The obtained values for the anterior (49.6 ± 3.5 µm), central (49.9 ± 5.3 µm), and posterior (47.6 ± 5.5 µm) retinas are not significantly different from that previously obtained for older stages (n=6; T-test) (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results confirm that the width of the retinal epithelium remains invariant throughout optic cup folding. Because the new 17 hpf measurements do not belong to the same recording series included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and in any case they do not modify our previous conclusions, we have decided to maintain the figure in its current format.</p><p><italic>5) In the same section: &quot;basal areas shrank significantly (40%) and irreversibly…&quot; Can the authors clarify the evidence (particularly at this point in the manuscript) for irreversibility of the phenomenon?</italic> </p><p>We do agree with the reviewers. Claiming that the constriction phenomenon is irreversible may be an unnecessary overstatement not sufficiently supported by the data. Thus, we have substituted in the manuscript the terms “irreversibility” and “irreversible” by the more descriptive terms “progressively” and “progressive”.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>: The authors note that for each timepoint, 24 cells were monitored. Were these the same 24 cells at each timepoint? How many embryos were used for these measurements?</italic> </p><p>For the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> we recorded a total of 24 cells from three different embryos, either at the apical or at the basal side (i.e. a total of six independent embryos were recorded). The same eyes were monitored at the central retina through time (in fact, for each time point we recorded 30 min videos). Focal planes needed to be adjusted every 30 min to guarantee that we were still recording 1-3 µm below the apical or basal surfaces. To make this point clear in the text, we have included the following information in the figure legend: “A total of 24 cells from three different embryos were recorded either at the apical or at the basal side.”</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3: I</xref> understand why the authors might have chosen to move to length measurements here, as opposed to the area measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. However, I have concerns about how this was done: are the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref> (and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) z-projections to ensure that the entire depth of the cells (and therefore width) can be accounted for? In addition, how does the variance in length compare to the variance seen in the area measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? Was it not possible to acquire z-stacks to measure the 2-dimensional area of apical and basal surfaces, perhaps after 3-dimensional rendering? Finally, in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, there appears to be a protrusion at the basal end of the cell – was this taken into account for the analysis?</italic> </p><p>The objective of this experiment was to investigate the existence of two possible mechanisms:</p><p>a) The occurrence of coordinated membrane pulses transmitted as waves across the entire apico-basal axis of the cell.</p><p>b) The coordinated contraction of apical and basal surfaces either simultaneously or asynchronously.</p><p>Our results, derived from the observation of 10 transplanted neuroblasts (from 5 different retinas), do not support any of these possibilities, but rather indicate that apical and basal surfaces behave as independent oscillators.</p><p>We do agree with the reviewer in that 3D renderings of the cells may have allowed reconstructing the apical and basal surfaces. In fact, we tried this approach on the transplanted neuroblasts. Unfortunately, this turned to be problematic, as it was technically difficult to keep the high-temporal and spatial resolution necessary while recording enough z-planes for a high quality 3D rendering. As an alternative approach we decided to measure the cell diameter in a maximum projection of 3 z-stacks (over a total of 1µm) selected at the maximum width of the cell (as determine after a preliminary z-stack reconstruction). This information is already included in the legend of <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>. Since the measured parameter was the basal end diameter, cell protrusions were not taken into account in our analysis.</p><p>Regarding the question of as to how does the variance in length compare to the variance in area: a geometric calculation shows that a typical variation of 10% in cell area implies a diameter variation of ≈ 5%, which still is within the resolution range of our videos. Therefore, we believe that the measurement of diameter variations is a valid approach to answer the intended question.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>: Were these mitotic cell measurements performed within a single optical section? Is it possible that there was displacement of neighboring cells in the z-axis?</italic> </p><p>Mitotic cells measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> were obtained for a total of 10 cells from 3 different retinae. Measurements were taken from maximum projections of 3 z-stacks (over a total of 1µm). This does not allow ruling out whether there is neighboring cells displacement in the z-axis. To address this question we examined 5 different cell divisions (from different retinas) at an apical plane. The results confirm our previous observations indicating that apical expansion along the mitotic axis is transient. In addition neighbor relationships remain approximately constant during cell divisions, thus indicating that apical expansion does not occur either perpendicularly to the mitotic axis. We have included these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G-J</xref>.</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: Can the authors provide supplemental images to demonstrate how angles of invagination were measured? I am having a hard time seeing 120 degrees in B and 45 degrees in C.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing our attention to this point. We have realized that the criteria used for angles measurement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (i.e. setting the angle vertex at the center of the retina epithelium) was different from that used in the rest of the figures (i.e. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> the angle vertex was anchored at the basal surface). We apologize for this inconsistent protocol, which in any case do not change our conclusions (i.e. on the existence of a critical period, in which local ablations at the basal surface trigger global tissue rearrangement).</p><p>To resolve this issue we have measured again all the retinal angles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, associated supplementary figures, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Videos 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">12</xref>, anchoring now the vertex to the basal surface. Angle measurements have been corrected accordingly in the figures (120º and 45º are now 130º and 80º respectively), and bending angles are now indicated with dashed lines. In addition we have also realized that angles nomenclature in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8 F-G</xref> was not sufficiently explained. For the statistical analysis of maximal ablation speeds, ablated retinas were sorted in 15º bins. This is now described in the laser ablation section in methods and the exact bins indicated in the corresponding box plots.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8, D-G</xref>: How were the regions selected for optical flow quantification? A representative image at each age with central and distal points marked would be helpful in understanding the quantifications here.</italic> </p><p>Boxes showing the regions selected for optical flow quantification are now indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>11) The data presented show very little statistics. In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, only 3 cells are represented and a couple of cells in supplemental figure. Similar observation can be made on the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were only quantifications for 1 clone are shown or for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> on the correlation between axis shortening and myosin accumulation. The authors should increase the number of cells analyzed in these figures, (for example in supplemental figures).</italic> </p><p>We believe that in general our observations have enough statistical support. In the revised version we have scanned the manuscript to make sure this is properly stated in the text when necessary. Nevertheless, we have revisited <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> as follow:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: We are showing apical and basal oscillations for 6 representative cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. However our conclusions are based on the recording of 43 individual cells at the apical side and 46 cells at the basal side. In both cases, cell oscillations were examined in three independent retinas. In addition, we have provided the average frequency and peak-to-peak amplitude in the text accompanying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and the average area through time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Most of this information was partially indicated in the text:</p><p>“more than 76% of the apical and 90% of the basal oscillations analyzed (n=43) presented no major correlation with those of their neighbors (Pearson correlation coefficient R &lt; |0.5|). Comparison of the pulsatile behavior at both epithelial planes revealed significant differences. Although both surfaces oscillate with a similar frequency of 50 ± 12.5 mHz (≈ 20 ± 5 sec.; n=26 cells), the pulsing amplitude * is considerably larger at the basal 11.1 ± 1,3 µm2/min than at the apical surface 4.1 ± 0.57 µm2/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>)”.</p><p>*Note: we realized that the term “pulsing amplitude” as it was included in page 7 was misleading as it was actually referring to “peak-to-peak amplitude”. We have reserved the term amplitude for semi-amplitudes in other sections of the manuscript.</p><p>We have now expanded this description in the first sentence to make the point clear:</p><p>“The analysis of individual cells from three independent retinas revealed that 76% of the apical (n=43) and 90% of the basal (n=46) oscillations presented no major correlation with those of their neighbors (Pearson correlation coefficient R &lt; |0.5|).”</p><p>In addition we have added new panels to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (panels E, F, and G) showing the distribution of the correlation coefficients between the oscillations of cell pairs at the apical and basal surface. We strongly believe that these analyses should be sufficient to evaluate the accuracy of the observations included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We think that all this information will be more informative than showing additional examples of the apical and basal oscillations, such as those included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, and the panels included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response images 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">2</xref>.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15797.036</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15797.036">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15797.036</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15797-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15797.037</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15797.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15797.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15797-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we included a representative example of the simultaneous recording of apical and basal oscillations in transplanted cells. As mentioned in the text and in the point 7 of this reply letter, our conclusions are derived from the observation of 10 transplanted neuroblasts from 5 different retinas (the last is now indicated in the figure legend and the methods section). To make this more evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we have now included a box plot showing the distribution of the correlation coefficients for the apical vs. basal surface in the 10 clones analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We believe that this graphic will be more informative than showing another example of the correlative oscillations, such as the one we have included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: The data presented in this figure are important for the general conclusions of the work. Therefore, in line with the reviewers’ comments, we have carried out new imaging experiment to increase the number of cells analyzed; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref> 20 cells from at least 10 different retinas in each type of experiment. In addition, we are showing additional examples of cellular behavior in the modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we are now including quantitative data on of axial cell shortening (µm) and basal area contraction (µm<sup>2</sup>) upon accumulation of myosin foci: Now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement1F</xref>, respectively.</p><p>We believe that these new analyses strongly support our conclusions regarding the correlation between myosin foci accumulation and basal feet constriction.</p><p><italic>12) The oscillations observed and quantified by the authors have rather small amplitude. It is difficult to identify the osciilations on the videos and to evaluate the precision of the segmentation. The authors should modify the suppl. Video showing apical and basal oscillations to include also the segmented cell. In that way we could evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation and measurements.</italic> </p><p>As we mentioned in the text the peak-to-peak amplitude at the basal and apical surfaces are 11.1 ± 1,3 μm<sup>2</sup>/min and 4.1 ± 0.57 μm<sup>2</sup>/min, respectively. This, for basal oscillations, corresponds to surface area changes varying between 10 to 15% of the total area, which is within the range of what has been observed for basal oscillations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cells (He et al. 2010).</p><p>Regarding the methodological issue on the evaluation of the accuracy of the segmentation and measurements, we have now included a new video (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">Video 13</xref>) in which membrane oscillations and automatic cell edge detection are shown in parallel. This video shows the RGB codes assigned by the segmentation program to each tracked cell.</p><p>In addition, although we have stated in the methods (imaging processing and segmentation) that: “Automatic detection of cell edges and tracking of individual cells through time was performed with Packing Analyzer v2.0, which uses a watershed algorithm for cell identification (Aigouy et al., 2010). Individual images were examined manually to correct for automatic segmentation mistakes”. Now we have added the following explanatory sentence to the methods section: “Unique RGB codes were assigned to each cell by Packing Analyzer V2.0 in tracked images. Only those cells that could be tracked unambiguously through time were considered for quantification.”</p><p><italic>13) About the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and the correlations between actin levels and cell area. The details of the analysis of the actin levels are missing. It is difficult to assess exactly what the authors are measuring. For instance, I wonder whether the fluctuations in actin levels are not coming to changes in cell perimeter or perimeter to surface ratio. The authors should clearly explain the methodology used to extract fluorescence levels.</italic> </p><p>Average rather than total pixel intensity was considered for the quantification of actin levels. Thus, fluctuations in actin levels do not come from changes in cell area, but from actin accumulation. We stated this already in the methods section -“For automatic intensity measurements, segmented and tracked images were processed using a MATLAB (Mathworks) script for mean pixel intensity quantification&quot;. However, we have decided to explain this point better in the revised version and thus the sentence has been modified as follow: &quot;For automatic intensity measurements, segmented images and RGB codes assigned by Packing Analyzer V2.0 were used to quantify mean pixel intensity for each tracked cell using a script in MATLAB (Mathworks).&quot;</p><p><italic>14) In the cases of Blebbistatin and laminin morpholino experiments, quantification of basal or apical cell surface areas are missing. The authors should show the effect of these treatments on the oscillations.</italic> </p><p>We have partially addressed this issue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> (and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>) in which we compare basal oscillations, average peak amplitude and basal constriction in control and blebbistatin treated embryos. To show the effect of <italic>lamc1</italic> loss of function on the cell oscillations we have carried out new imaging experiments. The results obtained are summarized in a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis shows that basal oscillations are not impaired upon <italic>lamc1</italic> knockdown; on the contrary, the average peak amplitude is significantly increased in the morphant cells by 45%. Interestingly, constriction of the cell feet is severally impaired in <italic>lamc1</italic>Mo embryos and the basal cell areas are significantly larger when compared to the control situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is an interesting observation that is in line with our previous work (Martinez-Morales et al. 2009; Bogdanovic et al. 2012) and that confirms (through a direct observation) that the constriction process requires laminin-dependent adhesion to the ECM. We thank the referee for suggesting this informative experiment.</p><p><italic>Changes to the text/discussion:</italic> </p><p><italic>Discussion section: &quot;We then examined… where the irreversible constriction takes place.&quot; As noted above, can the authors clarify the evidence for irreversibility? Is the constriction irreversible if embryos are manipulated in a different way (e.g. with latrunculin to depolymerize actin filaments)?</italic> </p><p>This comment is in line with point 5 (see above). What we observe through development is a progressive reduction of the cell areas at the basal surface. We agree with the reviewers in that the term “irreversible” is loaded with mechanistic implications not sufficiently supported by the data. We think that an experimental demonstration for irreversibility may be extremely difficult and goes beyond the scope of this work. Thus, as stated in point 5, we have substituted in the manuscript the terms “irreversibility” and “irreversible” by the more descriptive terms “progressively” and “progressive”.</p><p> <italic>Subsection “Analysis of tension distribution during optic cup morphogenesis by laser ablation.2 and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>: &quot;Tissue ablations at the apical surface did not seem to affect the global geometry of the retina.&quot; It seems to me that <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref> shows that upon apical ablation, the retina appears to recoil toward the basal side, causing some amount of retinal flattening; this seems to be similar to the way that the basal retina recoils toward the apical side upon basal ablation, though basal ablation leads to the opposite effect (increased folding). This suggests that the apical surface is under tension as well, which is interesting. Additionally, the prospective retinal pigmented epithelium is in close proximity to the apical surface of the neural retina: are those cells being ablated during the apical ablation?</italic> </p><p>Tissue reaction to basal vs. apical laser ablation is shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref> and both central and peripheral tissue displacements are indicated with green and white arrowheads respectively. We do agree in that a response is also observed upon apical ablation, which indicates that this surface is also under tension. It is likely that the apical actomyosin belt observed in the neural retina (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>) plays a role in maintaining this tension. In any case, we clearly observed a differential behaviour between apical and basal ablations. Whereas basal ablations resulted in a global tissue displacement affecting not only the central but also the peripheral retina, apical ablations only affected the morphology of the central retina and no peripheral displacement was observed (white arrowhead in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>). To make this point clear we have substituted the sentence &quot;Tissue ablations at the apical surface did not seem to affect the global geometry of the retina&quot; by the more explanatory sentence “In contrast to the global reaction observed upon basal ablation, which triggers the displacement of the peripheral retina, apical ablations only affected the morphology of the central retina but no peripheral retraction was observed (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>). Furthermore, we have generated a new supplementary figure showing measurements for central and peripheral displacements after ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the RPE issue, we cannot rule out a possible contribution from this tissue to apical tension. Although laser ablations were always aimed at the neural retina membranes, we may have unintentionally damaged the pigmented tissue in some experiments. However, since the main conclusions of the article are related to retinal behaviour upon basal ablation, we have not explored this interesting possibility further.</p><p><italic>In the first sentence of the Abstract the authors mention: &quot;Tissue morphogenesis depends on the dynamic flow of contractile actomyosin networks&quot;. This is too strong. Some morphogenetic rearrangements associate with actomyosin flow but this is far to be clear that epithelial morphogenesis depends on actomyosin flow.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the point. The sentence has been modified as follow: “Contractile actomyosin networks have been shown to power tissue morphogenesis.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors' revised manuscript addresses most of my concerns raised during initial review, and the revisions and clarifications strengthen their conclusions. I still have a few minor comments to be addressed, simply related to further clarifications required and concerns about statements made in the text.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In the rebuttal #13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the authors have clarified for me how the actin quantification was done. However, I feel that the wording in the methods section is still very general, and when reading through the methods, it was still not clear to me that this was actually the procedure used to quantify actin signal, and that it was quantified averaged per unit cell area (if I am interpreting the authors correctly). I would request that the authors please add a note of clarification to the methods that this was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and how quantifications specific to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were performed.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion we have include additional information on the quantification of actin intensity in the methods section. The following sentence “For automatic intensity measurements, segmented images and RGB codes assigned by Packing Analyzer V2.0 were used to quantify mean pixel intensity for each tracked cell using a script in MATLAB (Mathworks).” has now being replaced by the more explanatory paragraph:</p><p>“For automatic actin intensity measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), individual cell profiles (as revealed by lyn-tdTomato) were segmented and tracked using Packing Analyzer V2.0. This software generates unique RGB codes and masks for every tracked cell. Then, a MATLAB (Mathworks) script was used to overlap cell masks with images showing F-actin (Utrophin-GFP) and to quantify average intensity per cell area.”</p><p><italic>2) Results section: &quot;[…]whereas the active oscillatory behavior at the basal side resulted in a progressive reduction of cell area[…]&quot; At this point in the manuscript, the authors have not shown that oscillatory behavior is causative, merely that it correlates with reduction in cell area.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is right. We have changed the sentence as follows: &quot;[…]whereas a progressive reduction of cell area was apparent at the basal side, cells did not display a net constriction at the apical side over a 25 min period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Results section: &quot;[…]suggesting than [sic] actin needs to accumulate over a threshold to have an effect on cell size.&quot; This statement suggests a causal relationship between actin accumulation and cell size, and such a relationship has not been shown; this is correlative. Experiments in which actin depolymerizing agents are used would help to establish that relationship.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee in that we have not formally demonstrated a causal relationship. Regarding the use of actin-depolymerizing drugs, such as cytochalasin B, we were concerned about that their general cytotoxic effects may obscure the interpretation of the experiments. We believe that addressing causality between actin accumulation and cell feet size would require interfering locally with actin polymerization. Since we think these are complex experiments beyond the scope of this work, we have decided to simply remove this sentence from the final version.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D: the statistical comparisons being made in the graph are confusing to me; it is not clear from the positioning of the asterisks which comparisons are being considered statistically significant. A simple repositioning of the asterisks would help here.</italic> </p><p>The asterisks have been repositioned to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “Lamc1 function is required for efficient cell contractility, basal constriction and optic cup folding”: the authors refer to embryos injected with lamc1 morpholino as &quot;adhesion-deficient embryos&quot;. The authors have not shown that adhesion itself is deficient, only that lamc1 is likely knocked down.</italic> </p><p>We have modified this sentence as follow: “To investigate myosin dynamics in the folding retina of lamc1-deficient embryos, morpholinos were injected[…]”</p><p><italic>6) Discussion, paragraph four: I feel that the proposal of this working model would benefit from a model diagram to accompany it, possibly comparing wild type and lamc1 morphant oscillations and constriction.</italic> </p><p>A new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) has been generated to illustrate the working model suggested in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have significantly improved the quality of the manuscript. Particularly on the clarity of the statistics and methodology. I think the manuscript is now close to being acceptable for publication in eLife. I have however few comments that would be necessary to be implemented before acceptation.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors have now given epithelial width at earlier times (17hpf) in the answers to reviewers but not included it in the manuscript. I think these data should be included in the final version.</italic> </p><p>These data have now been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) About actin intensity measurements on the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, The methodology is still insufficiently explained. We observe normalized Utrophin-GFP fluctuating between 5 and -5. I understand from the explanation that these are proportional to mean pixel intensity over the entire surface of each segmented cell. Is it correct?</italic> </p><p>Yes, that is correct. Please see response to reviewer #2. We have already included more methodological information in the revised version</p><p><italic>How is it normalized to get positive and negative values? It should be more explicitely explained in the methods.</italic> </p><p>Please see below.</p><p><italic>3) On the same <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, it is labelled (u.a) where it should be (a.u.) for arbitrary units. Also How the cell area rate is normalized? It is not explicitly mentioned and depending on the normalization the units may not be arbitrary.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> we normalized the area rate and the Utrophin-gfp rates dividing by the mean of their absolute values. Thus, a.u. (the labels have been now corrected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is justified in the legends. The fact that both rates fluctuate between positive and negative values simply reflects the relaxation/contraction of cell area and the concentration/dilution of actin levels. We have now included this information in the corresponding figure legend.</p><p><italic>4) On the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> C the Avg peak amplitude units is microns2/min. I guess it is microns2. Also the peak amplitude seems to scale with the cell size of LamC morphants that is larger. This could be included in the text.</italic> </p><p>In the panel C we are representing the average peak amplitude of the cell area rate (in µm2/min). This however was not properly mentioned. We have now included this information in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
