peptides that modulate analgesia, reward, and stress. In vivo detection of enkephalins remains difficult due to transient and low endogenous concentrations and inherent sequence similarity. To begin to address this, we previously developed a system combining in vivo optogenetics with microdialysis and a highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based assay to measure opioid peptide release in freely moving rodents (Al-Hasani et al., 2018, eLife). Here, we show improved detection resolution and stabilization of enkephalin detection, which allowed us to investigate enkephalin release during acute stress. We present an analytical method for real-time, simultaneous detection of Met- and Leu-enkephalin (Met-Enk and Leu-Enk) in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) after acute stress. We confirm that acute stress activates enkephalinergic neurons in the NAcSh using fiber photometry and that this leads to the release of Met- and Leu-Enk. We also demonstrate the dynamics of Met- and Leu-Enk release as well as how they correlate to one another in the ventral NAc shell, which was previously difficult due to the use of approaches that relied on mRNA transcript levels rather than posttranslational products. This approach increases spatiotemporal resolution, optimizes the detection of Met-Enk through methionine oxidation, and provides novel insight into the relationship between Met- and Leu-Enk following stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enkephalin</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd><kwd>nucleus

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endogenous opioid peptides are released at significantly lower concentrations than small molecule neurotransmitters and undergo posttranslational processing that yields ~30 unique peptides from 4 precursor molecules. Together, these properties have made sensitive peptide detection difficult to achieve with existing technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fricker et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we describe an analytical method that enables quantification of dynamic in vivo changes in both Leu- and Met-enkephalin (Leu-Enk and Met-Enk) peptides in rodents. We show unique release profiles between Leu- and Met-Enk in response to two different stressors and gain new insight into peptide release dynamics; additionally, our method offers improved spatiotemporal resolution. More broadly, this approach will enable an understanding of how neuropeptide levels change in response to acute or chronic behavioral, pharmacological, and neurophysiological manipulations.</p><p>Enkephalins can act on both the delta and/or mu opioid receptors, but their activity often depends on receptor and peptide expression patterns, which differ across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banghart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mansour et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banghart et al., 2015</xref>). Confirming an opioid peptideâs identity based on the activity of the receptor alone poses difficulties. For example, in a single brain region, the mu opioid receptor may be activated by an enkephalin or endorphin peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomes et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, any technique that relies on a readout of mu opioid receptor activity is not sufficient to determine whether the peptide is an endorphin or an enkephalin. It has been particularly challenging to measure Met- and Leu-Enk selectively and independently in vivo; in fact, both peptides are typically referred to as âenkephalinsâ, which oversimplifies their distinct properties. Though antibody-based techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maidment et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marinelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernandez and Hoebel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieto et al., 2002</xref>) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mabrouk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baseski et al., 2005</xref> have improved Met- and Leu-Enk detection somewhat, limitations such as spatiotemporal restrictions and poor selectivity between enkephalins remain. Our group previously developed real-time in vivo detection of evoked opioid peptide release using microdialysis/nanoLC-MS (nLC-MS) after photostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Hasani et al., 2018</xref>). From this strong foundation, we have now optimized a novel opioid peptide detection technique. For the first time, we can selectively measure real-time in vivo levels of basal (non-evoked) peptide release, as well as during behavioral manipulations. Our primary goals in establishing this analytical workflow to measure opioid peptide dynamics in vivo were to (1) increase temporal resolution allowing for the detection of dynamic changes to short external stimuli and acute conditions, (2) lower the detection threshold to allow for accurate measurements from small brain regions using less volume of sample, (3) measure endogenous release of peptides in the native state without the need for photo- or chemogenetic stimulation, (4) report raw values of measured concentrations rather than % baseline measurements, (5) enable real-time, simultaneous detection of both Met- and Leu-Enk. To meet these goals and measure both Leu- and Met-Enk, we used an improved and specialized microdialysis technique coupled with nLC-MS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimizing a method for the simultaneous in vivo detection of Met- and Leu-Enk</title><p>Our workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) starts with stereotaxic surgery to implant the microdialysis probe in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). Along with others, we have shown that the opioid receptor system in the NAcSh mediates both reward and aversion through photostimulation of peptide-expressing neurons across the dorsal/ventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pirino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trieu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reynolds and Berridge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castro and Bruchas, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schindler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro and Berridge, 2014</xref>). Our aim was to measure NAcSh peptide release in response to aversive, stressful stimuli. We use custom-made microdialysis probes, intentionally modified so they are similar in size to commonly used fiber photometry probes, thus causing comparable levels of tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, the membrane that sits above the brain region of interest is smaller in diameter when compared to a photometry probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After recovery, we begin microdialysis collection every 13 min, circulating artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and collecting interstitial fluid (ISF) at a flow rate of 0.8 Î¼L/min. After each sample collection, we add a consistent known concentration of isotopically labeled internal standard of Met-Enk and Leu-Enk of 40 amol/sample to the collected ISF for the accurate identification and quantification of endogenous peptide. These internal standards have a different mass/charge (m/z) ratio than endogenous Met- and Leu-Enk. Thus, we can identify true endogenous signal for Met-Enk and Leu-Enk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and C</xref>) versus noise, interfering signals, and standard signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and D</xref>). Importantly, we have resolved one of the main barriers preventing the accurate quantification of Met-Enk: the variable oxidation of the methionine residue during sample processing, which results in the signal for Met-Enk being split among multiple m/z values, thereby impairing sensitivity. In order to ensure that the signal for Met-Enk is represented by a single m/z value, we converted all methionyl residues to the doubly oxidized sulfone prior to nLC-MS analysis, which allows us to reliably quantify Met-Enk and differentiate it from Leu-Enk without compromising the detection of either peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pesavento et al., 2007</xref>). Beyond opioid peptides, this approach represents a key advance and can be applied to any peptide containing a methionine residue. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, before the methionine oxidation reaction at time 0, Met-Enk can be observed in unoxidized, and singly and doubly oxidized forms with varying intensities. However, after the reaction is complete at time 1, Met-Enk is observed as doubly oxidized with much higher intensity, enabling accurate quantification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An optimized approach for in vivo Met- and Leu-enkephalin (Met- and Leu-Enk) measurement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of in vivo sample collection on day 1 and methionine oxidation reaction overnight, sample processing on day 2, and data acquisition on the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS), days 3â5.

Samples are then collected at a rate of 0.8 Î¼L/min for 13 min each. After collection is completed, the samples are oxidized overnight. On day 2, the samples undergo solid-phase extraction (SPE) and are then dehydrated and reconstituted using formic acid (HCOOH) before being acquired on the LC-MS.

To determine the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), forward and reverse curves were created using varying concentrations of the Met- and Leu-Enk standards in accordance with the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carr et al., 2014</xref>). We determined that the LLOQ for both Leu-Enk and Met-Enk is 40 amol/sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The improved quantification limit means increased temporal resolution. We now need less volume (10 Î¼L or less) and shorter sampling times: 10 min or less, rather than 15â20 min as compared to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Hasani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiFeliceantonio et al., 2012</xref>). To test the utility of the method in measuring real-time changes in peptide levels in vivo, we evoked the release of the peptides using high K<sup>+</sup> Ringerâs solution, which depolarizes the cells and causes the release of dense core vesicles containing neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ripley et al., 1997</xref>). This depolarization state significantly increased the release of Met- and Leu-Enk in the NAcSh as compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, Leu-Enk showed a greater fold change compared to baseline than did Met-Enk, with the fold changes being 28 and 7, respectively, based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. Previous studies reporting opioid peptide measurements rarely represent raw concentrations measured. Instead, most past studies reported changes in peptide concentrations as % of baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mabrouk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Hasani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiFeliceantonio et al., 2012</xref>). One key advantage of our improved method is that we can detect reliable measurements of both Met- and Leu-Enk at baseline reported as concentrations in the amol/sample range. We then quantified the ratio of Met- to Leu-Enk after applying high K<sup>+</sup> solution and showed that this ratio is 3:1 in the NAcSh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). The release of Met-Enk is postulated both in vitro and ex vivo to be between three and four times that of Leu-Enk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Comb et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hughes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson et al., 1978</xref>). We are the first to not only corroborate the predicted ratio in vivo in freely behaving animals<italic>,</italic> but specifically in the NAcSh. Interestingly, this 3:1 ratio is almost identical to that previously reported in homogenized human tissue from the sympathoadrenal systems using radioimmunoassays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshimasa et al., 1982</xref>). Importantly, this conserved ratio highlights the usefulness of rodent models for investigating the highly conserved opioid system and demonstrates its potential in translation to humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experimenter handling drives the release of Met- and Leu-Enk in the NAcSh</title><p>To highlight the applicability and value of this improved approach, we investigated the changes in the levels of enkephalins following acute stress. It has been hypothesized that enkephalins act as anti-stress signals based on studies that have shown increased preproenkephalin transcript levels following acute stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mansi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dumont et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ceccatelli and Orazzo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valentino and Van Bockstaele, 2015</xref>). These studies have included regions such as the locus coeruleus, the ventral medulla, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the nucleus accumbens core and shell. Studies using global knockout of enkephalins have shown varying responses to chronic stress interventions, where male knockout mice showed resistance to chronic mild stress in one study, while another study showed that enkephalin-knockout mice showed delayed termination of corticosteroid release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, decreased enkephalin expression in the NAc was correlated with an increase in the susceptibility to social defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nam et al., 2019</xref>). This body of literature supports the hypothesis that enkephalins participate in stress encoding and reactivity. We were specifically interested in how enkephalins mediate acute stress responses. Our group has also recently demonstrated that the photostimulation of a subpopulation of peptidergic neurons in the NAcSh drives aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>), which further suggests a role for neurons in the NAcSh during aversive stimuli such as stress. Despite the wealth of data implicating these peptides in the stress response, it has not been possible to measure the dynamics of real-time peptide release in response to acute stressful stimuli. We sought to test the hypothesis that Met- and Leu-Enk are released in the NAcSh following acute stress. Using the nLC-MS detection method, we successfully monitored dynamic changes of Met- and Leu-Enk during two different stressors. The first stressor was defined as experimenter handling, which involves the experimenter scruffing the mouse while connecting to the dialysis setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The second stressor was exposure to predator odor (i.e. fox urine).</p><p>We show that both Met- and Leu-Enk are released following experimenter handling, and that the levels decrease within minutes after exposure to the stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also analyzed the data with sex as a main effect and did not find any differences between males and females after correcting for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We corroborate our findings from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref> showing that the ratio of 3:1 Met-Enk to Leu-Enk is conserved following experimenter handling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Another key finding is that peptide release appears to be precisely controlled. We show that the amol/sample of Met-Enk released at the beginning of the experiment is predictive of later release. For example, a higher level released (in the fmol/sample range) during the first collections results in lower levels released (in the amol/sample range) during later collections and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We show a negative correlation (~â0.3) between the first two samples (~26 min) and the later time points, samples 3â10 (~104 min). Importantly, this relationship is not due to Met-Enk depletion as the circulation of high K<sup>+</sup> aCSF is sufficient to drive the release of Met-Enk at the end of an experiment and reverse the negative correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experimenter handling evokes the release of Met- and Leu-enkephalin (Met- and Leu-Enk) in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimenter handling during microdialysis causes a significant increase in the release of Leu- and Met-Enk in comparison to baseline.

To do this, we stereotaxically injected a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus containing the calcium sensor GCaMP6s in the NAcSh of preproEnkephalin-Cre (<italic>Penk</italic>-Cre) mice and implanted fiber photometry probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). During handling, we observed increased calcium activity in enkephalinergic neurons, even after it was repeated twice within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Individual responses to experimenter handling varied appreciably, as shown by the heatmaps and bar plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>); such variation could be due to slight differences in probe placement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and D</xref>) as peptidergic neurons in the dNAcSh encode reward while neurons in the vNAcSh encode aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the enkephalin precursor is expressed across the dorsal-ventral axis as shown in the in situ hybridization atlas (Allen Brain Institute). The fiber photometry data and peptide release data are concordant, as enkephalinergic neurons are activated following experimenter handling, which drives Met- and Leu-Enk somatodendritic release. However, the photometry and peptide release data differ in that repeated neuronal activation may not necessarily lead to repeated peptide release, as suggested by the decrease in peptide release over time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Additionally, fiber photometry cannot provide information about Met- and Leu-Enk independently, as it relies on the precursor gene, <italic>Penk</italic>. Taken together, our data highlight the value and importance of coupling fiber photometry results with in vivo measurements of neuropeptides to determine release dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Predator odor causes the release of Met-Enk in the NAcSh</title><p>We wanted to test another stressor that is similar in nature to experimenter handling, as the experimenter represents aversive visual, olfactory, and touch stimuli to the mouse. Fox odor has been widely demonstrated to be aversive to rodents and other mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apfelbach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endres and Fendt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farmer-Dougan et al., 2005</xref>). The benefit of using predator odor is that it represents what mice would encounter in the wild, outside of the lab environment. It also allows us to probe conserved circuits in laboratory mice related to aversion, threat, and defensive behaviors. Prior reports have shown that predator odor leads to an increase in the expression of the neuronal activation-associated transcription factor fos in enkephalin-positive neurons in different brain regions, including the NAcSh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hebb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asok et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether enkephalins are released in the NAcSh following exposure to fox urine. We first measured calcium activity of enkephalinergic neurons using fiber photometry after exposure to fox urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We show that upon first exposure, the activity of enkephalinergic neurons is markedly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>). However, this enkephalinergic activity is significantly attenuated during second and third exposures that are separated by 5 min, suggesting habituation to the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>). To determine whether the response to fox urine may also be due to the novelty of the weigh boat used to introduce the fox urine, we measured enkephalinergic calcium activity after introducing a weigh boat containing water to the home cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we show that enkephalinergic neurons also respond to the introduction of a novel object, and the response to the water-containing weigh boat is attenuated upon repeated exposure, which is what we observed for fox urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2BâD</xref>). We compared the enkephalinergic neuron activation in response to both water and fox urine for each individual mouse that experienced both, and we see similar calcium transient responses to both the introduction of a novel object and the odor of a predator, suggesting the same subpopulation of enkephalinergic neurons may have been activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). Interestingly and importantly, only recently have researchers shown that a higher level of spiking in the striatum is not always reflected in greater photometry transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Legaria et al., 2022</xref>). In the future, it will be important to determine whether the fox urine response indeed shows higher action potential spiking than the weigh boat with water. Although the calcium responses to both the fox urine and water-containing weigh boats were similar in magnitude, it may be that different subpopulations of enkephalinergic neurons are activated in the NAcSh. Further exploration of the specific neurons that respond to the introduction of a novel object or the odor of a predator is warranted. We concluded that enkephalinergic neurons are activated by fox odor using fiber photometry. We were then interested in testing whether activation of enkephalinergic neurons leads to the release of Met- and Leu-Enk, so we measured peptide levels in the NAcSh after fox odor using our method of microdialysis and nLC-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Fox odor exposure activates enkephalinergic neurons and drives the release of Met-enkephalin (Met-Enk) in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viral strategy and probe placement for the fiber photometry experiment in <italic>Penk</italic>-Cre mice injected with the calcium sensor GCaMP6s in the NAcSh.

The response to predator odor varies appreciably: the responses are almost evenly split between elevated release, release with no elevation, or no detectable release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Enkephalins are thought to mediate resilience to stress, so the individual differences in responses to predator odor may indicate differences in stress adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valentino and Van Bockstaele, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">BÃ©rubÃ© et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BÃ©rubÃ© et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, no sex differences in the responses to fox urine were observed, similar to responses to experimenter handling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). It is also worth noting that we only observed Leu-Enk release in 3 of 16 experiments. This is likely due to Leu-Enk not being released following predator odor or because it is released at a level below the LLOQ, as suggested by the observed 3:1 ratio of Met-Enk to Leu-Enk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, this work allows for multiple unique advances in studying endogenous opioids and neuropeptides in general. Although there has been substantial progress in fluorescent sensor-based techniques, electrochemical approaches, and immunoaffinity-based assays, the investigation of opioid peptides has lagged due to their unique properties: sequence similarity, diversity, and low concentrations. Here, we address these challenges by advancing microdialysis coupled with nLC-MS. First, we have refined a method of methionine stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pesavento et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosei et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finn et al., 2004</xref>) that is transferable to other neuropeptides and have decreased the LLOQ and temporal resolution, which are typically the main critiques of microdialysis and LC-MS approaches. As we have shown, if Met-Enk is not fully oxidized prior to LC-MS analysis, it is hard to quantify because of the presence of differentially oxidized species. The diversity of the signal detected impedes the analysis of a single sample and may lead to inaccurate concentration values. Here, we show that the oxidation of methionine allows for the stable detection of not only Met-Enk but also the simultaneous and selective detection of Leu-Enk.</p><p>Second, we quantified the relationship between Leu- and Met-Enk and offer a definitive in vivo ratio (3:1 Met-Enk to Leu-Enk) that has long been in question; this ratio corroborates human data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshimasa et al., 1982</xref>) and suggests that mice are a useful model system for the study of enkephalinergic release dynamics. Based on this, future studies investigating the use of opioid peptides as biomarkers for psychiatric conditions will be readily translatable from rodents to humans and will allow for ease in reverse translation efforts. There is already some demonstrated interest in measuring opioid peptide levels in humans due to their roles in mood disorders, substance use, and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Hakeim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamel et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, prior to our study, the predicted ratio of Met- to Leu-Enk was predicted based on the mRNA transcript sequence, so we are the first to confirm that posttranslational cleavage indeed yields the predicted ratio. We also noted that Leu-Enk showed a greater fold increase relative to baseline after depolarization with high K<sup>+</sup> buffer as compared to Met-Enk. This may be due to increased Leu-Enk packaging in dense core vesicles compared to Met-Enk or since there are two distinct precursor sources for Leu-Enk, namely both proenkephalin and prodynorphin, while Met-Enk is mostly cleaved from proenkephalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conway et al., 2022</xref>). Third, we identify a role for the NAcSh in the acute stress response by demonstrating local release of Met- and Leu-Enk after stress exposure using our improved microdialysis and nLC-MS method. Although studies have suggested a role for the NAcSh in stress through measurements of <italic>Penk</italic> transcripts, it had not been definitively shown that there is local release of enkephalins after stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hebb et al., 2004</xref>). Our findings showed a robust increase in peptide release at the beginning of experiments, which we interpreted as due to experimenter handling stress that directly precedes microdialysis collections. However, there are other technical limitations to consider, such as the fact that we were collecting samples from mice that were recently operated on. Another consideration is that the circulation of aCSF through the probe may cause a sudden shift in oncotic and hydrostatic forces, leading to increased peptide release to the extracellular space. As such, we wanted to examine our findings using a different technique, so we chose to record calcium activity from enkephalinergic neurons â the same cell population leading to peptide release. Using fiber photometry, we showed that enkephalinergic neurons are activated by stress exposure, both experimenter handling and fox odor, thereby adding more evidence to suggest that enkephalinergic neurons are activated by stress exposure, which could explain the heightened peptide levels at the beginning of microdialysis experiments. Repeated experimenter handling led to repeated activation of enkephalinergic neurons. However, fox odor exposure showed significant attenuation after the first exposure. This is consistent with prior studies showing fast habituation to olfactory stimuli in rodents after initial exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apfelbach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endres and Fendt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farmer-Dougan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sundberg et al., 1982</xref>). We also showed using fiber photometry that the novelty of the introduction of a foreign object to the cage, before adding fox odor, was sufficient to activate enkephalinergic neurons. This is consistent with the object being a stressor as it is newly introduced to the home cage. Alternatively, it could also mean that the stress response is more nuanced and is impacted by the novelty of the stressor. This is an area of interest to our group, and we will design future experiments to disentangle the novelty from the stressor in order to understand the enkephalinergic system better. Given that previous studies implicating enkephalins in stress used mRNA transcript measurements of proenkephalin, it was not possible to determine whether Leu- and/or Met-Enk were involved in the acute stress response. Our study suggests that both peptides are involved in experimenter handling stress; however, this is less clear following exposure to fox odor, where Met-Enk appears to be primarily involved. Most of our experiments with fox odor do not show Leu-Enk release; however, that could be due to Leu-Enk levels being below the LLOQ since we have demonstrated that it is three times lower than Met-Enk. Fourth, we show that Met- and Leu-Enk are released during acute stress in the NAcSh, offering evidence for their role in gating the stress response, which was suggested based on studies of enkephalins in the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valentino and Van Bockstaele, 2015</xref>). Therefore, combined with other studies, our work suggests that the role of enkephalins in stress is generalizable to other brain regions, namely the ventral striatum. Based on our findings, it remains unclear how enkephalins modulate the stress response. It will be interesting to investigate whether enkephalinergic signaling modulates stress coping behaviors. Future studies will focus on determining the effect of the local release of Met- and Leu-Enk in the NAcSh on responses to stress in rodents.</p><p>Finally, when a limited amount of peptide is released over time, we show that peptide release is biologically constrained and can be experimentally driven using high K<sup>+</sup> buffer or photo- or chemogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Hasani et al., 2018</xref>). We also show that data from fiber photometry corroborate peptide release data; however, fiber photometry does not offer the necessary specificity to correlate activation with release, or the distinction between different peptides that arise from the same precursor molecule. Additionally, it is important to stress that our fiber photometry studies used a calcium sensor as a proxy for neuronal activity, and the temporal scale was on the order of seconds. A recent study using an opioid-peptide fluorescent sensor shows temporal scales on the order of minutes, which mirrors microdialysis timelines for neuropeptide detection and offers evidence that neuropeptide dynamics are generally much slower than neurotransmitters in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2021</xref>). In conclusion, this improved peptide detection method enables biological advances through an optimized approach for Met- and Leu-Enk detection in vivo with broad applicability to other neuropeptides.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The outlet line directly collected sample in a tube that is kept at 4Â°C throughout the experiment. The flow of aCSF was then turned on, and sample collection time started as the sample began to collect in the outlet tube. The flow rate of aCSF was set to 0.8 Î¼L/min during sample collection. Fractions were collected every 13 min, resulting in a 10 Î¼L sample. After each collection, the samples were spiked with 2 Î¼L of 12.5 fmol isotopically labeled Met-Enk and Leu-Enk. The microdialysis rig (BASI Raturn MD 1404) was equipped with bedding, regular mouse chow, and water ad libitum. While connected to the perfusion lines, the mice were allowed to move freely. For the experiments measuring evoked release, the high K<sup>+</sup> Ringerâs solution was perfused through the lines instead of aCSF at 0.8 Î¼L/min, and fractions were collected every 13 min as described previously.

This was followed by a rinse in 0.1% FA (vol/vol) and a 2 min spin at 3000 rpm. The final rinse was done by adding 100 Î¼L of 1% FA (vol/vol) to each of the stage tips. Following the final rinse, the samples were added to the C18 stage tips and spun for 10 min at 0.8 rpm. After ensuring that the samples passed through the stage tips, the samples were desalted with 0.1% FA (vol/vol) and spun for 1.5 min at 3000 rpm twice. After the spins were done, the stage tips were directly placed into autosampler vials to elute the analyte with 60 Î¼L of 50% MeCN, 0.1% FA (vol/vol) using a syringe. Eluates in the autosampler vial were dried in a SpeedVac, reconstituted in 3 Î¼L 1% FA (vol/vol), and set up on the autosampler for injection on the mass spectrometer.</p><sec id="s4-4-2-2-1"><title>nLC-MS/MS</title><p>The samples in FA (1%) were loaded (2.5 ÂµL) onto a 75 Âµm i.d. Ã 50 cm Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 RSLC column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an EASY <italic>nano</italic>LC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a constant pressure of 700 bar at 100% A (1% FA). Prior to sample loading, the column was equilibrated to 100% A for a total of 11 ÂµL at 700 bar pressure. Peptide chromatography was initiated with mobile phase A (1% FA) containing 5% B (100% MeCN, 1% FA) for 1 min, then increased to 20% B over 19 min, to 32% B over 10 min, to 95% B over 1 min and held at 95% B for 19 min, with a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The data was acquired in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode. The full-scan mass spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a scan range of m/z=150â1500 and a mass resolving power set to 70,000. DIA high-energy collisional dissociations were performed according to the inclusion list with a mass resolving power set to 17,500, an isolation width of 2 Da, and a normalized collision energy setting of 27. The maximum injection time was 60 ms for parent-ion analysis and product-ion analysis. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set at a target value of 3e6 ions for full MS scans and 2e5 ions for MS2. The inclusion list contained four peptide entries. The loop count was set at 30. Retention time windows were set at 20 min. Each sample was run in two technical replicates, and the peak area ratio was averaged before concentration calculations of the peptides were conducted. Several quality control steps were conducted prior to running the in vivo samples. (1) Two technical replicates of a known concentration were injected and analyzed â an example table from four random experiments included in this manuscript is shown below. (2) The buffers used on the day of the experiment (aCSF and high K<sup>+</sup> buffer) were also tested for any contaminating Met-Enk or Leu-Enk signals by injecting two technical replicates for each buffer. Once these two criteria were met, the experiment was analyzed through the system. If step 1 failed, which happened a few times, the samples were frozen, and the machines were cleaned and restarted until the quality control measures were met. If step 2 failed, the samples were considered contaminated and not processed as part of the study. This quality control procedure was predetermined.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Injected conc (aM)</th><th align="left" valign="top">QC before ME (aM)</th><th align="left" valign="top">QC after ME (aM)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Mean</th><th align="left" valign="top">STDEV</th><th align="left" valign="top">QC before LE (aM)</th><th align="left" valign="top">QC after LE (aM)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Mean</th><th align="left" valign="top">STDEV</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">25 fM</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">28</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">32</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">30.000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.82842712</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">40</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">36</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">38</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.82842712</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">40 aM</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">44</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">41</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">42.500</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.12132034</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">53</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">50</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">51.5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.12132034</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">40 aM</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">54</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">51</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">52.500</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.12132034</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">51</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">55</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">53</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.82842712</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">40 aM</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">42</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">41</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">41.500</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.70710678</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">43</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">45</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">44</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1.41421356</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Stable isotope dilution assay for measurement of enkephalins</title><p>Peptides were synthesized as high-purity natural abundance and stable isotope-labeled pairs for the development of a targeted proteomics method for enkephalins.

During the surgery, the isoflurane level was kept at 1.5â2%. Then, we performed a craniotomy and unilaterally injected 200â250 nL of AAV5.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 using a Nanoject III (Drummond) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) (Addgene: 100845-AAV5) at the following coordinates: +1.3 [AP], Â±0.5 [ML], â5.0 mm [DV]. To allow for viral expression, the fiber photometry probes (5 mm shaft length, doric lenses) were implanted 3 weeks later at +1.3 [AP], Â±0.5 [ML], â4.75 mm [DV]. Implanted probes were secured with dental adhesive (C&amp;B Metabond kit) followed by cyanoacrylate (Loctite Super Glue Gel Control).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-2"><title>Fiber photometry recording procedure</title><p>Before recording, the implanted probes were tethered to an optic fiber using a ferrule sleeve (Doric, catalog no. ZR_2.5). Two light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used to excite GCaMP6s. A 331 Hz sinusoidal LED light (Doric) of wavelength 470 nm 470âÂ±â20 nm was used for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal. A 210 Hz sinusoidal LED light of wavelength 405âÂ±â10 nm (Doric, LED driver) was used to evoke the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signal and serve as the isosbestic control. GCaMP6s fluorescence traveled through the same optic fiber before being bandpass filtered (525âÂ±â25 nm, Doric, catalog no. FMC4), transduced by a femtowatt photoreceiver (New Focus Model 2151) and recorded by a real-time processor (TDT, RZ5P). The signals were extracted by the Synapse software (TDT). During the recording, two behavioral manipulations were introduced. The first was after a 10 min recording in a home cage environment. An experimenter handled the mouse while the recording was ongoing. The handling bout which mimicked traditional scruffing lasted about 3â5 s. The mouse was then let go, and the handling was repeated another two times in a single session with a minimum of 1â2 min between handling bouts. Mice were habituated to this manipulation by being attached to the fiber photometry rig for 3â5 consecutive days prior to the experimental recording. Additionally, the same maneuver was employed when attaching/detaching the fiber photometry cord, so the mice were subjected to the same process several times. The second behavioral manipulation was introduced to the same mice a week after the first recording session. After a 10 min recording in the home cage environment, a weigh boat containing a kim wipe that had absorbed 3 mL of fox urine was placed in the cage as the recording proceeded. The weigh boat was removed after a minute of exploration, then reintroduced into the cage for another two times, separated by 5 min from the last exposure, during the session. In a subset of the animals (five of nine), the fox urine exposure was preceded by water exposure following the same process described above in the same recording session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-3"><title>Fiber photometry data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed through the Python toolbox GuPPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherathiya et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, the isosbestic control signal was used to correct for motion and photobleaching artifacts. The control channel is fitted to the signal channel using a least squares polynomial fit of degree 1. Transient detection occurred after using a 15 s moving window for thresholding transients. Then, high-amplitude events were identified, and their timestamp of occurrence during the session was reported. To determine the effect of handling or fox urine exposure on enkephalinergic cell activity, the event timestamp was used to observe changes in activity before and after the behavioral manipulation. The average of all trials is then calculated for repeated exposures and for exposures in multiple animals. The fiber photometry data was represented as z-scores.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry and verification of probe placement</title><p>After the completion of the experiment, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. After the perfusion, brains were dissected and fixed for 24 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4Â°C and then placed in 30% sucrose solution for cryoprotection for a minimum of 48 hr. The brains were then sliced into 30 Âµm sections, washed three times in PBS, and blocked in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum for 1 hr. Following the blocking step, the slices were stained for the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte marker to determine glial scarring around the probe site (guinea pig anti-GFAP, synaptic systems) at 1:500 dilution and incubated at 4Â°C for 16 hr. The next day, the sections were washed three times with PBS and stained with the secondary antibody, mouse anti-guinea pig, Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) at 1:500 dilution and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. After the incubation, the slices were washed three times in PBS, followed by two washes with PB. Finally, the slices were mounted on glass slides with HardSet Vectashield with DAPI staining (Vector Labs) and imaged using an epifluorescence microscope (Leica DM6 B). Correct probe placement in the NAcSh is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>. For the verification of the injection and probe placement for fiber photometry, the same procedure described above was performed for tissue preparation. After slicing, the slices were washed in a 0.1% Triton for 1 hr in order to permeabilize the cells, followed by two 10 min PBS washes. The slices were then stained with NeuroTrace (Nissl) red (Invitrogen) to mark neurons by adding 5 Î¼L to each well for 2 hr at room temperature, followed by three 10 min PBS washes and three 10 min PB washes. Finally, the slices were mounted using HardSet Vectashield (Vector Labs). GCaMP6s expression was determined by observing green fluorescent protein expression colocalized with NeuroTrace staining. Correct probe placement in the NAcSh is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>. For misses in probe or viral placement, the data was not included in the manuscript as we only intended to obtain measurements from the NAcSh. This exclusion criterion was predetermined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We performed simple linear regression analysis on the forward and reverse curves and reported the line equations. For the forward curves, the regression was applied to the measured concentration of the light standard as the theoretical concentration was increased. For plotting purposes, we show the measured peak area ratios for the light standards in the forward curves. For the reverse curves, the regression was applied to the measured concentration of the heavy standard, as the theoretical concentration was varied. The proteomics data is represented as violin plots with individual points depicted and dashed lines indicating quartiles. The middle-dashed lines represent the median. The violin plots were created using GraphPad Prism. The data was log<sub>10</sub> transformed to reduce the skewness of the dataset caused by the variable range of concentrations measured across experiments/animals. Prior to log transformation, the measurements failed normality testing for a Gaussian distribution. After the log transformation, the data passed normality testing, which provided the rationale for the use of statistical analyses that assume normality. Two-way ANOVA testing with peptide (Met-Enk or Leu-Enk) and treatment (buffer or stress, for example) as the two independent variables. Post hoc testing was done using Å Ã­dÃ¡kâs multiple comparisons test, and the p-values for each of these analyses are shown in the figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). A paired t-test was performed on the predator odor proteomic data before and after odor exposure to test the hypothesis that Met-Enk increases following exposure to predator odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism. To determine the linear relationship between the levels of Met-Enk to Leu-Enk in the same samples, we conducted simple linear regression analysis and reported the slopes of the lines. This is based on prior literature positing a relatively fixed ratio of Met-Enk to Leu-Enk, and we corroborate that here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Comb et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hughes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson et al., 1978</xref>). For the fiber photometry data, the z-scores were calculated as described in using GuPPy, which is an open-source Python toolbox for fiber photometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherathiya et al., 2021</xref>). The z-score equation used in GuPPy is z=(ÎF/F-(mean of ÎF/F)/standard deviation of ÎF/F), where F refers to fluorescence of the GCaMP6s signal. For the averaged plots depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, z-scores from all individual animals were averaged and shown as one trace with the SEM as the highlighted area. The purpose of the averaged traces is to show the extent of concordance of the response to experimenter handling and predator odor stress among animals, with the SEM demonstrating that variability. The heatmaps depict the individual responses of each animal. The heatmaps were plotted using Seaborn in Python, and mean traces were plotted using Matplotlib in Python.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All surgical and behavioral procedures were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine animal care guidelines in accordance with federal animal use regulations IACUC protocol #23-0261.

The authors refine their pipeline to measure met and leu enkephalin using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The authors subsequently measure met and leu enkephalin in the NAc during stress induced by handling and fox urine, in addition to calcium activity of enkephalinergic cells using fiber photometry. The authors conclude that this improved tool for measuring enkephalin reveals experimenter handling stress-induced enkephalin release in the NAc that habituates and is dissociable from calcium activity of these cells, whose activity doesn't habituate. The authors subsequently show that NAc enkephalin neuron calcium activity does habituate to fox urine exposure, is activated by a novel weigh boat, and that fox urine acutely causes increases in met-enk levels, in some animals, as assessed by microdialysis. This study highlights a new approach to monitor two distinct enkephalins and more robust analytical approach for more sensitive detection of neuropeptides. The authors also provide a pipeline that potentially could aid in detection of other neuropeptides and increase our understanding of endogenous opioid neuropeptidergic control in health and disease.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91609.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aimed to improve the detection of enkephalins, opioid peptides involved in pain modulation, reward, and stress.

The authors refine their pipeline to measure met and leu enkephalin using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The authors subsequently measured met and leu enkephalin in the NAc during stress induced by handling, and fox urine, in addition to calcium activity of enkephalinergic cells using fiber photometry. The authors conclude that this improved tool for measuring enkephalin reveals experimenter handling stress-induced enkephalin release in the NAc that habituates and is dissociable from the calcium activity of these cells, whose activity doesn't habituate.

The use of hydrogen peroxide reaction for the oxidation of Met-Enk in various biological samples, including brain regions, has been reported previously, although the protocols may slightly vary. Specifically, the manuscript writes about &quot;a critical discovery in the stabilization of enkephalin detection&quot; and that they have &quot;developed a method of methionine stabilization.&quot; Those statements are incorrect and the preceding papers that relied on hydrogen peroxide reaction for oxidation of Met-Enk and HPLC for quantification of oxidized Enk forms should be cited.

Explain how Met- and Leu-Enk were identified from DIA data, and what tools were used.</p><p>Thank you for pointing out this source of confusion. We believe it is because we use a different DIA method than is typically used in other literature. Briefly, we use a DIA method with the targeted inclusion list to ensure MS2 triggering as opposed to using large isolation widths to capture all precursors for fragmentation, as is typically done with MS1 features. For our method, MS2 is triggered based on the 4 selected m/z values (heavy and light versions of Leu and Met-Enkephalin peptides) at specific retention time windows with isolation width of 2 Da; regardless of the intensity of MS1 of the peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Simple Linear Regression Analysis: The text mentions that simple linear regression analysis was performed on forward and reverse curves, and line equations were reported, but it lacks details such as the specific variables being regressed (although figures have labels) and any associated statistical parameters (e.g., R-squared values).</p></disp-quote><p>Additional detail about the linear regression process was added to the methods section, please see lines 614-618.

Leu enk increases to the range of met-enk. There is non-detectable or approaching being non-detectable leu-enk (below the 40 amol / sample limit of quantification) in most of the subjects that become apparent and approach basal levels of met-enkephalin. This suggests that the K+ evoked response may be more pronounced for leu-enk. This is something that should be considered for further analysis and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this astute observation, and you make a great point. We have added some discussion of this finding in the results and discussion sections see lines 111112 and lines 253-257.</p><p>âInterestingly, Leu-Enk showed a greater fold change compared to baseline than did Met-Enk with the fold changes being 28 and 7 respectively based on the data in Fig.1F.â</p><p>âWe also noted that Leu-Enk showed a greater fold increase relative to baseline after depolarization with high K+ buffer as compared to Met-Enk. This may be due to increased Leu-Enk packaging in dense core vesicles compared to Met-Enk or due to the fact that there are two distinct precursor sources for Leu-Enk, namely both proenkephalin and prodynorphin while Met-Enk is mostly cleaved from proenkephalin (see Table 1 [48]).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ For example in 2E, it would be helpful to label in the graph axis what samples correspond to the manipulation and also in the text provide the reader with the sample numbers. The authors interpret the relationship between the last two samples of baseline and posthandling stress as the following in the figure legend &quot;the concentration released in later samples is affected; such influence suggests that there is regulation of the maximum amount of peptide to be released in NAcSh. E. The negative correlation in panel d is reversed by using a high K+ buffer to evoke Met-Enk release, suggesting that the limited release observed in D is due to modulation of peptide release rather than depletion of reserves.&quot; However, the correlations are similar between 2D and E and it appears that two mice are mediating the difference between the two groups. The appropriate statistical analysis would be to compare the regressions of the two groups. Statistics for the high K+ (and all other graphs where appropriate) need to be reported, including the r2 and p-value.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive critique. To elucidate the effect of high K+, we have plotted the regression line and reported the slope for Fig. 2E. Notably, the slope is reduced by a factor of 2 and appears to be driven by a large subset of the animals. The statistics for the high K+ graph are shown on the figure (Fig 1F) which test the hypothesis of whether high K+ leads to the release of Leu-Enk and Met-Enk respectively compared to baseline with aCSF. We have added the test statistics to the figure legend for additional clarity. Fig. 1G has no statistics because it is only there to elucidate the ratio between Met-Enk and Leu-Enk in the same samples. We did not test any hypotheses related to whether there are differences between their levels as that is not relevant to our question. The correlation on the same data is depicted in Fig. 1H, and we have added the R<sup>2</sup> value per your request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ The interpretation that handling stress induces enkephalin release from microdialysis experiments is also confounded by other factors. For instance, from the methods, it appears that mice were connected and sample collection started 30 min after surgery, therefore recovery from anesthesia is also a confounding variable, among other technical aspects, such as equilibration of the interstitial fluid to the aCSF running through the probe that is acting as a transmitter and extracellular molecule &quot;sink&quot;. Did the authors try to handle the mice post hookup similar to what was done with photometry to have a more direct comparison to photometry experiments? This procedural difference, recording from recently surgerized animals (microdialysis) vs well-recovered animals with photometry should be mentioned in addition to the other caveats the authors mention.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We are aware of this technical limitation, and it is largely why we sought to conduct the fiber photometry experiments to get at the same question. As you requested, we have included additional language in the discussion to acknowledge this limitation and how we chose to address it by measuring calcium activity in the enkephalinergic neurons, which would presumably be the same cell population whose release we are quantifying using microdialysis. See lines 262-273.</p><p>âOur findings showed a robust increase in peptide release at the beginning of experiments, which we interpreted as due to experimenter handling stress that directly precedes microdialysis collections. However, there are other technical limitations to consider such as the fact that we were collecting samples from mice that were recently operated on. Another consideration is that the circulation of aCSF through the probe may cause a sudden shift in oncotic and hydrostatic forces, leading to increased peptide release to the extracellular space. As such, we wanted to examine our findings using a different technique, so we chose to record calcium activity from enkephalinergic neurons - the same cell population leading to peptide release. Using fiber photometry, we showed that enkephalinergic neurons are activated by stress exposure, both experimenter handling and fox odor, thereby adding more evidence to suggest that enkephalinergic neurons are activated by stress exposure which could explain the heightened peptide levels at the beginning of microdialysis experiments.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ The authors should provide more details on handling stress manipulation during photometry.

The mouse was then let go and the handling was repeated another two times in a single session with a minimum of 1-2 minutes between handling bouts.

Additionally, the same maneuver was employed when attaching/detaching the fiber photometry cord, so the mice were subjected to the same process several times.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ For the novel weigh boat experiments, the authors should explicitly state when these experiments were done in relation to the fox urine, was it a different session or the same session? Were they the same animals? Statements like the following (line 251) imply it was done in the same animals in the same session but it should be clarified in the methods &quot;We also showed using fiber photometry that the novelty of the introduction of a foreign object to the cage, before adding fox odor, was sufficient to activate enkephalinergic neurons.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in supplementary figure 4, individual animal data is shown for both water and fox urine exposure (overlaid) to depict whether there were differences in their responses to each manipulation â in the same animal. And yes, you are correct, the animals were first exposed to water 3 times in the recording session and then exposed to fox urine 3 times in the same session. We have added that to the methods section describing in vivo fiber photometry. See lines 575-576.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Statistical testing would be needed to affirm the conclusions the authors draw from the fox urine and novel weigh boat experiments. For example, it shows stats that the response attenuates, that it is not different between fox urine and novel (it looks like the response is stronger to the fox urine when looking at the individual animals), etc. These data look clear but stats are formally needed. Formal statistics are also missing in other parts of the manuscript where conclusions are drawn from the data but direct statistical comparisons are not included (e.g. Fig 2.G-I).</p></disp-quote><p>The photometry data is shown as z-scores which is a formal statistical analysis. ANOVA would be inappropriate to run to compare z-scores. We understand that this is erroneously done in fiber photometry literature, however, it remains incorrect. The z-scores alone provide all the information needed about the deviation from baseline. We understand that this is not immediately clear to readers, and we thank you for allowing us to explain why this is the case. We have added test statistics to figure legends where hypothesis testing was done and <italic>p</italic>-values were reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Did the authors try to present the animals with repeated fox urine exposure to see if this habituates like the photometry?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we did not do that experiment due to the constrained timing within which we had to run our microdialysis/LC-MS timeline, but it is a great point for future exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ It would be useful to present the time course of the odor experiment for the microdialysis experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>The timeline is shown in Fig.1a and Fig.3e. To reiterate, each sample is 13 minutes long.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Can the authors determine if differences in behavior (e.g. excessive avoidance in animals with with one type of response) or microdialysis probe location dictate whether animals fall into categories of increased release, no release, or no-detection? From the breakdown, it looks like it is almost equally split into three parts but the authors' descriptions of this split are somewhat misleading (line 210). &quot; The response to predator odor varies appreciably: although most animals show increased Met-Enk release after fox odor exposure, some show continued release with no elevation in Met-Enk levels, and a minority show no detectable release&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive feedback. We do not believe the difference in behavior is correlated with probe placement. The hit map can be found in suppl. Fig 3 and shows that all mice included in the manuscript had probes in the NAcSh. We purposely did not distinguish between dorsal and ventral because of our 1 mm membrane would make it hard to presume exclusive sampling from one subregion. That is a great point though, and we have thought about it extensively for future studies. We have edited the language to reflect the almost even split of responses for Met-Enk and appreciate you pointing that out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Overall, given the inconsistencies in experimental design and overall caveats associated, I think the authors are unable to draw reasonable conclusions from the repeated stressor experiments and something they should either consider is not trying to draw strong conclusions from these observations or perform additional experiments that provide the grounds to derive those conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional language on the caveats of our study, and our use of a dual approach using fiber photometry and microdialysis was largely driven by a</p><p>desire to offer additional support of our conclusions. We expected pushback about our conclusions, so we wanted to offer a secondary analysis using a different technique to test our hypothesis. To be honest the tone of this comment and content is not particularly constructive (especially for trainees) nor does it offer a space to realistically address anything. This work took multiple years to optimize, it was led by a graduate student, and required a multidisciplinary team. As highlighted, we believe it offers an important contribution to the literature and pushes the field of peptide detection forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A more comprehensive and objective interpretation of results could enhance the overall quality of the paper. The manuscript contains statements like &quot;we are the first to confirm,&quot; which can be challenging to substantiate and may not significantly enhance the paper. It's essential to ensure that novelty statements are well-founded. For example, the release of enkephalins from other brain regions after stress exposure is well-documented but not addressed in the paper. Similarly, the role of the NA shell in stress has been extensively studied but lacks coverage in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the language to reflect your feedback. We have also included relevant literature expanding on the demonstrated roles of enkephalins in the literature. We would like to note that most studies have focused on chronic stress, and we were particularly interested in acute stress. See lines 129-134.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>âThese studies have included regions such as the locus coeruleus, the ventral medulla, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the nucleus accumbens core and shell. Studies using global knockout of enkephalins have shown varying responses to chronic stress interventions where male knockout mice showed resistance to chronic mild stress in one study, while another study showed that enkephalin-knockout mice showed delayed termination of corticosteroid release. [33,34]â</p><p>Finally, not a weakness but a clarification suggestion: the method description mentions the use of 1% FA in the sample reconstitution solution and LC solvents, which is an unusually high concentration of acid. If this concentration is intentional for maintaining the peptides' oxidation state, it would be beneficial to mention this in the text to assist readers who might want to replicate the method.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct and has been clarified in the methods section</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>-The Abstract should state the critical improvements that are made. Also, quantify the improvements in spatiotemporal resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have edited the abstract to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The use of &quot;amol/sample&quot; as concentration is less informative than an SI units (e.g., pM concentration) and should be changed. Especially since the volume used was the same for in vivo sampling experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We chose to report amol/sample because we are measuring such a small concentration and wanted to account for any slight errors in volume that can make drastic differences on reported concentrations especially since samples are dried and resuspended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Please check this sentence: &quot;After each collection, the samples were spiked with 2 ÂµL of 12.5 fM isotopically labeled Met-Enkephalin and Leu-Enkephalin&quot; This dilution would yield a concentration of ~2 fM. In a 12 uL sample, that would be ~0.02 amol, well below the detection limit. (note that fM would femtomolar concentration and fmol would be femtomoles added).</p><p>-&quot;liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) [9-12]&quot;... Reference 9 is a RIA analysis paper, not LC-MS as stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching these. We have corrected the unit and citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Given that improvements in temporal resolution are claimed, the lack of time course data with a time axis is surprising. Rather, data for baseline and during treatment appear to be combined in different plots. Time course plots of individuals and group averages would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the expected variability between individual animal time course data, where for example, we measure detectable levels in one sample followed by no detection, it was very difficult to combine data across time. Therefore, to maximize data inclusion from all animals that showed baseline measurements and responses to individual manipulations, we opted to report snapshot data. Our improvement in temporal resolution refers to the duration of each sample rather than continuous sampling, so those two are unrelated. Thank you for your feedback and allowing us to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I do not understand this claim &quot;We use custom-made microdialysis probes, intentionally modified so they are similar in size to commonly used fiber photometry probes to avoid extensive tissue damage caused by traditional microdialysis probes (Fig. 1B).&quot; The probes used are 320 um OD and 1 mm long. This is not an uncommon size of microdialysis probes and indeed many are smaller, so is their probe really causing less damage than traditional probes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We are only trying to make the point that the tissue damage from these probes is comparable to commonly used fiber photometry probes. We only point that out because tissue damage is used as a point to dissuade the usage of microdialysis in some literature, and we just wanted to disambiguate that. We have clarified the statement you pointed out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The oxidation procedure is a good idea, as mentioned above. It would be interesting to compare met-enk with and without the oxidation procedure to see how much it affects the result (I would not say this is necessary though). It is not uncommon to add antioxidants to avoid losses like this. Also, it should be acknowledged that the treatment does prevent the detection of any in vivo oxidation, perhaps that is important in met-enk metabolism?</p></disp-quote><p>The comparison between oxidized and unoxidized Met-Enk detection is in figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-It would be a best practice to report the standard deviation of signal for technical replicates (say near in vivo concentrations) of standards and repeated analysis of a dialysate sample to be able to understand the variability associated with this method. Similarly, an averaged basal concentration from all rats.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have included a table showing example quality control standard injections from 4 randomly selected experiments included in the manuscript that were run before and after each experiment and descriptive statistics associated with these technical replicates. We also added some detail to the methods section to describe how quality control is done. See lines 521-530.</p><p>âEach sample was run in two technical replicates and the peak area ratio was averaged before concentration calculations of the peptides were conducted. Several quality control steps were conducted prior to running the in vivo samples. (1) Two technical replicates of a known concentration were injected and analyzed â an example table from 4 random experiments included in this manuscript is shown below. (2) The buffers used on the day of the experiment (aCSF and high K+ buffer) were also tested for any contaminating Met-Enk or Leu-Enk signals by injecting two technical replicates for each buffer. Once these two criteria were met, the experiment was analyzed through the system. If either step failed, which happened a few times, the samples were frozen and the machines were cleaned and restarted until the quality control measures were met.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EDITORS NOTE</p><p>Should you choose to revise your manuscript, please include full statistical reporting including exact p-values wherever possible alongside the summary statistics (test statistic and df) and 95% confidence intervals.
