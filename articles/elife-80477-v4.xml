Transcriptional regulation of DC development had been one of the major research interests in DC biology; however, the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms during DC development remains unclear. Here, we report that <italic>Histone deacetylase 3</italic> (<italic>Hdac3</italic>), an important epigenetic regulator, is highly expressed in pDCs, and its deficiency profoundly impaired the development of pDCs. Significant disturbance of homeostasis of hematopoietic progenitors was also observed in HDAC3-deficient mice, manifested by altered cell numbers of these progenitors and defective differentiation potentials for pDCs. Using the in vitro Flt3L supplemented DC culture system, we further demonstrated that HDAC3 was required for the differentiation of pDCs from progenitors at all developmental stages. Mechanistically, HDAC3 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of cDC1-associated genes, owing to markedly elevated H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at these gene sites in BM pDCs. In contrast, the expression of pDC-associated genes was significantly downregulated, leading to defective pDC differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pDC development</kwd><kwd>histone deacetylase 3</kwd><kwd>H3K27ac</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Key Research Project 2019YFA0508502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31991174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31800769</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Key Research Project 2022YFC2505001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Center of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82388101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HDAC3 regulates the development of pDCs and maintenance of homeostasis of hematopoietic progenitors with dendritic cell (DC) differentiation potential, mechanistically by repressing cDC1 associated genes in a deacetylase-dependent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential regulators of immune responses. Major DC subsets include conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). cDCs are professional antigen-presenting cells that are critical for initiation of antigen specific adaptive immunity and induction of immune tolerance. pDCs are the major producers of large amounts of type I interferon (IFN) during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reizis, 2019</xref>). In the past decades, the knowledge on the cytokines, transcription factors, and progenitors involved in DC development had been obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nutt and Chopin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). However, the role of epigenetic regulation in DC lineage determination and differentiation remains elusive.</p><p>The ultimate origin of DCs is the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which give rise to multipotent progenitors (MPPs) with potential to populate entire hematopoietic system. MPPs produce common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), which give rise to lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells, respectively. Both CLPs and CMPs have the potential to differentiate into DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sathe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Amico and Wu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chicha et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manz et al., 2001</xref>). CMPs further develop into common DC precursors (CDPs) with restricted potential for DC lineage differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Naik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Onai et al., 2007</xref>), CDPs differentiate into pDCs and pre-cDCs in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu and Nussenzweig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puhr et al., 2015</xref>). The CD115<sup>−</sup>CDP subsets predominantly produce pDCs, while CD115<sup>+</sup>CDP subsets produce more cDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Onai et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the Siglec H<sup>+</sup>Ly6D<sup>+</sup> subset of LPs (CLPs) exhibits a specific potential to differentiate towards pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodrigues et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dress et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several transcription factors and key regulators have been identified to play important roles in pDC development. Transcription factor TCF4 (E2-2) is highly expressed in pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagasawa et al., 2008</xref>). Deletion of TCF4 disrupts the development and function of pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cisse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>). The development of pDCs also requires PU.1, MTG16, ZEB2, and BCL11A, while expression of ID2 should be repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schlitzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carotta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ippolito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Luc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagasawa et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a key epigenetic regulator orchestrating histone modification and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emmett and Lazar, 2019</xref>). Previous studies show that HDAC3 regulates stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Summers et al., 2013</xref>), T and B lymphocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stengel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stengel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stengel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Philips et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>), and the function of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Generation of DCs in vitro in the presence of pan-HDAC inhibitors reveals that HDAC family members are required for establishing a DC gene network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chauvistré et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remains unknown which HDAC family member plays the major role in the development of DCs.</p><p>In this study, we observed a higher expression of <italic>Hdac3</italic> in pDCs compared to that in cDCs. Moreover, the development of pDCs was impaired in HDAC3-deficient mice, mainly due to the altered differentiation potential of pDCs in the HDAC3-deficient DC progenitors. Mechanistically, HDAC3 was required for repressing the H3K27ac level at cDC1-associated gene loci such as <italic>Zfp366</italic>, <italic>Batf3</italic> and <italic>Zbtb46,</italic> etc., thereby repressing the expression of cDC1-associated genes and promoting the differentiation towards pDCs. Together, our study revealed a crucial role of HDAC3 in regulating the development of pDCs from multiple hematopoietic progenitors with DC differentiation potential, and the histone deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is required for this process. Our findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for pDC development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HDAC3 deficiency resulted in defective development of pDCs</title><p>Genome-wide expression dataset ImmGen reveals that among class I HDACs, <italic>Hdac1</italic>, <italic>Hdac2,</italic> and <italic>Hdac3</italic> but not <italic>Hdac8</italic> are highly expressed by most immune cells. <italic>Hdac3</italic> is highly expressed in hematopoietic progenitors such as HSCs and CLP, and pDCs in spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, <italic>Hdac3</italic> expression in sorted DC subsets analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that pDCs expressed significantly higher levels of <italic>Hdac3</italic> than cDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, we speculated that <italic>Hdac3</italic> might play important roles in pDC development or function.</p><p>To test the role of HDAC3 in pDC development, <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were crossed with <italic>Rosa26</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice to generate HDAC3 conditional knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice and <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> controls mice were treated with Tamoxifen (intraperitoneal injection, i.p.) for 5 consecutive days and DC subsets were analyzed 7 days after the last tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Murine pDCs express intermediate levels of CD11c, high levels of B220, CD45RA, Ly6C, and can be defined by specific markers such as Siglec H and PDCA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Compared to <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice showed substantially reduced pDCs and the absolute number decreased about fourfold in BM and spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). CD11c<sup>hi</sup> cDCs were also slightly decreased, especially the CD24<sup>+</sup>CD172α<sup>−</sup> cDC1s, whereas the absolute numbers of CD24<sup>−</sup>CD172α<sup>+</sup> cDC2s were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To further confirm the number of pDC was reduced, additional pDC surface markers PDCA-1, Ly6C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), B220 and Ly6D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) were also applied to identify pDC population, and all showed consistent reduction in pDC numbers in BM and spleen of <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice. pDCs are the major producers of type-I IFN, consistent with the reduction of pDCs in BM and spleen of <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice, the production of IFN-α by <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> CreER<sup>T2</sup> bone marrow cells, splenocytes and splenic DCs were also decreased in response to type A CpG ODN stimulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Splenic cDC1 can also be identified using cell surface markers including XCR1 and CD8α. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, in accordance with cDC1 identified by CD24, the percentage of splenic cDC1 marked by XCR1 showed little difference in <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice compared with that of <italic>Hdac3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. However, the expression of CD8α significantly decreased in HDAC3-deficient splenic cDC1 cells.

To determine whether the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is important for its role in regulating pDC development, the HDAC3 selective inhibitor RGFP966 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malvaez et al., 2013</xref>) was added into FLT3L stimulated BM culture system. At low concentration, RGFP966 could efficiently inhibit the differentiation of pDCs but not for cDCs. At higher concentration, it exhibited cellular toxicity, evidenced by the dramatic reduction in total cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This result suggested that HDAC3 deacetylase activity was required preferentially for pDC development. The highly conserved tyrosine residue (Y298) in HDAC3 is located within the active site and is required for HDAC3 catalytic activity. HDAC3 (Y298F) mutant contains a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution at residue 298, which inactivates HDAC3 deacetylase catalytic activity but not the interaction with NCoR/SMRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).

The amount of HDAC3 (Y298F) protein was comparable to those of HDAC3 (WT) in each group.

Motif analysis of unique H3K27ac peaks in HDAC3-deficient pDCs showed that these regions were significantly enriched with motifs recognized by PU.1 (SPI1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggested that HDAC3 could repress cDC1-associated gene expression through histone deacetylation and thereby promoted the expression of pDC-associated genes and subsequent pDC development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified HDAC3 as a key epigenetic regulator for pDC development, evidenced by the absence of pDCs in BM and spleens of the HDAC3-deficient mice. Further investigation revealed that HDAC3 deficiency resulted in disturbed homeostasis of BM hematopoietic progenitors with DC differentiation potential. Moreover, we showed that HDAC3 was required for pDC differentiation from all early progenitors with DC differentiation potential. Mechanistic study by RNA-seq analysis comparing the gene expression profiles of the major progenitor populations and BM pDCs from HDAC3-deficient and control mice revealed significant downregulations of pDC-associated gene expression and upregulations of cDC1-associated genes. To further clarify how HDAC3 regulated the expression of these genes, we performed CUT&amp;Tag analysis and ChIP-qPCR analysis. The results suggested that HDAC3 regulated the acetylation of H3K27 at cDC1-associated gene loci, thereby repressed the expression of cDC1-associated genes and promoted the expression of pDC-associated genes and subsequent differentiation of the progenitors towards pDCs. Consistently, HDAC3 deficiency resulted in decreased expression of pDC-associated genes and profound defect in pDC development. Thus, our study revealed a novel epigenetic regulatory role of HDAC3 in pDC development.</p><p>The development of DCs from hematopoietic progenitors is precisely orchestrated. We observed that deletion of <italic>Hdac3</italic> resulted in marked decrease in the numbers of CMPs, CLPs and CD115<sup>+</sup>CDPs, which partially accounted for the reduced pDC generation, whereas the numbers of HDAC3-deficient LSKs, especially MPP2 and MPP3, were significantly increased. However, despite the increase in the numbers, their abilities to differentiate into pDCs were severely impaired. The reduction in the number of CLP and increase in the number of LSKs in HDAC3-deficient mice were in line with the results of the BrdU incorporation analysis that showed a reduced DNA replication in HDAC3-deficient CLPs and an increased DNA synthesis in HDAC3-deficient LSKs. The incorporation level of BrdU in HDAC3-deficient and control CD115<sup>+</sup>CDPs and CD115<sup>-</sup>CDPs were comparable, though the number of HDAC3-deficient CD115<sup>+</sup>CDPs was reduced. Considering that total number of CDPs did not change significantly, and a decrease of <italic>Csf1r</italic> (coding CD115) expression could be observed in RNA-seq analysis of the HDAC3-deficient CDPs. These results suggested that the reserved number of CD115<sup>-</sup>CDPs might be due to the downregulation of <italic>Csf1r</italic> expression in CD115<sup>+</sup>CDPs. Overall, these results suggested that HDAC3 regulated different hematopoietic progenitors with different regulator mechanisms.</p><p>Cell fate determination is a key process during cell development, in which transcription factors play important roles. Recent studies reported PU.1-DC-SCRIPT-IRF8 axis as an important transcriptional pathway that regulated the fate determination between pDC and cDC1. PU.1 can activate <italic>Zfp366</italic> (encodes DC-SCRIPT) expression and DC-SCRIPT enhanced the expression of <italic>Irf8</italic> and thereby promoted the development and function of cDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of DC-SCRIPT leads to defective differentiation of cDC1 and an enhanced development of pDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chopin et al., 2019</xref>). These studies demonstrated that cell fate determination of cDC1 versus pDC was regulated in a mutually restrictive manner. In line with this, we also observed in the BM chimeric mice that HDAC3-deficient BM cells generated decreased number of pDCs but increased number of cDC1 compared to that derived from wildtype BM 3 weeks after Tamoxifen treatment, suggesting that HDAC3 may be involved in the fate determination of pDCs versus cDC1. This was confirmed by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis of the residual HDAC3-deficient BM pDCs that showed down-regulation of pDC-signature genes such as <italic>Tcf4, Siglech</italic> and up-regulation of cDC1-associated genes, including <italic>Zfp366</italic>, <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Batf3</italic>, indicating that HDAC3 may promote pDC differentiation by repressing the expression of cDC1-associated genes. Further Cut &amp; Tag analysis indicated that HDAC3-KO resulted in enhanced H3K27ac on <italic>Zfp366</italic>, <italic>Zbtb46</italic> and <italic>Batf3</italic> loci, and ChIP-qPCR analysis verified the binding of HDAC3 on these sites.

Briefly, sorted BM pDCs were fixed using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and quenched with 10×glycine in the kit. Then cells were washed with PBS for 3 times and resuspended using ChIP lysis in the kit. After centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, the cells were the lyzed in digest buffer with proteinase inhibitor cocktail and phosSTOP (Roche, Switzerland) on ice. Then the cells were sonicated using Bioruptor Pico sonication device (Diagenode, Belgium) with 30 s on/ 30 s off for 5–6 cycles at 4 °C, and then add enzymatic shearing cocktail to the system and incubated at 37 °C for 8 min, reaction was stopped by adding of EDTA and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Before diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (with proteinase inhibitor cocktail and phosSTOP) appropriate volume of supernatant was collected as 20% Input. Then the sample were divided into two equal volumes and antibody of HDAC3 (85057 S, CST, USA) or normal rabbit IgG (2729 S, CST, USA) was added according to the antibody instruction and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Then 10 μl of pre-washed Magna ChIP Protein A+G Magnetic Beads (16–663, Millipore, USA) were added to each sample respectively and incubated for 2.5 hr. Then the beads were washed sequentially with low salt buffer, high salt buffer and TE buffer at 4 °C, the beads were then washed by TE buffer again and then remove the entire supernatant. Then the beads sample and input were added 172 μl TE buffer, 10 μl 10% SDS and 8 μl 5 M NaCl, and incubated at 65 °C overnight shaking vigorously. RNase A in the kit were then added and incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min followed by adding the proteinase K (20 mg/ml) to the system and incubated at 55 for 1 hr.

HDAC3 within the dendritic cell (DC) compartment by taking advantage of a tamoxifen-inducible ERT2-cre mouse model to report the dependency of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but not conventional DC (cDCs)s on HDAC3 at the common lymphoid progenitor stage during DC development. The methods are convincing and include RNA seq studies that identify multiple DC-specific target genes within the remaining pDCs, and the use of Cut and Tag technology to validate some of the identified targets of HDAC3. Taken together, this study shows the requirement of HDAC3 for pDCs but not for cDCs, congruent with the recent findings of a lymphoid origin of pDCs, and will be of great interest to immunologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80477.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rath</surname><given-names>Satyajit</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00djv2c17</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Tussiwand</surname><given-names>Roxane</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.08.494949">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.494949v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Roxane Tussiwand (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific points:</p><p>In Figure 2 the authors observe a relative increase of cDC and a decrease of pDCs. It is important to define the pre-gating strategy. To determine if there the decrease of pDCs reflects on the cDC increase, a mixed BM chimeras would be essential, such that both subsets can be compared in competitive settings. For this purpose the use of CD45.1-Cd45.2 and the intercross of CD45.1.2 heterozygous mouse might be suitable. (regarding the Mixed BM chimera done in Figure 4 please see comment below).</p><p>The reasoning that the defect is cell intrinsic is imprecise. The fact that HDAC3 is expressed on HSCs and CLPs could reflect a defect that is already present within the progenitor compartment. In light of the recent evidence that pDCs are mostly generated from lymphoid progenitors in BM, providing data for chimera experiments on B, T and NK cell reconstitution as well as a more detailed progenitor subset analysis would be helpful to determine at which stage the defect is most prominent.</p><p>Figure 3 LSKs are increased in numbers. Each pool of cells is defined by the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis rate. Therefore, all three parameters must be analyzed to define the reason for expansion or reduction. i.e. are HDAC cKO precursors undergoing increased proliferation? Is this a consequence of more cytokines availability due to the lack of other subsets, such as B cells? To achieve differentiation cells need to reduce proliferation and upregulate lineage specific programs. Is the increased abundance of stem cells related to the incapacity of downregulating proliferation and could this be the reason for impaired differentiation? The analysis of cell cycle stages within the progenitor compartment may be useful to address this aspect. In parallel to here performed BrDU pulse experiment a pulse and chase or a chase experiment may help further clarify. It will be nevertheless important to dissect all subsets more carefully given the broad expression of HDC3 across precursors</p><p>A more recent classification of progenitors could be used for HSCs and DC-progenitors:</p><p>- &quot;Pietras et al. 2015&quot; (MPP2 MPP3 and MPP4) and &quot;Klein et al. 2022&quot; Lymphoid committed (ESAM+ and ESAM- MPP4)</p><p>- cDC progenitors &quot;Durai et al. 2020 (CD226-preDC1)&quot;</p><p>- pre DC2 &quot;Grajales-Reyes GE 2015&quot; and &quot;Schlitzer A. 2015&quot;</p><p>Also analysis of competitive chimeras may help in dissecting the developmental defect resulting from HDAC3 deficiency.

Given that after tamoxifen treatment, Flt3 expression is almost completely absent on lymphoid progenitors it is likely that the cells are incapable to respond to Flt3-Flt3L instructive signal. Transduction of BM progenitors with Flt3R may allow to address this point.</p><p>Figure 3E. the gate shown will include auto florescent cells please use a better gating strategy for identifying CLPs.i.e include an auto florescent exclusion gate, see comment above on looking at MPP4s.</p><p>In Figure 4C CD115-CDPs are transplanted, this subset is not generating the necessary cells for the survival of lethally irradiated mice and indeed the reconstitution percentage is also for WT cells below 10%, suggesting that recipient mice are not lethally irradiated to allow for their survival and contribute to the hematopoietic compartment. Could you. Please specify if in this context mice were lethally or sublethally irradiated.</p><p>To avoid the confusion between recipient derived cells and donor derived WT cells I would suggest using, as mentioned above, CD45.1.2 heterozygous mice as WT donors or recipients.</p><p>The fact that HDAC3 deficiency results in a significant disadvantage of HSC reconstitution suggest that the defect is upstream any DC/pDC lineage specification.

In this study we defined pDCs and cDCs using the same pre-gating (Figure 4 and Figure 5).

However, in this particular experiment, we opted to construct the competitive BM chimeric mice by using CD45.1 mice as recipients, the CD45.2 mice (Hdac3-Ctrl and Hdac3-cKO) as donors, and the CD45.1 wild-type BM cells were used as competitors. Using this specific combination we could clearly distinguish the cells derived from CD45.2 donor BM cells within the chimeric mice, which allowed us to effectively compare the differentiation capacity of Hdac3-Ctrl and Hdac3-KO BM cells within the same competitive environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reasoning that the defect is cell intrinsic is imprecise.

The relevant description has been underlined in the revised manuscript Page 6 Line 153-154.</p><p>In this study, we found no significant changes in T cells, mature B cells or NK cells, but immature B cells were dramatically decreased, in Hdac3- ERT2-Cre mice after tamoxifen treatment (Figure 6).

The issues concerned by the reviewer have been well illustrated in the published work (Summers et al., 2013), where they have confirmed that HDAC3 is required for HSC homeostasis by regulating DNA replication. Consistently, our observations in BrdU and cell cycle analysis also demonstrated an increase in the number and proliferation rate of HSCs in <italic>Hdac3</italic> deficient mice (Figure 7), with a notable accumulation at the S phase of the cell cycle (Figure 8), and the increased cell number were mainly within MPP2 and MPP3., the progenitors for myeloid lineage differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A more recent classification of progenitors could be used for HSCs and DC-progenitors:</p><p>- &quot;Pietras et al. 2015&quot; (MPP2 MPP3 and MPP4) and &quot;Klein et al. 2022&quot; Lymphoid committed (ESAM+ and ESAM- MPP4)</p><p>- cDC progenitors &quot;Durai et al. 2020 (CD226-preDC1)&quot;</p><p>- pre DC2 &quot;Grajales-Reyes GE 2015&quot; and &quot;Schlitzer A. 2015&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the highly useful references recommended by the reviewer. Accordingly, we re-analyzed the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells by using the gating strategy described by &quot;Pietras et al. 2015”. The LT-HSC, ST-HSC, MPP2, MPP3, MPP4 and CLPs among lineage negative cells in bone marrow were gated separately. We found that LSK cells were increased in <italic>Hdac3</italic> deficient mice, especially the MPP2 and MPP3, whereas, no significant changes in MPP4 were observed. In contrast, the numbers of LT-HSC and ST-HSC and CLP were all dramatically decreased (Figure 3). These results have been integrated in <italic>Figure 3A-C</italic> in revised manuscript. The relevant description has been added and underlined in the revised manuscript Page 6 Line 164-168, Page 7 Line 180.</p><p>We also analyzed pre-cDC1, based on the recommended gating strategy (Durai et al. 2020) and observed a significant decrease in the number of bone marrow pre-cDC1 in <italic>Hdac3</italic> deficient mice (Figure 9). These results for pre-cDC1 were added into Figure 3−figure supplement 1D-F in revised manuscript. The relevant description has been added and underlined in the revised manuscript Page 7 Line 180-183.</p><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we also analyzed the pre-cDC subpopulations, based on the recommended gating strategy (Schlitzer et al., 2015). In this analysis, a significant decrease was observed in the number of total population of pre-DCs, including all four major subpopulations (Figure 10 below). According to the published work (Schlitzer et al., 2015), where they described the different subpopulations of pre-DCs, Siglec H<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>−</sup> (R3) represents the early pre-DCs that can differentiate into pDCs, cDC1s, and cDC2s. Siglec H<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> (R2) and Siglec H<sup>−</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> (R1) were identified as cDC2-primed progenitors, while Siglec H<sup>−</sup>Ly6C<sup>−</sup> (R4) represents the cDC1-primed progenitor population, which represents the major remaining pre-DC population in <italic>Hdac3</italic> deficient mice. The results of analysis of pre-DC were added to Figure3−figure supplement 1A-C. The relevant description has been added in the text (underlined, Page 7 Line 180-183) of revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also analysis of competitive chimeras may help in dissecting the developmental defect resulting from HDAC3 deficiency.

Moreover, Flt3 signaling is essential for the development of both pDCs and cDCs, the fact that the cDCs could still be generated, although in reduced numbers, in HDAC3 deficient mice suggested that the expression of Flt3 might not be the major causative factor for the defective phenotype of pDC in <italic>Hdac3</italic> deficient mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3E. the gate shown will include auto florescent cells please use a better gating strategy for identifying CLPs.i.e include an auto florescent exclusion gate, see comment above on looking at MPP4s.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s kind suggestion.

In this case the co-transferred CD45.1 WT bone marrow cells could support the survival of the recipient mice, and consequently, the proportions of HDAC3 deficient CD115<sup>−</sup>CDP-derived cells (CD45.2) and the WT CD115<sup>−</sup>CDP-derived cells in the BM and spleens of recipient mice were quite low, typically below 10%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To avoid the confusion between recipient derived cells and donor derived WT cells I would suggest using, as mentioned above, CD45.1.2 heterozygous mice as WT donors or recipients.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we used CD45.1 mice as both competitor donors as well the recipients, and CD45.2 mice (either Hdac3-Ctrl or Hdac3-cKO) as donors respectively.

We conducted experiments using a range of concentrations of RGFP966 in in vitro DC differentiation assays. At the low concentration (0.2μM), a significant decrease in pDCs number was observed, while the number of cDCs remained largely unaffected. As the concentration increased, the numbers of both pDCs and cDCs decreased or nearly absent, which is more likely due to the cytotoxic effects of RGFP966 at higher concentrations (0.5μM and 1.0μM). These results suggested that at the optimal concentration of the inhibitor, pDC development was more reliant on HDAC3 compared to cDCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To Figure 7</p><p>Could you provide with the full tables of genes that are deregulated?
