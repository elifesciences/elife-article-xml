neuronal signaling and cardiac function. Previously, we showed that activation of CaMKII triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, potentially increasing the spread of the active state (Stratton et al., 2014; Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). Using mass spectrometry, we show now that unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides derived from the CaMKII-α regulatory segment bind to the CaMKII-α hub and break it into smaller oligomers. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the regulatory segments dock spontaneously at the interface between hub subunits, trapping large fluctuations in hub structure. Single-molecule fluorescence intensity analysis of CaMKII-α expressed in mammalian cells shows that activation of CaMKII-α results in the destabilization of the holoenzyme. Our results suggest that release of the regulatory segment by activation and phosphorylation allows it to destabilize the hub, producing smaller assemblies that might reassemble to form new holoenzymes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CaMKII</kwd><kwd>activation-dependent disassembly</kwd><kwd>spread of activation state</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulation</kwd><kwd>native mass spectrometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 GM 126145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhattacharyya</surname><given-names>Moitrayee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE-1609866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Zijie</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Evan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>calsolv</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Zijie</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Evan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 GM 126145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhattacharyya</surname><given-names>Moitrayee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation and autophosphorylation of CaMKII releases the regulatory segment, which can then bind to and destabilize the hub assembly by trapping large fluctuations in the hub architecture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an oligomeric serine/threonine kinase that is important in neuronal signaling and cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020a</xref>).

This conclusion was based on the results of experiments in which two samples of CaMKII were labeled separately with fluorophores of two different colors, mixed, and then activated. Single-molecule visualization showed activation-dependent co-localization of the two fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>). In other experiments, separate CaMKII samples were labeled with FRET donor and acceptor fluorophore pairs, respectively, and mixing these samples after activation led to increased FRET compared to mixing unactivated samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). These data are also consistent with subunit exchange. Colocalization of differently labeled subunits was also observed when unactivated CaMKII holoenzymes were mixed with activated ones. Importantly, these experiments showed that activated CaMKII holoenzymes could phosphorylate subunits of unactivated ones, thereby spreading the activation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The regulatory segment of CaMKII has been shown to be important for subunit exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). After activation, autophosphorylation of Thr 286 in the regulatory segment prevents it from re-binding to the kinase domain, thereby conferring Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM independence (autonomy) on CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thiel et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lou and Schulman, 1989</xref>). Autophosphorylation of two other sites, Thr 305 and Thr 306, prevents the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to the regulatory segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colbran, 1993</xref>). Thus, we expect that activation is accompanied by the release of at least some fraction of the regulatory segment from the kinase and from Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM.</p><p>A constitutively active variant of CaMKII-α (T286D) undergoes spontaneous subunit exchange without activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>). Mutation of the calmodulin-binding element of the regulatory segment in this variant eliminated subunit exchange, which suggests that the calmodulin-binding element might interact with the hub and destabilize it, thereby promoting subunit exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, a construct consisting of just the hub and the regulatory segment was shown to undergo spontaneous subunit exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Recent differential scanning calorimetry and mass photometry experiments have shown that while the isolated hub is very stable, the holoenzyme, especially with the linker present, is unstable and undergoes dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torres-Ocampo et al., 2020</xref>). </p><p>A prominent feature of the hub assembly is the presence of grooves located at the inter-subunit interfaces. These grooves are lined by negatively-charged residues, and we proposed that positively-charged residues in the calmodulin-binding element might recognize these negatively-charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Each interfacial groove between subunits contains the uncapped edge of a β-sheet, and peptide segments have been shown to dock within the groove by forming an additional strand of this β-sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). A peptide with the sequence of the calmodulin-binding element has been shown to bind weakly to the hub, with a dissociation constant of ~90 µM, but destabilization of the hub was not studied in those experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we present the results of investigations into interactions between the regulatory segment and the hub, and the effect of activation on the stability of the holoenzyme. We used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to show that peptides derived from the regulatory segment can bind to and destabilize the dodecameric or tetradecameric CaMKII-α hub assembly, releasing smaller oligomers of the hub domain. We generated a 13 μs molecular dynamics trajectory of the dodecameric hub of CaMKII-α, which shows that two regulatory segments bind spontaneously to the hub at two inter-subunit interfaces. This docking is facilitated by large distortions in the structure of the hub, which reflect an intrinsic feature of hub dynamics, as shown by a normal mode calculation. Finally, we use single-molecule TIRF microscopy to show that activation of CaMKII-α expressed in mammalian cells is accompanied by apparent destabilization of the holoenzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mass spectrometry shows that peptides derived from the regulatory segment can break the CaMKII-α hub assembly</title><p>We used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to analyze the integrity of the CaMKII-α hub assembly, in isolation and in the presence of peptides. The sequences of most of these peptides are based on that of the calmodulin-binding element of the regulatory segment (Peptide A and Peptides C-F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which includes several positivelycharged residues preceding hydrophobic residues. We refer to the hydrophobic portion (residues 301–308) as the β-clip segment because a part of this segment is incorporated into the interfacial β-sheet in a structure of autoinhibited CaMKII-α, in a conformation referred to as the β-clip conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chao et al., 2011</xref>). We also tested a peptide that contains only the β-clip segment and a portion of the kinase-hub linker (Peptide B). Finally, we tested the effect of two different peptides that bind to the kinase domain of CaMKII but have no known affinity for the hub. One of these peptides (Peptide G) corresponds to the portion of the regulatory segment that precedes the calmodulin-binding element (residues 274–295). This region of the regulatory segment binds to the kinase domain in the autoinhibited state and includes Thr 286, which confers Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-independent activity, or ‘autonomy’ when phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lou and Schulman, 1989</xref>). The other peptide (Peptide H) is a commonly used CaMKII inhibitor called CaMKIINtide, which binds to the kinase domain and blocks the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The mass spectrometry experiments were carried out for the CaMKII-α hub in isolation, without the kinase domain and linkers.

In the previous studies, a higher sample cone voltage of 150 V was used to reduce adduction of solvent and/or other small species, in order to obtain higherresolution mass spectra. Under these higher energy source conditions, some collision-induced disassembly of the hub occurs, resulting in the release of a small amount of monomeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the present study, we used softer ionization conditions, with a cone voltage of 50 V. Although this results in a decrease in the mass spectral resolution, we do not observe any smaller oligomeric species for the isolated hub.

This result is unexpected, since the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides bind to the hub with comparable affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the available crystal structures of the hub, an explanation for why the phosphorylated peptides are more potent at breaking the hub is not readily apparent. Also, we note that the phosphorylated peptides do not appear to provide a persistent signal in the mass spectrometer, and over time the peak corresponding to the peptide decreases and eventually disappears. For these reasons, the interaction of the phosphorylated peptides with the hub requires further study in order to obtain a more complete understanding of their mechanism of action.</p><p>The mass spectrometric data presented here provide compelling evidence that the interaction of the hub with the calmodulin-binding element of CaMKII, whether phosphorylated or not, results in hub destabilization. Interestingly, this destabilization is not detected in conventional experiments using gel filtration. For example, gel filtration analysis of the CaMKII hub incubated with Peptide A under conditions identical to those used for mass spectrometry shows only a single protein peak corresponding to dodecameric/tetradecameric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since Peptide A interacts with the hub relatively weakly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that gel filtration causes dissociation of the peptide from the hub, perhaps allowing the hub to reassemble. In addition, perturbations introduced by the mass spectrometric analysis, such as sample heating, might partially destabilize the hub making it possible to more readily observe the effects of the peptides on the hub stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of regulatory segment docking on the hub</title><p>We generated molecular dynamics trajectories for the hub assembly with the regulatory segments and linkers either present or absent, using the specialized Anton2 supercomputer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>).

In the simulation, at interfaces where regulatory segments are not bound the interfacial grooves are constricted so that binding of the regulatory segments would be hindered substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

When unphosphorylated, CaMKII is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM for kinase activity. Once phosphorylated at Thr 286, CaMKII subunits acquire calmodulin-independent activity (autonomy). Thr 286 phosphorylation must necessarily occur in trans, with one kinase subunit phosphorylating another. Efficient Thr 286 phosphorylation occurs only within a holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Koninck and Schulman, 1998</xref>), with the enzyme-kinase and substrate-kinase being tethered to the same hub at high local concentrations. This feature makes subunit exchange potentially important for spreading the activation of CaMKII, since it provides a means for activated subunits to enter into holoenzymes that have not yet been activated and thereby produce more activated subunits by trans-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The intriguing aspect of subunit exchange in CaMKII is that it is activation dependent. Most oligomeric proteins are capable of subunit exchange, provided that the dissociation rate constants are not too slow, and the subunits do not unfold when they are dissociated. Indeed, a CaMKII enzyme from choanoflagellates does not form stable oligomeric species, and it undergoes spontaneous subunit exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, mammalian CaMKII-α is very stable as a dodecameric or tetradecameric oligomer and it demonstrates an insignificant degree of subunit exchange when not activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we have shown, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, that the stable assembly formed by the CaMKII-α hub is destabilized by the addition of peptides derived from the regulatory segment of CaMKII-α. Addition of regulatory segment peptides, in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms, at 10 µM or higher concentration to samples of the hub leads to rapid loss of integrity of the hub, and the release of monomers, dimers, tetramers, hexamers and octamers. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that individual subunits undergo considerable displacements with respect to adjacent subunits. These transient fluctuations lead to the interfacial grooves between subunits opening up, allowing regulatory segments to be captured. The simulations indicate that although two regulatory segments can dock on a closed hub, the binding of additional segments could disrupt the integrity of the hub. These simulations are relatively short, and much longer simulations would be required to model the complete disassembly process. We have also shown, using a single-molecule TIRF assay, that activation of CaMKII-α expressed in mammalian cells results in destabilization of the holoenzymes.</p><p>We had suggested previously that there is a three-way competition for binding to the calmodulin-binding element between the kinase domain, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and the hub interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). The calmodulin-binding element binds with nanomolar affinity to the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colbran et al., 1988</xref>), with picomolar affinity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tse et al., 2007</xref>), and with micromolar affinity to the hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Upon activation, phosphorylation on Thr 286 prevents the calmodulin-binding element from binding to the kinase domains and phosphorylation on Thr 305/Thr 306 prevents interaction with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Thus, if a CaMKII subunit undergoes phosphorylation at both Thr 286 and at Thr 305/Thr 306, then the regulatory segment might be released, and free to interact with the hub interface. The local concentration of the regulatory segments with respect to the hub is estimated to be in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Given the observation that the addition of the regulatory segment peptides at micromolar concentrations in trans leads to hub disassembly, we conclude that the presentation of these elements in cis to the hub could lead to rapid destabilization of the hub upon activation.</p><p>Subunit exchange in CaMKII has been proposed originally as a mechanism whereby the activation states of CaMKII could be maintained indefinitely, contributing to the storage of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lisman, 1994</xref>). It is difficult to reconcile such a mechanism with the action of phosphatases, which are expected to reset the activation sates of CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020b</xref>). Instead, we speculate that the destabilization of CaMKII holoenzymes upon activation is a mechanism that potentiates the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses under conditions when calmodulin is limiting, as is the case in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Persechini and Stemmer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pepke et al., 2010</xref>). Under these conditions, the release of dimers and other smaller oligomers can result in the spread of activated CaMKII species that can interact with and activate as yet unactivated holoenzymes. The precise mechanism by which this spread of activation occurs, and the role of subunit exchange, awaits further study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CAMK2N1</td><td>GenBank</td><td>HGNC:HGNC:1460</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">CMC0014</td><td valign="top">Chemically competent</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>UC Berkeley cell culture facility</td><td/><td>Authenticated using STR profiling and tested negative for mycoplasma</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pEGFP-C1 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Clontech, Mountain View, CA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Vector backbone for inserting the CaMKII genes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pSNAP<sub>f</sub> (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs, MA</td><td valign="top">N9183S</td><td valign="top">Vector backbone</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pEGFP-C1-Avi-mEGFP-CaMKII</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>pEGFP-C1 vector was modified to have a biotinylation sequence followed by a linker at the N-terminus of mEGFP.

All peptides used in this study were purchased from Elim Biopharm, Hayward, CA. The hub and peptide were mixed such that final concentrations in the reaction mix contained 120 µM CaMKII-α hub (subunit concentration) and 1 µM to 1 mM of the peptide, with a constant ionic strength of ~400 mM of ammonium acetate. This reaction mix was incubated for 5 min at room temperature before analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In experiments of the hub incubated with phosphorylated peptides, the mass spectra obtained comprised predominantly of smaller oligomeric species and aggregates. Therefore, the last incubation step was eliminated, and the sample was introduced into the mass spectrometer as soon as the hub was mixed with the phosphorylated peptide. As a control experiment, 120 µM of CaMKII-α hub in 400 mM ammonium acetate was also incubated for five minutes at room temperature and analyzed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.</p><p>Mass spectra were acquired on a Waters SYNAPT G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA).

The submicron emitters were chosen to help reduce salt adducts on the protein ions and to reduce the chemical noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Susa et al., 2017</xref>). Nanoelectrospray ionization was initiated by applying a voltage of ~1.0 kV to 1.2 kV onto a platinum wire (0.127 mm in diameter, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) that is inserted inside the emitter and in contact with sample solutions. The emitter tips were placed ~6 mm to 8 mm away from the entrance of the mass spectrometer.</p><p>To minimize collisional activation of the ions, a relatively low-sample cone voltage (50 V) and low-source temperature (80°C) were used. The voltages of collisional induced dissociation cells (both Trap and Transfer cells) were set at 2 V, a value at which no gas-phase dissociation of the protein complex was observed. Mass spectral data were smoothed using the Savitsky-Golay smoothing algorithm, available via the Waters MassLynx software, with a smoothing window of 100 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> (mass-to-charge ratio). For all experiments, the mass spectral results were continuously recorded as long as protein signals were observed.

After harvesting, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris at pH 8, 150 mM KCl, 1.5 mM TCEP-HCl, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma)), 0.5% phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 (P0044, Sigma) and 3 (P5726, Sigma), 50 mM NaF, 15 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 1% NP-40 (ThermoFisher).</p><p>The cell lysate was diluted in the gel filtration buffer (same recipe as above, but without glycerol). mEGFP-CaMKII-α in the diluted cell lysate was activated by incubating the lysate with an activation buffer containing 5 μM CaM, 100 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM ATP and 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentrations in the reaction) for 60 min at room temperature. For the unactivated sample, the 60-min incubation was carried out in gel filtration buffer without the addition of any components of the activation buffer. For both the activated and unactivated samples, 100 μL of the diluted cell lysate was added to a well in the flow chamber. After incubation for 1 min, the diluted cell lysate was washed out with 1 mL of PBS. During this incubation, the biotinylated mEGFP-CaMKII-α variants were immobilized on the surface of the functionalized glass substrates, via the streptavidin-biotin interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy</title><p>Single-particle total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon 100 × 1.49 numerical aperture oil-immersion TIRF objective, a TIRF illuminator, a Perfect Focus system, and a motorized stage. Images were recorded using an Andor iXon electron-multiplying CCD camera. The sample was illuminated using the LU-N4 laser unit (Nikon) with solid-state lasers for the channels emitting at wavelengths of 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm. Lasers were controlled using a built-in acousto-optic tunable filter. A 405/488/561/638 nm Quad TIRF filter set (Chroma Technology Corp.) was used along with supplementary emission filters of 525/50 m, 600/50 m, 700/75 m for the 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm channels, respectively. Image acquisition was performed with the automated change of illumination and filter sets, at 75 different positions from an initial reference frame, so as to capture multiple non-overlapping images, using the Nikon NIS-Elements software. mEGFP- CaMKII-α was imaged by illuminating the 488 nm laser set to 5.2 mW. Images for all the mEGFP-CaMKII-α variants were acquired using an exposure time of 80 ms, while keeping the laser power unchanged over all conditions.</p><p>To correct for the baseline clamp and dark current, a series of dark images were collected under the same exposure time of 80 ms as the experimental sample. Uneven illumination and fringe interference effects in the intensity distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattheyses et al., 2010</xref>) were corrected for by measuring the field illumination with a solubilized fluorescein sample. The dark image was subtracted from both the sample data and field illumination control, then the sample data were divided by a normalized mean field control to acquire appropriate intensities.</p><p>For photobleaching experiments, the GFP-fluorescence signal was recorded in a stream acquisition mode, with an exposure time of 80 ms, under the same conditions as described above. As a control, the intensities and photobleaching traces of mEGFP-Hck, a monomeric protein kinase, were also collected under the same conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Analyses of single-molecule TIRF data</title><p>Individual single particles of mEGFP-CaMKII-α were detected and localized using the single particle tracking plugin TrackMate in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>). The particles were localized with the Laplacian of Gaussian detector with an initial diameter set to 6 pixels. A threshold value of 300 was used to exclude noisy, low-intensity spots. To eliminate the effects of variation in resolution at the edges of the field due to heterogenous TIRF illumination, only particles within a central area of 400 × 400 pixel<sup>2</sup> were included in the calculation. The intensity distributions for single particles of mEGFP-CaMKII-α (488 nm) were determined using custom in-house software written in Python. The total intensity values acquired from TrackMate for the 488-channel were adjusted by subtracting the local median background intensity for each spot (scaled by the spot area) to produce an intensity histogram for all the mEGFP-CaMKII-α spots.</p><p>For the analysis of the GFP step-photobleaching data, the photobleaching traces for each spot were built by plotting the maximum intensities of mEGFP-CaMKII-α as a function of time with MATLAB. The number of single photobleaching events were counted manually by inspecting the photobleaching trace for every spot. Single-step and two-step bleaching traces were clearly identified, but multistep photobleaching traces exhibited relatively unclear, distinct bleaching events. We therefore categorized the bleaching traces into single-step, two-step, and multi-step photobleaching. A similar analysis was used for mEGFP-Hck, which exhibited only single step traces.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Determination the composition of oligomeric species in the intensity distributions</title><p>The intensity distribution of monomeric GFP species is lognormal when detected on an EMCCD camera, and is given by<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ln</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the integrated intensity of a spot, µ is the mean of the underlying normal variable and σ is its standard deviation. Given a monomer distribution, the intensity distribution for a species with N subunits can be determined by convolving the intensity distribution of the monomer with itself N times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mutch et al., 2007</xref>). An oligomer may have some dark GFP leading to a different intensity distribution than expected, and the dark fraction (ν) can be used to predict the extent to which this occurs.

The probability mass function was then reconverted back to a density function.</p><p>We estimated the dark fraction (ν) by auto-convolving the monomeric distribution 12 times and determining value of ν that yields the best alignment of the predicted dodecameric distribution with the high-intensity peak in the experimental data. These gave values of ν ~0.3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While this method of estimating ν will center the predicted peak with the data, it has no bearing on its width, which is governed by the underlying lognormal function. Based on these results, a dark fraction of 0.3 was used for all samples.</p><p>The following procedure was used to create the final mixture model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>. First the low-intensity peak was fit to a mixture of monomeric and dimeric species with a fixed dark fraction (ν) of 0.3, which yielded parameters σ and μ for the underlying monomeric lognormal distribution. This log-normal distribution was convolved with itself 12 times, also with a fixed dark rate of 0.3, to gives three final distributions: monomer, dimer, and dodecamer. The observed data were then fit to a mixture of these three populations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Howard Schulman and Christine Gee for helpful discussions.

This paper uses an elegant combination of mass spectrometry, computational analysis, and cellular experiments to extend our understanding of the dynamics of the oligomeric structure of CamKII. Using synthetic peptides derived from the CaMKII regulatory segment, the authors show that the highly organized Hub structure of this kinase can be destabilized providing a molecular mechanism of controlling its cellular function.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Breakage of the Oligomeric CaMKII Hub by the Regulatory Segment of the Kinase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Leslie Griffith as Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Bayliss (University of Leeds) (Reviewer #2); Dorothee Kern (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below request an additional experiment before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper builds on studies from the Kuriyan lab published in <italic>eLife</italic> that have suggested that CaMKII, which exists as a 12-mer or 14-mer complex, can exchange subunits upon activation by Ca/CaM. Here they show short peptides derived from the CaMKII regulatory segment can bind and destabilize the 12-mer using native ESI mass spec. Molecular dynamics simulations were also performed to model a mechanism for dissociation. Lastly, the authors show data from a single molecule assay that suggest that activation can cause dissociation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found that this was both an interesting and potentially important follow-up to the lab's previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper(s). They do feel, however, that the manuscript could be improved by additional data (essential revision 1 below) and by additional prose/analysis/figures to flesh out a couple other areas (essential revisions 2-4) below.</p><p>1) The authors' previous studies indicated that phosphorylation of Thr305 and/or Thr306 in the regulatory domain potentiates subunit exchange. Indeed, the authors conclude that phosphorylation at T286 and T305/6 disrupt the linker's interactions with kinase domain and Ca/CaM, respectively, so that it can then bind to hub. However, none of the peptides (A, B, C) used in the current work were phosphorylated. Their prior paper indicated that peptide phosphorylation does not directly affect binding to the hub, but it should be very informative to compare the effects of Thr305- and/or Thr306-phosphorylation of peptide A to the current data set for subunit disassembly using the peptide/MS method.</p><p>2) There is not enough detail in the figures to make a clear comparison of the distortions in the hub observed in the presence and absence of peptide. The reviewers were therefore not completely convinced about the relevance of these distortions to the mechanism of peptide-induced dissociation of the hub. The analysis of subunit-subunit changes is presented simply as angular changes, whereas the docking interface is shown in atomic detail. Would it not make sense to also show the interface interactions, and to present an analysis of the molecular contacts at these interfaces?</p><p>3) In the second part of the manuscript, binding of peptide to the hub is investigated via docking/long MD simulations on ANTON. Two peptides are found to bind in two interfaces between subunits leading to distortions of the hub rom its normal circular shape to an oval shape. However, the hub does not actually separate at any of the interfaces. The authors suggest that the docking of additional segments to the hub are needed for hub disassembly. Would not the binding of just these two peptides as shown in Figure 5 with full disruption of the hub interactions in these two interfaces result in hexamers that are seen in the MS data? Why would docking of additional segment be needed? Looking at the rough time-scale of disassembly from the MS data (in the minute regime), could the more likely explanation for the lack of disassembly be that the process is too slow relative to the simulation times? A discussion of the timecourse of the dissociation, as observed by ESI-MS, and how this relates to the timescale of the simulation should also be included.</p><p>4) The data purportedly demonstrating that activation of mammalian cell-expressed CaMKII holoenzymes are not completely convincing: there is no statistical analysis of the replicates and the changes in the area of the peaks appear rather minor in two of the three replicates. The effects, if any, on WT holoenzymes 60 min after activation appear to be very modest compared to the essentially complete disruption of the hubs that was observed within a few minutes of peptide addition. This would seem to be important to ascertain whether this apparent &quot;holoenzyme dissociation&quot; results from the specific mechanism defined in the prior studies, or from a more general instability of CaMKII over this extended incubation. Indeed, the surprisingly significant levels of monomer/dimer in the inactivated samples may result from an alternative more general instability, complicating interpretation. The authors need to acknowledge and comment on these issues and provide adequate data treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57784.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found that this was both an interesting and potentially important follow-up to the lab's previous eLife paper(s).

We now include results from experiments that explore the effects of phosphorylated Peptide A and Peptide B on hub stability, as measured by electrospray mass spectrometry (Figure 4). We observed a more rapid decrease in hub stability upon addition of the phosphorylated Peptide A (Peptide A<sup>phos</sup>) at different concentrations, when compared to unphosphorylated Peptide A. A similar effect was observed when phosphorylated Peptide B (Peptide B<sup>phos</sup>) was mixed with the hub. In order to capture by mass spectrometry the more rapid destabilization upon the addition of Peptide A<sup>phos</sup> or Peptide B<sup>phos</sup>, we had to eliminate the 5-minute incubation prior to introducing the sample into the mass spectrometer that was done in the original experiments with Peptide A and Peptide B. That is, mass spectral acquisition was started as soon as the hub was mixed with the peptide. As the reviewer points out, our earlier publication had noted that there is no apparent difference in affinity between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides. Those earlier experiments did not consider the effects of the peptide on hub stability. That the phosphorylated peptides are more effective at breaking the hub was therefore not anticipated. A more thorough analysis of this effect awaits future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is not enough detail in the figures to make a clear comparison of the distortions in the hub observed in the presence and absence of peptide.

We have also included a figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 3), where the regulatory segment that docked at one of the open interfaces was modeled onto a closed interface, showing how steric clashes would prevent this docking unless the interface undergoes further distortion, which might lead to destabilization and disassembly of the hub. Hydrogen bonds across interfaces are preserved in the simulation, irrespective of whether the interface opens or closes, and we have included a discussion and figures showing this (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). While it is likely, based on analyses in Bhattacharyya et al., 2016, that these interactions will break when the hub undergoes disassembly, this has not occurred on the timescale of this simulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the second part of the manuscript, binding of peptide to the hub is investigated via docking/long MD simulations on ANTON.

The authors need to acknowledge and comment on these issues and provide adequate data treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the nature of these experiments with cell lysates, conventional statistical measures, such as the average and standard error, are really not applicable. Variations from run to run are dominated by systematic error sources (e.g. transfection rates, reaction stoppage conditions, etc.) that affect the degree to which the reaction progresses. To address these variations, we present data from multiple independent replicates (3 replicates) for each experiment. The consistent theme is that activation always increases the proportion of monomers, dimers and lower order oligomers. Figures 8 and 9 have been reformatted to emphasize this dominant feature of the data.</p><p>The effect of activation on CaMKII holoenzyme destabilization is actually not that small. If we look strictly at the increase of dimers, we see that it increases ~1.3-2 fold in each replicate, which is significant. This can come from a relatively small fraction of dodecamer dissociation, and the original figures did not readily convey this fact. We have now updated the Figures 8 and 9 to more clearly indicate the fold-changes in dimer fraction.</p><p>The extent of peptide-induced destabilization is different between mass spectrometry and single-molecule TIRF as these are measuring two different samples and under very different experimental conditions. In mass spectrometry, we are studying the hub (without the rest of the protein) after addition of the calmodulin-binding element (CBE) peptide in <italic>trans</italic>. In contrast, intact CaMKII holoenzyme is studied in the single-molecule experiments, where the CBE peptide segment is presented in <italic>cis</italic>. Also, the cell lysate experiments are done in the presence of saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin, which binds to the regulatory segment (in a normal activation process <italic>in situ</italic> the calcium levels would drop after stimulation). In addition, the holoenzyme activation may also lead to some subunit exchange, where the released smaller oligomeric species may re-equilibrate with the holoenzyme.</p><p>The reviewer’s comments led us to appreciate the fact that the different experiments we have carried out represent different approximations of the physiologically relevant conditions, which are themselves not well understood. As noted above, the cell-based experiments are done in the presence of saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin, which would normally subside to low levels after a calcium pulse. In these experiments, therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin protects the regulatory segment from phosphorylation on Thr 305/Thr 306, and also from interaction with the hub. In the mass spectrometry experiments it is surprising that we see so much breakage, given that the peptide is added in <italic>trans</italic>. Indeed, the incubation of the isolated hub with the CBE peptides at different concentrations does not lead to the detection of smaller oligomeric species by classical analytical gel filtration. In the gel filtration experiment, the peptide is separated from the hub as soon as the sample enters the column. It is important to note that classical biochemical experiments, such as gel filtration, may not detect destabilization, as it may be a subtle effect under those experimental conditions. In contrast, in the mass spectrometry experiment, the local concentration of peptides and hub may be very high in the electrospray droplets, and they may also be subjected to local heating. Note that such heating, if it occurs, does not lead to any detectable destabilization of the hub in the absence of the peptide. We have included this discussion in the revised manuscript and presented the gel filtration data as a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We believe this will inform future experiments trying to characterize subtle destabilization effects in CaMKII or other systems.</p></body></sub-article></article>
