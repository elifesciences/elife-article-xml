The <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline serves as an excellent model for studying these regulatory mechanisms. Here, we report that a previously uncharacterized gene <italic>CG14545</italic>, which we named <italic>sakura</italic>, is essential for oogenesis and female fertility in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sakura is predominantly expressed in the ovaries, particularly in the germline cells, including GSCs. sakura null mutant female flies display rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous phenotypes, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. The germline-specific depletion of sakura impairs Dpp/BMP signaling, leading to aberrant <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) expression, resulting in faulty differentiation and loss of GSCs. sakura is also necessary for normal levels of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) levels and for female-specific splicing of <italic>sex-lethal</italic> (<italic>sxl</italic>), a master regulator of sex identity determination. We identified Ovarian Tumor (Otu) as a protein binding partner of Sakura and found that loss of <italic>otu</italic> phenocopies loss of <italic>sakura</italic> in ovaries. Thus, we identify Sakura as a crucial factor for GSC renewal and differentiation and oogenesis, and propose that Sakura and Otu function together in these processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germline stem cell</kwd><kwd>oogenesis</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>ovarian tumor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM145352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukunaga</surname><given-names>Ryuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03AI178064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukunaga</surname><given-names>Ryuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Johns Hopkins University Catalyst Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukunaga</surname><given-names>Ryuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sakura is expressed in female germlines, interacts with Otu, and is crucial for germline stem cell renewal and differentiation and oogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oogenesis is a complex process in which GSCs develop into mature female gametes or oocytes. This process involves multiple layers of regulations and numerous genes, some of which remain to be discovered and characterized. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a genetically tractable model organism, has long been at the forefront of GSC and oogenesis research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirilly and Xie, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> females possess a pair of ovaries, each composed of 12–16 ovarioles. At the anterior tip of each ovariole is a structure called the germarium, which houses two to three GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GSCs reside in the most anterior region of the germarium, where they directly contact cap cells and escort cells, forming a niche crucial for GSC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin and Spradling, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Cuevas and Matunis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Losick et al., 2011</xref>). GSCs undergo asymmetric mitotic division, producing two distinct cells: one GSC and one cystoblast. The cystoblast, destined to differentiate, undergoes four mitotic divisions with incomplete cytokinesis, resulting in interconnected cysts of 2, 4, 8, and 16 cells. Of the 16 cells, one will differentiate into an oocyte, while the remaining 15 develop into polyploid nurse cells, which synthesize proteins and RNAs for deposition into the oocyte.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sakura expression pattern and mutant allele.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary and germarium. <italic>Drosophila</italic> female has a pair of ovaries, each consisting of 12–16 ovarioles (cyan).

Failure in GSC self-renewal or inappropriate differentiation leads to stem cell loss, disrupting oocyte production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox et al., 1998</xref>). Conversely, uncontrolled GSC division or defective differentiation results in an overabundance of GSC-like cells (a tumorous phenotype) and fewer differentiated cells, ultimately inhibiting oocyte production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gateff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohlstein et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, a precise balance between GSC self-renewal and cyst differentiation within the germarium is essential for proper oogenesis and is tightly regulated.</p><p>Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling plays a critical role in regulating GSC self-renewal and differentiation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis. In the stem cell niche, GSCs are physically anchored to cap cells via adherens and gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilboa et al., 2003</xref>). Cap cells secrete BMP ligands, such as Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Glass bottom boat (Gbb), which are recognized by transducing receptors like Thickvein (Tkv) and Saxophone (Sax) on the GSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004</xref>). Upon activation, these receptors phosphorylate a transcription factor, Mad. The phosphorylated Mad (pMad) translocates into the nucleus, where it represses the transcription of <italic>bam</italic>, a key differentiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kai and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Bam, a ubiquitin-associated protein, is essential for cystoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKearin and Spradling, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>). Dpp/BMP signaling in the niche represses <italic>bam</italic> expression, preventing GSCs from differentiating and enabling self-renew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2004</xref>). However, as the daughter cells (cytoblasts) exit the niche, they derepress <italic>bam</italic> and initiate the differentiation program. Tight regulation of Dpp/BMP signaling and <italic>bam</italic> expression ensures that only cells within the niche adopt GSC fate, while adjacent daughter cells differentiate into cystoblasts. Loss of <italic>bam</italic> leads to blocked differentiation and the accumulation of GSC-like cells (tumorous phenotype), whereas ectopic <italic>bam</italic> expression forces GSCs differentiation, depleting the stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKearin and Spradling, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohlstein and McKearin, 1997</xref>).</p><p>One of the proteins that interacts with Bam is Otu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2017</xref>). Otu forms a deubiquitinase complex with Bam, which deubiquitinates Cyclin A (CycA), stabilizing CycA and promoting GSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2017</xref>). Otu also binds RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Otu is crucial for oogenesis and female fertility. Mutations in the <italic>otu</italic> gene cause various ovarian defects, including tumorous growths, germ cell loss, abnormalities in oocyte determination and nurse cell dumping, and defects in the sexual identity determination of germ cells, indicating Otu’s importance in multiple stages of oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and King, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gans et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gollin and King, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King and Riley, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Storto and King, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pauli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodesch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glenn and Searles, 2001</xref>). However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which Otu functions in these processes remain largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to identify a novel gene required for oogenesis. Through a search for uncharacterized genes expressed exclusively in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries, we discovered CG14545, a gene encoding a 114 amino acids (aa) long protein without any known functional domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that CG14545 is expressed specifically in female germline cells, including GSCs. Our genetic analysis revealed that CG14545 is required for oogenesis and female fertility and plays an important intrinsic role in regulating GSCs renewal and differentiation. Additionally, CG14545 is important for the piRNA pathway and for the female-specific mRNA splicing pattern of <italic>sex-lethal</italic> (<italic>sxl</italic>), a master regulator of sex determination. We identified Otu as a binding partner of the CG14545 protein, suggesting that both proteins may participate in the same molecular pathways to regulate GSC fate and differentiation. We named the CG14545 gene <italic>sakura</italic>, meaning ‘cherry blossom’ in Japanese, symbolizing birth and renewal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sakura is exclusively expressed in the ovaries</title><p>Based on high-throughput expression data in Flybase, <italic>sakura</italic> mRNA is highly and exclusively expressed in adult ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate Sakura protein expression, we generated a polyclonal anti-Sakura antibody against a recombinant full-length Sakura protein. Using this antibody, we examine Sakura protein expression at different stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and across tissues. We found that Sakura protein is specifically expressed in ovaries, particularly in germarium - 11 egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>sakura</italic> mutant flies</title><p>To explore the biological and molecular functions of Sakura in vivo, we generated a <italic>sakura</italic> mutant allele (<italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup>) with a one nucleotide (nt) insertion replacing 33 nts within the Sakura coding region using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This mutation causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon, resulting in a 33-amino acid (aa) N-terminal fragment of Sakura followed by a 22-aa segment produced by frameshifted translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This truncated fragment is unlikely to be functional, and we were unable to detect stable protein expression, as shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, we consider this allele a null mutation. <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null/null</italic></sup> flies were viable, revealing that Sakura is not essential for survival.</p><p>To validate the <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> strain, we performed Western blots using ovary lysates from <italic>sakura</italic> mutant flies using the anti-Sakura antibody.

No smaller protein corresponding to the truncated Sakura fragment was detected in either <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null/+</italic></sup> or <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null/null</italic></sup> ovaries, thus suggesting that the fragment is unstable or not expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sakura is cytoplasmic and expressed specifically in germ cells</title><p>To determine the localization of Sakura protein within the ovaries, we generated transgenic flies carrying a Sakura coding sequence fused with EGFP at the C-terminus (Sakura-EGFP) under the control of the <italic>sakura</italic> promoter. Western blot analysis of ovary lysates showed that Sakura-EGFP is expressed at levels comparable to endogenous Sakura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Oogenesis begins in the germarium, which contains 2–3 GSCs identified by round, unbranched spectrosomes that contact cap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirilly and Xie, 2007</xref>).

Confocal imaging revealed that Sakura-EGFP is specifically expressed in the cytoplasm of germ cells, including GSCs, cyst cells, nurse cells, and developing oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Sakura-EGFP was not expressed in somatic cells such as terminal filaments, cap cells, escort cells, or follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We predicted the structure of the Sakura-Otu protein complex using AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). AlphaFold suggested that the N-terminal region of Sakura (1-49aa) and the N-terminal region of Otu (1-405aa) are highly likely to form interactions, while the C-terminal region of Sakura (100-144aa) does not interact with Otu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>). The Tudor domain of Otu is not directly involved in this interaction, consistent with our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To experimentally validate the predictions made by AlphaFold, we generated a series of truncated Otu fragments, including Otu(∆Tudor) (1–336, 389-853aa, corresponding to the endogenous 98 kDa isoform), Otu(N1) (1-405aa), Otu(N2) (1-339aa), and Otu(C) (405-853aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We then performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to test which fragments could interact with full-length Sakura. All fragments except Otu(C) were associated with full-length Sakura protein in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), demonstrating that the C-terminal low-complexity region of Otu is dispensable for the interaction. This assay also showed that the Tudor domain is not critical and the N-terminal fragment (1-339aa) of Otu is sufficient for interaction with Sakura. These findings align well with the predictions made by AlphaFold.</p><p>Subsequently, we created several truncated Sakura fragments and conducted co-immunoprecipitation assays in S2 cells to determine which Sakura fragments can interact with full-length Otu. The fragments generated included Sakura(NM) (1-100aa), Sakura(NC) (1–49, 100-144aa), Sakura(MC) (49-144aa), Sakura(N) (1-49aa), Sakura(M) (49-100aa), and Sakura(C) (100-144aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We found that Sakura(NM), Sakura(NC), Sakura(N), and Sakura(M) were associated with Otu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Compared to Sakura(NM) and Sakura(N), the interaction of Sakura(M) with Otu is relatively weaker, as indicated by a fainter band in the Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Sakura-NC exhibited a weak interaction with Otu, while Sakura(MC) and Sakura(C) showed no interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). These assays demonstrated that the N-terminal region (1-49aa) of Sakura is sufficient for interaction with Otu. Moreover, the results suggest that the C-terminal region of Sakura (100-144aa) does not interact with Otu and that adjoining it with the N-terminal (1-49aa) or the middle (M) region (49-100aa) weakens the interaction with Otu. These findings support the AlphaFold predictions.</p><p>Finally, to test whether the interaction between Sakura and Otu can be achieved solely through their N-terminal regions, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay with Sakura (N) and Otu (N2). We discovered that Sakura (N) and Otu (N2) physically interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). A reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay also confirmed their interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), revealing that the interaction between Sakura and Otu can be established with just the 1-49aa of Sakura and the 1-339aa of Otu. Therefore, we conclude that Sakura interacts with Otu in vivo, and the N-terminal regions of both proteins are sufficient for their interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-13"><title>Loss of <italic>otu</italic> phenocopies loss of <italic>sakura</italic></title><p>Having established the interaction between Sakura and Otu, we were interested in whether they function together during oogenesis.

Loss of <italic>sakura</italic>, either through null mutation or germline RNAi including in GSCs, results in rudimentary ovaries exhibiting germless and tumorous phenotypes.</p><p>The tumorous phenotype associated with the loss of <italic>sakura</italic> is characterized by an excess of GSC-like cells, which feature round spectrosomes, as well as cyst cells with branched fusomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The increased number of GSC-like cells in the loss of <italic>sakura</italic> suggests dysregulation of GSC self-renewal and differentiation. Meanwhile, the presence of excess cyst cells with branched fusomes indicates abnormal differentiation and division of cysts. Differentiation of cystoblasts typically involves four mitotic divisions with incomplete cytokinesis, leading to 16 cyst cells interconnected by branched fusomes. The degree of fusome branching serves as a marker for the stages of cyst cell division, with increased branching from 2-cell to 16-cell cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Cuevas and Spradling, 1998</xref>). Notably, fusomes begin to degenerate and disappear after 16 cell cysts as the germline cyst enters the meiotic zone or region 2 of the germarium. The persistence of cyst cells with branched fusomes in <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null/null</italic></sup> suggests that <italic>sakura</italic> is crucial for the proper division and differentiation of cysts, and we speculate that it is required for germline cysts to enter meiotic division.</p><p>Mosaic analysis of <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> indicates that <italic>sakura</italic> is intrinsically required for the establishment of GSCs in the ovary. When mutant clones were induced in the PGC stage, significantly fewer <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> marked GSCs were observed in adult ovaries, suggesting that many <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> PGCs fail to survive or differentiate into GSCs. Furthermore, induction of <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> clones in adult ovaries led to a more rapid decline in marked <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> GSCs compared to controls, indicating that <italic>sakura</italic> is also intrinsically required for GSC maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Over time, germaria containing <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> GSC clones became increasingly tumorous, with an expanding population of <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> GSC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). In contrast, the number of GSC-like cells across the entire and all ovarioles, regardless of whether GSCs in the niche remain, declined over time in <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> GSCs initially undergo aberrant proliferation, leading to tumor formation, but ultimately <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> GSCs and GSC-like cells are lost through a cell death mechanism, as evidenced by the elevated levels of cleaved Caspase-3 in <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Dpp/BMP signaling governs GSC self-renewal and cystoblast differentiation by repressing <italic>bam</italic> in GSCs and de-repressing it in daughter cystoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This process is mediated by the transcription factor Mad, which, when phosphorylated (pMad), translocates into the nucleus to repress bam transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirilly and Xie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kahney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hinnant et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings indicate that Bam expression is not limited to 8 cell cysts but continues throughout the germarium in ovaries lacking <italic>sakura</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). The misexpression of Bam in GSCs likely results from reduced levels of pMad in the GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Given the low pMad levels observed upon loss of <italic>sakura</italic>, we propose that <italic>bam</italic> misregulation in GSCs occurs primarily at the transcriptional level, although Bam is also known to be subject to post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pek et al., 2009</xref>)<italic>.</italic> The continued expression of Bam throughout the germarium, well beyond the GSC niche, suggests a failure to terminate <italic>bam</italic> expression at the 16 cell cyst stage — a developmental transition when <italic>bam</italic> is normally turned off. Thus, <italic>sakura</italic> mutants likely exhibit two distinct molecular defects contributing to <italic>bam</italic> overexpression: (1) impaired Dpp/BMP signaling within the GSC niche, and (2) a failure to downregulate <italic>bam</italic> at 16 cell stage. Given the limited space within the GSC niche, the latter defect may be the predominant contributor to the observed <italic>bam</italic> overexpression. The molecular mechanism that silences bam at the 16 cell cyst stage remains poorly understood, and how <italic>sakura</italic> loss perturbs this regulation is unclear. The sakura mutant may, therefore, serve as a valuable model to investigate the mechanism that normally suppresses <italic>bam</italic> expression at the 16 cell stage.</p><p>Transposons are mobile genetic elements that, if not silenced, can generate DNA damage and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levin and Moran, 2011</xref>). piRNAs derived from transposons and other repeats can target and silence transposon RNAs to preserve genome integrity in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siomi et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of piRNAs leads to transposon derepression, resulting in increased DNA damage, which subsequently triggers cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moon et al., 2018</xref>). Genetic damage in germ cells can cause developmental defects and diseases that may be inherited by the next generation. Thus, the elimination of defective germ cells is crucial for maintaining germline integrity of a species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ota and Kobayashi, 2020</xref>). We found that loss of <italic>sakura</italic> results in reduced piRNA levels and loss of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The observed apoptosis, indicated by elevated cleaved Caspase-3 levels in <italic>sakura</italic> mutant ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggests that desilencing of transposons due to reduced piRNA levels likely results in increased DNA damage, triggering cell death. We speculate that the germless phenotype in <italic>sakura</italic> mutants may partly arise from an apoptotic germline elimination program activated to maintain germline integrity.</p><p>In addition to its expression in GSCs and cysts in the germarium, Sakura is also expressed in germline cells in later-stage egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>) and is required at this stage for proper oogenesis. When Sakura is depleted from region 2b of the germarium onward —leaving GSCs and early cyst cells intact—females have significantly fewer stage 14 oocytes and lay significantly fewer eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The failure to produce stage 14 mature oocytes likely stems from cytoskeletal disorganization that disrupts oocyte development, as evidenced by mislocalization of Orb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, piRNA pathway mutants also exhibit similar Orb mislocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohtani et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the reduced piRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) may contribute to the oocyte development defects, including Orb mislocalization, in <italic>sakura</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Sakura does not possess any known protein domains. To infer its function, we identified Otu, a protein known to be crucial for oogenesis, as a protein partner of Sakura. Mutations in <italic>otu</italic> gene lead to a range of ovarian phenotypes, including germ cell loss, tumorous egg chambers filled with undifferentiated germ cells, defects in germline sexual identity determination, abnormalities in nurse cell chromosome structure, and defects in oocyte determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King and Riley, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Storto and King, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pauli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glenn and Searles, 2001</xref>). We showed that germline depletion of Otu via RNAi phenocopies loss of <italic>sakura</italic>. Similar to Sakura, loss of <italic>otu</italic> inhibits Dpp/BMP signaling, resulting in low pMad levels in GSCs and Bam de-repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–B</xref>). Additionally, loss of <italic>otu</italic> also results in the loss of piRNA-mediated silencing, paralleling the effects of <italic>sakura</italic> loss. Furthermore, germline knockdown of <italic>otu</italic> yielded a similar ratio of germless ovaries as seen in <italic>sakura</italic>-RNAi, and simultaneous knockdown of both <italic>otu</italic> and <italic>sakura</italic> exacerbated the germless ovary phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that Sakura and Otu function together to regulate germ cell maintenance in the ovaries and are involved in Dpp/BMP signaling to balance stem cell renewal and differentiation.</p><p>Otu possesses deubiquitinase activity, catalyzed by its N-terminal Otu domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). In germ cells, Otu interacts with Bam, forming a deubiquitinase complex that deubiquitinates and thereby stabilizes CycA, promoting GSC differentiation. The predicted structure of Sakura and Otu complex suggests that the Mid domain of Sakura directly contacts the Otu domain of Otu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We found that Sakura lacks deubiquitinase activity and it does not directly affect Otu’s deubiquitinase rate in our in vitro assays using Ub-Rhodamine 110 as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>). This does not preclude the possibility that Sakura may still influence Otu’s deubiquitinase activity, potentially guiding Otu to its substrate and determining substrate specificity. Our in vitro assays may not have detected such specificity changes.</p><p>Otu is an RNA-binding protein whose deubiquitinase activity is enhanced by RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Bam, along with other proteins such as Bgcn, Mei-P26, and Sxl, binds nanos mRNA —a key stem cell maintenance factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Lin, 2004</xref>)— and represses its translation once germ cells have exited the GSC niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Lin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Bam and Otu form a protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies should explore whether Sakura modulates Otu’s RNA-binding properties and its interaction with other proteins. Although Sakura is exclusively expressed in ovaries, particularly in germline cells including GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), Otu is broadly expressed in various tissues, including testes and gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steinhauer and Kalfayan, 1992</xref>). This restricted expression pattern suggests that Sakura may serve as a female germline-specific cofactor that enhances or modifies Otu’s molecular functions. Identifying Otu’s RNA targets and deubiquitinase substrates beyond CycA, as well as determining how Sakura binding influences these activities, will be key to elucidating their roles in oogenesis. One intriguing possibility is that Sakura regulates Otu’s activity toward piRNA pathway components, thereby contributing to proper piRNA biogenesis and function. Additionally, the Sakura-Otu complex may directly regulate essential post-transcriptional processes such as <italic>sxl</italic> alternative splicing and translational control of other oogenic RNAs.</p><p>In summary, this study identifies and characterizes the previously unknown gene <italic>sakura</italic>, which is specifically expressed in female germ cells and is essential for oogenesis and female fertility. Together with its protein partner Otu, Sakura likely regulates germline cell fate, maintenance, and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>We generated the <italic>sakura</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> strain by introducing indels within the Sakura coding region using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system, as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu and Fukunaga, 2021</xref>).

Proteins were eluted with 40 μL acidic elution buffer (200 mM glycine pH 2.5) followed by immediate neutralization with 5 μL neutralization buffer (1 M Tris pH 10.4).</p><p>As a quality control before mass spectrometry, ~5 μL of the samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2x SDS PAGE loading buffer (80 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% [w/v] SDS, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 0.0006% [w/v] bromophenol blue, 2% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol), heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and run on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (Bio-Rad, #4561094). Silver staining was then performed by using the Pierce Silver Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher, 24612) to assess the quality of the immunoprecipitated protein samples. Mass spectrometry was conducted at the Mass Spectrometry Core at the Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu and Fukunaga, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Sakura protein, wild-type ovaries (w1118) were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% [v/v] IGEPAL CA-630) containing 1×protease inhibitor cocktail, centrifuged at 21,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the clear supernatant protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Four μg of rabbit anti-Sakura and normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, #2729) were incubated with 50 μL of Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher, 10004D) for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were washed once with PBST (1 x PBS with 0.1% Tween-20). The ovary lysate supernatant was then incubated with the washed beads at room temperature for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBST. The proteins were eluted with 2 x SDS-PAGE loading buffer (80 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% [w/v] SDS, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 0.0006% [w/v] bromophenol blue, 2% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. After bead separation using a magnetic tube rack, the eluted proteins in 2 x SDS-PAGE loading buffer were heated again at 95 °C for 3 min.</p><p>Transient protein expression in S2 cells was performed using the pAc5.1/V5-HisB plasmid vector (Invitrogen). A total of 1 μg plasmids were transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, 301425). Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 17,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the clear supernatants were collected for immunoprecipitation. For anti-HA immunoprecipitation, supernatants were incubated with 25 μL (0.25 mg) of Pierce Anti-HA Magnetic Beads (Thermo Fisher, 88837) at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were then washed three times with TBST (1 x TBS [0.05 M Tris/HCl and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.6] with 0.05% Tween-20). For anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, 2 μg of mouse anti-FLAG (1/10,000, Sigma, F1804) was incubated with 50 μL of Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher, 10004D) for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were washed once with PBST. The S2 cell lysate supernatant was incubated with the washed beads at room temperature for 15 min. The beads were washed three times with PBST. In both anti-HA and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations, proteins were eluted with 2x SDS PAGE loading buffer. For anti-HA, the beads in 2 x SDS-PAGE loading buffer were heated at 95 °C for 7 min. For anti-FLAG, the beads were heated at 70 °C for 10 min, then were separated using a magnetic tube rack. The eluted proteins in 2 x SDS-PAGE loading buffer were heated again at 95 °C for 3 min.</p><p>While the anti-Otu antibody worked in immunoprecipitation from ovaries, in subsequent anti-Sakura Western blot after anti-Otu IP, Otu antibody light chain bands often overlapped with the Sakura band.

There is no mention of this anywhere in the manuscript.</p><p>While our Sakura antibody detects Sakura in IF, it seems to detect some other proteins as well.

In Fig 5D, we are showing the numbers of stage 14 oocytes per fly (=per a pair of ovaries). ‘n’ is the number of flies (=number of a pair of ovaries) examined.
