It was previously shown that plants tolerate the generation of triparental polyspermy-derived plants and that polyspermy can bypass hybridization barriers. Polyspermy thus has the potential to harness previously incompatible climate-adapted wild varieties for plant breeding. However, factors that influence polyspermy frequencies were not previously known. The endopeptidases ECS1 and ECS2 have been reported to prevent the attraction of supernumerary pollen tubes by cleaving the pollen tube attractant LURE1. Here, we show that these genes have an earlier function that is manifested by incomplete double fertilization in plants defective for both genes. In addition to supernumerary pollen tube attraction, <italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> mutants exhibit a delay in synergid disintegration, are susceptible to heterofertilization, and segregate haploid plants that lack a paternal genome contribution. Our results thus uncover ECS1 and ECS2 as the first female factors triggering the induction of maternal haploids. Capitalizing on a high-throughput polyspermy assay, we in addition show that the double mutant exhibits an increase in polyspermy frequencies. As both haploid induction and polyspermy are valuable breeding aims, our results open new avenues for accelerated generation of climate-adapted cultivars.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polyspermy</kwd><kwd>haploid induction</kwd><kwd>double fertilization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>646644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groß-Hardt</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018703</institution-id><institution>European Innovation Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101057189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groß-Hardt</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The endopeptidases ECS1 and ECS2 regulate double fertilization and their modulation is a powerful tool for the induction of haploids and the formation of triparental plants, which are two agronomically relevant breeding targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexually reproducing organisms have evolved a plethora of ingenious tools to make gamete fusion a safe event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Iwao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tekleyohans and Groß-Hardt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toda and Okamoto, 2020</xref>). The production of supernumerary sperm is commonly found in both animals and plants, but this strategy comes with the risk of polyspermy. While polyspermy is lethal in most animals, molecular and genetic evidence for supernumerary sperm fusion in plant egg cells has long been lacking, and so has knowledge of the fate of a polyspermy-derived egg cell. In 2008 Rod Scott et al. made elegant use of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana tes</italic> mutants, which form pollen with supernumerary sperm, to show that, similar to animal systems, polyspermy in the egg cell is typically prevented by an efficient polyspermy block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Toda et al., 2016</xref> were later able to artificially bypass the polyspermy block using delicate electrofusion experiments and combined two sperms with a single egg to generate polyploid plants.</p><p>In 2017, we provided molecular and genetic evidence of egg polyspermy in planta capitalizing on a high-throughput polyspermy detection (HIPOD) assay, which was established in the Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakel et al., 2017</xref>). The assay consists of two pollen donors, that contain the individual elements of the yeast GAL4-UAS two-component system. The elements control expression of a herbicide resistance conferring gene, that consequently only gets activated if both paternal constructs are combined in a single egg cell. This enables the generation and identification of plants with three parents, one mother and two fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakel et al., 2017</xref>). Using a modified HIPOD assay that allows detection of embryos from three parents based on seed color, we also showed that polyspermy can specifically affect the egg cell, such that DNA of the second father bypasses DNA control mechanisms of the endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mao et al., 2020</xref>). This has significant implications for plant breeding, where the introduction of beneficial traits, for example from heat or drought-adapted wild species, is often prevented by hybridization barriers of the endosperm.</p><p>Plants can also be exposed to an insufficient number of fertilization-competent sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cyprys et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Takahashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">von Besser et al., 2006</xref>) in which case they activate a fertilization recovery program: The mechanism is triggered when fertilization in one of the female gametes stalls at the level of plasmo - or karyogamy and includes a transient halt of second synergid disintegration and concomitant attraction of supernumerary pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasahara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maruyama et al., 2013</xref>). This recovery program allows for recruitment of further sperm transporting pollen tubes and hence constitutes an important back-up mechanism.</p><p>Various proteases have previously been associated with the cortical reaction in animals, a fertilization-induced exocytosis of secretary granules that mediates a biochemical renovation of the egg coat to prevent further sperm entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Haley and Wessel, 1999</xref>). Based on the analysis of more than 450,000 seedlings, we here and in a preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mao et al., 2022</xref>) show that the aspartic endopeptidases ECS1 and ECS2 repress polyspermy. The defect is associated with a transient delay in synergid disintegration, supernumerary pollen tube attraction, and heterofertilization which are characteristic features of the fertilization recovery program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasahara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maruyama et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, we show that a fraction of <italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> double mutants exhibit defects in gamete fusion and segregate seeds lacking paternally contributed fluorescence marker either in embryo or endosperm indicative of single fertilization events. These results are in line with a recent report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2022</xref> concordantly showing that ECS1 and ECS2 are required for gamete attachment. Furthermore, we show that the double mutants segregate haploid plants, as later confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>. ECS1 and ECS2 have previously been demonstrated to prevent the attraction of supernumerary pollen tubes by cleaving the pollen tube attractant LURE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that polytubey is prevented by at least two different functions of ECS1 and ECS2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The aspartic proteases ECS1 and ECS2 negatively regulate polyspermy and the formation of triparental offspring</title><p>ECS1 and ECS2 were identified in a candidate gene approach for factors regulating polyspermy: T-DNA insertion lines for egg cell-expressed proteases, that is, <italic>ecs1</italic>, <italic>ecs2-1</italic>, <italic>ecs2-2</italic> single mutants, and <italic>ecs1 ecs2-1</italic> double mutants were subjected to HIPOD by synchronously applying the pollen of two fathers onto the stigmatic surface. One father contained a construct providing constitutive expression of the yeast transcription factor mGAL4-VP16 while the second father was engineered to express a herbicide conferring YFP-tagged BAR gene under the GAL4 responsive promoter UAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The resulting seedlings were subjected to herbicide selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and resistant plants were inspected under the fluorescence microscope for YFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The fusion of one egg cell with two sperm cells is expected to yield triploid rather than diploid offspring, which was demonstrated by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, we confirmed the triparental status of the seedlings by PCR, which revealed inheritance of GAL4 and UAS from the two genetically distinct fathers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). For wild-type Columbia plants, we recovered 19 triparental seedlings out of 92,680 seeds, corresponding to a polyspermy frequency of 0.041%. This is significantly higher than the polyspermy frequency previously recovered for the Landsberg accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakel et al., 2017</xref>), and experimentally re-assessed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). By comparison, we detected an up to threefold increase in polyspermy frequencies in <italic>ecs1 ecs2-1</italic> double mutants among the 77,441 seedlings analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

We next asked whether the polyspermy defect was of gametophytic origin. To answer this, we performed the polyspermy assay in <italic>ecs1/ecs1, ecs2-1/ECS2</italic> background, where each gynoecium is expected to segregate a 1:1 ratio of double and single mutant gametophytes. We first assessed <italic>ecs2-1</italic> segregation in the reference offspring population that was not herbicide treated by genotyping PCR and found an <italic>ECS2:ecs2-1</italic> ratio of 109:97, in line with the expected 1:1 segregation ratio. We furthermore reasoned that the segregation of the <italic>ecs2-1</italic> mutant allele would be enhanced in the triparental offspring if the absence of ECS2 in the female gametophyte positively affects polyspermy. Following herbicide selection of 78,338 seedlings, we recovered 24 triparental plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), of which 18 plants exhibited an <italic>ecs2-1</italic> tDNA-specific PCR product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), corresponding to an <italic>ECS2:ecs2-1</italic> ratio of 6:18. This finding fits well with the threefold increase in polyspermy frequency found in <italic>ecs1 ecs2-1</italic> double mutants. In addition, analysis of YFP-tagged ECS1 and ECS2 fusion proteins, as well as <italic>pECS1::NLS-tdTomato</italic> and <italic>pECS2::NLS-tdTomato</italic> promoter reporter constructs revealed that ECS1 and ECS2 are exclusively expressed in the egg cell prior to fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Together, these results indicate a gametophytic origin of the polyspermy defect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> mutants are defective in gamete fusion and activate a fertilization recovery program</title><p>Making use of aniline blue staining, we found the reproductive defect to be associated with an 8.4% increase in supernumerary pollen tube attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Polytubey in <italic>ecs1 ecs2-1</italic> double mutants was also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2021</xref>, who provide a compelling set of experiments to show that the endopeptidases cleave specific variants of LURE1. In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2021</xref>, however, we observed reproductive defects, reflected by 13% abnormal seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To investigate whether the phenotype was causally linked to ECS1 and ECS2, we first generated a second double mutant using the independent <italic>ecs2-2</italic> allele, which exhibited similar defects in seed development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Our results thus indicate that the seed defect in <italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> double mutants is caused by loss of ECS1 and ECS2. To determine whether the defect was due to the role of ECS1 and ECS2 in the male or female reproductive tissue, we conducted reciprocal crosses between the double mutant and wild type. While the introduction of the mutant alleles from the female crossing partner recapitulated the defect, the reciprocal cross yielded fertile seeds, suggesting that the defect was of female origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> double mutants exhibit reproductive defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Occurrence of polytubey in <italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> mutants 20 hr after pollination (HAP) (n=1039/835/1070 for wild type/<italic>ecs1 ecs2-1/ecs1 ecs2-2</italic>, respectively).

To substantiate this result, we performed a complementary approach and determined the chromosome number by chromosome spread. <italic>A. thaliana</italic> contains five different chromosomes and in the diploid Col-0 accession used in this study they exist in two copies. Notably, in nuclei of plants with short siliques and small flowers, we detected 5 instead of 10 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), confirming the haploid nature of these plants. To determine whether these haploids were of maternal origin, we conducted inter-accession crosses combining diploid <italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> in the Col-0 background with wild-type L<italic>er</italic> accession. We recovered eight haploid plants out of 934 F1 seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and profiled accession-dependent restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for each of the five chromosomes.

Thus, single fertilization of egg or central cell can be observed in <italic>ecs1 ecs2</italic> double mutants that contributes to seed abortion and can infrequently result in the generation of haploid plants. It also leads to delayed synergid disintegration and concomitant attraction of supernumerary pollen tubes. The supply of additional sperm cells can either lead to successful fertilization recovery or the induction of polyspermy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). It was recently reported that following successful double fertilization ECS1/2 are secreted and play a role in degradation of LURE peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). To what extent this process in addition contributes to supernumerary pollen tube attraction is currently unclear.</p><p>Taken together, we have shown that ECS1 and ECS2 regulate offspring genome size via haploid and polyspermy induction, two agriculturally highly relevant mechanisms.

For the analysis of seed development, the emasculated flowers were manually pollinated and collected as specified in the figure legends. For whole-mount clearings, samples were treated with acetic acid/ethanol (vol/vol=1:9) overnight, washed in a 80%, 70%, and 50% ethanol series and mounted in chloral hydrate:glycerol:water (8:2:1; wt:vol:vol)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gross-Hardt et al., 2007</xref>). For each experiment, more than five emasculated flowers or pollinated pistils were analyzed. With regard to the determination of persistent synergid cell, more than 10 pistils 19–21 hr after pollination (HAP) were scored and the data from the pistils containing less than 10 fertilized ovules were excluded. Cleared whole-mount ovules and seeds were analyzed under Zeiss Axioscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and the images were captured by Canon PowerShot G10 camera. Mature siliques were dissected and observed under Leica S6E or S8apo stereomicroscope (Leica, Germany).</p><p>For aniline blue staining, pistils were collected 20 HAP and processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mori et al., 2006</xref>).

I encourage authors to try this or a similar alternative experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The production of embryo-only seeds in ecs1 ecs2 mutants probably needs more explanation. They claimed that the embryo-only seeds could be observed in ecs1 ecs2 siliques. However, the embryo-only seeds in ecs1 ecs2 siliques are not reported in Jiang et al., (2022) and Zhang et al., (2023). Although the authors provided the reasons that this phenotype might result from the different growth conditions and developmental stages, the explanation is not satisfactory to me. I'm actually curious about one thing, that is, whether the percentage of the ovules with only embryo and arrested sperm cell nuclei is comparable with the percentage of embryo-only seeds (7.1%) in line 143. If they were comparable, the authors probably need to have a deeper discussion on how the egg cell- specifically expressed proteases only affect the interaction between the central cell and sperm cell in those embryo-only seeds. If they were not comparable, I probably have another explanation for these embryo-only seeds, that is, there is a possibility that both of the two sperm cells delivered by one pollen tube (in less pollinated condition) fertilize the egg cell simultaneously due to the polyspermy block defect in ecs1 ecs2 ovules. These ovules were not targeted by the second pollen tube, therefore the central cell did not fertilize in the end. Since the phenotype of having embryo-only seeds was completely not observed in the other two published papers, I would suggest the authors explain the cause of the embryo-only seeds more clearly.</p><p>2. In Figure 2B, the images of ecs1 ecs2 mutant siliques are not representative. The authors reported that there were two types of aborted seeds in siliques of ecs1 ecs2 mutants, including embryo-only seeds and endosperm-only seeds (Figure 2C). According to Xiong et al., (2021) and Li et al., (2022), embryo-only seeds do not enlarge and are small dot-like, which are significantly smaller than endosperm-only seeds and normal seeds. I notice that in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, they showed small dot-like embryo-only seeds and white-but-smaller endosperm-only seeds in the siliques of ecs1 ecs2-1×ecs1 ecs2-1. Thus, I would suggest the authors provide representative images of siliques of ecs1 and ecs2 which simultaneously show the two types of aborted seeds and mark them respectively in Figure 2B.</p><p>3. In Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, I notice that the frequency of unfused sperm cells in ecs1 ecs2 ovules is approximately 15% (in my own calculation), but this ratio is significantly higher than the percentage of polytubey in ecs1 ecs2 mutants (Figure 2A). Therefore, I think that the phenotype of unfused sperm cells can not be fully attributed to and explained by the mechanism that is reported by Yu et al., (2021).</p><p>4. The logic about how ECS1 and ECS2 participate in persistent synergid cell degeneration is a little bit confusing. The authors think that the defect of persistent synergid cell degeneration is caused by the defect of gamete fusion. However, in Figure 3A, they provided the persistent synergid cell nucleus in ovules undergoing successful double fertilization. The conclusion and the evidence are two different things. I suggest that the authors show ovules with gamete fusion defect and polytubey to support that persistent synergid cell degeneration is caused by the defect of gamete fusion. For example, provide the DIC image of the synergid nucleus in the embryo-only and endosperm-only ecs1 ecs2 ovules. I also suggest the authors discuss the relationship between ECS1/2 and EIN3/EIL1/EIN2 since the phenotype in figure 3A is very similar to those of ein3 eil1 and ein2 mutants. I'm very much curious about whether the EIN3-dependent ethylene-response cascade that is activated by fertilization of the egg cell is affected in ecs1 ecs2 ovules. Whether the affected cleavage of pollen tube attractant AtLURE1 is related to persistent synergid cell death/nucleus disintegration in ecs1 ecs2 ovules?</p><p>In Figure 3B, what do the &quot;unfertilized ovules&quot; indicate? (Based on my understanding, this type of seed has neither embryo nor endosperm). The authors should explain this type of ovule in detail here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85832.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

This experiment thus gives additional evidence, that after single fertilization of either egg or central cell, the fertilization recovery mechanism was activated and a second pollen tube (different color) was attracted and fertilized the hitherto unfertilized gamete. Please note that we found fertilization recovery at a frequency of 1.8 %, which is even slightly higher than the frequency reported by Maruyama et al. 2013 when using pollen tubes that contain a single sperm cell (1.2 %).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We cannot exclude the possibility that the first pollen tube delivers both sperm cells to the egg cell. However, we now provide an extra data set that shows that we do encounter single egg cell fertilization (EC only– Figure 3B).</p><p>While secretion of ECS1 could not be observed (Susaki et al., 2021) before fertilization, it is not unlikely that these molecules are secreted directly at the initiation of fertilization and thus likewise influence the correct fertilization of the central cell. In addition it was previously shown that aspartyl proteases of the same class contain small peptides that can be cleaved off and act as mobile signal transducers (Xia et al., 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We agree with the reviewer’s assessment. We, however, believe that it is difficult to directly compare two differently conducted experiments using two different methods. We determined the fertilization failure by checking the decondensation HTR10-RFP labelled sperm nuclei 8-10 HAP (Figure 3B) and the frequency of heterofertilization through dual pollination experiment (Figure 3C-E) see above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In the context of this particular experimental setup, we can only deduce that fertilization has occurred based on the division of the endosperm nuclei. At the same time, at this early stage the oocyte/zygote has not yet divided and therefore we cannot confidently distinguish between double fertilization or single fertilization of the central cell. Analysis of later time points requires introgression of fluorescent reporters which is beyond the time frame of this work but will be possible subsequently. We are sorry for the confusion and changed the figure caption accordingly (Figure 3A). In addition, we have included two experiments that clearly show single fertilization events (Figure 3B and Figure 3C-E). For further explanation of new experiments see above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also suggest the authors discuss the relationship between ECS1/2 and EIN3/EIL1/EIN2 since the phenotype in figure 3A is very similar to those of ein3 eil1 and ein2 mutants.

At the same time, we think that the involvement of the ethylene response cascade exceeds the scope of this report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3B, what do the &quot;unfertilized ovules&quot; indicate?
