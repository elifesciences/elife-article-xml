Optimal amounts of TG stores are desirable as insufficient capacity to store TG, as in lipodystrophy, or exceeding the capacity for storage, as in obesity, results in metabolic disease. We hypothesized that mice lacking TG storage in adipocytes would result in excess TG storage in cell types other than adipocytes and severe lipotoxicity accompanied by metabolic disease. To test this hypothesis, we selectively deleted both TG synthesis enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2, in adipocytes (ADGAT DKO mice). As expected with depleted energy stores, ADGAT DKO mice did not tolerate fasting well and, with prolonged fasting, entered torpor. However, ADGAT DKO mice were unexpectedly otherwise metabolically healthy and did not accumulate TGs ectopically or develop associated metabolic perturbations, even when fed a high-fat diet. The favorable metabolic phenotype resulted from activation of energy expenditure, in part via BAT (brown adipose tissue) activation and beiging of white adipose tissue. Thus, the ADGAT DKO mice provide a fascinating new model to study the coupling of metabolic energy storage to energy expenditure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd><kwd>lipodystrophy</kwd><kwd>triglyceride</kwd><kwd>fat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM124348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farese</surname><given-names>Robert V</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walther</surname><given-names>Tobias C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibiting triglyceride storage in adipose tissue prevents obesity and improves metabolic health.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because energy sources are not always available from the environment, many metazoan organisms have evolved the ability to store large amounts of metabolic energy as triglycerides (TGs) in adipose tissue. TG is particularly optimal for energy storage because it serves as stores of highly reduced carbon and does not require water for its storage. In cells, such as adipocytes, TGs are stored in organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). In adipocytes of mammals, TGs are stored in a unilocular adipocyte that fills the majority of the aqueous cytoplasm. Although TGs can also be found in LDs in other cell types (i.e., myocytes, hepatocytes, enterocytes), adipocytes represent by far the major energy depots in mammals.</p><p>Abundant evidence from many studies suggests that there is an optimal range for adipocyte TG storage in an organism. Exceeding the capacity to store TG in adipocytes occurs in obesity and is often accompanied by deposition of TG in other tissues and metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conversely, insufficient TG storage such as occurs in lipodystrophy is usually associated with adipocyte endocrine deficiency and similar metabolic derangements.</p><p>Here, we sought to test the requirement for TG storage in adipocytes in murine physiology at baseline and in response to high-fat feeding. We generated mice lacking both known TG synthesis enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cases et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cases et al., 2001</xref>), in adipocytes. We expected to generate a mouse model similar to those of classic lipodystrophy due to defects of TG storage in adipose tissue. Moreover, we hypothesized that these mice would have accumulation of TGs in other tissues, such as the liver or skeletal muscle, resulting in lipotoxicity and metabolic derangements, such as insulin resistance or fatty liver disease. To our surprise, we found the opposite result. We report here that selectively impairing TG storage in adipocytes leads to a unique murine model in which depletion of energy stores is not accompanied by metabolic derangements but instead results in protection from adverse metabolic effects, even with high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, due to activation of energy dissipation pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ADGAT DKO mice have reduced fat mass and TGs in adipose tissue</title><p>To generate mice lacking TGs in adipose tissue (ADGAT DKO), we crossed adipose tissue-specific <italic>Dgat1</italic> knockout mice (Cre-transgene expressed under control of the mouse adiponectin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eguchi et al., 2011</xref>] with <italic>Dgat2</italic> flox mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chitraju et al., 2019</xref>]).

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanning using <sup>18</sup>-fluoro-deoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>-FDG-PET/CT) showed that, after injection of β-3-adrenoceptor agonist (CL 316,243), BAT of chow-fed ADGAT DKO mice took up more glucose than BAT of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), presumably to fuel thermogenesis. In agreement with increased glucose uptake, glycogen levels in BAT of ADGAT DKO mice were increased in all conditions except 4°C cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The latter condition may reflect increased glycogen requirements in BAT of ADGAT DKO mice to maintain thermogenesis. This phenotype of DGAT-deficient BAT exhibiting increased glucose uptake and glycogen stores as an alternate fuel is consistent with our previous findings of BAT-specific knockout of both DGAT enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chitraju et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ADGAT DKO mice gradually activate an alternative mechanism to synthesize and store TGs</title><p>DGAT1 and DGAT2 appear to account for most of TG synthesis in mice. Newborn mice lacking both DGAT enzymes have &gt;95% reduction in whole body TGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stone et al., 2004</xref>), and adipocytes derived from fibroblasts lacking both enzymes fail to accumulate TGs or LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with this, histological analysis of WAT of 8-week-old ADGAT DKO mice showed fewer and much smaller LDs than control WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, by age 15 weeks, ADGAT DKO mice exhibited more LDs in iWAT than 8-week-old ADGAT DKO mice, suggesting that they activate alternate pathways to accumulate neutral lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This finding was more prominent in iWAT than in BAT. The neutral lipid that accumulated was BODIPY-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and TLC analysis of adipose tissue lipids from 15-week-old ADGAT DKO mice revealed the lipids to be TGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Feeding ADGAT DKO mice an HFD increased levels of TGs by ~twofold in iWAT at age 15 weeks, but the TG content of iWAT remained ~70% less than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The mass reduction of iWAT fat pads was accounted for predominantly by a decrease in TG mass per fat pad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>); protein levels per fat pad were similar to controls, and no other neutral lipids were detected. Lipid analyses of iWAT by mass spectrometry revealed that TG levels were reduced by ~80% across all detected TG species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In contrast, several phospholipids were substantially increased in iWAT of ADGAT DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), which may have contributed to the residual fat mass of the iWAT fat pads. Enzyme assays revealed that adipose tissues and isolated white adipocytes from 15-week-old chow-diet-fed ADGAT DKO mice had detectable (~20% of normal) DGAT activity in iWAT that was not inhibited by DGAT1- or DGAT2-specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). These data suggest that deletion of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in WAT induces a DGAT activity from an alternative enzyme, possibly from other candidates in the DGAT2 gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yen et al., 2005</xref>). mRNA levels for MGAT1 and MGAT2, enzymes in the same protein family as DGAT2, were increased in iWAT of ADGAT DKO mice and thus these proteins are candidates for this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Adipose tissue TG stores are required to maintain activity and body temperature during fasting</title><p>Because ADGAT DKO mice have severely decreased TG stores, we expected that they would not tolerate fasting well.

The resultant defect in TG stores had both expected and surprising effects on murine physiology. First, as expected, ADGAT DKO mice did not tolerate fasting well. At room temperature, fasted ADGAT DKO mice entered a torpor-like state, characterized by decreased ambulation and a drop in body temperature. Torpor is a physiological state that enables conservation of metabolic energy and the signals to induce this state are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gavrilova et al., 1999</xref>). The phenotype of ADGAT DKO mice suggests that depletion of adipocyte TG stores is sufficient to induce energy conservation and is somehow sensed.</p><p>A surprising feature of this mouse model is the apparent metabolic health, despite the reduced capacity to store lipids in the adipose tissue. Typically, loss of WAT leads to a condition known as lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mann and Savage, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patni and Garg, 2015</xref>). Lipodystrophy patients nearly always present with many metabolic derangements, including ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis), hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance or diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lawrence, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Misra and Garg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reitman, 2002</xref>). A characteristic feature of lipodystrophy is the decrease in levels of adipose tissue-derived hormones, such as leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman, 2019</xref>), and many derangements of lipodystrophies are corrected by leptin therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oral et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shimomura et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, the lipodystrophic ADGAT DKO mice with marked reductions in fat storage were metabolically healthy and did not develop metabolic derangements, such as diabetes or hepatic steatosis, even when fed an HFD. The metabolic health of the ADGAT DKO mice likely is due to their intact ability to make adipose tissue and to maintain adipose tissue endocrine function. These findings are consistent with previous data showing that cultured adipocytes differentiate normally in the absence of TG storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris et al., 2011</xref>). Adipose tissue of ADGAT DKO mice maintained the ability to synthesize and secrete adipose-derived hormones, such as leptin, which is crucially absent in typical lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shimomura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Savage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Leptin levels often correlate with adiposity and TG stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maffei et al., 1995</xref>), but ADGAT DKO mice exhibit a dissociation of TG stores with leptin expression, thereby showing that these parameters appear not to be causally related. Instead, leptin levels may be better correlated with other adipose properties, such as the number of adipocytes, as reflected in the observed correlation of leptin with adipose tissue mass.</p><p>Our studies revealed that, in response to the compromised ability to store TG in WAT and BAT, mice activate pathways of energy expenditure, including the generation of beige adipocytes and activation of BAT. Aspects of this phenotype were present even at thermoneutral conditions. The mechanisms underlying the activation of energy expenditure and beiging in ADGAT DKO mice are presently unclear, but may involve SNS stimulation. The lack of fatty acids in adipocytes may result in other available fuels (fatty acids and glucose) being routed to the BAT and beige adipocytes to maintain body temperature. One possible mechanism for the beiging and increased energy expenditure is that the ADGAT DKO mice secrete a factor (or factors) that activates the SNS and beiging pathway. Although currently such a factor remains to be identified, this model is reminiscent of global DGAT1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), which exhibit increased energy expenditure, enhanced glucose metabolism, protection from diet-induced obesity, and increased leptin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). For global DGAT1 knockout mice, fat transplant studies suggested the adipose tissue is the source of such factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Hormones that activate beiging, such as FGF21, are also testable candidate factors that may contribute to the ADGAT DKO phenotype. Many of the beneficial metabolic effects that we found in ADGAT DKO mice, including increased energy expenditure, increased glucose uptake by BAT, and torpor and browning, are found in murine models with increased levels of FGF21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Owen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inagaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>). However, an endocrine effect of FGF21 seems unlikely in these mice due to similar levels of the hormone in plasma of HFD-fed mice. We note, however, that a paracrine effect is not excluded. Crossing ADGAT DKO mice with FGF21 knockout mice would further test FGF21’s contribution to the metabolic phenotype of these mice. It would also be interesting to inhibit both DGAT enzymes at early or late time points in adipocyte differentiation and determine if endocrine or paracrine factors were altered, which might explain the systemic effect on metabolism.</p><p>In summary, ADGAT DKO mice represent an intriguing model in which a marked reduction in the ability to store TG in adipocytes triggers organismal pathways of energy dissipation. This suggests that exceeding the capacity to store energy in adipocytes is somehow sensed and triggers thermogenesis in adipose tissue. This phenotype likely requires an intact adipocyte endocrine system, which was found in ADGAT DKO mice but is often deficient in other models of lipodystrophy. The exact mechanism for how a TG storage defect triggers energy dissipation is currently unclear, but unraveling of this mechanism could lead to new strategies for treating or reducing obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

To the dried lipids, 100–300 µl of 0.1% Triton X-100 was added, and the solution was sonicated using ultrasonic homogenizer (Biologics, Inc, model 3000MP) for 10 s with 30% amplitude. The total TG content was measured using the Infinity TGs reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. TG and total cholesterol were measured using Infinity TGs reagent (Thermo Scientific) and a cholesterol E kit (Wako Diagnostics), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Tissue lysates (50 μg) were transferred to a pyrex glass tubes with a PTFE-liner cap. Lipids were extracted by Folch method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Folch et al., 1957</xref>), briefly, 6 ml of ice-cold chloroform-methanol (2:1 vol/vol) and 1.5 ml of water were added to the samples, and tubes were vortexed thoroughly to mix the samples homogenously with a polar and non-polar solvent. SPLAH mix internal standards were spiked in before the extraction. The organic phase of each sample was normalized by total soluble protein amounts and measured by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23225, Waltham, MA, USA). After vortexing, samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 1100 rpm at 4°C to separate the organic and inorganic phases. Using a sterile glass pipette, the lower organic phase was transferred into a new glass tube, taking care to avoid the intermediate layer of cellular debris and precipitated proteins. The samples were dried under nitrogen flow until the solvents were completely dried. Samples were resuspended in 250 μl of chloroform:methanol 2:1 and stored in –80°C until mass spectrometer (MS) analysis. Lipids were separated using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with tandem MS. Briefly, UHPLC analysis was performed on a C30 reverse-phase column (Thermo Acclaim C30, 2.1×250 mm, 3 μm operated at 55°C; Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system and a QExactive orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization probe. Five μl of each sample was analyzed separately, using positive and negative ionization modes. Mobile phase contained 60:40 water:acetonitrile (vol:vol), 10 mM ammonium formate, and 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 90:10 2-propanol/acetonitrile, also including 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. MS spectra of lipids were acquired in full-scan/data-dependent MS2 mode. For the full-scan acquisition, the resolution was set to 70,000, the AGC target was 1e6, the maximum injection time was 50 ms, and the scan range was m/z=133.4–2000. For data-dependent MS2, the top 10 ions in each full scan were isolated with a 1.0 Da window, fragmented at a stepped normalized collision energy of 15, 25, and 35 units, and analyzed at a resolution of 17,500 with an AGC target of 2e5 and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Peak identification and data analysis were carried out using Lipid Search software version 4.1 SP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taguchi and Ishikawa, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Metabolomic analysis</title><p>BAT and iWAT was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground at cryogenic temperature with a cyromill (Retsch, Newtown, PA, USA).

Samples were vigorously vortexed and centrifuged at 4°C at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to LC-MS vials for analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed using XBridge BEH Amide XP Column (2.5 µm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm) with associated guard column (2.5 µm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase A was 95% water and 5% acetonitrile, containing 10 mM ammonium hydroxide and 10 mM ammonium acetate. The mobile phase B was 80% acetonitrile and 20% water, with 10 mM ammonium hydroxide and 10 mM ammonium acetate. The linear elution gradient was: 0–3 min, 100% B; 3.2–6.2 min, 90% B; 6.5–10.5 min, 80% B; 10.7–13.5 min, 70% B; 13.7–16 min, 45% B; and 16.5–22 min, 100% B. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. The autosampler was maintained at 4°C. The injection volume was 5 µl, and needle wash was performed between samples using 40:40:20 methanol:acetonitrile:water. The MS used was Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA), and scanned from 70 to 1000 m/z with switching polarity. The resolution was 120,000. Metabolites were identified based on accurate mass and retention time using an in-house library, and the software used was EI-Maven (Elucidata, Cambridge, MA, USA). Data was analyzed using R software (version 4.2.0). The ion intensity of each sample was first normalized to the corresponding sample protein content. Differentially abundant metabolites were analyzed with the limma R/Bioconductor package, and the multiple comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (adjusted p value; q value). The volcano plots were generated using the ggplot and ggrepel packages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± SD (standard deviation).

The authors claim the beiging of WAT of ADGAT DKO mice is partially through the SNS; however, housing these mice at thermoneutrality did not block the beiging, which seems to negate that claim. Is there evidence of increased cAMP/PKA activation in the adipose tissues of ADGAT DKO to support the premise that the beiging is activated by the SNS, even at thermoneutrality? Alternatively, if the authors block beta-adrenergic receptors with antagonists, such as propranolol, does this block the beiging?</p></disp-quote><p>We are currently unsure of the mechanism(s) for WAT beiging and whether it requires the SNS. We attempted denervation experiments to ablate SNS input; however, the results were consistent with partial denervation and not clearly interpretable, so we elected not to include them in the manuscript. Unfortunately, we did not measure cAMP/PKA activation or utilize beta blockers in attempt to block SNS activation. Due to a recent laboratory move, there are no study mice available to perform these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It's been shown that autocrine FGF21 signaling is sufficient to promote beiging of iWAT (PMID 34192547). The authors show Fgf21 mRNA is increased in iWAT of chow-fed ADGAT DKO mice. Is Fgf21 also increased in iWAT of HFD-fed mice? This and measurement of local FGF21 secretion by adipocytes would strengthen this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Unfortunately, we did not measure Fgf21 mRNA levels in iWAT of HFD-fed mice or FGF21 secretion by adipocytes and mice are not currently available. We agree, however, that FGF21 is a candidate for mediating this phenotype. Testing this idea would likely require crossing the ADGAT DKO mice with FGF21 KO mice. Arguing against FGF21 as contributing systemically, plasma levels were similar in HF-fed ADGAT DKO mice and controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The primary adipocytes in Figure 5–figure supplement 2A do not appear to have any depletion in TG stores, suggesting this may not be an appropriate model to study the cell autonomous effects of ADGAT DKO on beiging. The authors should use DGAT inhibitors instead to corroborate or investigate this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that primary adipocytes from ADGAT DKO mice may not be the best model to study the cell autonomous effects of beiging, particularly since they are accumulating lipids. On the other hand, it’s not likely that DGAT inhibitors would be any better than the genetic deletions of the enzymes. Presumably, the neutral lipids are being synthesized by enzymes other than DGAT1 or DGAT2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Multiple studies have shown the importance of lipolysis for the activation of brown and beige thermogenic programs (PMID 35803907, 34048700) and can be potentiated by HFD feeding (PMID 34048700). In the absence of DGAT activity in ADGAT DKO mice, it seems plausible that free fatty acids could be elevated, especially in the context of HFD. Are free fatty acids elevated in the adipose tissues, which could promote thermogenic gene expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Although we cannot exclude this mechanism, arguing against it, we found lower levels of almost all free fatty acid species in iWAT of chow diet fed ADGAT DKO (Figure 5–figure supplement 1, metabolomics). Additionally, plasma FFA were reduced in these mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The lack of ectopic lipid deposition in the ADGAT DKO mice is striking, especially under HFD conditions. Can the increased energy expenditure fully account for the difference in whole body fat accumulation between Control and DKO mice or have the mice activated other energy disposal mechanisms? Please discuss or include measurement of fat excretion in the feces to strengthen this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Although decreased lipid absorption may conceivably contribute to energy loss, we would not expect this to occur in adipocyte-specific knockout mice, and we did not measure the lipid content in the feces. We have added a discussion point to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors wish to clarify the following points to strengthen this exciting work further.</p><p>1. The authors demonstrated that DKO mice exhibited enhanced browning of WAT even under a thermoneutral condition, and this occurred in a non-cell autonomous fashion. Accordingly, the authors suggested the possibility that SNS activity was enhanced in DKO mice. It would be intriguing to examine the extent to which lipolysis is indeed enhanced in DKO mice. For instance, do DKO mice have higher FFA and glycerol levels than controls in circulation? This could explain a part of the phenotype, as a recent work suggested that WAT lipolysis triggers beige progenitor cell proliferation in WAT.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Although this is an interesting idea, we found that ADGAT DKO mice have lower levels of free fatty acids and glycerol in the circulation, indicating lipolysis not likely the underlying mechanism for increased beiging in ADGAT DKO mice. FFA were also reduced in the iWAT of the ADGAT DKO mice (as shown in supplemental data for Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors suggested the possibility that other candidates in the DGAT2 gene family might compensate for the lack of DGAT1 and DGAT2. It will be insightful if the authors elaborate on this part - e.g., discussing any transcriptional changes of DGAT2 family members in the WAT of DKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Previous studies showed (Yen et al., 2005), monoacylglycerol acyl transferase (MGAT) enzymes also possess some TG synthesis activity. We found increased mRNA expression of MGAT1 and MGAT2 enzymes in white adipose tissue of ADGAT DKO mice. We now included this data in Figure 1–figure supplement 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Minor: Statistics of the AUC for the GTT and ITT (Fig. 3G and 3H).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We have now updated the figures with statistics of the AUC for GTT and ITT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The authors suggest that the DKOs are protected against a high-fat diet due to an intact endocrine function combined with increased FA oxidation and WAT browning. This phenotype is interesting but as the authors write, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, how important is retained endocrine function, in relation to WAT browning, in explaining the resistance to a high-fat diet in the DKOs? As these mice are born with the double DGAT KO and it is possible that compensatory mechanisms explain some of the observed effects. What happens with the endocrine function/browning effect if DGAT1/2 is inhibited in cells that already contain full TG stores? While I understand that studies in an inducible KO model are outside the scope of this study, data in cells where the effects of DGAT inhibition are studied early and late during differentiation would be interesting and could at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. It is possible that ADGAT DKO have adipose tissue-derived factors that act in endocrine or paracrine manner to induce beiging. Unfortunately, we do not have data addressing this point, but added discussion of this point to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. While the possibility to dissociate TG storage from the endocrine function of WAT is attractive, the authors have only studied two adipokines. Do they have data on any other adipokine(-s) supporting the claim that the secretory function is intact?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Regrettably we did not measure additional adipokines, and the mice are no longer available for study due to a recent lab move.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments/suggestions:</p><p>1. The authors show multiple phospholipid species were increased by ADGAT DKO. Cardiolipin has been shown to promote brown fat thermogenesis (PMID 29861389). Were cardiolipin levels changed by ADGAT DKO?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We found cardiolipin levels were increased in iWAT of ADGAT DKO mice. However, we have not measured cardiolipin levels in brown fat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A recent study (PMID 36914626) has shown that inhibition of lipogenesis in adipose tissue impairs autophagy and also causes beiging of white adipose tissue. Is autophagy affected by ADGAT DKO? Are de novo lipogenesis enzymes affected by the DKO?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion. We did find that mRNA levels of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis (Srebp1c, Acc, Fas) were decreased in iWAT of ADGAT DKO mice, as expected from some of our other studies involving DGAT inactivation. Unfortunately, we did not measured autophagy per se in iWAT of ADGAT DKO mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
