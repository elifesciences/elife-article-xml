environment are often critical for selecting actions that achieve desired goals. The success of these goal-directed actions relies on 3D sensorimotor transformations that are experience-dependent. Here we investigated the relationships between the robustness of 3D visual representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity in parietal cortex. Macaque monkeys performed an eight-alternative 3D orientation discrimination task and a visually guided saccade task while we recorded from the caudal intraparietal area using laminar probes. We found that neurons with more robust 3D visual representations preferentially carried choice-related activity. Following the onset of choice-related activity, the robustness of the 3D representations further increased for those neurons. We additionally found that 3D orientation and saccade direction preferences aligned, particularly for neurons with choice-related activity, reflecting an experience-dependent sensorimotor association. These findings reveal previously unrecognized links between the fidelity of ecologically relevant object representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd>parietal cortex</kwd><kwd>choice activity</kwd><kwd>3D vision</kwd><kwd>oculomotor</kwd><kwd>nuisance variables</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

The parietal cortex is an important site of sensorimotor transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rushworth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buneo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brovelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buneo and Andersen, 2006</xref>). Parietal lesions can result in deficits associated with the impaired use of sensory information to create and execute motor plans, as opposed to deficits in sensory processing or action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pause and Freund, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pause et al., 1989</xref>). However, they can also produce 3D visual processing deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holmes, 1918</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holmes and Horrax, 1919</xref>). Although sensorimotor transformations are widely studied using two-dimensional (2D) stimulus paradigms, mappings between 3D object information and motor responses are essential in the natural world. Thus, parietal cortex may have a fundamental role in creating robust 3D representations and mapping them to specific actions.</p><p>Within parietal cortex, a major site of 3D visual processing is the caudal intraparietal (CIP) area. Neurons in CIP are tuned for 3D orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>) signaled by multiple cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsutsui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenberg and Angelaki, 2014b</xref>) and perform multisensory processing required for gravity-centered vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosenberg and Angelaki, 2014a</xref>). In addition to high-level sensory representations, CIP activity correlates with the short-term memory and perceptual matching of 3D features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsutsui et al., 2003</xref>) and choices made during a binary orientation discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, inactivating CIP impairs 3D feature discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Dromme et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The anatomical projections and effective connectivity of CIP suggest that it may contribute to goal-directed sensorimotor transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Premereur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Dromme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lanzilotto et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, CIP projects to areas involved in motor planning and execution through eye and hand movements, including the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennur and Gold, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shushruth et al., 2018</xref>), anterior intraparietal (AIP) area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pani et al., 2014</xref>), and V6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fattori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fattori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breveglieri et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is unknown if CIP neurons carry motor-related signals, and if so, whether they form sensorimotor associations.</p><p>Here we investigated the relationships between sensory representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity in CIP. Neuronal activity was recorded while macaque monkeys performed an eight-alternative forced choice (8AFC) tilt discrimination task with planar surfaces at different slants and distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). The neurons differed in the extent to which their orientation tuning depended on distance. Choice-related activity was preferentially carried by neurons whose 3D orientation selectivity was more tolerant to distance and associated with further increases in tolerance. Neuronal choice tuning was parametric and the choice and surface tilt preferences generally aligned. A comparison of results from monkeys trained to report opposite stimulus features (i.e. the near versus far side of the plane; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>) indicated that the alignment was experience dependent. Motor-related activity was also assessed for the first time in CIP using a visually guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Munoz and Wurtz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanes and Schall, 1996</xref>). Many neurons had saccade direction tuning and the saccade direction and surface tilt preferences generally aligned. This sensorimotor association was strongest for neurons with choice-related activity.</p><p>These results reveal systematic relationships between sensory representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity in CIP. Neurons with more robust 3D representations (i.e. those whose 3D orientation selectivity was more tolerant to distance) were most strongly coupled to behavior. Beyond traditional associations between neuronal choice-related activity and decision processes, our findings identify links to the fidelity of high-level sensory representations and the strength of sensorimotor associations. The coupling of sensory and motor functions at the level of single CIP neurons may facilitate sensorimotor transformations over short timescales that enable successful interactions with the 3D world.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We tested three hypotheses about the relationships between sensory representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity. First, that neurons with more robust 3D representations would preferentially carry choice-related activity. Second, that choice-related activity would be associated with further increases in the robustness of 3D selectivity, not the attenuation of information not directly relevant to the task at hand (i.e. nuisance variables). Third, that sensorimotor associations would be experience dependent and stronger for neurons with choice-related activity.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying behavioral sensitivity to 3D surface tilt</title><p>Testing our hypotheses required a protocol that could be used to simultaneously measure the 3D visual sensitivity of the monkeys as well as quantify the 3D selectivity of individual neurons. To this end, we developed an 8AFC tilt discrimination task in which the side of a viewed plane that was nearest was reported through a saccade to one of eight choice targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then trained two monkeys to perform this task under different viewing conditions that determined the task difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, by presenting planes at multiple combinations of tilt, slant, and distance we could assess how 3D visual sensitivity and neuronal responses depended on 3D surface pose (i.e. orientation and position).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task, stimuli, and performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tilt discrimination task. After fixating a target at the center of the screen for 300 ms, a plane was shown for 1 s while fixation was maintained. The target and plane then disappeared and eight choice targets appeared.

Tilt (0° ≤ T &lt; 360°) specifies the direction that the plane is oriented in depth. For example, T = 0° indicates right-near and T = 90° indicates top-near. Planes were presented at eight tilts (0° to 315°, 45° steps), corresponding to the eight choice options. Slant (0° ≤ S ≤ 90°) specifies the amount of depth variation. Larger slants indicate greater depth variation. Because a frontoparallel plane (S = 0°) has no depth variation, tilt is undefined at that orientation. As such, frontoparallel planes were ambiguous stimuli in the task and no correct response could be objectively defined. Planes were presented at five slants (0° to 60°, 15° steps). All combinations of these tilts and slants (N = 33 unique orientations) were presented at four distances: 37, 57, 97, and 137 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, we measured behavioral and neuronal responses to 132 surface poses.</p><p>Behavioral performance was quantified for each combination of tilt, slant, and distance using the distribution of reported tilt errors (ΔTilt = reported tilt – presented tilt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). The sensitivity to each stimulus condition was defined as the concentration parameter (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) of the von Mises probability density function fit to the corresponding error distribution (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) and was calculated for each session (Monkey L: N = 26; Monkey F: N = 27). For both monkeys, we found that sensitivity significantly depended on slant (four-way ANOVA, both p≤6.0x10<sup>−11</sup>) and distance (both p≤1.3x10<sup>−34</sup>) but not tilt (linearized into cosine and sine components, all four p≥0.21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher, 1995</xref>). We therefore summarized sensitivity as a function of slant and distance calculated over all tilts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings in which performance in the 8AFC tilt discrimination task was extensively analyzed over a wider range of 3D poses and multiple visual cue conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>), sensitivity decreased with distance from fixation (57 cm) and increased with slant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The representation of 3D surface pose by CIP neurons</title><p>We next needed to quantify the representation of 3D surface pose in CIP. Although previous studies examined the 3D orientation selectivity of CIP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsutsui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsutsui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosenberg and Angelaki, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenberg and Angelaki, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>), it is currently unknown how that selectivity depends on distance. This information is important because it can distinguish 3D representations from sensitivity to lower-level features (e.g. local binocular disparity cues) that co-vary with changes in object pose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyenkim and DeAngelis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alizadeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>). To disentangle these possibilities, we measured how the 3D orientation tuning depended on the surface’s distance with the fixation distance held constant. With this protocol, robust 3D selectivity is indicated if the orientation selectivity (tuning curve shape) is tolerant to the distance (though the gain can change, reflecting distance tuning). In contrast, sensitivity to lower-level features is implied if the selectivity substantially changes with distance. To quantify the representation of 3D surface pose in CIP while the monkeys performed the behavioral task, we recorded from 437 neurons using laminar array probes (Monkey L: N = 218; Monkey F: N = 219; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neuronal recordings.</title><p>Coronal MRI sections showing the estimated boundaries of CIP (light blue) and neighboring regions (see Materials and methods).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, we show response time courses for an example neuron and the population to preferred and non-preferred stimuli. The median visual response latency was 52 ms and the population responses to preferred and non-preferred stimuli became significantly different at 58 ms (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05), indicating that selectivity for 3D surface pose started early in the response. The onset of choice-related activity in the population response followed at 202 ms (calculated in a subsequent section). To test our hypotheses regarding associations between 3D selectivity and choice-related activity, we operationally defined two time windows for performing analyses. The first window captured the sensory dominant (SD) activity and was defined from the median visual response latency to the onset of choice-related activity in the population response. We confirm that choice-related activity was not detectable within the SD window in a subsequent section, but nevertheless refer to this window as ‘sensory dominant’ to reflect the possibility that some choice-related activity (e.g. at the tail end of the window) could have gone undetected. The second window contained sensory plus choice (SPC) activity in the population response and was defined from the onset of choice-related activity to the end of the stimulus presentation. In this section, we quantify the representation of 3D surface pose during the SD window. In a subsequent section, we characterize how the representation differed in the SPC window. The 3D pose tuning curves of five neurons measured during the SD window are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

To quantify how well CIP activity conformed to this ideal, we fit each neuron’s responses with a separable model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>). The model captured how well a neuron’s joint tuning for orientation and distance was described by the multiplication of a 3D orientation tuning curve and a distance tuning curve (this model performed significantly better than an additively separable model for every neuron, see Materials and methods). A Tolerance index was then defined as the average correlation between the responses and fit at each distance. Values near one indicate that the shape of the orientation tuning curves was more tolerant to distance. Values near 0 indicate that the shape changed substantially with distance, as expected for neurons sensitive to lower-level visual features. Some neurons were highly tolerant, indicating robust 3D pose tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; Tolerance = 0.88). Others had modest tolerances, suggesting intermediate representations between lower-level features and 3D pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; Tolerance = 0.53). Yet others had low tolerances, consistent with lower-level feature selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; Tolerance = 0.34 and 0.24, respectively). A minority had stronger distance than orientation selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Indeed, 62 neurons (14%) were distance (two-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.05) but not orientation (p≥0.05) selective. Across the population, the mean Tolerance was 0.58 ± 0.15 standard deviation (Std Dev; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The 3D orientation preferences of CIP neurons were previously found to be uniformly distributed when measured at the fixation distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>). To test if this finding held across surface distance (with constant fixation distance), preferences were estimated by fitting a Bingham function to each significant orientation tuning curve (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05, Bonferroni-Holm corrected for each neuron). Consistent with the previous result, the distribution of tilt preferences was not significantly different from uniform at any distance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>; 37, 57, and 97 cm: p≥0.43; 137 cm: p=0.03, not significant after Bonferroni-Holm correction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Likewise, the distribution of slant preferences at 57 cm (fixation distance) was not significantly different from uniform (p=0.13). However, the distributions of slant preferences were significantly different from uniform at 37, 97, and 137 cm (all p≤1.2x10<sup>−3</sup> and Bonferroni-Holm corrected). At each of these distances, the mean slant preference across the population was larger than at 57 cm. We therefore wanted to identify the neuronal factors underlying this dependency.</p><p>One possibility was that the slant preferences of individual neurons increased with distance from fixation. To test this, we performed pairwise comparisons of the slant preferences of individual neurons with significant orientation tuning at adjacent distances (within-neuron analysis). Indeed, the preferences tended to increase between 57 and 97 cm (mean ΔSlant = 5.3°; paired t-test, p=1.1×10<sup>−3</sup>, N = 144 tuned at both distances) as well as between 97 and 137 cm (mean ΔSlant = 4.3°; p=9.7×10<sup>−3</sup>, N = 87 tuned at both distances). These results indicate an inseparability in the 3D pose tuning such that the slant preferences tended to increase with distance behind fixation. The slant preferences of individual neurons were also larger at 37 than 57 cm, but the difference was not significant (mean ΔSlant = 2.1°; p=0.19, N = 209 tuned at both distances). This finding suggests a second (not mutually exclusive) possibility that neurons tuned for distances away from fixation tended to prefer larger slants. To test this, we compared the slant preferences of neurons tuned at 57 cm only (N = 75) to the slant preferences of the combined set of neurons tuned at 37, 97, or 137 only (N = 31). Consistent with this possibility, the mean slant preference of neurons tuned at a single distance away from fixation was 7.6° greater than for neurons tuned only at fixation (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=0.02). Thus, the larger mean slant preferences at distances away from fixation reflected an inseparability in the 3D pose tuning of individual neurons as well as a tendency for neurons that represented distances away from fixation to prefer larger slants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neuronal correlates of 3D tilt sensitivity</title><p>We next wanted to compare the behavioral and neuronal findings. Two prominent features of the behavioral data were increasing tilt sensitivity as a function of slant and an inverted U-shape relationship between tilt sensitivity and distance that peaked at the fixation distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings prompted us to test if behavioral tilt sensitivity was related to the ability to discriminate preferred from non-preferred tilts using individual neuron responses (during the SD window to minimize potential choice-related activity). For each neuron and slant–distance combination, we calculated a tilt discrimination index (TDI) that quantified the strength of response modulation across tilts relative to the overall response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prince et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). The behavioral tilt sensitivities (averaged over sessions) and TDI values (averaged over neurons) followed similar trends: both increased as a function of slant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and had an inverted U-shape relationship with distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Indeed, across all sixteen slant–distance combinations, the tilt sensitivities and TDI values were highly correlated (Monkey L: r = 0.95, p=2.2×10<sup>−308</sup>; Monkey F: r = 0.93, p=2.2×10<sup>−308</sup>). Thus, the 3D tilt sensitivity of the monkeys was closely related to the tilt discriminability of CIP neurons over a wide range of viewing conditions.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Neuronal correlates of 3D tilt sensitivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean behavioral tilt sensitivity (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and neuronal tilt discrimination index (TDI) values during the SD window increased with slant.

That model predicted a monotonic relationship between behavioral tilt sensitivity and the population response amplitude. To test this prediction, we compared the average tilt sensitivity at each slant–distance combination to the corresponding amplitude of the tilt tuning curves averaged over all neurons during the SD window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistent with the prediction, tilt sensitivity increased as a function of response amplitude (Monkey L: Spearman r = 0.95, p=2.2×10<sup>−308</sup>; Monkey F: r = 0.87, p=2.2×10<sup>−308</sup>). This result parallels the strong correlation between tilt sensitivity and TDI value (which depends on response modulation and variability). The finding that the neuronal responses predicted behavioral sensitivity across performance levels ranging from near-chance to near-perfect suggests that CIP activity may constrain the precision of tilt perception.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences</title><p>To test our hypotheses regarding the fidelity of 3D visual representations and choice-related activity, we needed to classify the neurons according to whether or not they carried choice-related activity. To ensure that we distinguished choice-related activity from tilt-selective responses, we performed the classification using responses to frontoparallel planes (S = 0°) only. Because tilt is undefined at that orientation, the stimuli were task-ambiguous. To increase the statistical power, we combined responses across all distances after separately z-scoring them at each distance. Responses were then grouped according to the choice made on each trial.</p><p>An advantage of the 8AFC task was that it could reveal parametric choice tuning, which is not possible with typical binary choice tasks. We therefore computed eight population-level time courses relative to the choice that elicited the maximum response for each neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The responses first showed an initial response transient that was sensory dominant and therefore untuned since only frontoparallel plane responses (z-scored at each distance) were included. They then began to show parametric tuning with amplitudes that fell off symmetrically with greater deviation from the preferred choice (note the similarity of the ±45°, ±90°, and ±135° curves). The onset of choice-related activity (202 ms) was defined as the first time point that the time courses significantly diverged (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). As discussed above, this time point was used to operationally define two response epochs: a sensory dominant (SD) window and a sensory plus choice (SPC) window.

The surface tilt and choice preferences of the example neurons aligned, even for the neuron with stronger distance than orientation tuning. To quantify this relationship across the population, we used the orientation preferences measured at each distance to compute a principal orientation preference for each neuron (SD window only; see Materials and methods and Figure 7D). We then compared the principal surface tilt and choice preferences from the von Mises fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The median circular difference between the preferences was −8.3° and not significantly different from 0° (circular median test, p=0.24; N = 166 neurons with orientation and choice tuning), indicating that the sensory and choice preferences generally aligned.</p><p>Because the SD and SPC windows were defined using a population-level measure, a potential concern was that they were not sensitive to individual neuron differences in the onset of choice-related activity, which could inadvertently introduce choice-related activity into the SD window. We therefore tested each neuron for choice-related activity in the SD window (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). Consistent with the expected rate of false positives, the result of this test was significant for only 5% of neurons (22/437, none were example neurons) and not associated with the classification of having choice-related activity since only 13 had significant choice tuning in the SPC window. Moreover, excluding those 22 neurons did not significantly affect the mean Tolerances of neurons with or without choice-related activity in either time window (t-test, all four p≥0.64). These findings suggest that the SD and SPC windows defined reliable, functionally distinct response epochs at the individual neuron level. Another potential concern was that the SPC window was longer than the SD window. We therefore tested a short SPC window (850 ms – 1 s) that matched the duration of the SD window (150 ms) and found similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Thus, the full SPC window was sufficient to characterize choice tuning and its relationship to surface tilt selectivity. To further validate the time-course of choice-related activity, we performed demixed principal component analysis and classified the behavioral choices using the choice projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Following the cross-validation procedures of Kobak and colleagues, the classification accuracy did not exceed chance level until 232 ms, providing a second estimate of the onset of choice-related activity. Note that we used the more stringent estimate of 202 ms in our analyses. Together, these findings corroborated the distinction between the SD and SPC windows.</p><p>We wanted to further evaluate if the alignment of preferred surface tilts and choice report directions reflected a naturally occurring correspondence or a learned association. The current experiment was designed to distinguish between these possibilities through a comparison with results from another recent CIP study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>). The two studies trained monkeys to report opposite features of viewed planar surfaces. For this study, we trained monkeys to report the near side of the plane. In contrast, the previous study trained monkeys to report the far side. This difference allowed us to test if the alignment of preferred surface tilts and choice report directions was experience dependent since opposite choice report directions were required for the same surface tilt. Importantly, we found that the alignment was reversed in the two data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, consider a typical neuron preferring a bottom-near plane (T = 270°). If the monkey was trained to report the near side, downward (upward) choice reports were associated with stronger (weaker) neuronal responses. Thus, a preference for bottom-near planes aligned with a preference for downward choice reports (which, based on the training, were used to indicate T = 270°). In contrast, if the monkey was trained to report the far side, upward (downward) choice reports were associated with stronger (weaker) responses. Thus, a preference for bottom-near planes aligned with a preference for upward choice reports (which, based on that training, were used to indicate T = 270°). Thus, how a neuron’s preferred choice report direction aligned with its surface tilt preference depended on the task training. This comparison indicates that the association between 3D orientation selectivity and choice report directions did not simply reflect a natural correspondence but was instead flexible and experience dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Choice-related activity was associated with more robust 3D selectivity</title><p>The above analyses identified response epochs that were either sensory dominant (SD) or contained sensory plus choice (SPC) activity, and two neuronal subpopulations based on whether or not they had choice-related activity. These distinctions allowed us to next test our hypotheses regarding the fidelity of 3D visual representations and choice-related activity by comparing the 3D pose tuning curves across the time windows and subpopulations. To illustrate how the tuning curves changed across the time windows, the example neurons’ 3D pose tuning curves measured during the SPC window are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref>. First, consider the three neurons with orientation and choice tuning. The selectivity of the neuron with high Tolerance in the SD window changed little and its Tolerance slightly increased: ΔTolerance = 0.08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Strikingly, the orientation tuning of the neuron with intermediate Tolerance in the SD window aligned across all four distances in the SPC window to match the tuning at the preferred distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). Its Tolerance greatly increased: ΔTolerance = 0.35. For the neuron with low tolerance in the SD window, responses at non-preferred distances remained relatively weak in the SPC window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). However, the orientation tuning was now significant at each distance and the preferences were similar, resulting in a large increase in Tolerance: ΔTolerance = 0.46. Next, consider the neuron with low Tolerance during the SD window and no choice-related activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). The selectivity of this neuron changed relatively little between the time windows: ΔTolerance = 0.08.

In particular, more neurons showed significant orientation tuning at each distance in the SPC window than the SD window (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Correspondingly, the neurons tended to have orientation tuning at more distances in the SPC window than the SD window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). There was also a reduction in the number of neurons which were distance but not orientation selective in the SPC window (two-way ANOVA; N = 20, 5%) compared to the SD window (N = 62, 14%). Consistent with a shift towards a higher-level 3D pose representation, the mean SPC window Tolerance (0.66 ± 0.16 Std Dev, N = 437) was greater than the mean SD window Tolerance (0.58 ± 0.15 Std Dev), and the difference was statistically significant (paired t-test, p=1.3×10<sup>−18</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Having identified two subpopulations of neurons based on whether or not they carried choice-related activity, we were able to further test our hypothesis that neurons with more robust 3D selectivity would preferentially carry choice-related activity.

Consistent with our hypothesis, neurons with choice-related activity had a higher mean Tolerance (0.61) than those without choice-related activity (0.56), and the difference was statistically significant (ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD test, p=0.02). Thus, neurons with choice-related activity tended to have more robust 3D selectivity than neurons without choice-related activity. Importantly, this difference in the 3D selectivity of the two subpopulations was present in the SD window, indicating that it could not be attributed to choice-related activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Choice-related activity was associated with more robust 3D selectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tolerance values in the SD window for neurons with (orange) and without (gray) choice-related activity.

To start, we compared each neuron’s 3D pose tuning in the SD and SPC windows by calculating the correlation over all 132 poses. The mean correlation was r = 0.49 ± 0.27 Std Dev (N = 437), indicating that the tuning curves were generally similar but not identical. Besides our hypothesis, an alternative explanation for this relatively modest average correlation could be the attenuation of selectivity for slant and distance (nuisance variables in the task), leaving only selectivity for the task-relevant variable (tilt). Contrary to this possibility, slant and distance tuning persisted in the SPC window for the example neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref>). To quantify this observation, we tested each neuron for slant and distance tuning (four-way ANOVA with slant, distance, and tilt linearized into cosine and sine components, p&lt;0.05) in each time window. The number of neurons with slant tuning was 334 (76%) in the SD window and 370 (85%) in the SPC window. The number of neurons with distance tuning was 414 (95%) in the SD window and 412 (94%) in the SPC window. Because the prevalence of slant and distance tuning did not decrease during the SPC window (indeed, orientation selectivity increased; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>), these results are inconsistent with choice-related activity being associated with the attenuation of information not directly relevant to the task at hand.</p><p>Having ruled out that choice-related activity was associated with the attenuation of selectivity for slant and distance, we tested our hypothesis that it would be associated with an increase in the robustness of 3D selectivity. Specifically, that 3D orientation selectivity would be more tolerant to distance in the SPC than the SD window. First, we compared the mean Tolerance values between neurons with (0.72) and without (0.60) choice-related activity in the SPC window and found that the difference was statistically significant (ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test, p=3.8×10<sup>−9</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the difference in mean Tolerance values between neurons with and without choice-related activity was greater in the SPC window (ΔTolerance = 0.12) than in the SD window (ΔTolerance = 0.04). Second, our hypothesis implies that only neurons with choice-related activity should show a statistically significant increase in Tolerance between the time windows. To test this, we compared the Tolerance values for each neuronal subpopulation across the SD and SPC windows. Indeed, the Tolerance values significantly increased for neurons with choice-related activity (p=3.8×10<sup>−9</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) but not neurons without choice-related activity (p=0.06). These results indicate that the increase in the robustness of 3D selectivity was specific to neurons with choice-related activity. For neurons with choice-related activity, we additionally found that the SPC window Tolerance was significantly correlated with the strength of choice-related activity (log of the choice tuning curve amplitude): r = 0.45, p=2.8×10<sup>−11</sup>. Thus, more robust 3D selectivity was associated with stronger choice-related activity.</p><p>The analysis of Tolerance values indicated that 3D orientation tuning became more similar across distance after the onset of choice-related activity but could not reveal which aspects of the tuning curves (preferences, bandwidths, etc.) specifically changed. We therefore quantified how much the orientation preferences of individual neurons differed across distance in each time window. For each neuron with choice-related activity, we used the orientation preferences from the Bingham function fits in both time windows to calculate a principal orientation preference (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The deviations in each neuron’s orientation preferences from its principal orientation are shown for both time windows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>. In these plots, the angular variable is the direction that a given preferred orientation deviated from the principal orientation (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ψ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) and the radial variable is the angular deviation (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>∡</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). The origin indicates no difference and the outer ring indicates the maximum difference (90°). Note that the deviations were more tightly clustered around the origin (i.e. smaller deviations) in the SPC window than the SD window. To quantify how much the orientation preferences differed in the two time windows, we calculated cumulative density functions for the angular deviations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The mean deviation was greater in the SD (28.3°) than the SPC (20.4°) window and the cumulative density functions were significantly different between the time windows (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p=1.4x10<sup>−10</sup>). Thus, the orientation preferences of individual neurons were more similar across distance after the onset of choice-related activity than before. Importantly, we repeated this analysis for neurons without choice-related activity and found that the cumulative density functions were not significantly different across the time windows (p=0.91). These findings indicate that choice-related activity was associated with an increase in the similarity of 3D orientation preferences across distance.</p><p>We additionally tested if choice-related activity was associated with changes in the shape of the 3D orientation tuning curves. To do so, we performed a parametric analysis using the Bingham function fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, we found that the tuning bandwidths were not significantly different between neurons with and without choice-related activity in either time window (Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Tukey’s HSD test, both p≥0.15). Nor were the bandwidths significantly different across the time windows for either subpopulation (both p≥0.16). Second, we found that the orientation tuning curves of both subpopulations were less elongated (more isotropic) in the SPC window than the SD window (both p≤0.04). For instance, this difference is seen in the orientation tuning curves at 37 cm for the example neuron without choice-related activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>): SD λ<sub>1</sub> = −1.84 (elongated) and SPC λ<sub>1</sub> = −0.05 (almost isotropic). Thus, regardless of choice-related activity, tilt and slant tuning widths were more similar later in the response than earlier. Although the isotropy of the tuning curves was similar for the two subpopulations in the SD window (p=0.89), neurons with choice-related activity had more isotropic tuning than neurons without choice-related activity in the SPC window (p=1.4×10<sup>−6</sup>). Third, we found that the orientation of the major/minor axes of the tuning curves generally aligned with the slant and tilt axes of the coordinate space, and did not differ between the subpopulations in either time window or across time windows (all four p≥0.72). These findings indicate that choice-related activity was associated with a greater change in the aspect ratio of the tuning curves, such that the slant and tilt tuning widths became more similar. One potential consequence of this change is that the Fisher information along the two orientation dimensions would become more similar. This could theoretically make the monkeys’ sensitivities to small differences in slant or tilt more equivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seung and Sompolinsky, 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sensorimotor associations in CIP are strongest for neurons with choice-related activity</title><p>We next wanted to test if sensorimotor associations between 3D surface representations and motor-related activity exist at the level of CIP.

Following our analysis of choice-related activity, we computed eight population-level time courses of saccade-related activity relative to the saccade direction that elicited the maximum response for each neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Saccade direction selectivity started 102 ms before the saccade onset (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). The responses showed parametric tuning with amplitudes that symmetrically fell off with greater deviation from the preferred direction. They also predicted the saccade timing. For each neuron, we labeled every trial in which a saccade was made in the preferred direction according to the saccade latency. The time course of saccade-related activity was then calculated for each quartile of the saccade latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; inset shows the latency histogram, mean = 137 ms). The four latency-conditioned time courses approximately intersected 15 ms before saccade onset, suggestive of a saccade initiation threshold (~42 spikes/s, open black circle). The activity also increased more slowly when the saccade latency was longer (colored circles mark when each curve deviated from baseline; ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). For each time course, we computed the growth rate (linear slope) between the start of activity and the putative saccade threshold. Consistent with frontal eye field findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanes and Schall, 1996</xref>), there was an inverse linear relationship between the growth rate and mean saccade latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, saccade-related activity in CIP functionally correlated with both the saccade direction and timing during the visually guided saccade task.</p><p>Across the population, 274 neurons (63%) had significant saccade direction tuning (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). Saccade direction tuning curves with von Mises fits are shown for the example neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E-I</xref> (green curves). The tuning curves were well described by von Mises functions (mean r = 0.91 ± 0.10 Std Dev, N = 274).

For comparison, surface tilt tuning curves marginalized over slant and distance (SD and SPC windows) are also shown (black curves). The first two neurons had orientation tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A,B</xref>), choice tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), and saccade direction tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>).

The surface tilt and saccade direction preferences of this neuron were somewhat aligned but not as well as for the neurons with strong orientation and choice tuning. Lastly, the neuron with stronger distance than orientation tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>) had choice tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and saccade direction tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). The saccade direction preference of this neuron did not align with its surface tilt or choice preferences (which were aligned).</p><p>Having discovered saccade direction selectivity in CIP, we were able to test for a sensorimotor association between the surface tilt and saccade direction preferences. For each neuron with significant saccade direction tuning, we compared the principal surface tilt (SD and SPC windows) and saccade direction preference from the von Mises fit. Across the population, the preferences aligned both for neurons with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) choice-related activity, indicating a sensorimotor association. For neurons with (without) choice-related activity, the median circular difference between preferences was −1.6° (−0.9°), and not significantly different from 0° (circular median test, both p≥0.61). Although the tilt and saccade direction preferences generally aligned regardless of choice-related activity, the distribution of preference differences was significantly narrower for neurons with (circular variance = 0.36) than without (circular variance = 0.74) choice-related activity (two-sample concentration difference test, p=3.2×10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher, 1995</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that the sensorimotor association (i.e. the alignment of surface tilt and saccade direction preferences) did not require choice-related activity, but was strongest for neurons with choice-related activity, revealing a three-way interaction between sensory representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Sensorimotor and choice-motor associations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differences between principal surface tilts and saccade direction preferences for neurons with choice-related activity (N = 135).

To do so, we identified four subpopulations of neurons based on their choice- and saccade-related activities.

First, we compared the two subpopulations with choice-related activity (C+S+ and C+S-). The Tolerance values of these subpopulations were not significantly different in either time window (ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD test, both p≥0.14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). Likewise, the cumulative density functions for the angular deviations in orientation preferences were not significantly different in either time window (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, both p≥0.24; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Thus, for neurons with choice-related activity, the robustness of 3D selectivity was not associated with saccade-related activity. Across time windows, both subpopulations showed similar increases in Tolerance (both p≤7.9×10<sup>−5</sup>) and similar reductions in the angular deviations in orientation preferences across distance (both p≤0.014). Thus, choice-related activity was sufficient for the robustness of 3D selectivity to increase across the time windows and saccade-related activity was not necessary. Second, we compared the two subpopulations without choice-related activity (C-S+ and C-S-). The Tolerance values of these subpopulations were not significantly different in either time window (both p=1.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D,E</xref>). The cumulative density functions for the angular deviations in orientation preferences were significantly different in the SD window (p=3.8×10<sup>−3</sup>; preferences were more similar for neurons without than with saccade-related activity) but not the SPC window (p=0.10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>).

Neurons in CIP achieve 3D orientation selectivity through the integration of stereoscopic and perspective cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsutsui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenberg and Angelaki, 2014b</xref>). A stereoscopic representation of 3D orientation that is tolerant to distance requires an encoding of relative disparity gradients that accounts for the nonlinear relationship between depth and disparity. We found that the orientation selectivity of many CIP neurons was highly tolerant to distance. Importantly, that tolerance did not simply reflect selectivity for perspective cues (which were independent of distance) since the vast majority of neurons also had significant distance tuning. Our findings thus revealed a high-level representation of 3D object pose that was created, at least in part, through relative disparity computations. How might this representation be achieved?</p><p>Functional properties and connectivity data suggest that representations of 3D object pose based on relative disparities are created hierarchically, beginning with V1 neurons that represent local absolute binocular disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cumming and Parker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cumming and Parker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumming and Parker, 2000</xref>). A transformation towards relative disparity tuning proceeds in V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>) and V3A where absolute disparity representations may still predominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anzai et al., 2011</xref>) but selectivity for disparity gradients may also begin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>). The 2D-to-3D transformation likely progresses further in the posterior intraparietal area where tuning for local relative disparity gradients may be solidified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alizadeh et al., 2018</xref>), ultimately achieving 3D object pose selectivity in CIP.</p><p>In addition to 3D object representations, recent studies have identified brain regions that represent the 3D structure of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaziri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lescroart and Gallant, 2019</xref>). It is currently unclear how 3D object and environment representations interact. To characterize 3D sensory and sensorimotor processing in naturalistic contexts, it will be important for futures studies to investigate how CIP represents objects with which the monkeys directly interact and if that representation is influenced by the surrounding environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Separable tuning for orientation and distance</title><p>Distinguishing 3D representations from lower-level visual feature selectivity is a longstanding problem. Demonstrating that 3D orientation selectivity is tolerant to distance when the fixation distance is held constant can be used to verify 3D tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyenkim and DeAngelis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alizadeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>). This fundamental test was not previously performed in CIP. We found that the slant preferences of individual neurons tended to increase with distance behind fixation. Although the increase was relatively small, it indicates that orientation and distance tuning was not strictly separable. Importantly, this finding was consistent with the behavioral data which showed that tilt sensitivity fell off more gradually with distance from fixation at larger compared to smaller slants, which would be predicted if the amplitude of the neuronal responses fell off more slowly with distance at larger compared to smaller slants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that strictly separable 3D pose tuning may not be a reasonable expectation. It would be informative to test if this conclusion rests on the use of stimuli with fixed slants as opposed to fixed disparity gradients. Although the disparity gradient signaling a particular slant is distance dependent (due to the nonlinear relationship between depth and disparity), the 3D shape of a stimulus changes with distance if the disparity gradient is fixed (for the same reason). As such, neuronal tuning for orientation and distance may not be strictly separable regardless of whether the stimuli have fixed slants or fixed disparity gradients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Associations between 3D selectivity and choice-related activity</title><p>We found that neurons with more robust 3D representations (i.e. those whose 3D orientation selectivity was more tolerant to distance) preferentially carried choice-related activity. Moreover, greater tolerance was correlated with stronger choice-related activity. Thus, the activity of neurons with more robust 3D selectivity was more tightly coupled to the monkeys’ behavior. The extent to which subcortical vestibular neurons resolve the gravito-inertial acceleration ambiguity necessary to represent translation independently of head tilt similarly correlates with the strength of choice-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dakin and Rosenberg, 2018</xref>). Across sensory modalities, these findings suggest that neurons which have resolved fundamental ambiguities about the sensory information being discriminated preferentially carry choice-related activity.</p><p>Our behavioral task required the monkeys to report the tilt of a plane regardless of its slant or distance. As such, tilt was the directly relevant stimulus feature while slant and distance were nuisance variables that modulated performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). This distinction between the stimulus features allowed us to test for interactions between choice-related activity and the representations of directly relevant and ‘nuisance’ sensory information. Following the onset of choice-related activity there was no attenuation in selectivity for slant or distance across the population. Thus, the low-dimensional task (‘report the tilt’) did not reduce the number of features maintained in the neuronal representation of the multi-dimensional (tilt, slant, and distance) stimulus. Instead, for neurons with choice-related activity, the robustness of 3D selectivity increased across the SD and SPC windows. Thus, choice-related activity was associated with an increase in the fidelity of the high-level sensory representations. Because the behavioral task required the monkeys to report the surface tilt only, we were restricted to measuring choice tuning curves over tilt. However, the increased robustness in 3D selectivity cannot be fully explained by the addition of a tilt choice tuning curve at each stimulus distance since choice-related activity was associated with changes in both the tilt and slant preferences (thereby aligning the 3D orientation tuning curves across distance). Thus, we speculate that the changes in 3D selectivity reflected choice-related activity that contained both tilt and slant information. Importantly, the increased fidelity of the 3D representations may enable more robust perception and flexible sensorimotor processing. For example, if choice-related processes attenuated selectivity for features not directly relevant to the task at hand, performance would be impaired if the task and relevant information unexpectedly changed.</p><p>Choice-related activity is traditionally associated with feedforward contributions to perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celebrini and Newsome, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Britten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dodd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nienborg and Cumming, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gu et al., 2007</xref>). However, this possibility has been questioned on the basis that choice-related activity, attentional effects, and correlated activity can be conflated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cumming and Nienborg, 2016</xref>). Indeed, existing measures of choice-related activity likely reflect combinations of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haefner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2014</xref>). We found that surface tilt and choice preferences typically aligned, consistent with a feedforward origin of choice-related activity and contrasting with the potentially non-specific effects of a feedback origin, as thought to occur in the ventral intraparietal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zaidel et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a potential implication of the current findings is that neurons with more robust tuning for task-relevant information have greater weight in the neural readout. Indeed, decoding from neurons that are more tolerant to nuisance variables may simplify readout since marginalizing out non-relevant features would be more straightforward.</p><p>For the current study, we trained monkeys to report the near side of a viewed plane, whereas a previous CIP study had monkeys report the far side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the monkeys in these two studies were trained to make opposite behavioral reports for the same surface tilt. This difference allowed us to test if the alignment of surface tilt and choice report directions was experience dependent. In both data sets we found that the alignment of preferred surface tilt and choice report directions reflected the task training. Importantly, this collective finding indicates that the association between 3D visual orientation and choice report directions did not simply reflect a natural correspondence. Instead, it was flexible, reflecting an experience-dependent association between perception and action.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sensorimotor and choice-motor associations</title><p>We discovered that the functional properties of CIP neurons extend beyond sensory and perceptual processing. Specifically, CIP activity correlated with the direction and timing of visually guided saccades, implicating the area in visuomotor control for the first time. Moreover, there was a sensorimotor association between the surface tilt and saccade direction preferences, indicating that visual and oculomotor activities were not simply multiplexed. Correspondingly, for neurons with both choice- and saccade-related activity, the choice report and saccade direction preferences also generally aligned. However, it is important to emphasize that the choice- and saccade-related activities were distinct from each other. First, the choice and saccade tuning curves of individual neurons systematically differed in bandwidth. Second, these functional properties were dissociable since many neurons were only tuned for choice report or saccade direction, not both. These findings suggest that the choice-related activity did not simply reflect saccade preparation signals. Moreover, the dissociation of these properties across the population allowed us to test if the robustness of 3D selectivity was distinctly associated with choice-related activity or if it was also linked to saccade-related activity. For example, it is conceivable that the addition of saccade preparation signals to the sensory responses might appear like an increase in the robustness of 3D selectivity since the saccade signals in our task were likely independent of the surface’s distance. However, that was not the case. Across the population, we found that choice-related activity was both necessary and sufficient for the robustness of 3D selectivity to increase across the time windows. In contrast, saccade-related activity was neither necessary nor sufficient. If choice- and saccade-related activities simply reflected a common signal, then saccade-related activity would have also likely been associated with an increase in the fidelity of the 3D visual representations, which was not the case. Thus, these findings further support that choice- and saccade-related activities were functionally distinct, and suggest that only choice-related activity was linked to the robustness of the 3D visual representations.</p><p>We further found that sensorimotor associations were strongest for neurons with choice-related activity (and therefore the most robust 3D selectivity). Thus, a potential implication of the current findings is that neurons with robust 3D selectivity and strong sensorimotor associations have the greatest weight in determining motor responses. Indeed, associating robust sensory and motor-related activity at the single neuron level may help ensure successful and timely interactions with the environment since the same neurons represent the relevant sensory information and signal the appropriate motor response. Building on these findings, future studies can test this possibility using reaction time tasks to evaluate the time course of 3D sensory and sensorimotor processing. To date, relatively few studies have used reaction time tasks to assay 3D visuomotor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verhoef et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verhoef et al., 2015</xref>). Such tasks could elucidate potential differences in the timing of choice-related activity across neurons, sessions, and/or conditions, which this study was not designed to examine, and the implications of such differences for 3D perception and action.</p><p>In addition to oculomotor processing, connections between CIP and prehensile areas suggest that the area’s sensorimotor functions may be broader. This possibility is consistent with recent work implicating human parietal regions that integrate visual orientation and saccade signals in the updating of grasp plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltaretu et al., 2020</xref>), and will be important to explore through neurophysiological studies with monkeys. Lastly, our findings reveal that experience has ongoing effects on the functional properties of CIP neurons, as occurs in downstream area LIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freedman and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Law and Gold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennur and Gold, 2011</xref>), producing flexible mappings between sensory, choice-, and motor-related activity that support goal-directed behaviors. Determining how such effects influence downstream motor processing will be essential to further elucidate the sensorimotor cascade underlying ecologically relevant interactions with the 3D environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Fixation was always at screen distance (57 cm). At 37 cm, all dots were in front of the fixation target. At 57 cm, the dots were distributed about the fixation target. At 97 and 137 cm, all dots were behind fixation.

A neuron was classified as having choice-related activity if the z-scored firing rates significantly depended on the choice (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). For each of these neurons, an average SDF was calculated for each choice (aligned to the stimulus onset), and labeled relative to the choice that elicited the maximum z-scored firing rate for the neuron: preferred choice, ±45°, ±90°, ±135°, and 180°. The SDFs were then averaged across neurons to create eight population-level time courses. The onset of choice-related activity was defined as the first time point that the time courses significantly differed (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). To refine the estimate, we iteratively repeated this process with all neurons, each time calculating the firing rates starting from the previous estimate of the onset of choice-related activity to the end of the 1 s stimulus presentation (firing rates were first calculated using the full 1 s). This process was repeated until the onset no longer changed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Quantifying orientation selectivity</title><p>For each distance and time window, we tested for orientation tuning (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05 and Bonferroni-Holm corrected).

Results with the additive model were not presented because the responses of every neuron in both time windows (874 comparisons) were better described by the multiplicatively separable model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-6"><title>Saccade analysis</title><p>A saccade onset was defined as the first time point that the velocity of either eye was ≥ 150°/s. A neuron was classified as having saccade direction selectivity if the baseline subtracted firing rates significantly depended on the saccade direction (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). For each of these neurons, an average SDF was calculated for each saccade direction (aligned to the saccade onset) and labeled relative to the saccade direction that elicited the maximum firing rate for the neuron. The SDFs were then averaged across neurons to create eight time courses. The start of saccade-related activity was defined as the earliest time point before saccade onset that the time courses significantly differed (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05). To refine the estimate, we iteratively repeated this process with all neurons, each time calculating the firing rates from the previous estimate of the start of saccade-related activity to the saccade onset. This process was repeated until the onset no longer changed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-7"><title>Vergence</title><p>Vergence eye movements can potentially contribute to neuronal responses. We therefore tested if our 3D pose tuning measurements were significantly affected by small vergence eye movements that did not violate the vergence window. For each neuron, we performed an ANCOVA to test for main effects of stimulus tuning with vergence included as a covariate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeAngelis and Uka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2019</xref>). Tilt (linearized into cosine and sine components), slant, and distance were independent factors and the mean vergence over the analyzed time window was a covariate. Both the SD and SPC windows were included because the results were similar for the individual time windows. Only 40 neurons (9%) showed a statistically significant effect of vergence (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, the significance of the stimulus main effects was unchanged for all but 11 neurons (3%) when vergence was included as a covariate. These effects are smaller than those previously reported for disparity tuning in the middle temporal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeAngelis and Uka, 2003</xref>), and indicate that vergence had a minimal impact on the measurements.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank L Caitlin Elmore for recording the ‘report far’ neurons and help with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and Satchal Postlewaite for help with spike sorting.

you for submitting your article &quot;Choice activity stabilizes sensory representations and mediates sensorimotor associations in parietal cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional analysis, substantial revisions to the manuscript, and possibly new data are needed to address a number of major concerns and points of confusion. The reviewers were unanimous in wanting to give you the opportunity to respond to their concerns but also emphasized that substantial improvements are needed to merit acceptance in our journal. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study which examines the role of parietal cortex area CIP in judgments and choices with 3D stimuli. The stimuli consist of a parametric set of patterns at a range of tilts, slants and distances in depth. The monkeys' task is to report the perceived tilt by making a saccade to a target that is closest to the viewer in depth. Neuronal mechanisms underlying 3D perception and particularly choices/decision are relatively understudied, so this study is novel in that regard. The mapping of the tilt to saccade is fixed so that the choice (saccade direction) is known as soon as the stimulus is viewed. The main result of the study is that there is substantial encoding correlated with 3D tilt as well as with choice (saccade direction). Interestingly there is a strong correspondence observed between tilt and saccade direction, which the authors interpret as associative encoding which combined stimulus tilt encoding with encoding of the appropriate saccade direction, suggestive of a role for CIP in mediating decisions during this task.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers raised serious concerns about the ability to dissociate stimulus from choice/saccade encoding. This problem is in part due to the experimental design, which uses a rigid link between the monkeys' decisions and the direction of the saccades. Further, there is concern about the attempt to dissect sensory and choice information using different time windows. Sensory only (SO) window and sensory plus choice (SPC) windows are used for analysis. Since the animal can plan his response as soon as he determines the tilt, how can you be sure that the SO window doesn't contain any choice information? More description and rationale for this is needed, and likely a revised analysis approach is needed. How confident are the authors in the determination of the onset of choice information? This could vary from session to session or from neuron to neuron in principle, yet the timings were determined from an across session average. The SO vs SPC time windows are described in a confusing way-as if they truly dissociate sensory and choice information in a clean way. Instead it is an arbitrary temporal cut-off and the windows each likely include a mixture of sensory and choice information.</p><p>2) It is potentially of strong interest that there is a correspondence between tilt and choice selectivity as shown in 5G. A key question is whether this correspondence arose because of training, or because this could be a naturally occurring correspondence. It is possible that eye movements are naturally drawn to the closest part of a tilted 3D object. It would be very interesting to test in naïve animals whether this is indeed the case (perhaps during passive presentation of tilted objects and free viewing). If there is no such effect in naïve animals, but it is observed in the trained animals, this would support the idea that the correspondence arose because of training. Was the tuning assessed for each neuron during passive viewing outside the context of the task? If so, this might be a way to get at the question by comparing task vs passive viewing.</p><p>3) The reviewers agreed with one another that the results are described throughout the manuscript in a way which implies a causal relationship between CIP activity/encoding and choice. But given the correlational approaches used here, this message should be revised and clarified in order to avoid confusion and to better bring the discussion of the paper in line with the observed results and experimental design.</p><p>4) All reviewers were in agreement that the writing of the manuscript needs to be improved substantially in order to help readers follow the logic of the analyses, experimental design, and results.</p><p>5) Analysis related to Figure 4: authors should clarify which period of the task they are describing here, is it SO or SPC? They separate sensory (SO) and choice response (SPC) periods. The distinction between SO and SPC seems pretty arbitrary. The only neuronal activity they show up to Figure 5 are heat map. It would be helpful to see the actual time course of the neuronal response for example neurons.</p><p>6) Although they show that 5 example neurons, they do not provide clear population analyzes of 3D orientation selectivity. At least, they should show the distribution of tolerance index for all the neurons. Given the response shown in Figure 5A, I wonder how neurons could be tilt selective during the SO period. I'd like to see the actual response of these neurons.</p><p>7) There is confusion regarding the discussion of vergence, raised by reviewer 3, which needs to be addressed. Also, the correlation of tilt selectivity between SO and SPC shown in Figure 7 needs to be clarified and explained in more detail.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Functional links between sensory representations, choice activity, and sensorimotor associations in parietal cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Joshua Gold (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The new analysis with previous data required additional clarification and explanation, and perhaps additional analysis. The reviewers agreed that there is concern about whether the observed results can be explained by saccade preparation. Specifically one reviewer states that &quot;I don't understand how 3D selectivity and choice can be aligned as shown in Figure 5 considering that choice changes depending on the training (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). If a neuron is tuned to right forward, and monkey is trained to choose forward, the neuron will fire strongly during SPC when stim is right forward and therefore when monkey is planning a saccade to the right. When trained to report away, the same neuron should, according to Figure 5—figure supplement 1, responds strongly during SPC when planning a saccade to the left. How is that possible given that 3D selectivity is getting stronger during SPC and that 3D selectivity and saccade spatial selective strongly overlap (Figure 8)? I understand that they are not analyzing the same neurons, but then, does it only mean that choice selectivity in CIP reflects saccade preparation? I'm genuinely afraid I am missing something important here.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In reviewing this revised manuscript, the authors have done a thorough job in responding to the previous round of review. They have clarified key points, and in particular largely resolved major concerns about whether the observed association like effects were indeed due to training by including an additional supplementary figure, and by more thoroughly referring to previous results from their group which help address this concern.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors did an excellent job in revising the manuscript. Specifically, the comparison with the task where the monkeys had to indicate the opposite features of the stimulus is crucial to demonstrate that the association between stimulus orientation and choice direction was indeed learned. I have no further major comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I recognize authors spend a lot of energy trying to address our comments. I am not sure they fully manage to address them though.</p><p>Here are the main claims (Abstract):</p><p>Choice related activity (saccade) is carried by neurons with robust 3D selectivity.</p><p>Following onset of choice activity 3D robustness increased</p><p>3D selectivity and saccade selectivity aligned</p><p>Here are my main concerns:</p><p>1) Specifically, their analysis consisting of testing for choice related activity in the SD window is not convincing. Our point was that some choice related activity could start before the end of SD window and before the start of the SPC window, not that the activity during the entire SD window was related to choice. In this regard, they failed to address our concerns.</p><p>2) I am still very confused by Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and the claim that 3D selectivity and saccade/choice selectivity are aligned:</p><p>Let's consider a neuron tuned to top near. We have 4 conditions based on task design (near-CN-or far-CF) and stimulus slant (Top Near-TN-or Bottom near-BN): a) CN/TN, b) CN/BN, c) CF/TN, d) CF/BN.</p><p>Condition a: choose near with stimulus top near: this neuron will have a strong visual response which will stay sustained since it is aligned to motor plan.</p><p>Condition b: Choose near with stimulus bottom near: this neuron will have a weak visual response, which will stay weak during motor planning.</p><p>Condition c: choose far with stimulus top near: there will be a strong visual response (similar to a, neuron's favorite stim) which should decrease during motor planning.</p><p>Condition d: choose far with stimulus bottom near (saccade to the top): there will be a weak visual response (similar to b, neuron's less favorite stim) which should increase during motor planning.</p><p>I am confused how this is translated to Figure 5 sp2 and how does that match authors' claim that &quot;Following onset of choice activity 3D robustness increased&quot; and that choice and &quot;3D selectivity and saccade selectivity are aligned&quot;. Separating between SC and SPC window does not help at all to understand the neuronal response properties.</p><p>3) Their attempt to dissociate choice and motor planning is not successful. Stimuli and motor action are still strongly linked whether monkeys have to report near or far side. I don't see how it breaks the link.</p><p>4) Despite their effort to improve the flow of argument in the article, I still find it very difficult to follow.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57968.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers raised serious concerns about the ability to dissociate stimulus from choice/saccade encoding.

This task difference allows us to dissociate stimulus orientation from choice/saccade directions since opposite choice report directions were made for the same surface orientation. Importantly, the association between stimulus orientation and choice report direction was reversed across the two data sets, indicating that the association reflected task training. For instance, consider a typical neuron preferring bottom-near planes. If the monkey were trained to report the near side, the neuronal responses were larger if the monkey selected the lower choice target. However, if the monkey were trained to report the far side, the responses were larger if the monkey selected the upper choice target. This indicates that the stimulus and choice/saccade encodings were dissociable. These findings are presented in subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences”, in new Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and further discussed in subsection “Associations between 3D selectivity and choice-related activity”. We provide greater detail about these additions in Essential Revision 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, there is concern about the attempt to dissect sensory and choice information using different time windows.

Instead it is an arbitrary temporal cut-off and the windows each likely include a mixture of sensory and choice information.</p></disp-quote><p>One of our primary goals was to assess if the robustness of 3D sensory representations was associated with choice-related activity. To test this, we identified two subpopulations of neurons based on whether or not they carried choice-related activity and two time windows based on the onset of choice-related activity. By comparing the 3D tuning properties of neurons between the subpopulations as well as within the subpopulations across the time windows, we were able to identify relationships between the robustness of 3D selectivity and choice-related activity. To help clarify this, we expanded the description and rationale behind the analyses and made it more explicit that the windows were operationally defined based on the population activity (subsection “The representation of 3D surface pose by CIP neurons”, subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences”).</p><p>The reviewers raise a great point about confidence in the onset of choice-related activity. To address this question, we incorporated several new analyses which verified that the two windows defined functionally distinct response epochs at the individual neuron level. We provide greater details in Essential Revision 5, but briefly we: (1) verified the absence of significant choice-related activity in the SO window for individual neurons, (2) showed that the results were highly similar if choice tuning was assessed using full and short SPC windows, thus indicating that the two-window analysis was sufficient to characterize the findings, and (3) verified the time course of choice-related activity using a state-space analysis that provided a second estimate of the onset of choice-related activity. The second estimate of choice onset was similar to the first and corroborated the absence of significant choice-related activity in the SO window. These results are presented in subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences” and in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>While the new analyses confirmed that choice-related activity was not detectable before ~202– 232 ms, we changed the name of the “sensory only (SO)” window to the “sensory dominant (SD)” window (52 to 202 ms) to leave room for the possibility that some choice-related activity may exist in this time window (though it was not detectable). From this point forward in the responses, we refer to the old SO window by its new name (SD window).</p><p>We found that the two-window analysis facilitated our goal of testing whether high-level sensory representations were associated with choice-related activity. These findings motivate and will be essential for interpreting the results of future experiments designed to evaluate the time course of 3D sensory and sensorimotor processing and the potential consequences of neuron, session, and/or condition variability in the timing of choice-related activity. Surprisingly, few studies have used reaction time tasks to assay 3D vision. The potential for future studies using reaction time tasks to investigate these important questions are now discussed in subsection “Sensorimotor and choice-motor associations”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is potentially of strong interest that there is a correspondence between tilt and choice selectivity as shown in 5G.

If so, this might be a way to get at the question by comparing task vs passive viewing.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise a great question regarding whether the correspondence between sensory and choice selectivity is naturally occurring or due to training. We buried too deeply (mostly in the Discussion of the original manuscript) that the study was designed to distinguish between these possibilities through a comparison with our recent CIP work (Elmore et al., 2019). Specifically, the current task was to report the near side of the plane whereas the previous task was to report the far side. By having monkeys report opposite features of the same surface orientation, we were able to dissociate the stimulus from the choice report/saccade direction. For example, for a bottom-near plane, the correct response was the lower choice target in this study but the upper choice target in the previous study. This difference allowed us to evaluate if the association reflected the task training. Importantly, the choice and surface orientation preferences aligned in both cases according to the training. For example, consider a neuron that preferred bottom-near planes. If trained to report the near side, the preferred choice report direction was typically down. In contrast, if trained to report the far side, the preferred choice report direction was typically up. Thus, the correspondence was flexible and experience dependent, and did not simply reflect a tendency for the eyes to be drawn to the closest part of the surface.</p><p>To give this finding a more prevalent place in the manuscript, we now present choice-conditioned tuning curves (following several recent papers including Elmore et al., 2019) which show that the same choice report direction was associated with opposite effects on neuronal activity depending on the training. These findings are presented in subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences”, in new Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and further discussed in subsection “Associations between 3D selectivity and choice-related activity”. We also note that a full comparison of responses measured during the 8AFC task versus passive viewing would be impractical due to the large number of 3D pose conditions (N = 132) and would likely yield ambiguous results due to the training (e.g., it would be difficult to rule out that choice-related processes were not automatically engaged even during passive viewing).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers agreed with one another that the results are described throughout the manuscript in a way which implies a causal relationship between CIP activity/encoding and choice. But given the correlational approaches used here, this message should be revised and clarified in order to avoid confusion and to better bring the discussion of the paper in line with the observed results and experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and note that it was not our intention to imply a causal relationship. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We made revisions throughout the text to assiduously avoid any language that might lead to this interpretation. For example, we no longer refer to any process or function as potentially mediating any other. Instead, we refer to discovered <italic>associations</italic> between various sensory, choice-, and motor-related properties. We correspondingly changed the manuscript title to “Functional links between sensory representations, choice activity, and sensorimotor associations in parietal cortex”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All reviewers were in agreement that the writing of the manuscript needs to be improved substantially in order to help readers follow the logic of the analyses, experimental design, and results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

The distinction between SO and SPC seems pretty arbitrary.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in Essential Revision 1, we revised the text to clarify the rationale behind this distinction. Here we go into greater detail about the analyses we incorporated to confirm that the SD and SPC windows defined reliable, functionally distinct response epochs. Some of these points are discussed further in Essential Revisions 1 and 6 relating to the SD/SPC windows, state-space analysis, and dissociating choice- from saccade-related activities.</p><p>1) We confirmed at the individual neuron level that significant choice-related activity was rare in the SD window (22/437 neurons, 5%, and thus consistent with the expected rate of false positives) and not linked to a neuron being classified as having choice-related activity since only 13 had choice-related activity in the SPC window. Excluding these neurons did not affect the mean Tolerances of neurons with/without choice-related activity in either time window. These results are presented in subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences”.</p><p>2) We confirmed that choice tuning curves calculated over the full SPC window (from the onset of choice-related activity to the end of the stimulus presentation) were highly similar to those calculated over a short SPC window matching the duration of the SD window. This analysis indicates that the full SPC window was sufficient to characterize choice tuning and its relationship to surface tilt selectivity. These results are presented in subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences” and in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-D.</p><p>3) We performed a state-space analysis (demixed principal component analysis) which provided a second estimate of the time course of choice-related activity. Based on this analysis, choice-related activity was not detectable until 232 ms (note that we used the first, more stringent, estimate of 202 ms for our analyses). Importantly, this corroborates that choice-related activity was not detectable in the SD window. These results are presented in subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences” and in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1E,F.</p><p>4) We performed a parametric analysis of the shape of the 3D orientation tuning curves (for details, please see Essential Revision 6). These results showed that the orientation tuning curves of neurons with/without choice-related activity were similar during the SD window. Changes in the shape of the tuning curves across the SD and SPC windows were greater for neurons with than without choice-related activity, supporting the distinction between the two neuronal subpopulations and the two time windows.

At least, they should show the distribution of tolerance index for all the neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be beneficial to include more details regarding 3D orientation selectivity across the population. In particular, how that selectivity differed for neurons with/without choice-related activity and how it differed across the time windows. We therefore incorporated three new analyses. Note that all of the population analyses included in the original manuscript remain, including: (1) distributions of 3D orientation preferences at each distance in Figure 3F, (2) histograms showing the proportion of neurons with orientation tuning as a function of distance and the number of distances in Figure 6F,G, and (3) Tolerance distributions comparing neurons with/without choice-related activity in Figure 7A-C.</p><p>1) As suggested, we added Tolerance distributions for all neurons in each time window in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C. These are the same data as in Figure 7A-C but presented agnostically to whether or not the neurons had choice-related activity. Pointers to these plots are found in subsection “The representation of 3D surface pose by CIP neurons” and subsection “Choice-related activity was associated with more robust 3D selectivity”.</p><p>2) We computed a tilt discrimination index (TDI) to assess how well preferred and nonpreferred tilts could be discriminated using single neuron responses. The TDI values were compared to the behavioral tilt sensitivities as a function of slant and distance. This analysis shows that neuronal tilt discriminability and behavioral tilt sensitivity closely mirror each other. The findings are presented in subsection “Neuronal correlates of 3D tilt sensitivity” and in Figure 4A,B.</p><p>3) We conducted a parametric analysis of the orientation tuning curve shapes. This analysis tested for differences in the orientation tuning of neurons with/without choice-related activity and differences in tuning across the SD/SPC windows. In brief, bandwidths did not differ between the two neuronal subpopulations or across the time windows. The tuning curves of both subpopulations were more isotropic (less elongated) in the SPC than the SD window, indicating that tilt and slant tuning widths became more similar later in the response. Neurons with choice-related activity showed greater changes in tuning isotropy than neurons without choice-related activity. These findings and their interpretation are presented in subsection “Choice-related activity was associated with more robust 3D selectivity” and in new Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the response shown in Figure 5A, I wonder how neurons could be tilt selective during the SO period. I'd like to see the actual response of these neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there was some confusion here, and therefore expanded the text describing the quantification of choice-related activity in subsection “Choice-related activity was parametrically tuned and aligned with the tilt preferences”. Specifically, the assessment of choice-related activity was performed using frontoparallel planes only because tilt is undefined at that orientation. Because Figure 5A shows responses to frontoparallel planes, there is no tilt selectivity in either the SD or SPC window. Differences between the curves during the SPC window reflect choice-related activity. To further clarify this point, we now show response time courses for preferred and non-preferred stimuli (across all tilts, slants, and distances) in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. We also report that the population responses to preferred and non-preferred stimuli became significantly different 58 ms after stimulus onset. This is only 6 ms after the median visual response latency, indicating that 3D pose selectivity started early in the responses (subsection “The representation of 3D surface pose by CIP neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There is confusion regarding the discussion of vergence, raised by reviewer 3, which needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing this confusion to our attention. In the revised manuscript we clarify that this test evaluated if the neuronal responses were significantly affected by small vergence eye movements that did not violate the vergence window. As suggested, we moved the analysis so that it would not distract from the 3D pose tuning results. It is now located at the end of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the correlation of tilt selectivity between SO and SPC shown in Figure 7 needs to be clarified and explained in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. To clarify how we quantified differences in tilt preferences across distance in the SD and SPC windows, we added a schematic which illustrates each step of the analysis (new Figure 7D). We also expanded the corresponding text in subsection “Choice-related activity was associated with more robust 3D selectivity”. Pointers to the Materials and methods direct readers to the mathematical details.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The new analysis with previous data required additional clarification and explanation, and perhaps additional analysis. The reviewers agreed that there is concern about whether the observed results can be explained by saccade preparation. Specifically one reviewer states that &quot;I don't understand how 3D selectivity and choice can be aligned as shown in Figure 5 considering that choice changes depending on the training (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). If a neuron is tuned to right forward, and monkey is trained to choose forward, the neuron will fire strongly during SPC when stim is right forward and therefore when monkey is planning a saccade to the right. When trained to report away, the same neuron should, according to Figure 5—figure supplement 1, responds strongly during SPC when planning a saccade to the left. How is that possible given that 3D selectivity is getting stronger during SPC and that 3D selectivity and saccade spatial selective strongly overlap (Figure 8)? I understand that they are not analyzing the same neurons, but then, does it only mean that choice selectivity in CIP reflects saccade preparation? I'm genuinely afraid I am missing something important here.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The four conditions outlined in Reviewer 3’s second comment below were helpful for understanding where the confusion arose regarding the alignment of tilt and choice report/saccade signals. Please see our response to that comment for further clarification and pointers to text edits. Briefly, choice report/saccade direction and planar surface tilt are 360° periodic variables. As matters of convention, 0° corresponds to a rightward choice report/saccade direction as well as right-side near planes. Given these conventions and a learned association between surface tilt and choice report/saccade directions, we found the following results: (1) if the monkey was trained to report near, then the surface tilt and choice report/saccade direction preferences had the same value, and (2) if the monkey was trained to report far, then the surface tilt and choice report/saccade direction preferences were 180° apart. That is, the alignment (being either “in phase” or “out of phase”) depended on the specific training, as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Importantly, several lines of evidence supported that the choice- and saccade-related activities were functionally distinct. First, we found systematic differences in the choice and saccade tuning curve bandwidths of individual neurons. Second, the choice- and saccade-related activities were dissociable across the population. Specifically, many neurons exhibited significant saccade direction tuning only or choice tuning only (not both). We incorporated additional text emphasizing these findings in the Results and Discussion. Third, we found that the robustness of 3D selectivity was associated with choice-related activity but not saccade-related activity. For that analysis, we divided neurons into four subpopulations based on whether or not they had choice-related activity (assessed using responses to the ambiguous frontoparallel plane stimuli) and whether or not they had saccade-related activity (assessed using the visually guided saccade task, without the presentation of planar surfaces). Neurons with saccade-related activity but not choice-related activity did not show an increase in the robustness of 3D selectivity across time windows. Thus, a change in 3D selectivity could not be explained by saccade preparation signals alone. In contrast, neurons with choice-related activity showed an increase in the robustness of their 3D selectivity across the time windows. Importantly, the change in 3D selectivity did not depend on whether or not the neurons had saccade-related activity. Thus, we found no association between saccade preparation signals and improvements in 3D selectivity. These results further support that choice- and saccade related activities did not simply reflect a common signal. We incorporated additional text to further clarify these points in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In reviewing this revised manuscript, the authors have done a thorough job in responding to the previous round of review. They have clarified key points, and in particular largely resolved major concerns about whether the observed association like effects were indeed due to training by including an additional supplementary figure, and by more thoroughly referring to previous results from their group which help address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer again for their feedback. The comments helped us substantially improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors did an excellent job in revising the manuscript. Specifically, the comparison with the task where the monkeys had to indicate the opposite features of the stimulus is crucial to demonstrate that the association between stimulus orientation and choice direction was indeed learned. I have no further major comments.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I recognize authors spend a lot of energy trying to address our comments. I am not sure they fully manage to address them though.</p><p>Here are the main claims (Abstract):</p><p>• Choice related activity (saccade) is carried by neurons with robust 3D selectivity.</p><p>• Following onset of choice activity 3D robustness increased</p><p>• 3D selectivity and saccade selectivity aligned</p><p>Here are my main concerns:</p><p>1) Specifically, their analysis consisting of testing for choice related activity in the SD window is not convincing. Our point was that some choice related activity could start before the end of SD window and before the start of the SPC window, not that the activity during the entire SD window was related to choice. In this regard, they failed to address our concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the ANOVA-based analysis found at line 382, which confirmed that choice-related activity was not detectable during the sensory dominant (SD) window for individual neurons, we verified that choice-related activity was not detectable in the SD window at the population level using: (1) an ANOVA-based analysis and (2) a state-space analysis combined with a choice classification procedure. We still used “dominant” when defining the window to reflect the possibility that a small amount of choice-related activity went undetected, perhaps starting just before the end of the SD window. We further clarified this point in the Results. Importantly, our main analyses focused on changes in 3D selectivity between the two time windows which differed in the amount of choice-related activity present. As such, any choice-related activity in the SD window would only reduce the observed differences. The fact that we found significant changes in 3D selectivity across the two time windows suggests that if any choice-related activity were in the SD window then it did not affect our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am still very confused by Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and the claim that 3D selectivity and saccade/choice selectivity are aligned:</p><p>Let's consider a neuron tuned to top near. We have 4 conditions based on task design (near-CN-or far-CF) and stimulus slant (Top Near-TN-or Bottom near-BN): a) CN/TN, b) CN/BN, c) CF/TN, d) CF/BN.</p><p>Condition a: choose near with stimulus top near: this neuron will have a strong visual response which will stay sustained since it is aligned to motor plan.</p><p>Condition b: Choose near with stimulus bottom near: this neuron will have a weak visual response, which will stay weak during motor planning.</p><p>Condition c: choose far with stimulus top near: there will be a strong visual response (similar to a, neuron's favorite stim) which should decrease during motor planning.</p><p>Condition d: choose far with stimulus bottom near (saccade to the top): there will be a weak visual response (similar to b, neuron's less favorite stim) which should increase during motor planning.</p><p>I am confused how this is translated to Figure 5 sp2 and how does that match authors' claim that &quot;Following onset of choice activity 3D robustness increased&quot; and that choice and &quot;3D selectivity and saccade selectivity are aligned&quot;. Separating between SC and SPC window does not help at all to understand the neuronal response properties.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for laying out these four conditions. They helped us to understand where the confusion arose. We made corresponding text edits to clarify the relevant points in the Results and Discussion. As we discuss in our response preceding the reviewer comments, the confusion seems to revolve around the conventions for describing choice report/saccade directions and surface tilt.</p><p>We found that the alignment was reversed if the monkey was trained to report the near versus far side of the plane, indicating that the association was experience dependent. In the following description, note that 90° indicates top-near planes as well as upward choice reports/saccades. If the monkey was trained to report near, a preference for top-near planes (tilt = 90°) aligned with a preference for upward choice reports (i.e., saccade to the target at 90° which was used to indicate tilt = 90°). In contrast, if the monkey was trained to report far, a preference for top-near planes (tilt = 90°) aligned with a preference for downward choice reports (i.e., saccade to the target at 270° which was used to indicate tilt = 90°). As such, conditions c and d outlined above are incorrect. For condition c, the stimulus response would be strong as indicated but so would the choice component since downward choices indicated that the bottom was far. For condition d, both the stimulus response and choice component would be weak since they correspond to the non-preferred surface tilt and non-preferred choice report direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Their attempt to dissociate choice and motor planning is not successful. Stimuli and motor action are still strongly linked whether monkeys have to report near or far side. I don't see how it breaks the link.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we elaborated on findings which support that choice- and saccade-related activities are dissociable. Briefly, the dissociation was supported by three findings: (1) systematic differences in the choice and saccade tuning bandwidths of individual neurons, (2) dissociation of choice- and saccade-related activities across the population (i.e., many neurons were tuned either for choice or saccade direction only, not both), and (3) an increase in the robustness of 3D selectivity across the time windows was only associated with choice-related activity, not saccade-related activity. If choice- and saccade-related activities simply reflected a common signal, saccade-related activity would likely have also been associated with the robustness of 3D selectivity, which was not the case. Please see our response preceding the reviewer comments for further details and pointers to text edits.</p><p>A main finding of the study is that there is indeed a sensorimotor association linking the stimuli and motor response. The experiment referenced suggests that the association is experience dependent. We made additional text edits to further clarify that the comparison of results obtained with tasks in which the monkeys reported opposite stimulus features demonstrates that the association between surface tilt and the monkey’s response direction was experience dependent. Please see our responses above related to Figure 5—figure supplement 2 for further details and pointers to text edits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Despite their effort to improve the flow of argument in the article, I still find it very difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the additional feedback, and hope that the additions summarized above have resolved the remaining points of confusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
