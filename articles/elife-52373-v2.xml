Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to the intercalated disk (ICD) of cardiomyocytes. Patch clamp and surface biotinylation data show reciprocal downregulation of each other’s surface density. Mutagenesis of the Kir6.2 ankyrin binding site disrupts this functional coupling. Duplex patch clamping and Angle SICM recordings show that I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>KATP</sub> functionally co-localize at the rat ICD, but not at the lateral membrane. Quantitative STORM imaging show that Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are localized close to each other and to AnkG, but not to AnkB, at the ICD. Peptides corresponding to Nav1.5 and Kir6.2 ankyrin binding sites dysregulate targeting of both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to the ICD, but not to lateral membranes. Finally, a clinically relevant gene variant that disrupts K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking also regulates Na<sup>+</sup> channel surface expression. The functional coupling between these two channels need to be considered when assessing clinical variants and therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATP-sensitive

for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in many excitable cell types, including neurons, skeletal muscle and cardiac myocytes. The pore-forming α-subunit of the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel (Nav1.5) is encoded by the <italic>SCN5A</italic> gene. A large amount of genetic information has linked <italic>SCN5A</italic> variants to inherited forms of arrhythmias and sudden death, including Brugada syndrome, sick sinus syndrome, Long-QT syndrome and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Veerman et al., 2015</xref>). Nav1.5 interacts with several types of proteins, including 14-3-3, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), Fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13), Ankyrin-G (AnkG) and several others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shy et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in these interactors are also associated with arrhythmogenic syndromes since they affect the Na<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shy et al., 2013</xref>). It is of paramount importance, therefore, to know which proteins associate with Na<sup>+</sup> channels and how they affect Na<sup>+</sup> channel expression and function.</p><p>The sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel is one of the most abundant channels expressed in cardiac myocytes and it promotes action potential shortening adaptation with elevated heart rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster and Coetzee, 2016</xref>). K<sub>ATP</sub> channels additionally have important protective effects during metabolic stress and hypoxia/ischemia. Studies with murine genetic models have demonstrated that sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels mediate a key component of the protective effects of ischemic preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster and Coetzee, 2016</xref>). As sensors of intracellular nucleotides (ATP, MgADP and AMP), K<sub>ATP</sub> channels couple alterations in energy metabolism to K<sup>+</sup> fluxes and membrane excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster and Coetzee, 2016</xref>). Intracellular ATP blocks the channel by binding to a pocket formed by the intracellular N- and C-termini of Kir6.x, whereas ADP promotes channel opening by binding to intracellular nucleotide binding folds on the partner subunit, SURx. Two genes (<italic>KCNJ8</italic> and <italic>KCNJ11</italic>) respectively code two distinct pore-forming Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 subunits, and two genes (<italic>ABCC8</italic> and <italic>ABCC9</italic>) code for the accessory SUR1 and SUR2 subunits. Two major SUR2 isoforms (SUR2A and SUR2B) exist as a result of alternative mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster and Coetzee, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite the obvious functional differences in cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, there are also similarities, particularly in their subcellular expression profiles. At least two distinct pools of Na<sup>+</sup> channels have been identified in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shy et al., 2013</xref>). One pool is targeted to lateral membranes by the syntrophin/dystrophin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hund et al., 2010</xref>), whereas another subpopulation is organized in a highly specialized macromolecular complex at the intercalated disk (ICD) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agullo-Pascual et al., 2014</xref>), where targeting and anchoring is coordinated by AnkG, Synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97), Microtubule plus-end binding protein (EB1) and Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillet et al., 2014</xref>). K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subcellular expression follows a similar trend: The presence of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in lateral membranes was established by their initial identification with patch clamp methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster and Coetzee, 2016</xref>). However, as with Na<sup>+</sup> channels, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are enriched at the ICD of cardiac myocytes where they morphologically cluster with desmosomal proteins such as PKP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels form part of an ICD channel/transporter complex that is gaining increasing recognition for roles in cell-cell communication and cell adhesion.</p><p>It is a common theme in cardiac electrophysiology that ion channels in the same subdomain have the potential to interact with each other, as well as with other channels and transporters. Here, we provide evidence that Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are morphologically clustered (particularly at the ICD) and that they interact functionally, most likely due to the fact that they are targeted to a common subcellular location by AnkG. These studies provide a new paradigm when considering pharmacological and genetic aspects of arrhythmogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>K<sub>ATP</sub> and Nav1.5 channels negatively regulate each other in HEK293 cells</title><p>Distinct subpopulations of Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels exist in a cardiomyocyte, but the relevance of this observation has been unclear. Recent studies have shown that the function and trafficking of Na<sup>+</sup> channels can be regulated by some K<sup>+</sup> channels, including Kir2.1 and Kv4.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ponce-Balbuena et al., 2018</xref>). We investigated whether an interaction exists between Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. First, we performed experiments with HEK293 cells transfected with only K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (Kir6.2/SUR2A), only Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Nav1.5), both type of channels, or with an empty vector (pcDNA3) as a negative control. Unlike Kir2.1, which positively regulates Nav1.5, we unexpectedly found that the whole-cell Na<sup>+</sup> current density was significantly smaller when K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The voltage-dependence of steady-state activation of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel and the inactivation kinetics were unchanged by the presence of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next tested whether K<sup>+</sup> flux through K<sub>ATP</sub> channels plays a role. To answer this question, we took advantage of the fact that mutating the GFG sequence in the Kir6.2 pore to AAA produces a non-functional channel that still traffics normally to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tong et al., 2006</xref>). As with the wild-type channel, Kir6.2-AAA also suppressed Nav1.5 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that a conducting K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is not required. Reciprocal functional interaction occurs since the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel mean patch current in excised patches were significantly reduced when Na<sup>+</sup> channels were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The presence of Na<sup>+</sup> channels did not affect the sensitivity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to ‘cytosolic’ ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Of note, the negative regulation of one channel by the other was not due to differences in transfection efficiency, transcription or translation since the Nav1.5 protein levels in cell lysates were unchanged in the presence of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and co-transfection with Nav1.5 did not affect total Kir6.2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and Na<sup>+</sup> channels negatively regulate each other’s function when overexpressed in a heterologous expression system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and Na<sup>+</sup> channels reciprocally reduce the functional expression of one another.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative whole-cell Na<sup>+</sup> current recordings from Nav1.5 transfected HEK293 cells co-transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3) or K<sub>ATP</sub> channel (Kir6.2+SUR2A).

To investigate the potential role of ankyrin binding, we mutated the EED residues to lysine (Kir6.2-KKK).

By contrast, Kir6.2-KKK/SUR2A did not functionally interact with Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, surface biotinylation data demonstrated that WT-Kir6.2/SUR2A reduced surface expression of Nav1.5 as expected, but Kir6.2-KKK/SUR2A had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We investigated whether the functional interaction also occurs with the other member of the Kir6 subfamily, namely Kir6.1, which does not bind to AnkB-MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kline et al., 2009</xref>).

Indeed, rat cardiomyocytes expressing Kir6.2-mEos had a significantly reduced whole-cell Na<sup>+</sup> current density compared to Ad.mCherry as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). A key question, however, is whether the functional co-localization of Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels can be demonstrated at a subcellular level. To accomplish this goal, we have developed a novel duplex patch clamp technique that allows sequential measurements of the two currents in the same membrane patch (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Assuming that the free patch area of a 2–3 MΩ pipette is ~10 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakmann and Neher, 1995</xref>), this technique has a spatial resolution of ~2–3 µm. The I<sub>Na</sub> is first recorded in a cell-attached membrane patch as in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). This Na<sup>+</sup> channel recording is uncontaminated by K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, which are closed at rest in an intact cell. The patch is then excised to measure the I<sub>K(ATP)</sub> mean patch current in an inside-out membrane patch. The membrane voltage is kept at +80 mV to inactivate I<sub>Na</sub> and the magnitude of I<sub>K(ATP)</sub> is defined as the current component that is blocked by ‘intracellular’ ATP. Such paired recordings were made at the lateral membrane, or as close as feasible to the end of the cardiomyocyte (the ICD region) and paired recordings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. A key observation was that the majority of ICD patches expressed I<sub>Na</sub>, but it was found in only ~50% of lateral patches. By contrast, each of the patches from lateral membranes and the ICD contained K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. These paired data (blinded to their origin) were analyzed with machine learning algorithms (hierarchical clustering), which demonstrated two distinct populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lateral and ICD paired recordings segregated statistically between these two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; Fisher’s Exact test, p=0.002), demonstrating that the ICD and lateral paired data points are distinct populations. To examine functional co-localization of Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels at a subcellular level, we next performed duplex patch clamping after adenoviral delivery of Kir6.2-mEos. This intervention led to significantly larger K<sub>ATP</sub> channel currents at both the lateral membranes and at the ICD. The corresponding I<sub>Na</sub> patch current was significantly reduced at the ICD, but not at lateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels functionally interact predominantly at the ICD in cardiac myocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Functional interaction between K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and Na<sup>+</sup> channels in cardiac myocytes occurs predominantly at the ICD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the duplex patch clamp method, which allows sequential recordings of I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>KATP</sub> in the same membrane patch.

As before, the whole-cell Nav1.5 current was substantially reduced by co-expression with wild-type Kir6.2/SUR2A (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8D</xref>). By contrast, co-expression with Kir6.2-H259R/SUR2A did not reduce the Nav1.5 currents relative to empty vector controls (~100 pA/pF at −20 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8D</xref>) and the surface abundance of Nav1.5 was significantly higher when co-expressed with Kir6.2-H259R compared to wild-type Kir6.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, variants that influence K<sub>ATP</sub> channel surface expression may simultaneously affect Na<sup>+</sup> channel surface expression and therefore have the potential to contribute to abnormalities in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A clinically relevant Kir6.2 trafficking defective mutation (H259R) influences Nav1.5 surface expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK-293 cells were transfected with Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2-H259R/SUR2A.

Ankyrin binding appears to underlie functional coupling since it can be disrupted by mutations in the Kir6.2 ankyrin binding site. In cardiomyocytes, Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels co-localize both functionally, demonstrated by duplex patch clamping, and morphologically, specifically at the ICD. We found AnkG, but not AnkB, to be expressed at the ICD. Quantitative super-resolution microscopy shows similar clustering distances between AnkG and Na<sup>+</sup> channels or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels at the ICD. Competition experiments with peptides corresponding to Nav1.5 and Kir6.2 ankyrin binding sites dysregulate targeting of both Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to the ICD, but not to lateral membranes. Finally, we demonstrate that a clinically relevant gene variant that affect K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking also affects Na<sup>+</sup> channel surface expression.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Targeting of ion channels to discrete subcellular compartments</title><p>Many ion channels are compartmentalized within cells. For example, in the highly polarized kidney epithelial cell, channels and transporters can either target to the basolateral or apical membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stoops and Caplan, 2014</xref>). In cardiac myocytes, ion channels and transporters are also targeted to specific subcellular compartments for optimal cellular function. The L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC), for example, is targeted to couplons adjacent to ryanodine receptors to allow for efficient excitation-contraction. Ion channels and transporters are often targeted to caveolae and lipid rafts. Caveolae are generally thought to be present at the mouth of t-tubules and/or the crests between t-tubules and may contain ion channels such as a specific population of LTCCs, Hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4), Kv1.5 and Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Best and Kamp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong and Shaw, 2017</xref>). Caveolae are also enriched with components of molecular signaling pathways, such as β-adrenergic receptors, culminating in local regulation of ion channels. A number of ion channels are targeted to the ICD membrane structure that couple neighboring cardiac myocytes. The Na<sup>+</sup> channel was one of the first described to be enriched at the ICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen and Levitt, 1993</xref>). Examples of other channels enriched at the ICD of cardiac myocytes include Kv1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mays et al., 1995</xref>) and the inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel subunits, Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melnyk et al., 2002</xref>). In our studies, we found an enrichment of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels at the ICD regions of ventricular myocytes, where they co-localize with desmosomal proteins such as PKP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2012</xref>). The targeting mechanisms for Na<sup>+</sup> channels to the ICD are best understood, and involve forwarding trafficking and anchoring mechanisms that are coordinated by EB1, SAP97, PKP2 and AnkG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agullo-Pascual et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen-Izu et al., 2015</xref>). Mechanisms responsible for targeting K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to the ICD have not been described.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A role for ankyrin G in targeting channels to the ICD</title><p>Ankyrins are cytoskeletal proteins that associate with spectrin-actin networks and bind to integral membrane proteins, thus serving as a sub-membrane scaffold for coordinating the targeting of membrane proteins. Axonal voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, such as Nav1.6, has long been recognized to be targeted by AnkG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</xref>). Other ion translocators that are linked to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton by ankyrins include the anion exchanger, the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett and Baines, 2001</xref>). A missense variant in <italic>SCN5A</italic> (the gene coding for Nav1.5), associated with Brugada syndrome, which causes an amino acid substitution (E1053K) in the Nav1.5 ankyrin-binding domain, has led to the identification of a key role for AnkG in targeting Na<sup>+</sup> channels to the ICD of cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequent studies have shown that Na<sup>+</sup> channels are targeted to subcellular domains at the ICD that contain desmosomal proteins and N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leo-Macias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerrone and Delmar, 2014</xref>). K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are also enriched at the ICD and target to contain desmosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2012</xref>). Several observations from our current study suggest that AnkG plays a key role in K<sub>ATP</sub> channel targeting to this region. First, the functional interaction that exists between Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels can be prevented by specific amino acid substitutions within the ankyrin binding domain of Kir6.2. Second, the quantitative STORM measurements show similar intermolecular distances between AnkG and Na<sup>+</sup> channels or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Third, duplex patch clamping shows functional co-localization in all patches obtained at the ICD between Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Fourth, conventional fluorescence microscopy shows a remarkable degree of overlap between Nav1.5 and Kir6.2 staining at the ICD regions of cardiomyocytes. Fifth, competition experiments with peptides corresponding to Ankyrin binding motifs disrupt both Na<sup>+</sup> channel and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel expression at the ICD, demonstrating a clear role for ankyrins. Finally, consistent with the literature, we find strong expression of AnkG, but not AnkB, at the ICD. Collectively, we interpret these data as evidence that AnkG mediates targeting of both Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to the ICD.</p><p>Although we have observed the AnkG competition mechanism to regulate the surface expression of Nav1.5 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in both HEK293 cells and cardiomyocytes, a previous study has reported that the ankyrin binding deficient Nav1.5 E1053K efficiently transports to the membrane in HEK293 cells, but not in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>). In the latter study, cells were co-transfected with the Nav-beta subunit, which was previously shown also to interact with AnkG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malhotra et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, an additional role for Nav-beta subunits to regulate the AnkG/Nav1.5/K<sub>ATP</sub> complex is a real but unexplored possibility.</p><p>Both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are enriched at the ICD of a cardiac myocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Previous data suggest that AnkG and Gap junction alpha-1 protein (Cx43) are necessary to preserve the Na<sup>+</sup>current amplitude, electrical coupling and intercellular adhesion strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Since the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel, Na<sup>+</sup> channel and AnkG interaction can be demonstrated in HEK-293 cells, which do not express Cx43, we believe that our data demonstrate that Cx43 is not a necessary component for functional interaction. However, we have not investigated this in cardiomyocytes. With immunofluorescence, we found that Nav1.5 and Kir6.2 are spatially localized closer to each other at the ICD compared to the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, we do not think that Na<sup>+</sup> channels directly interact with K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Our STORM imaging data show that the median intermolecular clustering distance from Nav1.5 to closest Kir6.2 at the ICD region is 528 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is greater than expected for direct molecular interactions. The distributions of the cluster area of Nav1.5 and Kir6.2 channel subunits can be well fitted with single exponential function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating a stochastic self-assembly process in the formation of Nav1.5 and Kir6.2 clusters, which later become attached to AnkG in the ICD, as in the case of cardiac Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 directed by BIN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato et al., 2019</xref>). This observation suggests a model in which Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels bind to closely spaced AnkG proteins. The suppression of Na<sup>+</sup> channel surface density by K<sub>ATP</sub> channel overexpression (and <italic>vice versa</italic>), which can be disrupted by mutagenesis of the Kir6.2 ankyrin binding motif, most likely results from competition of these two channels for the AnkG proteins. Several different proteins, including Nav channels, the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, IP3 receptors, KCNQ channels, and Kv3.1 channels all bind to ankyrins, but each protein class has a very different ankyrin binding site, which is evolutionarily highly conserved within the class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and Healy, 2009</xref>). The high sequence similarity of the ankyrin binding motifs of Kir6.2 and Nav1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is therefore somewhat surprising, but it is easy to visualize how these similar sequences can both bind to AnkG. More surprising, however, is that the corresponding sequence within Kir6.1 is almost identical, but neither supports ankyrin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>), nor confers the ability to interact with Nav1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Future structural studies would be very helpful to determine the nature and specificity of the binding sites to AnkB and/or AnkG.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Targeting of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to lateral membranes</title><p>This study was not designed to study targeting to lateral membranes in cardiomyocytes, yet some of our findings are relevant. K<sub>ATP</sub> channels interact with AnkB in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2010</xref>), and AnkB is expressed mainly at lateral membranes at Z- and M-lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). In support, when overexpressed in HEK293 cells, we found that Kir6.2 can interact both with AnkB and AnkG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore fully expected a role for AnkB to target K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to lateral membranes. However, the peptide competition experiments question whether Kir6.2/AnkB interaction occurs natively. Peptides corresponding to ankyrin binding sites of Nav1.5 and Kir6.2 had identical effects to displace both Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels from the ICD, demonstrating that the peptides were functional. However, the peptides did not influence these two channels at lateral membranes. Data with the duplex patch clamp technique suggest that (at least some of the) Na<sup>+</sup> channels and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels may be differently trafficked to the lateral membrane. Within the spatial dimension of duplex patch clamping, about half of the patches contained Na<sup>+</sup> channels at the lateral membrane, whereas K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were present in every single patch. Differential trafficking of these two channels in lateral membranes is also suggested from high-resolution scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), which demonstrated that the majority of Na<sup>+</sup> channels in lateral membranes are clustered in crests of mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes, with hardly any Na<sup>+</sup> channels present in the grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rivaud et al., 2017</xref>). Early recordings with this technique, combined with whole-cell voltage clamping, by contrast suggested that lateral K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are present as submicrometer clusters in Z-grooves of the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korchev et al., 2000</xref>). The finding is in support of the presence of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), which are often found at t-tubular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong and Shaw, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, our duplex patch clamp data demonstrated functional co-localization of Na<sup>+</sup> channels an K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in about half of the patches and future studies should be directed at identification of the targeting mechanisms of these co-localized channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>What might be the physiological relevance and pathophysiological implications?</title><p>It is not clear what the role of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels at the ICD might be, and why they are functionally coupled to Na<sup>+</sup> channels. We have not examined action potential characteristics, since we believe that these local changes may not reflect global electrophysiological properties of the cell. Rather, we emphasize that our findings support the growing body of evidence that cardiac ion channels do not travel and organize as lone entities, but as complexes. Our data are fully supported by recent studies, such as the finding of co-translational 'microtranslatomes' that contain both K<sup>+</sup> channels and Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eichel et al., 2019</xref>), and findings that K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels can co-traffic in cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ponce-Balbuena et al., 2018</xref>). Given its small size (nanometers in scale) and convoluted nature, the ICD cleft space is severely diffusion restricted. Therefore, with repetitive electrical activity, Na<sup>+</sup> entering the cell via Na<sup>+</sup> channels may cause local intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation and Na<sup>+</sup> depletion in the ICD cleft, which is counteracted by ATP-driven Na<sup>+</sup> extrusion via the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump in exchange for K<sup>+</sup> influx. This, in turn, may lead to K<sup>+</sup> depletion in the ICD cleft space. A K<sup>+</sup> flux coupling mechanism must exist to maintain homeostasis. In addition to their functional coupling to Na<sup>+</sup> channels (this study), K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump are also functionally coupled, such that an increased Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump activity activates K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Priebe et al., 1996</xref>), which is thought to occur because of local sub-membrane ATP depletion (and ADP accumulation). We propose therefore that at high heart rates, the elevated Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump activity may locally activate the ICD K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in order to balance K<sup>+</sup> fluxes and maintain the ionic hemostasis in the ICD cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). From genetic studies, the overwhelmingly predominant clinical phenotype of <italic>KCNJ11</italic> (Kir6.2) variants is insulin secreting disorders. Arrhythmias may well be a secondary and understudied phenotype. We know from pharmacological studies (with both humans and animals) that cardiac arrhythmias are a very real phenomenon associated with K<sub>ATP</sub> channel openers and blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster and Coetzee, 2016</xref>). In the model proposed, a relationship between K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation and cardiac conduction is predicted, which is evident from the literature. For example, while studying K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the cardiac specialized conduction system, we have observed that conduction slowing in ischemic Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts was essentially prevented by the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker glibenclamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2011</xref>). This finding was in keeping with the literature that glibenclamide decreases conduction delays during ischemia in open-chest dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekheit et al., 1990</xref>), prevents the beneficial effect of IPC on electrical uncoupling during ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan et al., 1993</xref>), and prevents asymmetric conduction slowing during acute ischemia in canine interventricular septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morita et al., 2008</xref>). Our data additionally demonstrate another level of pathophysiological relevance. We found that genetic variants associated with insulin disorders that cause K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking defects may also affect Na<sup>+</sup> channel surface expression. These suggest that there may be implications for heart disease and conduction disorders in diabetic patients with K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking mutations. Conversely, genetic defects resulting in Na<sup>+</sup> channel trafficking alterations have the potential to affect K<sub>ATP</sub> channel surface expression, and therefore the susceptibility of patients with inherited forms of arrhythmias to ischemia/reperfusion injury. These possible relationships need to be explored in future studies given the clinical relevance and therapeutic potential of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Study limitations</title><p>At present, the physiological or pathophysiological implications of the functional interactions between Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are unknown. Human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are a poor substitute to study this question since these cells have an immature electrophysiology phenotype with little K<sub>ATP</sub> channel expression. These cells also lack fully developed intercalated disks. These limitations are shared by other cardiac cellular models, such as HL-1 cells and cultured primary neonatal cardiac myocytes. An in vivo model with disrupted AnkG/Nav1.5/K<sub>ATP</sub> interaction would be ideal to address effects in cardiomyopathies or in clinically relevant arrhythmias. Unfortunately no such model is currently available. Such an in vivo model would also be able to address the question of whether disrupted AnkG/Nav1.5/K<sub>ATP</sub> interaction affects the ICD structure. We deem this to be unlikely, though, given that patients with mutations in the Nav1.5 AnkG binding domain (and disrupted trafficking of Nav1.5 to the ICD) develop arrhythmias (Brugada syndrome) but not cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>), which would be expected to occur if structural disorder of the ICD occurred.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Kir6.1, Kir6.2-KKK and Kir6.2-H259R were synthesized by Genscript. Ankyrin-G (#31059) and ankyrin-B (#31057) constructs were from AddGene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HEK-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573), negative in mycoplasma contamination test, were cultured in EMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) was used to transfect ankyrins, Nav1.5 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subunit cDNAs. When cells were transfected with multiple cDNAs, the empty vector (pcDNA3) was included to keep the total cDNA amount equal in transfection reactions. Nav1.5 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were co-transfected with the cDNA amount ratio of Nav1.5:Kir6.2:SUR2A to be 10:1:9. Rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2011</xref>). All procedures conformed to the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the NYU IACUC committee (protocol s17-00352). Cells were plated on laminin-coated coverslips and cultured in EMEM. Adenovirus carrying mEos3.2 labeled Kir6.2 (Vector Biolabs, Malvern, PA, USA) were added at an MOI of 1000 for 12 hr incubation. An mCherry expressing adenovirus was used as control. Cultured cardiomyocytes were used for experiments 72 hr post-infection. Peptides corresponding to the ankyrin binding sites of Kir6.2 (VPIVAEEDGGGGGRKKRRQRRRPQ) or Nav1.5 (VPIAVAESDGGGGGRKKRRQRRRPQ) were synthesized by Genscript, and incubated cardiomyocytes for 24 hr before patch clamp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Patch clamp electrophysiology</title><p>Standard patch-clamping was performed using an Axopatch-200B amplifier and recording data with a Digidata 1550A and Clampex 10 software. For inside-out K<sub>ATP</sub> current recordings, the pipette resistance was 3 ~ 4 MΩ when filled with pipette solution consisting of (in mM): 110 potassium gluconate, 30 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and pH 7.4. The bath solution consisted of (in mM): 110 potassium gluconate, 30 KCl, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and pH 7.2. Following patch excision, the pipette potential was held at +80 mV and current was digitized at 1 kHz. Currents were recorded immediately after patch excision and recordings with any sign of rundown were discarded. The ‘cytosolic’ ATP concentration was changed by a rapid solution changer (RSC160, BioLogic SAS, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). For whole-cell Nav1.5 current recordings in HEK293 cells, the pipette resistance was 2 ~ 3 MΩ when filled with pipette solution consisting of (in mM): 50 CsCl, 60 CsF, 10 TEA·Cl, 20 EGTA, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 10 HEPES, and pH 7.2 with CsOH. The bath solution consisted of (in mM): 30 NaCl, 110 CsCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 5 Glucose and pH 7.35 with CsOH. NaCl in bath solution dropped to 5 mM and compensated by CsCl when recording in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>For duplex recording of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> current from the same patch in cardiomyocytes, the pipette resistance was ~2 MΩ when filled with pipette solution consisting of (in mM): 125 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 10 TEA·Cl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.33 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 4-aminopyridine, 10 HEPES, and pH 7.35 with NaOH. The bath solution consisted of (in mM): 140 KCl, 0.33 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES and pH 7.2 with KOH. Nav1.5 current was first measured by a voltage step protocol with P/N substraction in cell-attached mode, Nav1.5 channel was activated by depolarizations from −100 mV to voltages between −80 mV to +80 mV, then membrane under the pipette tip was excised and K<sub>ATP</sub> current was measured with rapid ATP perfusion in inside-out mode with holding potential of +80 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological recordings with angle SICM</title><p>Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is a non-contact scanning probe microscopy technique based on the principle that the flow of ions through the tip of a nanopipette filled with electrolytes decreases when the pipette approaches the surface of the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansma et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korchev et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korchev et al., 1997b</xref>). In this study, we used a variant of SICM called angular approach scanning ion conductance microscopy described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shevchuk et al. (2016)</xref>. The system was used in the same configuration as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leo-Macias et al. (2016)</xref>. Briefly, the scanning probe was mounted in a PatchStar micromanipulator (Scientifica, UK) that allows to adjust the angle for the scanning, selected as 33° in this work for the purpose of scanning the ICD of adult cardiomyocytes with nanoscale resolution. Borosilicate glass nanopipettes pulled from 1.0 mm outer diameter, 0.4 mm ID capillary were used in all experiments. Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments; Molecular Devices) was used to measure the pipette current as well as to record ion channel activity. Cell-attached currents were digitized using Digidata 1440A and a pClamp 10 data acquisition system (Axon Instruments; Molecular Devices).</p><p>After the ICD region was recognized by the scanning, the pipette was moved to the area of sealing, the feedback of the hoping mode was switched off and a gigaseal was formed by lowering the pipette until it makes contact with the surface of the ICD. Cell-attached patch-clamp configuration was then used to record of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels simultaneously. Recordings were performed at room temperature using the following solutions; external solution containing (in mM): 145 KCl; 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 2 EGTA; 10 glucose; 10 HEPES; and pH 7.4 with KOH; internal recording solution containing (in mM): 135 NaCl; 0.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 5.4 KCl; 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 5.5 glucose; 5 HEPES; 20 TEA-Cl; 0.2 CdCl<sub>2</sub>; 10 CsCl; 10, 4-AP; and pH 7.4 with NaOH. Pinacidil was added to both solutions at a concentration of 200 µM to activate K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. The pipette used for cell-attached recordings had an average resistance of ~30 MΩ. To generate a current–voltage (I–V) relationship that allow the simultaneous recording of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, the membrane under the patch was held at a voltage of −120 mV and incremental steps of 10 mV were applied from −100 to +90 mV. Data were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz using the built-in Bessel filter of the amplifier and sampled at 20 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Biotinylation assay</title><p>HEK293 cells expressing Nav1.5 and Avi-Kir6.2-myc were incubated with 0.33 mM biotin for 1 hr at 4°C. After washing with PBS, cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer. Equal amount of biotinylated proteins was incubated with Neutravidin agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) at 4°C overnight. The supernatants were discarded and biotinylated proteins were eluted by a mixture of loading buffer and 200 mM DTT. Western blots were quantified by ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Membrane fractionation</title><p>Flash-frozen hearts were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar. Samples were homogenized on ice with 30 strokes of a glass-glass homogenizer, followed by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer in (in mM) 250 sucrose, 1 EDTA, 10 HEPES, 1 DTT and pH 7.4 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Following brief centrifugation (1000 g for 5 min at 4°C), the pellet was re-homogenized in fresh homogenization buffer with 25 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce and cleared by brief centrifugation (1000 g, 5 min, 4°C). The resulting supernatant was combined with that of the previous step. The supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm using a 90 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) for 1 hr at 4°C. The resulting membrane pellets were solubilized with rotation overnight at 4°C in 20 mM HEPES, 0.5% Triton X100, pH 7.4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), isolated rat cardiomyocytes or rat heart slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.

After washing and mounting, images were obtained by Zeiss 700 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)</title><p>Freshly isolated rat cardiomyocytes were plated on laminin-coated coverslips for 1 hr before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 10 min, and incubated in blocking solution (PBS based 2% Glycine, 2% BSA and 0.2% Gelatin) for 30 min. Primary antibodies diluted 1:50 in blocking solution incubated the cells for 1 hr at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, secondary antibodies against a combination of mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 and rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 or a combination of rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 and chicken conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (1:10000, Invitrogen) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Imaging conditions were achieved by addition of 200 mmol/L mercaptoethylamine and an oxygen scavenging system (0.4 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.8 µg/mL catalase and 10% (wt/wt) glucose) to the fluorophore-containing sample.</p><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), samples were imaged using a custom-built platform based on an inverse microscopy setup (Leica DMI3000). Sample emission was split into two channels through proper dichroic and emission narrow-band bandpass filters (green channel 580/60, red channel 680/40, Semrock), in conjunction with a Dual View (DV2-Photometrics) to image two colors simultaneously, onto a single EM-CCD camera (Andor iXon+ 897). For accurate alignment and mapping of the two color channels, we first imaged diffraction-limited fluorescent beads that have a wide emission spectra spanning both channels (Invitrogen). The location of the beads was matched for both channels based on the use of a polynomial morph-type mapping function, whereby mapping coefficients are generated by Gaussian and centroid fits to the sub-diffraction limit point-spread functions of the fluorescence beads. The two-color image was reconstructed at 20 nm/pixel using the following QuickPALM parameters, FWHM = 4 and S/N = 2.00. The reconstructed super-resolved images of each channel were then super-imposed to generate a two color super-resolved image. The mapping error in the super-resolved image was 20 nm. ROIs of intercalated disc were manually drawn for each reconstructed super-resolution images and further cluster detection were obtained using ImageJ and cluster distance analysis accomplished by a home-built Python script that utilized the image processing packages scikit-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>), and ‘Mahotas,’ an open source software for scriptable computer vision (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jors.ac">http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jors.ac</ext-link>).

The cardiac ICD is a complex protein network, which contains ion channels and structural proteins. Its function is to maintain mechanical and electrical coupling among neighboring cardiomyocytes in the tridimentional myocardium. AnkG plays a role in Nav1.5 organization (Lowe et al., 2008; Leterrier et al., 2014) and in this manuscript, Yang provides additional evidence for NaV1.5 interactions with Kir6.2 mediated by Ankyrin-G, but not Ankyrin-B, in the cardiomyocyte. The authors investigate Nav1.5 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel distribution at the intercalated disc (ICD) and their reciprocal interaction mediated by the intracellular structural platforms. They conducted a functional analysis of such interactions using two models: transfected HEK293 cells (5 cell groups: Na<sup>+</sup> K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, Na+, K<sub>ATP</sub>, and empty) and isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Their data suggests that Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are paired-located at the ICD and have a functional interaction that is mediated by the anchoring protein Ankirin-G (AnkG).</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ankyrin-G mediates targeting of both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to the cardiac intercalated disc&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While two different models were used, none of them accurately illustrates human physiology. It would be of interest to use hiPSC-CM or a genetically modified mouse model to address the aim of this manuscript. Furthermore, it is well known that the integrity of the ICD components is important for normal heart function and structure. An in vivo model of this AnkG-Nav1.5-K<sub>ATP</sub> disruption could address its implication in cardiomyopathy or clinically relevant arrhythmia development. We ask that the authors clearly discuss the limitations of their current approach in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Related to the above point – Previous literature shows that the trafficking machinery in the HEK cells exhibits significant differences compared to cardiomyocytes (Nav1.5 E1053K in HEK cells transports to membrane but does not in the rat ventricular cardiomyocytes- Mohler et al., 2004). The authors should discuss the caveats of their findings which are primarily obtained using heterologous expression system.</p><p>3) It has been demonstrated that Ank-G and Cx43 are necessary to preserve INA amplitude, electrical coupling and intercellular adhesion strength (Sato et al., 2011). The authors should clarify the possible role of Cx43 in the protein-protein interactions they are studying: can the authors demonstrate a Cx43-independent relation between K<sub>ATP</sub>, Na<sup>+</sup> and AnK-G interaction in the cardiomyocyte? In other words, is Cx43 affected in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes?</p><p>4) The suggested impaired Na+, K<sub>ATP</sub> and Ank-G macromolecular complex may lead to disruption of the ICD organization. This would lead to functional consequences on proteins, such as plakophilin-2, which regulates the function of ion channels responsible for the action potential. Is there any evidence for structural disorder of the ICD when the Nav15-K<sub>ATP</sub>-AnkG complex is disrupted? Can the authors provide information on the consequences of the above interactions on action potential characteristics in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes?</p><p>5) The KCNJ11 gene encodes the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2, which has been related mainly endocrine disorders, including diabetes mellitus. To the knowledge of this reviewer, there is no previous evidence suggesting that Kir6.2 is involved in cardiac arrhythmic disorders. The authors must be aware of the limited clinical implications of their data in terms of patient management and therapeutic options.</p><p>6) Isabelle Deschenes' lab has described quite convincingly that Nav1.5 channels form dimers that gate cooperatively. I am surprised her papers are not cited in this study and discussed in the context of the current findings.</p><p>7) The authors must include histograms of the cluster area distributions of K<sub>ATP</sub> and Nav1.5 channels. Should the distributions be exponential, the authors should at least discuss the possibility of stochastic self-assembly mechanism for cluster formation. Sato et al., 2019 is a good starting point.</p><p>8) Do K<sub>ATP</sub> and Nav1.5 negatively regulate their cluster size? What ratios of cDNA (Nav 1.5 to K<sub>ATP</sub>) were used to transfect the HEK cells? Is there a particular ratio of the channels that has to be transfected to see the functional interaction? This part is not clear from the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Following up on that, the Materials and methods section for heterologous expression does not state whether that Ankyrin-G was transfected along the two ion channels. It is not clear why AnkG was specifically transfected for the coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Please clarify.</p><p>9) The authors should discuss in great detail validation of Abs.</p><p>10) The authors should provide nano ruler data to validate the lateral resolution of their STORM system. Pritchard et al., 2012 PNAS provides guidance on how to do that.</p><p>11) The authors mention that the Kir6.2/KKK mutant does not functionally interact with the Nav 1.5, however the immunoblots shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows a decrease in the Nav1.5 expression with increasing amounts of K<sub>ATP</sub> 6.2-KKK cDNA transfection. This needs to be clarified.

Unfortunately no such model is currently available. hiPSC cardiomyocytes are a poor substitute since in our experience these cells have an immature electrophysiology phenotype with little or no K<sub>ATP</sub> channel expression. These cells also lack t-tubules and fully developed intercalated disks. These limitations are shared by other cardiac cellular models, such as HL-1 cells and cultured primary neonatal cardiac myocytes. A new section (“Study Limitations”) has been added to clearly discuss these limitations in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above point – Previous literature shows that the trafficking machinery in the HEK cells exhibits significant differences compared to cardiomyocytes (Nav1.5 E1053K in HEK cells transports to membrane but does not in the rat ventricular cardiomyocytes- Mohler et al., 2004).

However, we have not investigated this in cardiomyocytes. Current experimental models do not allow us to directly investigate this question. The peptide experiments require isolated cardiomyocytes and it is well documented that Cx43 is rapidly internalized from the ICD following enzymatic cell isolation. An in vivo model of the AnkG/Nav1.5/K<sub>ATP</sub> disruption may address this question, but such a model is not currently available.

The latter would be expected to occur if structural disorder of the ICD occurred. Therefore, we deem it unlikely that disruption of Nav1.5/K<sub>ATP</sub> localization to the ICD would result in structural disorder of the ICD. This issue is now discussed. We have not examined action potential characteristics, since we believe that these are local changes that may not reflect global electrophysiological properties of the cell. Rather, we emphasize that our findings support the growing body of evidence that cardiac ion channels do not travel and organize as lone entities, but as complexes. Our data are fully supported by recent studies, such as Gail Robertson’s finding of co-translational 'microtranslatomes' that contain both K channels and Na channels, and Pepe Jalife’s finding that K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels can co-traffic in cells. We have made a better attempt in the revised manuscript to convey this message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The KCNJ11 gene encodes the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2, which has been related mainly endocrine disorders, including diabetes mellitus.

For example, a recent report of the NIH Clinical Genome Resource Consortium concluded that, when performing a systematic evaluation of the evidence supporting the causality of gene variants associated with Brugada syndrome, clinical validity was demonstrated for only one gene (<italic>SCN5A</italic>), even though over 20 genes have previously been implicated with Brugada syndrome [PMID:29959160]. In the case of <italic>KCNJ11</italic>, the overwhelmingly predominant clinical phenotype is insulin secreting disorders and arrhythmias may well be a secondary understudied phenotype. We know from pharmacological studies (with both humans and animals) that cardiac arrhythmias are a very real phenomenon associated with the use of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel openers and blockers. We are therefore very aware of the potential clinical implications of our data in terms of patient management and therapeutic options. We have expanded this topic in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Isabelle Deschenes' lab has described quite convincingly that Nav1.5 channels form dimers that gate cooperatively. I am surprised her papers are not cited in this study and discussed in the context of the current findings.</p></disp-quote><p>With all due respect and at the risk of sounding ignorant, we are unclear as to the reason behind the reviewer’s surprise. The fact that sodium channels cluster together was actually first demonstrated in adult cardiac myocytes by the Delmar lab (PMID:26787348). That the channels gate cooperatively, though beautifully demonstrated by the paper of the Deschenes lab, seems outside of the realm of relevance for the present manuscript. Yet, if the reviewer considers this to be of critical importance, and if he/she were kind enough to provide us a rationale for inclusion of this paper in our Discussion, we would be happy to oblige.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors must include histograms of the cluster area distributions of K<sub>ATP</sub> and Nav1.5 channels.

We have not been sufficiently clear to point out that we have not transfected cells with AnkB or AnkG, with the exception of testing the validity of the antibodies and in the co-IP experiment (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). In all other cases, we have relied on the endogenous expression of Ankyrins in HEK-293 cells or in cardiomyocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors should discuss in great detail validation of Abs.</p></disp-quote><p>The details of antibody validation are now added as a supplement file (Supplementary file 1).

Pritchard et al, 2012 PNAS provides guidance on how to do that.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Unfortunately, we are unable to find the article that the reviewer would like us to consult. PubMed does not list any article authored by Pritchard et al. that is published in PNAS in 2012 and addresses lateral resolution of STORM. That being said, the point of the reviewer (namely, to provide validation of the lateral resolution of our STORM system), is well taken. In this regard, the reviewer is invited to consult the previous work from the Rothenberg/Delmar labs (a total of 12 papers, starting in 2012; the first one in close collaboration with Dr. Coetzee) in which we have applied STORM methods. Of particular relevance to this conversation is the paper by Agullo-Pascual et al., published in Cardiovascular Research 2013 (PMID:23929525). In the Supplemental material of that paper we provide extensive methodological details of our custom-made analysis system, its technical specifications and limitations, as well as specifics of its resolution both in the X-Y and in the Z planes. In that paper (and in the technical supplement) we cite additional reference materials, including several papers of Dr. Rothenberg dealing with single-molecule localization microscopy, starting in 2010. We believe that the previous work provides enough details on the characterization of the technical aspects of our system, our methods of measurement and the resolution in the X-Y plane. We do agree that these details were not specified in the present manuscript and therefore we have included additional references and wording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors mention that the Kir6.2/KKK mutant does not functionally interact with the Nav 1.5, however the immunoblots shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows a decrease in the Nav1.5 expression with increasing amounts of K<sub>ATP</sub> 6.2-KKK cDNA transfection.

By raising the Kir6.2-KKK cDNA amount relative to that of Nav1.5, we believe that less Nav1.5 cDNA was taken up into the cell during transfection because there is more of the other cDNAs. Indeed, we have now performed an experiment which demonstrated that less Nav1.5 expression takes place even when increasing the overall amount of empty vector (pcDNA3) in the transfection reaction (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This explanation now provided in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The co-IP experiment in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 is an important piece of work considering that the authors claim that a common scaffolding protein underlies the functional interaction.

Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data demonstrate that peptides against a region of Kir6.2, previously identified as an AnkB binding site, and peptides against the Nav1.5 AnkG binding site have similar effects. They each affect expression of Na and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels at the ICD, but not at the lateral membrane. Since AnkB is not readily detected at the ICD, our conclusion is that these peptides disrupt interaction with AnkG at the ICD. This is a plausible conclusion given the near sequence identity of these peptide sequences. We assume that the editorial panel refers to the binding site(s) within AnkB or AnkG. Unfortunately, we do not have information about the nature of these sites, not have we addressed these experimentally.</p></body></sub-article></article>
