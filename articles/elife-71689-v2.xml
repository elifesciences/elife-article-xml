neuromedin B (NMB), respectively, to the spinal cord of mice. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been proposed to transmit both types of itch via its receptor NPRA encoded by <italic>Npr1</italic>. However, BNP also binds to its cognate receptor, NPRC encoded by <italic>Npr3</italic> with equal potency. Moreover, natriuretic peptides (NP) signal through the G<sub>i</sub>-couped inhibitory cGMP pathway that is supposed to inhibit neuronal activity, raising the question of how BNP may transmit itch information. Here, we report that <italic>Npr3</italic> expression in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn partially overlaps with NMB receptor (NMBR) that transmits histaminergic itch via G<sub>q</sub>-couped PLCβ-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway. Functional studies indicate that NPRC is required for itch evoked by histamine but not chloroquine (CQ), a nonhistaminergic pruritogen. Importantly, BNP significantly facilitates scratching behaviors mediated by NMB, but not GRP. Consistently, BNP evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in NMBR/NPRC HEK 293 cells and NMBR/NPRC dorsal horn neurons. These results reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which BNP facilitates NMB-encoded itch through a novel NPRC-NMBR cross-signaling in mice. Our studies uncover distinct modes of action for neuropeptides in transmission and modulation of itch in mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>An itch is a common sensation that makes us want to scratch. Most short-term itches are caused by histamine, a chemical that is released by immune cells following an infection or in response to an allergic reaction. Chronic itching, on the other hand, is not usually triggered by histamine, and is typically the result of neurological or skin disorders, such as atopic dermatitis.</p><p>The sensation of itching is generated by signals that travel from the skin to nerve cells in the spinal cord. Studies in mice have shown that the neuropeptides responsible for delivering these signals differ depending on whether or not the itch involves histamine: GRPs (short for gastrin-releasing proteins) convey histamine-independent itches, while NMBs (short for neuromedin B) convey histamine-dependent itches.</p><p>It has been proposed that another neuropeptide called BNP (short for B-type natriuretic peptide) is able to transmit both types of itch signals to the spinal cord. But it remains unclear how this signaling molecule is able to do this.</p><p>To investigate, Meng, Liu, Liu, Liu et al. carried out a combination of behavioral, molecular and pharmacological experiments in mice and nerve cells cultured in a laboratory. The experiments showed that BNP alone cannot transmit the sensation of itching, but it can boost itching signals that are triggered by histamine.</p><p>It is widely believed that BNP activates a receptor protein called NPRA. However, Meng et al. found that the BNP actually binds to another protein which alters the function of the receptor activated by NMBs. These findings suggest that BNP modulates rather than initiates histamine-dependent itching by enhancing the interaction between NMBs and their receptor.</p><p>Understanding how itch signals travel from the skin to neurons in the spinal cord is crucial for designing new treatments for chronic itching. The work by Meng et al. suggests that treatments targeting NPRA, which was thought to be a key itch receptor, may not be effective against chronic itching, and that other drug targets need to be explored.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>itch</kwd><kwd>BNP</kwd><kwd>NPRC</kwd><kwd>NPRA</kwd><kwd>GRP</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How itch and pain information is encoded and transmitted has been subjected to numerous studies for more than a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2021</xref>). There is increasing evidence indicating the pivotal roles of neuropeptides in the coding of itch information in primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2021</xref>). A pruritogenic stimulus activates skin, immune, and nerve cells, or an inflammatory response, which provokes the release of itch-specific neuropeptides from primary afferents to activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang and Kim, 2020</xref>). Notably, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB), two mammalian neuropeptides, have been shown to encode nonhistaminergic itch and histaminergic itch, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2014b</xref>).

These findings are in accordance with human and animal studies showing that histaminergic and nonhistaminergic itch is transmitted through parallel primary afferent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johanek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Namer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>B-type or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), encoded by the gene <italic>Nppb,</italic> has been implicated in itch at discrete regions, including skin cells, sensory neurons, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solinski et al., 2019</xref>). The natriuretic peptide (NP) family also consists of atrial (ANP) and C-type natriuretic peptides (CNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Potter et al., 2006</xref>). BNP binds to both NPRA and NPRC, encoded by <italic>Npr1</italic> and <italic>Npr3</italic>, respectively, with equality affinity, but not NPRB, while ANP also binds NPRA directly, resulting in the elevation of the second message cyclic GMP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Potter et al., 2006</xref>). Although NPRC is considered to function as a clearance or silent receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maack et al., 1987</xref>), it can also mediate guanylyl cyclase (GC) receptor-coupled G<sub>αi</sub>signaling under certain physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anand-Srivastava, 2005</xref>). BNP-NPRA signaling was initially proposed as an itch-specific pathway responsible for transmitting both histamine- and CQ-evoked itch that acts upstream of GRP-GRPR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>). However, that BNP transmits all types of itch is at odds with the fact that GRP is required only for nonhistaminergic itch. Further, genetic ablation of spinal <italic>Grp</italic> neurons fails to impact itch behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that spinal <italic>Grp</italic> neurons do not constitute a functional circuit for itch. Recent studies have shown that BNP-NPRA signaling is involved in histaminergic itch as well as chronic itch in mice which comprises the histaminergic component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solinski et al., 2019</xref>). Given that BNP can bind both NPRA and NPRC, two cognate receptors for BNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the relationship between NPRA/NPRC and NMBR/GRPR and the role of NPRC in itch transmission remains undefined. Considering that the GC-cGMP signal transduction pathway mediated by BNP is inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Potter et al., 2006</xref>) and that BNP-NPRA/NPRC signaling may exert an inhibitory rather than excitatory function, analogous to G<sub>αI</sub> protein-coupled signaling, it is paradoxical that BNP would transmit rather than inhibiting itch information.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>Npr1</italic>, 2,and <italic>3</italic> and other molecular markers in the spinal cord.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram shows crosstalk between NPs and NP receptors.

Among three NPs, interestingly, only BNP facilitates histamine itch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). BNP evoked dose-related scratching behavior (1–5 µg that is equivalent to 30–150 µM) with a peak scratching number of 74 ± 16.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiguchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). However, these doses are much higher than endogenous concentrations of ligands that should be within the nanomolar range, implying that scratching behaviors evoked by BNP reflect a non-specific pharmacological artifact. Time-course analysis showed that scratching behavior was delayed by 20–30 min after BNP injections as described without isoflurane treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiguchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is distinct from the rapid onset of scratching response evoked by i.t.

The use of isoflurane for anesthesia could result in complex effects on neural circuits, especially inhibitory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constantinides and Murphy, 2016</xref>). We compared the effect of i.t. BNP on awake and isoflurane-anesthetized animals and found that isoflurane pretreatment significantly enhanced BNP-induced scratching behaviors in the first 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). This suggests that induced scratching behavior is an indirect rather than direct effect of BNP with isoflurane treatment, consistent with the fact that NPRA/NPRC are inhibitory receptors.

This raises the question as to the specific role BNP may play in the first phase, which is physiologically relevant to the histamine and CQ itch that usually occurs within this period. We suspected that BNP may play a modulatory function in acute itch behavior in a manner resembling the role of serotonin in itch modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2014a</xref>). To test this, we pre-treated mice with BNP at a lower dose (30 µM, i.t.) followed by i.d. histamine at a dose of 100 µg that is insufficient to induce robust scratching behaviors. The low-dose effect was similar to the saline control, which enabled us to examine the facilitatory effect, rather than the additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). At 30 µM, BNP failed to induce scratching behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To determine whether NPRC facilitates histamine itch, we tested the effect of ANP-4–23, a selective NPRC receptor agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maack et al., 1987</xref>), on NMB-evoked scratching behavior. Although ANP-4–23 or NMB at the low dose could not induce substantial scratching behavior individually, their combined administration (i.t.) evoked robust scratching behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), demonstrating that ANP-4–23 could potentiate NMB action. To further determine the role of NPRC in itch, we pharmacologically inhibited NPRC with AP 811 (i.t), a highly selective NPRC antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koyama et al., 1994</xref>), and found that AP 811 significantly reduced BNP facilitated histamine itch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

Indeed, BNP-facilitated histamine itch was markedly reduced by U 73122 treatment, a selective PLC inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting an intracellular coupling between NPRC and NMBR.</p><p>We previously showed that NMB exerts its role exclusively through NMBR in the spinal cord, as NMB is a functional antagonist for GRPR in spite of its cross-binding activity with GRPR in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2014b</xref>).

BNP by itself rarely induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, regardless of the dose, in these neurons. However, when BNP (200 nM) was co-applied with a subthreshold concentration of NMB (10 nM), it dramatically potentiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to the second NMB application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Overall, of 1513 neurons analyzed, 100 responded to 20 nM NMB (6.6 %) and 16 to BNP (200 nM, 1.1 %). Thus were classified as NMBR neurons. From which, 16 responded to co-application of BNP (200 nM, 1.1 %). From 33 NMBR neurons used in this study, 8 (24%) were potentiated by co-application of NMB (10 nM) and BNP. Notably, the percentage of NMBR neurons that responded to both NMB and BNP is largely consistent with the finding that 29% of which express <italic>Npr3</italic>.

Nevertheless, the expression of NPRC in the dorsal horn has raised the question of whether BNP-sap may additionally ablate neurons expressing NPRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–N</xref>). Because BNP-sap at 5 µg, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>), resulted in the lethality of WT mice, we reduced the dose to 2.5 µg so that enough animals could survive for behavioral and molecular analysis.

We also show that NPRC in the spinal cord is crucial for mediating BNP-facilitated histaminergic itch. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is a hallmark feature of neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge, 1998</xref>). By demonstrating that BNP alone could not activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients either in HEK293 cells or in the dorsal horn neurons, we verify that BNP is an inhibitory neuropeptide, in line with the observation that i.t. BNP, even at very high doses (2.5–5 µg), fails to induce the rapid onset of scratching behavior, typical for ligand-mediated acute activation of excitatory itch receptors in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2014b</xref>). Such high doses therefore most likely fall outside the range of its endogenous concentration (e.g. at picomolar concentrations) required for mediating acute itch transmission directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). Although <italic>Npr1</italic> siRNA knockdown in both spinal cord and DRGs makes it difficult to ascribe itch deficits to either region, the observation that BNP-sap treatment, in spite of partial ablation, attenuates histamine but not CQ itch suggests that NPRA in DRGs, rather than in the spinal cord, is involved in CQ itch. Whether NPRA may facilitate histaminergic itch in DRGs awaits further clarification. Given a very small fraction of spinal NPRA neurons also express NMBR, the possibility that BNP-NPRA signaling may marginally contribute to histaminergic itch cannot be excluded. Coupled with previous studies suggesting the inhibitory effect of BNP on nociceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), it remains plausible that NPRA in DRGs may exert opposing functions by facilitating itch while inhibiting certain types of inflammatory pain. Nonetheless, the observation that most <italic>Nppb</italic> neurons express little GRP implies that BNP/NMB and GRP released from distinct types of primary afferents may be responsible for the activation of the dorsal horn neurons expressing NPRC/NMBR and GRPR, respectively.</p><p>Perhaps, the most unexpected finding is that the BNP-NPRC signaling facilitates histamine itch through NPRC-NMBR crosstalk. Given that PTX acts on G<sub>αi</sub> directly in the G<sub>αiβγ</sub> heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smrcka, 2008</xref>) and gallein acts on G<sub>βγ</sub> directly, the findings that inhibition of G<sub>αi</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> signaling similarly attenuates the facilitatory effect of BNP on NMB-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in NPRC/NMBR cells and BNP-facilitated histamine itch suggest an intracellular coupling of the G<sub>αi/βγ</sub> signaling pathway to PLCβ signaling downstream of NMBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that inhibitory G<sub>I</sub>-coupled receptors enhance or facilitate the activation of the canonical PLCβ−Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling transduction pathway downstream of G<sub>q</sub>-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prezeau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Werry et al., 2003</xref>). For example, we have shown that inhibitory receptors such as 5-HT1A and μ-opioid receptor isoform MOR1D in mice or MOR1Y in humans could facilitate or activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling downstream of GRPR via intracellular G<sub>i</sub>-G<sub>q</sub> crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2014a</xref>). Nevertheless, NPRC-NMBR represents the first example of the crosstalk between a non-GPCR inhibitory receptor and an excitatory GPCR. The attenuation of NPRC-GRPR crosstalk by pharmacological inhibition of either G<sub>βγ</sub> or PLCβ signaling suggests that, irrespective of the receptor type, G<sub>i</sub>-G<sub>q</sub> coupling leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization are versatile and universal mechanisms. In congruence with this, even the rare G<sub>i</sub>-G<sub>βγ</sub>-PLCβ-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway that was considered to be a stand-alone paradigm was recently found to be dependent on G<sub>q</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeil et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, partial attenuation of BNP-facilitated histaminergic itch by PTX and gallein implies that G<sub>βγ</sub>-independent signaling mechanisms may also have a role in NPRC-NMBR crosstalk. It is intriguing that ANP may not play a role in facilitating histamine itch, even though it can bind to NPRC with equal potency as BNP. It is possible that ANP may interact with the receptor at different binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Savoie et al., 1995</xref>). Alternatively, it could be due to a much faster clearance rate of ANP (0.5–4 min) than BNP (four to more than 20 min) or CNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Potter, 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematics for the BNP-NPRC facilitated signaling pathway and distinct neuropeptide pathways for histamine-dependent and -independent itch.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic showing a model for NMBR-NPRC cross-signaling facilitated by BNP via the NMB-NMBR pathway. In response to histamine, NMB and BNP are released from primary afferents to activate NMBR and NPRC concurrently. Activation of NMBR by NMB at a low concentration may prime PLCβ signaling, whereas activation of NPRC by BNP stimulates Gai signaling, which in turn stimulates PLCβ to activate downstream Ca2+ signaling.

CQ itch is mediated in part by GRP-GRPR signaling independent of glutamatergic transmission. In contrast, histamine itch is mediated by NMB-NMBR signaling from primary afferents to NMBR neurons and by glutamatergic transmission from NMBR neurons to GRPR neurons.

The finding that cutaneous activation of BNP/SST fibers failed to evoke scratching behavior suggests that activation of these fibers does not transmit itch information as a functional entity. These results may seem surprising in light of robust scratching behavior evoked by i.t. SST. However, they are consistent with the observation that DRG-specific deletion of <italic>Sst</italic> did not influence itch transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Although diminished itch behavior of Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>/<italic>Sst</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice was used to argue for a role of SST in itch disinhibition in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), the deficit can be ascribed to deletion of <italic>Sst</italic> in the brain regions, where Wnt1 is expressed in numerous neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that cutaneous activation of <italic>Nppb/Sst</italic> fibers may provoke the release of BNP/SST onto the spinal cord; However, their endogenous release may not be sufficient to evoke scratching behavior. Together, these loss- and gain-of-function studies indicate that itch-related scratching behavior evoked by i.t. SST represents a pharmacological artifact. Interestingly, conditional knockout of <italic>Sst</italic> in DRGs attenuated thermal and mechanical pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that SST release may contribute to certain types of nociceptive transmission. Consistently, the downregulation of <italic>Sst</italic> in mice with chronic itch may reflect a dampening effect of spinal inhibitory neuronal activity for nociceptive transmission under pathological itch conditions. Thus, the role of SST in sensory neurons is limited to the disinhibition of certain types of pain by inhibiting SST2R inhibitory neurons gating nociceptive transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This interpretation is in line with recent studies suggesting that spinal inhibitory neurons that gate itch and pain, respectively, are anatomically segregated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Most human chronic itch conditions are resistant to antihistamines, which is a major focus of current research due to clinical implications. However, current mouse models of chronic itch, including allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and atopic dermatitis (AD), are additionally mediated by histamine-dependent mechanisms, as they are chemically induced allergic inflammatory responses that involve histamine release from mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shim and Oh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang and Kim, 2020</xref>). In these mouse models, BNP may be upregulated in DRGs as a result of mast cell degranulation and may facilitate histaminergic itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solinski et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is either downregulated or not altered in a dry skin itch model, which is mediated exclusively through GRP-dependent nonhistaminergic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miyamoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, NPRA is dispensable for the development of dry skin itch and <italic>Nppb</italic> is downregulated in a neuropathic itch model as shown in the present study.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate a novel BNP-NPRC-NMBR crosstalk in the modulation of itch transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Considering that BNP potently enhances NMB function, but not vice versa<italic>,</italic> these studies suggest that neuropeptides in sensory neurons either encode or modulate itch information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Our studies reveal an unexpected role of NPRC in facilitating NMB-mediated histaminergic itch transmission (Figure S4). These results delineate distinct functions of GRP, NMB, and BNP in histaminergic and nonhistaminergic itch and highlight the different modes of action for neuropeptides in the coding and modulating of

BNP can act through 3 receptors. Here the authors better define the role of these receptors in itch signaling. They find distinct expression for Npr1, Npr2, and Npr3 in the dorsal horn, with different overlaps with Grpr and Nmbr. Npr3 siRNA decreased histamine but not CQ itch. They focused on Npr3 overlap with Nmbr. BNP pre-injection potentiates itch caused by histamine, CQ, and NMB but not GRP. Bnp-Saporin injection ablates Npr1, Npr3 neurons, and histaminergic itch. Calcium imaging of dorsal horn neurons show that BNP could potentiate NMB induced neuron activation, and transfection of HEK cells showed that NPRC could facilitate NMB responses. They then switch to SST-cre/ChR2 mice to target BNP neurons, but optogenetics did not produce itch. These data indicate that BNP may facilitate histaminergic itch by binding NPRC and potentiate signaling of NMBR.</p><p>The strength of this study combines several approaches to helps clarify signaling in itch and reveals a potential crosstalk between NPRC and the NMB signaling pathway. However, additional vigor, approaches, and clarifications about results are needed. We also wonder if the authors could further use specific agonists/antagonists of NPRC to prove their mechanism. Major questions:</p><p>1) From the literature, ANP should bind to NPRC with higher affinity than BNP (http://pml.medpress.com.pl/ePUBLI/free/PML287-370.pdf). Given the emphasis of the authors on NPRC, it is unclear why ANP intrathecal injection does not cause or modulate, itch whereas BNP intrathecal injection does cause itch. Can the authors please explain?</p><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors inject BNP intrathecally and they conclude that there is delayed kinetics of scratching 20-30 min post-injection, which suggests indirect effects of BNP. Can the authors show that GRP or NMB injection shows faster itch kinetics than BNP?</p><p>3) There is a NPRC specific agonist, ANP-4-23. Can the authors use this ligand to prove the role of this receptor in facilitating NMB induced itch?</p><p>4) The authors utilized Npr3 siRNA injection to determine the role of the NPRC receptor because the Npr3-/- mice have skeletal abnormalities. There is a specific NPRC antagonist – AP811 (https://www.tocris.com/products/ap-811_5498). Can the authors use this antagonist in some experiments to complement siRNA based datasets?</p><p>5) In Figure 4A-B, How many neurons and mice were imaged total in this experiment?</p><p>6) In Figure 4D-F, how many HEK cells were imaged and over how many fields/experiments?</p><p>7) How faithful are SST-ChR2 reporter mice to endogenous expression of Sst and Nppb?</p><p>Other Points:</p><p>1) Line 270-271: The authors state &quot;these findings indicate BNP-NPRA signaling is not required for the development of chronic itch.&quot; That is an overstatement given that dry skin itch is just one model of itch, not all chronic itch.</p><p>2) The schematic in Figure 7 seems to have points in there that are not directly proven by this study. The role of PLCbeta in being downstream of Gi signaling of the BNP receptor is not directly addressed by any experiments. We recommend the authors focus specifically on proven points from their study or qualify clearly in the Figure legend points that are speculative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The strength of the study is to use multiple approaches including mouse genetics, behavior, pharmacology, and imaging to reveal a novel spinal pathway regulating histaminergic itch. The authors showed neuropeptide BNP from DRG sensory neurons and its receptor NPRC in spinal cord neurons can facilitate itch transmission by enhancing the action of another neuropeptide NMB and its receptor NMBR. And their cellular studies suggest that the two receptors NPRC and NMBR present in the same spinal cord neurons interact and boost NMBR signaling. The weakness of the study is the lack of vigorous quantification and analysis of cellular analysis. In addition, there are couple of surprising results need to have further experimental evidence to be clarified.</p><p>It is unclear that how many cells and neurons have been analyzed for ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiment and how many of them were activated by the agonists? If only a small subset of neurons was activated, how can they make sure the activated neurons expressing the corresponding receptors?</p><p>Spinal cord neurons are highly diverse including excitatory and inhibitory interneurons and projection neurons. It is important to determine what type of neurons are activated by the peptides.</p><p>On Line 246: It stated &quot;~37% of Grp+ neurons (44.6 {plus minus} 1.9 in Control vs. 22.6 {plus minus} 2.0 in BNP-sap)&quot;. Should it be a ~50% ablation instead of 37% ablation? 50% ablation is pretty significant reduction. It is surprising to see there is no reduction in CQ induced itch after the ablation. Need to show the ablation of GRP image in Figure 5.</p><p>It is puzzling why Gi pathway became excitatory in neurons. Normally Gi is coupled to an inhibitory pathway to block neuronal activation. This result needs to be further clarified.</p><p>The optogenetic activation of SST+ neurons did not evoke any robust scratching which is surprising. Do these neurons really express BNP and if so whether optogenetic activation lead to release of BNP?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript addresses a critical question regarding chemical itch transmission in the spinal cord, what is the relationship between NMBR/GRPR and NPRA/NPRC in histaminergic versus non-histaminergic itch? The authors adopt a multidisciplinary approach to revealing the facilitatory action of BNP and NMB co-mediated histaminergic itch processing in the spinal cord. The experiments are insightful.</p><p>There are a few points I wish to raise:</p><p>The authors claimed that about half of Npr3+ neurons expressed Nmbr. But there are few overlapping expressions in Figure 1H. Moreover, previous single-cell RNA-Seq results showed that Npr3 (Glut8) and Nmbr (Glut10 and 11) are expressed in different excitatory neuron types in the dorsal spinal cord (Häring et al., Nat Neurosci, 2018). Since the overlapping expression between Npr3 and Nmbr is the fundamental finding in this work, the authors need to validate their conclusion by high-quality histochemistry experiments and/or other approaches. Is Npr1 overlapped with Npr3?</p><p>The authors found that BNP pre-treatment enhanced both histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch responses in mice. They need to demonstrate the contribution of NPRA and/or NPRC in BNP-mediated itch facilitation.</p><p>It is interesting to study the intracellular signal pathways underlying the coupling between NPRC and NMBR. However, the authors cannot generalize their statement on the role of G β-γ based on one pharmacological experiment. In fact, gallein pre-treatment did not abolish BNP/NMB-mediated elevation of intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. It just led to a ~50% reduction in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The authors need more in vitro and in vivo evidence to address the role of G β-γ on BNP-mediated facilitation of histaminergic itch.</p><p>The authors claimed that NPRA is dispensable for dry skin itch and neuropathic itch, and tested the development of persistent scratching responses in a dry skin itch model using Npr1 KO mice. However, no evidence in this work shows that NPRA is dispensable for Sst-mediated neuropathic itch. Does the coupling between NPRC and NMBR contribute to the development of chronic itch and neuropathic itch? The experiments using Sst-ChR2 mice are not correlated with the main conclusion of this study.</p><p>1. Lines 117-118, although a population may be homogenous through the spinal cord dorsal horn, that does not mean it has no modality-specific function but rather may need to be defined by subpopulations to understand any modality-specific functions.</p><p>2. Low-dose BNP-sap did not completely ablate spinal NPRA+ and NPRC+ neurons. Thus the authors cannot rule out the role of NPRA+ or NPRC+ neurons in non-histaminergic itch. And confocal imaging should be required to examine the internalization of NPRs in Figure 5.</p><p>3. In Figure1, laminae are not clearly marked, making it difficult to determine distribution pattern. Image sizes and scales are different even for the same probe (D and F for example). Cell density (DAPI staining) in the dorsal spinal cord is distinct in different images. A lower magnification view of the entire dorsal horn with a high magnification inset would be helpful. How many mice and spinal sections are included for cell counting?</p><p>4. Figure1, figure legend: For D-I all the descriptions separately describe &quot;double ISH&quot; and &quot;Venn diagram&quot;, but for J-M describe both together. Why not either separately state each or state all at the beginning of the legend.</p><p>5. Figure 1—figure supplement 1: Panel A, CGRP/IB4 Npr1 KO subpanel – spinal cord is damaged it is suggested to use a different representative image.</p><p>6. Figure 3C, low-dose NMB still triggered scratching responses in some mice. The authors need to validate their results. Without a saline alone control, the authors cannot make any statement.</p><p>7.

Briefly, a total of1513 dissociated dorsal horn neurons isolated from 10 pups were analyzed and 100 responded to 20 nM NMB (~6.6 %) and 16 to 200 nM BNP (~1.1 %). Out of 33 NMBR neurons identified, 8 (~24%) exhibited potentiation by BNP. This number is largely consistent with the finding that approximately 29% of NMBR neurons express Npr3 (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Because of the heterogeneity of the spinal cord neurons, it is important to determine what type of neurons are activated by the peptides (reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>Although spinal cord neurons are heterogeneous, only NMBR neurons responded to certain doses of NMB. Note that the specificity of NMBR neurons was confirmed using NMBR KO neurons. This enabled us to exclude the overwhelming majority of the dorsal horn neurons from our study. Importantly, the finding that co-application of BNP/NMB could evoke calcium transients in neurons co-expressing NPRC and NMBR warrants that only NPRC/NMBR neurons were selected to be examined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Validation of quantification of overlap of Npr3 and Nmbr expression with high quality approaches and explanation of how this relates to published datasets (Reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>About 32.0% of Npr3 neurons express Vgat and half of the excitatory Npr3 neurons express Nmbr. That is, about 1/3 of Npr3 neurons overlap with Nmbr neurons, whereas 28.7% of Nmbr neurons express Npr3. These findings are in line with calcium imaging results that 24% of Nmbr neurons responded to co-application of NMB and BNP. In principle, RNAscope ISH is a preferred method to reveal more accurate spatial information for gene expression. For example, RNAseq datasets indicate that all Npr3 transcripts are in Glut8 cluster. However, RNAscope ISH showed that 1/3 of Npr3 neurons express Vgat. It is worth noting that RNAseq datasets should be used as a reference rather than direct evidence due to its well-known limitations and the gene of interests should be validated using either RT-PCR or ISH approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Determine functional role of NPRA and NPRC in BNP facilitation of itch (reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>Additional pharmacological, behavioral and ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data are included to support the function of NPRC-NMBR crosstalk in BNP-facilitation of itch, which is the focus of the present study (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Additional approaches to clarify the role of NPRC in itch, including the use of specific receptor agonists and antagonists (Reviewer #1).</p></disp-quote><p>NPRC agonist and antagonist data are included (Figure 3 and 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Clarification of how a Gi pathway can become excitatory in neurons (Reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>The role of Gi has been clarified (see Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The intracellular signaling pathway proposed related to G β-γ is only supported by a single pharmacological experiment, and more evidence needed (Reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>We show that gallein, a Gβγ inhibitor, significantly inhibits the facilitatory effect of BNP on ca2+ and scratching responses induced by histamine (Figure 4E-G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Validation of Sst-ChR2 mice for BNP expression in these neurons and that optogenetics can induce neuropeptide release.

Technically, it is difficult to determine whether optogenetic activation of <italic>Sst</italic>-ChR2 neurons could release SST/BNP, since endogenous release of inhibitory neuropeptides may not induce overt scratching behavior. Although i.t. SST and BNP could induce scratching behaviors, we argue that they may reflect pharmacological artifacts (see discussion).

Since the overlapping expression between Npr3 and Nmbr is the fundamental finding in this work, the authors need to validate their conclusion by high-quality histochemistry experiments and/or other approaches. Is Npr1 overlapped with Npr3?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revisions #2 and Figure 1 shows that limited overlapping between Npr1 and Npr3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors found that BNP pre-treatment enhanced both histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch responses in mice. They need to demonstrate the contribution of NPRA and/or NPRC in BNP-mediated itch facilitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see essential revisions #3 and #4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is interesting to study the intracellular signal pathways underlying the coupling between NPRC and NMBR. However, the authors cannot generalize their statement on the role of G β-γ based on one pharmacological experiment. In fact, gallein pre-treatment did not abolish BNP/NMB-mediated elevation of intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. It just led to a ~50% reduction in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The authors need more in vitro and in vivo evidence to address the role of G β-γ on BNP-mediated facilitation of histaminergic itch.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to the reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claimed that NPRA is dispensable for dry skin itch and neuropathic itch, and tested the development of persistent scratching responses in a dry skin itch model using Npr1 KO mice. However, no evidence in this work shows that NPRA is dispensable for Sst-mediated neuropathic itch. Does the coupling between NPRC and NMBR contribute to the development of chronic itch and neuropathic itch? The experiments using Sst-ChR2 mice are not correlated with the main conclusion of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Data from a mouse model of neuropathic itch, in which Nppb and Sst expression are dramatically down-regulated, are added. However, in other chronic itch models with histaminergic itch component, Nppb is upregulated at certain time points6. Therefore, whether BNP is involved in chronic itch depends on the specific mouse models. Sst-ChR2 results are also clarified, which is consistent with the main conclusion of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 117-118, although a population may be homogenous through the spinal cord dorsal horn, that does not mean it has no modality-specific function but rather may need to be defined by subpopulations to understand any modality-specific functions.</p></disp-quote><p>A neural circuit with modality-specific function in the dorsal horn is usually defined by a gene expression displaying a lamina-specific expression. Spinal modality-specific neural microcircuits with slow response kinetics are proposed to be defined by excitatory GPCR expression in laminae I-II interneurons5. If a gene is additionally expressed in laminae III or other deep laminae, it is unlikely that the population of neurons defined this gene expression is homogenous functionally because lamina III neurons are involved in sensory modalities distinct from laminae I-II interneurons. Even with lamina-specific expression, it is more likely that a GPCR does not define a modality-specific neural circuit, since the number of sensory modalities is limited, while there may be more than a hundred distinct GPCRs expressed in the dorsal horn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Low-dose BNP-sap did not completely ablate spinal NPRA+ and NPRC+ neurons. Thus the authors cannot rule out the role of NPRA+ or NPRC+ neurons in non-histaminergic itch. And confocal imaging should be required to examine the internalization of NPRs in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we could not exclude a role for NPRA and NPRC neurons in nonhistaminergic itch. Unfortunately, BNP-sap has its limitation because a higher dose required for ablation of NPRA/NPRC neurons completely would kill animals, likely due to its diffusion to the supraspinal region. However, our studies are focused on NPRC-NMBR crosstalk, not on NPRA or NPRC neurons per se. In fact, NMBR neurons are also involved in nonhistaminergic itch as we showed previously, due to their partial activation by GRP as a weak agonist.</p><p>Figure 5 are confocal images at high power resolution. Original images are enlarged for better visualization. We used the same method to examine MOR1D/GRPR internalization<sup>7</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 1, laminae are not clearly marked, making it difficult to determine distribution pattern. Image sizes and scales are different even for the same probe (D and F for example). Cell density (DAPI staining) in the dorsal spinal cord is distinct in different images. A lower magnification view of the entire dorsal horn with a high magnification inset would be helpful.
