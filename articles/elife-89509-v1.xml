Despite this, its functional role in macrophages remains largely unknown. Here, we examine the function of Slc30a1 in host defense using mice models infected with an attenuated stain of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium and primary macrophages infected with the attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Bulk transcriptome sequencing in primary macrophages identifies Slc30a1 as a candidate in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Whole-mount immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy imaging of primary macrophage and spleen from <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected <italic>Slc30a1<sup>flag-EGFP</sup></italic> mice demonstrate Slc30a1 expression is increased in infected macrophages with localization at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol. <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre-driven <italic>Slc30a1</italic> conditional knockout mice (<italic>Slc30a1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Lyz2-Cre</italic>) exhibit increased susceptibility to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection compared to control littermates. We demonstrate that Slc30a1-deficient macrophages are defective in intracellular killing, which correlated with reduced activation of nuclear factor kappa B and reduction in nitric oxide (NO) production. Notably, the model exhibits intracellular zinc accumulation, demonstrating that Slc30a1 is required for zinc export. We thus conclude that zinc export enables the efficient NO-mediated antibacterial activity of macrophages to control invading <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Slc30a1</kwd><kwd>ZnT1</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>iNOS</kwd><kwd>zinc accumulation</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella infection</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32330047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fudi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31930057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fudi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Junxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zinc transporter Slc30a1 mediates antibacterial defense in macrophages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic>, the gram-negative bacterium that causes Salmonellosis, is a well-characterized and relatively common foodborne disease. According to the 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection is one of the leading causes of diarrhea-related death, particularly among children under 5 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troeger et al., 2017</xref>). Severe cases of <italic>Salmonella</italic> septicemia are associated with a 25% mortality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feasey et al., 2012</xref>). Based on epidemiological reports, zinc deficiency has been linked to the incidence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troeger et al., 2017</xref>). As an essential micronutrient, zinc is involved in a wide range of fundamental biological processes, including modulating the immune systemâs response to invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wessels et al., 2021</xref>). However, whether zinc plays a protective role in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection remains unclear.</p><p>In mammalian cells, zinc homeostasis is tightly regulated by two families of zinc transporters, namely solute carrier family 30 (Slc30a, also known as ZnTs) and solute carrier family 39 (Slc39a, also known as ZIPs), which export and import cellular zinc, respectively. Zinc imbalance caused by the dysfunction of zinc transporters contributes to impaired hematopoiesis and macrophage survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Slc30a1 (ZnT1) is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and is localized primarily at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nishito and Kambe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Golan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2010</xref>), where it enables the export of cytoplasmic zinc to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shusterman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kambe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura and Kambe, 2016</xref>). In mice, loss of Slc30a1 causes early embryonic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that Slc30a1 is essential for early development and survival. Recent data provide evidence that Slc30a1 expression is induced by a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stocks et al., 2021</xref>), fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>), and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moskovskich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages serve as the front line in the innate immune system by detecting and eliminating foreign pathogens. When <italic>Salmonella</italic> invades tissues, the bacteria are rapidly engulfed and killed by resident macrophages. This rapid engulfment and killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> by macrophages result in bacterial clearance, cytokine production, and the recruitment of polymorphonuclear phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mastroeni et al., 2009</xref>). Despite evidence suggesting a link between zinc regulators and macrophage function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), whether and how Slc30a1 regulates macrophage function during infection remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we perform transcriptome sequencing analysis to identify Slc30a1 as an important host factor in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected primary macrophages. We then used <italic>Slc30a1<sup>flag-EGFP</sup></italic> reporter mice to assess subcellular localization and cell-specific expression of Slc30a1 at the protein level. To study the role of Slc30a1 in macrophages, we generate <italic>Slc30a1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Lyz2-Cre</italic> (Slc30a1 cKO) mice and induce <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Lastly, we used primary macrophages differentiated from the bone marrow of Slc30a1 cKO mice to directly investigate the killing capacity and the antimicrobial response of macrophages to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Our findings provide interesting new insights into the role of Slc30a1 in manipulating cellular zinc homeostasis to support an antimicrobial response in macrophages in response to infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Slc30a1</italic> expression is induced in mouse macrophages upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection</title><p>We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) that were isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and then exposed to an attenuated stain of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 hr, the approximate time that has been closely correlated with the initial replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helaine et al., 2010</xref>).

Here, we provide the first in vivo evidence that Slc30a1 in macrophages plays a key role in host protection against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. We show that mice lacking Slc30a1 in macrophages are highly susceptible to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p><p>The killing capacity of macrophages has been studied extensively, and it mediates the host defense by ingesting and then destroying invading microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flannagan et al., 2009</xref>). Using BMDMs isolated from our <italic>Lyz</italic>2-Cre-driven <italic>Slc30a1</italic> conditional knockout mice, we show that these macrophages have reduced pathogen-killing capacity via reduced NF-ÎºB signaling, decreasing iNOS and NO production. Interestingly, we found that treating these cells with the zinc chelator TPEN improves NF-ÎºB signaling, suggesting that changes in cellular zinc levels likely contribute to their reduced antimicrobial function. Wu et al. previously reported that zinc can suppress iNOS/NO production by inhibiting NF-ÎºB in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have shown that zinc can reduce NF-ÎºB activation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haase et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brieger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeon et al., 2000</xref>). With respect to the underlying mechanism, studies have shown that zinc inhibits the NF-ÎºB pathway by reducing the activity of recombinant IKKÎ± and IKKÎ² by blocking IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this notion, our finding of the role of Slc30a1 in regulating the macrophage response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> may help explain how the genetic deletion of <italic>Slc30a1</italic>, specifically in this professional phagocyte leads to the observed disease outcome in our mouse model.</p><p>An interesting finding from our in vivo experiments is that our <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre-driven <italic>Slc30a1</italic> conditional knockout mice fail to redistribute zinc levels in the serum and spleen following <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. In general, serum zinc is rapidly taken up by the liver as part of the host defense process during systemic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alker and Haase, 2018</xref>). In mice, defects in this processâfor example, due to high zinc supplementationâhave negative consequences for neutrophil extracellular traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">KuÅºmicka et al., 2020</xref>). In infants, consuming a full-fat diet of powdered cowâs milk containing excessive zinc content can lead to a decreased phagocytic capacity of monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlesinger et al., 1993</xref>). In adults, excessive consumption of zinc supplements can impair both the migration and bactericidal capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra, 1984</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that a high zinc serum level in our <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre-driven <italic>Slc30a1</italic> conditional knockout mice affects the percentage of neutrophils and monocytes and the migration of macrophages, thereby reducing bacterial clearance and increasing their susceptibility to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Furthermore, nutrient-dense conditions such as excessive serum zinc can be beneficial to the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Previous studies reported that a high-affinity Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake system ZnuABC of <italic>Salmonella</italic> protects the bacterial cells from nitrosative stress in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fitzsimmons et al., 2018</xref>). Zinc rich also induces peptide deformylase, an essential protein contributing to <italic>Salmonella</italic> maturation that can be inhibited by NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singhal and Fang, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our measurements of intracellular zinc levels revealed high zinc concentrations in Slc30a1-deficient macrophages. We also detected an upregulation of <italic>Mt1</italic>, possibly indicating a cellular response to intracellular zinc saturation. Mt1 is a low molecular weight cysteine-rich protein with a high affinity for divalent metals that is essential for buffering surplus zinc to maintain zinc homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">KrÄÅ¼el and Maret, 2017</xref>). Smith et al. showed that the level of <italic>Mt1</italic> expression was positively correlated with intracellular free zinc concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). In this respect, <italic>Mt1</italic> overexpression may serve as zinc storage for reducing the side effects of excessive cytosolic-free zinc due to Slc30a1 deletion.</p><p>Although we found that genetically deleting <italic>Slc30a1</italic> in macrophages reduces the killing capacity by suppressing iNOS and nitrite production through zinc-medicated NF-ÎºB activation, the underlying mechanism that connects NO inactivation and excessive intracellular zinc remains uncertain. In this regard, additional experiments will be needed to investigate whether the antimicrobial function of Slc30a1-deficient macrophages is restricted to the defect of NO using selective inhibitors of iNOS. Furthermore, although we focused our study on BMDMs, macrophages may respond differently to infection in the context of the full immune system in vivo. Thus, generating a mouse line in which both <italic>Slc30a1</italic> and <italic>Nos2</italic> are knocked out in macrophages (<italic>Slc30a1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Nos2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Lyz2-Cre</italic>) may provide insight into underlying mechanisms behind failed bacterial clearance that affects disease outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, we report that Slc30a1 of macrophages plays a protective role against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection by regulating iNOS and NO activities, which are essential for bacterial clearance through NF-ÎºB signaling. These findings underscore the notion that cellular zinc regulated by zinc transporter Slc30a1 is important for host defenses by maintaining an intracellular killing capacity of macrophages. However, the precise mechanism of how Slc30a1 drives NO-mediated antibacterial activity remains misty, and further studies are needed to explore this aspect.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p><italic>Slc30a1<sup>flag-EGFP/+</sup></italic> mice were generated by Shanghai Biomodel Organism Science &amp; Technology Development Co Ltd.

The supernatants were then mixed with freshly prepared Griess solution consisting of 0.1% <italic>N</italic>-1-naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma, #N9125) and 1% sulfanilamide (Sigma, #V900220) in 5% phosphoric acid (Sigma, #P5811) at a ratio of 1:1. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. Absorbance at 540 nm was then measured using a microplate reader (Biotek Eon, Gen5), and nitrite production was calculated using a NaNO<sub>2</sub> calibration curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Cell viability</title><p>Cell viability of BMDMs under high zinc conditions was measured using the plate-based colorimetric tetrazolium salt assay. First, BMDMs were plated in 96-well plates at 2 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. The next day, twofold serial dilutions of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (Sigma, #Z0251) were added to the culture media, and the cells were incubated at 37Â°C for 24 hr. Next, the cell culture medium was carefully removed and replaced with 100 Âµl of fresh medium containing 5 mg/ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue (Sigma, #M2128). The cells were incubated for an additional 4 hr, and then the cell culture media was discarded. Blue crystals catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase were solubilized in 100% DMSO(Dimethyl sulfoxide), and the intensity was measured colorimetrically at 570 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Intracellular zinc measurement</title><p>A cell-based microplate assay was used to measure intracellular free zinc ions (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) using the cell-permeable fluorescent probe FluoZin-3 AM (Invitrogen, #F24195). BMDMs were plated into 96-well clear-bottom black polystyrene microplates (Corning, #3603) at 1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and allowed to attach onto the bottom surface overnight. The cells were then incubated in culture media containing 2 Î¼M FluoZin-3 AM for 30 min in the dark. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated in fresh PBS for an additional 10 min to allow de-esterification. To detect cellular zinc accumulation, 100 Î¼M ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (Sigma, #Z0251) and/or 4 Î¼M TPEN (Sigma, #P4413) was added to the cells, and FluoZin-3 fluorescence was measured at 1-min intervals for 30 min at 37Â°C using a SynergyMx M5 fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brieger et al., 2013</xref>). The levels of intracellular zinc in response to pathogens and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were measured after 30 min stimulation. Images of FluoZin-3 fluorescence were acquired using a Nikon A1R confocal microscopy and analyzed using NIS-Elements Viewer imaging software, version 4.50.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Protein quantification using western blot analysis</title><p>Proteins from BMDMs were extracted using RIPA buffer (Solarbio, #R0020) containing Pierce protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A32965) and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, #04906845001). Total protein content was quantified using the Bradford dye-binding method (Sigma, #B6916). A total of 50 Î¼g of cellular proteins were mixed with 5Ã loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of prepared proteins were electrophoresed in 10% SDSâPAGE(sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gel at 100 V. After gel electrophoresis, separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, #1620177) at 300 mA for 90 min using transfer buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. The membranes were then blocked in 5% (wt/vol) skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 90 min at room temperature. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST for 10 min each and then probed using the following primary antibodies overnight at 4Â°C (1:1000 dilution): iNOS antibody (#39898S), NF-ÎºB p65 (D14E12) XP rabbit mAb (#8242S), or phosphor-NF-ÎºB p65 (Ser536) (93H1) rabbit mAb (#3033) (all from Cell Signaling Technology). A monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-Peroxidase (HRP) antibody was used to detect the flag-tagged fusion protein. The following day, the membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with a secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (ABclonal, #AS014) diluted in 5% milk/TBST (1:2000) at room temperature for 2 hr. The membranes were then washed in TBST three times for 10 min each to remove excessive antibodies and developed using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #32106). The bands were quantified using the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance between the two groups was determined using a two-tailed, unpaired Student <italic>t</italic>-test (for comparing two groups).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Check if there is an effect of Slc30A1 deletion on bacterial phagocytosis (evaluation of bacterial numbers after 30 min of infection).</p><p>2) How does Zinc or TPEN supplementation to bacteria in LB medium affect the log growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic>?</p><p>3) revisit the histopathology results: check the scale bars, quantify lesions and carry out statistical analyses. The current magnification is not informative.</p><p>4) Seeing the minor differences in burden presented on Figure 5A with 3 mice, please repeat.</p><p>5) revisit the NO involvement in bactericidal activities as per the three reviewer's recommendation.</p><p>6) Remove Figure 7.</p><p>7) clarify the experimental setup that allow mice to survive such inoculum as per the three reviewers' comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The histopathology needs to be reanalyzed by a pathologist. I don't think the scale bars can be right. 5-10 mm? Quantification of lesions and statistical analyses are needed. The current magnification is not informative.</p><p>Many of the experiments include very few numbers. For example, 3 mice were used for data in Figure 4K. This is a very low number of mice.</p><p>Figure 5A, the differences in burden at 24 are very minor, and represent an N of 3. This experiment needs to be repeated.</p><p>Figure 5B, it is not clear whether the bacteria in the Slec30a1-flox group (right panel) are actually in the vacuole. In this panel, not clear that the top arrow is actually pointing to a bacterial cell as the electrodensity is the particle is quite different from all other bacteria shown.</p><p>Figure 5 shows expression of nos2 in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic>. However, panel F and G refer to responses to HK bacteria. The analysis should be done in response to life <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells. Given the MOI of 1 used, I'd be surprised if the macrophages produce much nitrite. Moreover, at the concentrations of nos2 expressed in the experimental conditions used, involvement of NO in the antimicrobial activity of BMDM is limited or inexistent. Killing assays in the presence of a NOS2 inhibitor should be used in order to draw the conclusions made in the paper. The burden isolated from peritoneal macrophages differs at 4 h but not at later times when wild-type and mutant littermates are compared (Figure 4K). The kinetics in Figure 4K are also inconsistent with the idea NO is mediating the resistance associated with Slc30a1. It is quite possible the zinc transport system contributes to NO-mediated host defense, but not under the experimental conditions tested.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the data in Figure 7 is premature, detracting from the main body of work. I suggest data in Figure 7 is deleted from this manuscript.</p><p>Published data is not properly discussed, and the present findings are not presented in context of what we know about the role zinc plays in <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis.</p><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> uses a zinc transport and export systems to gain a hold in mice. Papers on bacterial znuABC and znt transport systems should be considered in the discussion (PMID: 30365536 and PMID: 33203749).</p><p>I find it surprising that wild-type mice live so long after infection with 100,000 CFU of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. What is the strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> used? Does it harbor any attenuating mutations?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a lot of work and the information that Slc30a1 expression in macrophages contributes to control of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection in mice is a new finding that will be of interest to the field. While the findings that SLC30A1 plays a role in macrophage mediated killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> appears. The major conclusions of this study are not fully supported by the data and additional experiments are needed to define the mechanism by which Slc30a1 confers protection against bacterial pathogens like <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium.</p><p>Primarily, the stark difference in the survival of control animals compared to Slc30a1fl/flLysMCre mice (Figure 4D) does not appear to be consistent with the modest differences in the bacterial burden in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected mice (Figure 4K) and macrophages (Figure 5A). The authors should consider reporting additional time points of these experiments or should explain how small differences in the bacterial burden result in the high susceptibility of the Slc30a1 conditional KO animal.</p><p>Conventional C57BL/6 mice are already highly susceptible to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, however considering the dose administered (1 x 10^5 via IP route), the mice should all die by 5-7 days, yet most of the mice survive for two weeks. The authors should include additional details as to how the animals were derived and the source of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium strain used for the study.</p><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> express and secrete various effectors that alter the cellular environment of infected macrophages. As such, it is important that the authors perform additional experiments to show that iNOS and nitrite levels are down in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected macrophages lacking Slc30a1, as the data shown are with dead <italic>Salmonella</italic> and LPS, and the result with live <italic>Salmonella</italic> may be different. Currently, the data show only a correlation between an increase in <italic>Salmonella</italic> numbers and a decrease in iNOS activity in Slc30a1 deficient macrophages. To infer a mechanistic link between Slc30a1 activity and NO-mediated microbicidal activity additional experiments are required, for example using inhibitors of iNOS.</p><p>Overall, there are too many data in the paper, and not all of them are needed to support the main conclusions of the paper. The authors should consider paring down the data shown so that only the key experiments needed to support their conclusions are shown in the main figures and the remaining data are shown in the supplement. A published paper should communicate a scientific advance in a way that is accessible to the reader, and while the authors have clearly done a lot of work, it should not be necessary for the reader to wade through results that are not needed to support the major conclusions of the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The zinc transporter Slc30a1 in macrophages plays a protective role against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Dominique Soldati-Favre (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining minor issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This much improved manuscript has addressed my previous criticisms. There are two remaining issues that still need addressing. The conditional mice target macrophages but also other cells of the myelocytic cell lineage. Throughout the manuscript, please, soften your claim that the conditional mice used bear a macrophage-specific defect. Second, the fact that the strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> used is a vaccine explains the high doses tolerated by the mice. The attenuated strain might have been important for the elicitation of NOS2-dependent immunity, a phenotype that may not have been exposed with wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic>. To be fair with the scientific community, it should be very clear that the studies used an attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain. Therefore, I recommend the title is changed to &quot;The zinc transporter Slc30a1 in macrophages plays a protective role against attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic>.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>We appreciate the significant amount of effort made by the authors to carefully address our comments and find the revised manuscript to be much improved. A few editorial changes to the manuscript are needed before publication.</p><p>(1) The information on the identity of the attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain that is provided in the response to reviewers helps to explain why the mice survived for so long after the bacterial challenge. This information still needs to be added to the revised manuscript, in both the Materials and methods and the Results section describing the experiments, to clarify to readers that the experiments were performed with attenuated <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain MeganVac1 (Accession: CP112994.1).</p><p>(2) While the caveat that a mechanistic link between SLC30A1 deficiency and NO production has not been shown in this study is now acknowledged in the discussion, in the abstract the sentence &quot;We demonstrate that Slc30a1 deficient macrophages are defective in intracellular killing due to loss of iNOS and NO activities with consequent inhibition of NF-ÎºB.&quot; needs to be modified to say &quot;We demonstrate that Slc30a1 deficient macrophages are defective in intracellular killing, which correlated with reduced activation of NF-ÎºB and reduction in NO production.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89509.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Check if there is an effect of Slc30A1 deletion on bacterial phagocytosis (evaluation of bacterial numbers after 30 min of infection).</p></disp-quote><p>As advised, we have repeated the experiment and measured the bacterial numbers after 30 min of infection (dashed line in A).
