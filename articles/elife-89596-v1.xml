granules. The β-cell microtubule network has a complex architecture and is nondirectional, which provides insulin granules at the cell periphery for rapid secretion response, yet to avoid oversecretion and subsequent hypoglycemia. We have previously characterized a peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array, which is critical for the withdrawal of excessive insulin granules from the secretion sites. Microtubules in β cells originate at the Golgi in the cell interior, and how the peripheral array is formed remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that kinesin KIF5B, a motor protein with the capacity to transport microtubules as cargos, is needed to align sub-membrane microtubules in clonal mouse β cells MIN6 and β cells within intact mouse islets. Real-time imaging and photokinetics approaches indicate that KIF5B actively slides existing microtubules to the β-cell periphery. Moreover, like many physiological β-cell features, microtubule sliding is facilitated by a high glucose stimulus. These new data, together with our previous report that high glucose destabilizes the sub-membrane microtubule array to allow for robust secretion, indicate that MT sliding is another integral part of glucose-triggered microtubule remodeling, likely replacing destabilized peripheral microtubules to prevent their loss over time and β-cell malfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>insulin secretion</kwd><kwd>β cell</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DK122650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bracey</surname><given-names>Kai M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM127098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaverina</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK106228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaverina</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK65949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK125696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sub-membrane microtubule array, known to prevent excessive glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, depends on kinesin-1 KIF5B, which moves microtubules to both generate and remodel this array, potentially regulating the dosage of secretion.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The precise level of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic β cells is crucial for glucose homeostasis. On one hand, insufficient insulin secretion decreases glucose uptake by peripheral tissues, leading to diabetes. On the other hand, excessive secretion causes glucose depletion from the bloodstream and hypoglycemia. Not surprisingly, multiple levels of cellular regulation control the amount of insulin secretory granules (IGs) released on every stimulus. One level of this control is facilitated by microtubules (MTs), intracellular polymers that serve as tracks for intracellular transport of IGs and define how many IGs are positioned at the secretion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heaslip et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Varadi et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the architecture and dynamics of the MT network are instrumental for secretion control.</p><p>The findings in the last decade have uncovered that the organization and regulation of the β-cell MT network are quite unusual. As in several other eukaryotic cells, MTs in β cells are nucleated at MT-organizing centers (MTOCs) in the cell interior, partially at the centrosome and to a large extent at the Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Conventionally, this should be followed by MT plus-end polymerization toward the cell periphery, resulting in a radial MT array with high MT density in the center rather than in the periphery. However, the β cell lacks such MT polarity, well characterized in mesenchymal cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bracey et al., 2022</xref>). Instead, interior β-cell MTs are twisted and interlocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Varadi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), while peripheral MTs are arranged in a prominent array of co-aligned and often bundled MTs underlying the cell membrane, hereafter called the sub-membrane MT array or the peripheral MT array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Like other features on β-cell physiology, MTs in β cells are regulated by glucose metabolism. As protein polymers, MTs are capable of regulated polymerization and depolymerization, which allows for fine-tuning of their organization. Under basal glucose conditions, β-cell MTs are stable and undergo little turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Sub-membrane MT arrays are especially highly stabilized by an MT-associated protein (MAP) tau, well known for its neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2020</xref>). Upon a high glucose stimulus, tau is phosphorylated and sub-membrane MTs undergo destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2020</xref>) and fragmentation, possibly via an MT-severing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Müller et al., 2021</xref>). MT destabilization is accompanied by facilitated formation of new MTs at the main β-cell MTOC, the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>), and increased MT polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heaslip et al., 2014</xref>), which are thought to replace destabilized MTs and restore the MT network.</p><p>Such complex, glucose-dependent organization of MT networks in β cells is thought to underly a multifaceted involvement of MT transport in insulin secretion regulation: MTs regulate the availability of IGs for secretion in both positive and negative fashion. First, Golgi-derived MTs are necessary for efficient IG generation at the trans Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>). Second, interior MTs are to a large extent responsible for IG transportation throughout the cell, which occurs predominantly in the nondirectional, diffusion-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tabei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), likely due to the interlocked configuration of the interior MT network. In addition, directional MT-dependent runs of secretion-competent granules toward the cell periphery have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoboth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Müller et al., 2021</xref>). These processes contribute to the positive regulation of GSIS by preparing and distributing IG. At the same time, sub-membrane MT arrays serve for withdrawal of excessive peripheral IGs from the secretion sites, which prevents IG docking and acute oversecretion upon a given stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). The latter process provides a negative MT regulation of secretion.</p><p>During GSIS, the abovementioned glucose-dependent destabilization of the sub-membrane MT array must reduce IG withdrawal and downplay the negative MT-dependent regulation of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>). At the same time, new MTs polymerizing off the Golgi facilitate IG biogenesis and provide material to rebuild destabilized network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>). This is likely preparing cells for the next round of stimulation. Thus, existing data provide at least initial understanding of the mechanisms whereby β-cell MT architecture allows for fine-tuning of GSIS levels.</p><p>However, it is yet unclear how the complex β-cell MT network forms. Being nucleated at MTOCs in the cell interior, it is puzzling that the resulting β-cell MTs are not organized in conventional radial arrays and rather form a prominent peripheral array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>). The goal of this study is to uncover the mechanisms underlying the development of β-cell-specific MT network.</p><p>One of the established ways to modify the MT network without changing the location of MTOCs is to relocate already polymerized MTs by active motor-dependent transport. This phenomenon is called ‘MT sliding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Straube et al., 2006</xref>). Several MT-dependent molecular motors have been implicated in driving MT sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu and Gelfand, 2017</xref>). In some cases, a motor facilitates MT sliding by walking along a MT while its cargo-binding domain is stationary being attached to a relatively large structure, e.g., plasma membrane. This causes sliding of an MT which served as a track for the stationary motor. This mechanism has been described for dynein-dependent MT sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grabham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2005</xref>). MTs can also be efficiently slid by motors which have two functional motor assemblies, such as a tetrameric kinesin-5/Eg5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vukušić et al., 2021</xref>), or which carry an MT as a cargo while walking along another MT. For the latter mechanism, a motor needs a non-motor domain with a capacity to bind either an MT itself or an MAP as an adapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurasawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vukušić et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Out of these MT sliding factors, kinesin-1 is known to be critical for organizing unusual MT architecture in specialized cells. In oocytes, kinesin-1-dependent MT sliding empowers cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). In differentiating neurons, kinesin-1 moves organelles and MTs into emerging neurites, which is a defining step in developing branched MT networks and long-distance neuronal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). With these data in mind, kinesin-1 presents itself as the most attractive candidate for organizing MTs in β cells. This motor is highly expressed in β cells and is well known to act as a major driving force in IG transport and GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meng et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Varadi et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Varadi et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that KIF5B, being the major variant of kinesin-1 in β cells, actively slides MTs in this cell type. We show that this phenomenon defines MT network morphology and supplies MTs for the sub-membrane array. Moreover, we find that MT sliding in β cells is a glucose-dependent process and thus likely participates in metabolically driven cell reorganization during each secretion cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of KIF5B as the MT sliding motor in β cells</title><p>To address the factors that shape the configuration of MT networks in β cells, we tested for a potential involvement of motors-dependent MT sliding.

To visualize MT sliding, shRNA-treated MIN6 cells expressing mEmerald-tubulin were imaged by live-cell spinning disk confocal microscopy. We photobleached MTs in two large cell regions, leaving a thin unbleached band (‘fluorescent belt’) and analyzed relocation of MTs from the ‘fluorescent belt’ into the bleached areas over time. To minimize the effects of plausible MT polymerization and to reduce photobleaching, MTs were imaged for short time periods (5 min). Strikingly, in control cells (treated with scrambled control shRNA), MTs were efficiently translocated from the ‘fluorescent belt’ into the photobleached area, indicating that MT sliding events are prominent in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In contrast, MIN6 cells expressing either <italic>Kif5b</italic> shRNA variants displayed a significant loss of MT sliding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E, and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> ‘MT sliding FRAP’), indicating that the loss of KIFB leads to the loss of MT sliding.</p><p>While the assay described above provides an easy visualization of MT sliding, it allows for visualization of only a subset of the MT network. To further corroborate the above findings, we used a less photodamaging system to visualize MT sliding that does not involve photobleaching and allows for evaluation of displacements within the whole MT network. To this end, we applied an MT probe of fiducial marks, K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup>-SunTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>) in MIN6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). This probe contains the human kinesin-1 motor domain (residues 1–560) with a rigor mutation in the motor domain (K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup>) and fused to 24 copies of a GCN4 peptide. The rigor mutation in the motor domain causes it to bind irreversibly to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rice et al., 1999</xref>). When co-expressed with a pHalo-tagged anti-GCN4 single-chain antibody (ScFv-GCN4-HaloTag-GB1-NLS), K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup> can recruit up to 24 of the Halo ligands to a single position on an MT. The pHalo-tagged anti-GCN4 construct also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which lends itself to reduce the background of the unbound dye. This enables visualization of MT sliding events via single molecule tracking of the fiducial marks along the MT lattice, allowing us to analyze MT sliding behavior within the whole network with high temporal and spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref> ‘MT sliding Suntag’).</p><p>Our data indicate that in cells treated with scrambled control shRNA, a subset of K560Rigor<sup>E236A</sup>-SunTag fiducial marks underwent rapid directional movements, interpreted as MT sliding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and K</xref>).

Our examination revealed a consistent presence of a significant peripheral array in the C57BL/6J control mice, while the KO counterparts exhibited a partial loss of this peripheral bundle. Specifically, the measured tubulin intensity at the cell periphery was significantly reduced in the KO mice compared to their wild-type (wt) counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Distinct extra-dense MTs were not common in islet β cells, possibly due to the 3D shape of a β cell in tissue and/or compensatory mechanisms in organisms.

Here, we applied the same computational analysis to MT imaging data in MIN6 cells with perturbed KIF5B level and/or function. After deconvolution for increased signal-to-noise ratio, single 2D slices of MT images were subjected to thresholding. Two thresholding options were analyzed for the unbiased approach. A threshold specifically optimized (perfect) for the peripheral MT array in each cell was considered along with a standard threshold across the analyzed cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thereafter, the directionality of MTs with respect to the cell border was determined. Every pixel of the image was analyzed with inconclusive pixels disregarded. MT directionality was quantified as a function of the distance from the cell border and directionality of peripheral MTs within 1 µm of the cell border quantified. Across the analysis, two thresholding conditions provided similar outputs. Our results indicate that in MIN6 cells treated with nontargeting control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), the distribution of MT angles in the cell periphery is vastly parallel and co-aligned with the cell boundary, as previously reported for primary islet β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, the loss of KIF5B via shRNA depletion resulted in a significant loss of parallel MTs at the periphery as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the MT directionality analysis in β cells within islets from the <italic>Kif5b</italic> KO mice revealed a significant decrease in MT alignment to the cell periphery as compared to the wt mice, closely mirroring our findings from the <italic>Kif5b</italic> knockdown in MIN6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).

These data suggest that KIF5B-driven MT sliding is a decisive mechanism of the sub-membrane MT array generation, likely via redistribution of centrally nucleated MTs and their subsequent alignment at the cell edge.

When overexpressed, this construct acts as a dominant-negative (DN) tool preventing the association of the tail of endogenous KIF5B with MTs.

When subjected to the FRAP assay, we detected a complete loss of MT sliding events as compared to a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). To prevent tail engagement of the MT lattice through the ATP-independent binding domain, we opted to make point mutations in the tail domain to change the residues 892-DRKRYQ to 892-DAAAYA, thus generating KIFDN<sup>mut</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Photobleaching assay in cells co-expressing the KIFDN<sup>mut</sup> with mEmerald-tubulin indicated that the MT sliding activity was not blocked in the presence of the mutated construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref> KFDN FRAP), confirming that KIF5B tail domain binding to MTs is needed for MT sliding in β cells.</p><p>The DN constructs are also tagged with the FK506-rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP), as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.

We restored kinesin-1 activity by connecting the motor-less KIF5B, KIFDN<sup>wt</sup>, to kinesin-1 motor domain as a way to rescue the effects of DN approach of KIF5B tail overexpression. To this end, we co-expressed MIN6 cells with the tail domain, mEmerald-tubulin, and the KIF5C motor domain fused to FRB domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, the field is still far from understanding the mechanisms underlying the network architecture. Here, we show that MT sliding is a prominent phenomenon in β cells and that it is driven by kinesin KIF5 B. This kinesin-1-dependent MT sliding is a critical mechanism needed for the formation and long-term maintenance of β-cell MT networks. In addition, we show that MT sliding activity is facilitated by glucose stimulation, suggesting that this process is involved in the regulation of GSIS and/or providing β-cell fitness during the response to glucose. Overall, our study establishes MT sliding as an essential regulator of β-cell architecture and function.</p><p>As we reviewed in the Introduction, the β-cell MT network consists of an interlocked meshwork and peripheral MT arrays co-aligned with the cell border. We find that blocking kinesin has two major effects on MT organization: (1) receding of MTs at the cell periphery and increased MT density in the cell center, and (2) lack of alignment of remaining peripheral MTs with the cell border. We interpret that the first phenotype arises from the lack of MT sliding from the cell center to the periphery, and the second phenotype arises from the lack of MT sliding along pre-existing peripheral MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In cultured mesenchymal cells, the kinesin motor was reported to populate the cell periphery with MTs via promoting rescues and elongation of radially arranged dynamic MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreu-Carbó et al., 2022</xref>). Our data indicate that this mechanism does not noticeably contribute to kinesin-dependent MT organization in β cells, leaving MT sliding the only known mechanism underlying the phenotype observed here. This difference in kinesin action could be due to basic differences in MT network properties in these cell types: in a mostly non-radial, highly stabilized MT network in β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), modulation of MT plus end rescue efficiency is not likely to be a significant factor.</p><p>Interestingly, blocking kinesin results in a striking accumulation of MT in the cell center where they are normally nucleated at MTOCs, which include the centrosome and the Golgi, in differentiated β cells, the latter being the main MTOC. Thus, sliding MTs originate from the MTOC area. At the same time, FIB-SEM analysis did not detect many MTs associated with MTOCs in physiologically normal β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Müller et al., 2021</xref>). This implies that MTs are typically rapidly dissociated from MTOCs so that they become available for transport by sliding. It is worth mentioning that for long-distance transport by sliding, cargo MTs must be short; otherwise, MT buckling and not long-distance transport will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Straube et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, shorter MTs have been observed in high glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Müller et al., 2021</xref>) when MTs are nucleated more actively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>) and transported more frequently (this paper). Possibly, nucleated MTs are detached from MTOCs before they achieve a length that would prevent their transport. An intriguing possibility has been proposed, indicating that in high glucose conditions, MTs might undergo severing by katanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Müller et al., 2021</xref>). This process could generate MT fragments, potentially facilitating their role as cargos with increased ease of transport. It is also possible that sliding MT subpopulation has some additional specific features that make them preferred cargos, since it is becoming increasingly clearer in the field that there is immense heterogeneity among MTs. Posttranslational modifications and MT-associated proteins, which vastly alter stability and coordination of motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hammond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKenney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Monroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), might also influence which MTs serve as cargos versus transportation tracks in β cells.</p><p>Importantly, we observe a prominent effect of peripheral MT loss only after a long-term kinesin depletion (3–4 days). This is consistent with our observation that only a minor subset of MT is being moved within each experimental time frame. We postulate that the absence of a peripheral MT array in KIF5B-depleted cells is a consequence of prolonged lack of sliding. We hypothesize that MT sliding must contribute to β-cell-specific peripheral MT bundle formation during β-cell differentiation. We also found that increasing MT sliding does not yield a properly configured MT array: kinesore-treated cells lack aligned peripheral MTs, consistent with kinesore-induced MT looping reported in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Randall et al., 2017</xref>). This indicates that, similar to other parts of β-cell physiology, the dose of MT sliding has to be precisely tuned to achieve physiologically relevant architecture. It was shown before that exaggerated kinesin-dependent MT sliding causes MT bundling and buckling into aberrant configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Straube et al., 2006</xref>). We predict that a fine-tuning regulatory pathway must exist to restrict the number of MT sliding events to the cell needs.</p><p>Consistent with this idea, MT sliding is sensitive to metabolic regulation: our data indicate that MT sliding is activated on a short-term basis after glucose stimulation. While the deep understanding of the role of MT sliding in GSIS requires further studies, it is plausible to suggest two potential functions for this process in glucose-stimulated cells. (1) Given that peripheral MTs are destabilized in high glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2020</xref>), we suggest that a long-term function for MT sliding is needed to replace MT population at the cell periphery and restore the pre-stimulus MT organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Because the amount of MT polymer on every glucose stimulation changes only slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Müller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>) and we detect MT loss from the periphery only after a prolonged blocking of sliding, we reason that this function could be essential to maintain long-term β-cell fitness and prepare cells for repeated rounds of stimulation. (2) As a potential short-term function at each stimulation round, MT sliding within the peripheral bundle itself could rearrange fragmented MTs within this array suppressing its role in IG withdrawal from specific secretion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In this scenario, MT sliding would tilt the balance between positive and negative MT-dependent regulation of GSIS toward enhanced secretion at each stimulation.</p><p>Our finding provides an example of a phenomenon where a slight change in MT configuration is physiologically significant. This is not an exception because subtle MT defects often have dramatic consequences. For example, in mitotic spindles, a tiny overgrowth of MT ends during metaphase, which causes them to attach to both kinetochores rather than just one, is very significant for the efficiency of chromosome segregation, causing aneuploidy and cancer. The changes in β-cell MT networks that we are reporting are much stronger: the effect on the peripheral MT network accumulated over 3 days of KIF5B depletion is dramatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Short-term gross MT network configurations after a single glucose stimulation are harder to detect but are consistent with previous reports that MTs at the cell periphery are destabilized and fragmented upon high glucose stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Müller et al., 2021</xref>), and that preventing this MT rearrangement completely blocks GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One of the most fascinating features of insulin secretion regulation is that the amount of generated insulin granules significantly exceeds the normal physiological needs for insulin secretion (~100 times more than needed). At the same time, even slightly facilitated glucose depletion can be devastating for the human body. Accordingly, the excessive insulin content of a β cell resulted in the development of multiple levels of control, preventing excessive secretion. Our previous data suggest that the peripheral MT array provides one of those mechanisms. This study indicates that MT sliding is necessary to form the proper peripheral network in the long term. Short-term glucose-induced changes in the peripheral MT array likely need to be subtle to prevent oversecretion. Thus, we are not surprised that a dramatic effect of sliding inhibition is only detectable by our approaches after the changes in the MT network accumulate over time.</p><p>On a final note, it is important to evaluate the phenomenon reported here in light of the dual role of KIF5B as IG transporter and MT transporter and the coordination of those two roles in IG transport and availability for secretion. Our results indicate that KIF5B is needed for the formation of the peripheral MT bundle, which we have shown to restrict secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2020</xref>). At the same time, it is well established that KIF5B transports IGs, and KIF5B loss of function impairs GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meng et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Varadi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2011</xref>). After a prolonged KIF5B inactivation, a loss of peripheral readily releasable IG should be expected due to two factors: because there is no MT bundle to prevent oversecretion and IG depletion, and because there is no new IGs being transported from the Golgi area. In contrast, physiological activation of kinesin by glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donelan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Varadi et al., 2003</xref>) would both promote replenishment of IG through nondirectional transport through the cytoplasm and restoration of the peripheral MT array to prevent oversecretion.</p><p>In conclusion, here, we add another very important cell type to the list of systems that employ KIF5B-dependent MT sliding to build functional cell-type-specific MT networks. This system is unique because, in this case, MT sliding is metabolically regulated and activated on a single-minute timescale by nutrition triggers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key reagents</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">MIN6</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gift from Dr. Miyazaki, Osaka University Medical School, Japan</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_0431">CVCL_0431</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse Insulinoma Cell Line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Kinesore</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tocris Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#: 6664</td><td align="left" valign="top">Final concentration (50 µm)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">A/C Heterodimerizing Drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Takara Bio Inc</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#: 635056</td><td align="left" valign="top">Final concentration (25 µm)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-KIF5B rabbit monoclonal antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#: Ab167429</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">(1:500 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-alpha-Tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (DM1a)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#: T9026</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">(1:1000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Anti-alpha-Tubulin rabbit polyclonal antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#: T3526</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">(1:1000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Other</td><td align="left" valign="top">Janelia Fluor 585 (JF585) and 646 (JF646),<break/>HaloTag Ligands</td><td align="left" valign="top">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="top">CS315105, GA1120</td><td align="left" valign="top">Final concentration (2 µl/mL)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="top">Strain #:000664<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">Control mice (wt)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Kif5b<sup>fl/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup><italic>:RIP2-Cre</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top">Strain #:008637; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:008637">IMSR_JAX:008637</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Kif5b</italic> KO mice; derived from Jackson Laboratory fl/fl strain (see identifiers)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>MIN6 cells (a gift from Dr. Miyazaki, Osaka University Medical School, Japan) between passages 40 and 60 were utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishihara et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miyazaki et al., 1990</xref>).

The authors propose that KIF5B drives microtubule sliding and alignment along the plasma membrane, a process enhanced by high glucose levels. This precise microtubule arrangement is essential for regulated secretion in β-cells. Supporting this model, the authors show that KIF5B is more highly expressed than other kinesins in MIN6 cells, and its depletion via shRNA disrupts sub-membrane microtubule density and organization. In contrast, KIF5A knockdown alters overall microtubule architecture. Using a dominant-negative approach, they further demonstrate that KIF5B-mediated microtubule sliding relies on its tail domain and is stimulated by glucose, paralleling known glucose-dependent increases in kinesin-1 activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89596.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bracey</surname><given-names>Kai M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fye</surname><given-names>Margret A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cario</surname><given-names>Alisa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Kung-Hsien</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Pi'illani</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kaverina</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) It is difficult to appreciate that there is a &quot;peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array&quot; as it is not well defined in the manuscript. This reviewer assumes that this is in the respective field clear. Yet, while it is appreciated that there is an increased amount of MTs close to the cytoplasmic membrane, the densities appear very variable along the membrane. Please provide a clear description in the Introduction what is meant with &quot;peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>A definition has been added to the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors described a &quot;consistent presence of a significant peripheral array in the C57BL/ 6J control mice, while the KO counterparts exhibited a partial loss of this peripheral bundle.</p><p>Specifically, the measured tubulin intensity at the cell periphery was significantly reduced in the KO mice compared to their wild-type counterparts&quot;. In vitro &quot;control cells had convoluted nonradial MTs with a prominent sub-membrane array, typical for β cells (Fig. 2A), KIF5B-depleted cells featured extra-dense MTs in the cell center and sparse receding MTs at the periphery (Fig. 2B,C)&quot;. Please comment/discuss why in vivo there are no &quot;extra-dense MTs in the cell center&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We now add a discussion of this point, which we believe could be a manifestation of 3D shape of a beta cell in tissue and/or compensatory mechanisms in organisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Authors should include in the Discussion a paragraph discussing the fact that small changes in MT configuration can have strong effects.</p></disp-quote><p>A paragraph added to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 1: Even though the reviewer appreciates that minor changes of MT configuration have severe effects, still the overall effects appear minor (40 vs. &lt;50% or 35% vs. around 28%). Notably, there are no statistically significant differences in the different groups in Fig. 1Suppl-Fig.1 D. This reviewer is not sure if the combination of many not significantly different data points can result in significant changes and this should be checked by a statistician. Authors should include in the Discussion a paragraph discussing the fact that small changes in MT configuration can have strong effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the requested paragraph to the discussion. Indeed, the differences are small, and the significance is only detected in a data set with a large sample size in Fig. 1J,K (combined data sets with smaller sizes from Fig. 1-Suppl-Fig.1 D), consistent with the fact that a larger sample size generally provides more power to detect an effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Unfortunately, the authors cannot block kinesin-1 resulting in microtubule accumulation in the cell center and then release the block (best inhibiting microtubule formation), to show that the MTs accumulated in the cell center will be transported to the periphery.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed the case at the moment, yes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>- Abstract: β-cells vs. β cells (and throughout the manuscript)</p><p>- Page 4: &quot;MTOC, the Golgi, (Trogden et al. 2019), and&quot;</p><p>- Page 5: &quot;β-cell specific&quot;</p><p>- MT-sliding vs. MT sliding</p><p>- Kinesin 1 vs. kinesin-1</p><p>- Page 6, line 1: &quot;β cells. actively&quot;</p><p>- Page 7: &quot;a microtubule probe&quot;, should be &quot;MT&quot;</p><p>- Page 9: &quot;1μm&quot; vs. &quot;1 μm&quot;</p><p>- Page 10: &quot;demonstrate a dramatic effect&quot; recommended is: &quot;demonstrate a marked effect&quot;</p><p>- Page 13, line 1: dramatically vs. markedly</p><p>- Page 13, line 5: &quot;50μm&quot; vs. &quot;50 μm&quot; (in general, there should be a space between number and unit?)</p><p>- &quot;37 degrees C&quot; vs. &quot;37{degree sign}C&quot;</p><p>- Animal protocol number?</p><p>- &quot;Mice were euthanized by isoflurane inhalation&quot;?
