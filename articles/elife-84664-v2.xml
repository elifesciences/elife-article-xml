id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Home-based self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may be an alternative for women not attending clinic-based cervical cancer screening.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed barriers to care and motivators to use at-home HPV self-sampling kits during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating kit effectiveness. Participants were women aged 30–65 and under-screened for cervical cancer in a safety-net healthcare system. We conducted telephone surveys in English/Spanish among a subgroup of trial participants, assessed differences between groups, and determined statistical significance at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Over half of 233 survey participants reported that clinic-based screening (Pap) is uncomfortable (67.8%), embarrassing (52.4%), and discomfort seeing male providers (63.1%). The last two factors were significantly more prevalent among Spanish vs English speakers (66.4% vs 30% (p=0.000) and 69.9 vs 52.2% (p=0.006), respectively). Most women who completed the kit found Pap more embarrassing (69.3%), stressful (55.6%), and less convenient (55.6%) than the kit. The first factor was more prevalent among Spanish vs English speakers (79.6% vs 53.38%, p=0.001) and among patients with elementary education or below.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic influenced most (59.5%) to participate in the trial due to fear of COVID, difficulty making appointments, and ease of using kits.

This is expected to lead to gaps in preventive care and increased risk of preventable chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wright et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">CDC, 2020</xref>), especially among medically underserved populations. Cervical cancer screening declined by 84% in April 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeGroff et al., 2021</xref>), a month after the declaration of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the rates had not yet fully recovered by June 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mast et al., 2021</xref>). Before the COVID-19 pandemic, racial minorities and those with limited English proficiency were less likely to be screened for cervical cancer than their non-Hispanic white and English-proficient counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuzzell et al., 2021</xref>), leading to disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">National center for health statistics and National Health Interview Survey, 2019</xref>). These populations experiencing higher rates of cervical cancer and other chronic illnesses before the pandemic are now faced with widening health disparities due to COVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fisher-Borne et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Safety net health systems, which provide care regardless of the patient’s ability to pay, provide care for a large proportion of the medically underserved population in the US and have become increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knudsen and Chokshi, 2021</xref>). The population served by safety net systems predominantly comprises low-income individuals, immigrants, and racial/ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">America’s Health Care Safety Net, 2000</xref>). These populations are also disproportionately affected by COVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mullangi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Barriers to cervical cancer screening among safety net system patients, both pre- and post–pandemic, have not been fully described, and thus research to inform targeted approaches to increase screening participation is needed. A previous study found that under-screened women within a safety net system were more likely to have limited knowledge of HPV and report cost, time, and lack of childcare as barriers to Pap screening compared to screened women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ogunwale et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, alternative screening strategies such as home-based self-sampling for HPV testing may help circumvent many of these barriers. Additionally, other barriers introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as such as limited availability of clinic appointments and fear of illness, are also addressed by home-based self-sampling, which may provide opportunities to continue to deliver preventive care during disruptions.</p><p>Self-sample HPV testing is effective at detecting high-risk HPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herrington, 2022</xref>) and has been used in multiple settings for cervical cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nishimura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). Increased participation in screening varies across settings and by implementation strategies used, but a recent meta-analysis was associated with a nearly doubling of cervical cancer screening rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musa et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, self-sampling is highly acceptable by patients in multiple healthcare settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>). In the United States, the National Cancer Institute is currently conducting the ‘Last Mile’ initiative to provide data to support FDA approval of self-sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">National Cancer Institute. Division of Cancer Prevention, 2022</xref>). If approved, self-sampling could be used in healthcare settings to address barriers to screening, particularly in safety net systems where screening coverage is generally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2022</xref>). Thus it is imperative to understand current barriers to screening in safety net health systems, as well as motivators to use self-sample HPV testing.</p><p>Here, we describe perceived barriers to cervical cancer screening and motivators to use an at-home self-sampling kit for HPV testing among women in an urban safety net health system. The survey was conducted among a subset of participants from the PRESTIS trial, a pragmatic trial assessing the effectiveness of mailed self-sample HPV kits to improve cervical cancer screening among women in a safety net healthcare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Montealegre et al., 2020</xref>). The trial was predominantly conducted during the period of COVID-19-related measures, thus providing unique data on barriers and motivators to self-sampling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe how safety net patients were affected by COVID, their perceptions of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their participation in the trial, as well as barriers to clinic-based screening and motivators to use the self-sampling kits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Study participants were part of a larger HPV self-sampling randomized clinical trial, the Prospective Evaluation of Self-Testing to Increase Screening (PRESTIS) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Montealegre et al., 2020</xref>). The trial is being conducted in a large, urban safety net health system, Harris Health System, which is 54.1% Hispanic/Latino, 25.9% Black/African American, 11.3% non-Hispanic White, and 8.7% Asian or other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris Health System, 2021</xref>). The trial began in Febraury 2020, paused in March due to COVID-19-related closures, and resumed in August 2020 when COVID-19-related research restrictions were lifted. The trial’s protocol has been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Montealegre et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, patients are eligible for PRESTIS if they meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) 30–65 years of age; (2) no history of hysterectomy or cervical cancer; (3) under-screened for cervical cancer (no Pap test in the past 3.5 years or Pap/HPV co-test in the past 5.5 years); (4) at least two visits within the safety net healthcare system in the past 3.5 years; and (5) currently enrolled in a healthcare coverage or financial assistance plan accepted by the system (including Medicaid/Medicare, private insurance, and county-sponsored coverage). The latter two criteria were used to ensure that participants are current users of the healthcare system. Eligible patients were randomized to one of three study arms: Arm (1) Telephone recall (control) with a reminder to schedule a Pap test; Arm (2) Telephone recall with mailed self-sampling kit for HPV testing (intervention); and Arm (3) Telephone recall with mailed HPV self-sampling kit and an additional reminder/educational call from a health system employee (intervention plus). The self-sampling kits included an Aptima Multitest Swab collection kit to be returned to the health system for HPV testing.</p><p>As part of the trial, we conducted a nested survey to assess acceptability and experiences among a subset of randomly selected trial participants randomized to home-based self-sampling for HPV testing. This study includes telephone survey participants who responded between August 2020 and September 2022. Telephone survey participants were a random sample of women selected from each of four categories based on two factors: receipt of patient navigation (yes [Arm 3] or no [Arm 2]) and kit completed and returned within 6 months of randomization (yes or no). Women who require clinical follow-up were not eligible for this survey.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Data collection</title><p>The survey was administered by trained, bilingual researcher coordinators in the patient’s preferred language (English or Spanish). Participants were asked to provide verbal consent before commencing the survey and were sent a $20 gift card upon completion. This research was reviewed and approved by Baylor College of Medicine and Harris Health System’s Institutional Review Boards (H-44944).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Measures</title><p>The telephone survey was based on a questionnaire used in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Montealegre et al., 2015</xref>). Questions assess healthcare access and utilization (including specific questions about experiences during COVID-19-related closures and restrictions), barriers to cervical cancer screening, demographics, and telehealth access. Barriers to clinic-based screening were adapted from existing validated instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrd et al., 2004</xref>) and assessed using an 18-item scale, with items such as ‘I don’t have time to get a Pap test’ and ‘It’s difficult to get an appointment for a Pap test.’ Responses were on a three-point Likert scale (not at all, a little, very much) with an ‘unsure/cannot say’ option. Motivators were assessed by asking participants who reported using the kit to compare the convenience, stress/anxiety, and embarrassment of a Pap and the at-home self-sample kit by selecting whether the Pap at a clinic is more convenient/stressful/embarrassing, the self-sampling kit is more convenient/stressful/embarrassing, or the two screening methods are about the same. The motivators (convenience, stress, and embarrassment) of using the at-home kit vs clinic-based sampling were assessed with individual questions.</p><p>We assessed COVID-related experiences among all survey participants by asking whether the pandemic affected their economic situation, mental health, and physical well-being. Responses were on a 3-point Likert scale (large effect, small effect, no effect). To assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, participants who reported using the kit were asked whether the COVID pandemic influenced their decision to participate in the trial. Those who indicated that the pandemic affected their decision were asked, ‘In what way did the COVID-19 pandemic affect your participation in this trial?’ After thoroughly reading the recorded responses, the responses were coded using a grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glaser and Strauss, 1999</xref>). Codes were then categorized into emerging themes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for independence were conducted to assess the relationship between survey question responses and demographics. Fisher’s exact test was used when more than 20% of cells had less than five participants, and chi-square was used for all other comparisons All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata IC 15.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 233 telephone surveys were completed by patients enrolled in the PRESTIS study between August 2020 and September 2022.

These barriers were more prevalent among Hispanic women and those who completed the survey in Spanish. Our results suggest that barriers experienced by under-screened women within a safety net healthcare system may differ from those experienced by patients in other healthcare systems who have difficulty accessing care due to financial reasons and other barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuzzell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freeman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akinlotan et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to other studies conducted in safety net healthcare systems, we found that additional barriers beyond the access and financial barriers, including modesty concerns and discomfort, hinder participation in cervical cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuzzell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akinlotan et al., 2017</xref>). One study conducted in low-income settings, with differing patient demographics and not limited to under-screened women, showed that cost was the most commonly-reported barrier (53.1%), and that anxiety (38.7%), embarrassment (25.6%), the anticipation of pain (23.6%), and being seen by a male physician (19.7%) were less important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akinlotan et al., 2017</xref>). While this analysis reported similar barriers to this study, we found that less than a quarter of respondents reported that screening was expensive, and over half reported embarrassment, anxiety, and being seen by a male provider were barriers. This indicates the need to evaluate barriers within each environment to implement strategic programs to increase screening.</p><p>The motivators for using an at-home HPV self-sampling kit appear to address key barriers to cervical cancer screening found in our survey participants. Most who used the kit found it to be less stressful, embarrassing, and more convenient than clinic-based screening. Significantly more Spanish-speaking women and women with lower education completion found the at-home kits to be less embarrassing than clinic-based screening, a barrier reported significantly more among those groups of participants. Our findings suggest that self-sampling kits may address or circumvent some of the key barriers reported by survey participants within a safety net health system, especially those reported by Spanish-speaking women, and may help to address disparities in cervical cancer screening adherence. Our findings are consistent with other studies in showing that self-sampling can address barriers to clinic-based screening in various countries and health system settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herrington, 2022</xref>), though ours appears to be the first to report results from US safety net health system under-screened women.</p><p>Our results show that COVID-19 was a motivating factor for most respondents to participate in the at-home self-sampling HPV trial and that many patients experienced additional barriers to care since the beginning of the pandemic. The most common barriers included difficulty making appointments, fear of getting COVID, and a broad response that screening was easier at home. While the survey did not probe about this last response, many participants mentioned it in the context of competing priorities amid the pandemic, such as childcare. These responses align with research indicating that the burden of childcare and elder care has fallen disproportionately on women during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrd et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>This study had certain limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Because the study was conducted among women in a safety net system that cares for un- and under-insured individuals, results may not be generalizable to women served by other types of health systems. Similarly, the main analysis, while relevant to the safety net system in which the study was conducted, may not apply to other healthcare systems, or to international audiences. Women in the community and other healthcare settings often face significant structural barriers related to access to care due to lack of insurance and/or cost. The prevalent barriers in our study most certainly reflect that financial and insurance barriers are largely removed due to participants’ enrollment in the health system. Additionally, as mentioned, the closed-ended survey format did not allow us to probe into some of the responses, particularly how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the use of the kit. Nonetheless, this study is unique in that it gives in-depth insight into the particular barriers experienced by safety net patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of cervical cancer screening barriers among under-screened women in a safety net healthcare system in the COVID-19 era.</p><p>In conclusion, mailed at-home HPV self-sampling kits present an opportunity to reduce important barriers to cervical cancer screening among women in a safety net healthcare system. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these barriers may have been exacerbated by the economic, physical, and mental effects of the pandemic. Further research is needed to understand additional barriers experienced by women during the COVID-19 pandemic and how these might be addressed with new screening tools such as at-home HPV testing using self-sampling. Implementation of new screening programs should address the specific barriers to clinic-based screening and motivators to self-sampling experienced by their patient populations.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration NCT03898167.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The survey was administered by trained, bilingual researcher coordinators in the patient's preferred language (English or Spanish).

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matejka Rebolj (Reviewer #3); Paolo Giorgi Rossi (Reviewer #4).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The manuscript mainly focuses on differences between English-speaking and Spanish-speaking participants, presented in Tables 2 to 4, but comparisons by age, screening history, income, etc. may also be interesting (reviewers 1,3, and 4). Please include extra comparisons by age, income, etc., or convincingly argue why the focus is only on different language groups. For the additional analyses, a multivariable approach may be chosen in which different determinants are compared, as suggested by reviewer 1.</p><p>2. The manuscript contains many inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Most of them have been indicated by the reviewers. Please follow their suggestions as closely as possible. In addition, make sure that the table numbers match with the order in which they appear in the manuscript.</p><p>3. The reviewers had questions about missing items/data (reviewers 1 and 2) and inclusion/exclusion criteria (reviewers 3 and 4). Please make sure that the information is complete.</p><p>4. Table headings should provide more detailed information about the participants so that tables can be read without consulting the main text.</p><p>5. Do not use statements like p &lt;.05, but give precise p-values, as noted by reviewer 2. Also, indicate in the Material and Methods section when Fisher's exact test is used and when the chi-square test is used.</p><p>6. The manuscript should provide a better overview of the existing literature. Many studies have investigated the attitude of underscreened women from high-income countries towards self-sampling, as noted by reviewer 3. Note that the recently published IARC Handbook on Cervical Cancer Screening (Volume 18) contains a lot of references to HPV self-sampling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Susan L. Parker et al. interviewed 233 women (being a subgroup of the PRESTIS study) from a US safety-net system on their perceived barriers and motivators for at-home HPV self-sampling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Five patient characteristics were given of which language was used in a monovariate analysis to discriminate the results of (1) the self-reported barriers of getting a Pap smear, (2) motivators for self-sampling versus Pap, and (3) COVID-related barriers.</p><p>The differences observed in the barriers to having clinician-taken Pap smears between different health care systems will inform health professionals and policymakers to stake at the mutual, universal ones or act specifically on barriers for a particular group, hence creating a maximal impact on cervical cancer screening participation. In this study, Spanish-speaking women stressed the embarrassment of having a Pap (by a male provider, compared to the self-sample) more than their English-speaking counterparts within the same safety net system. The survey results on the motivators to use an HPV self-sampling kit confirm previous and worldwide experiences, putting self-sampling as a convenient intervention to address under-screened women, also in this particular setting. The COVID-pandemic impacted as well on the willingness to accept self-sampling as a valuable alternative.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is written straightforwardly, and highly accessible to the general public, with a clear-cut introduction on the impact of COVID on primary care, focusing on cervical cancer screening in an under-served population. Results engage on the differences between Spanish- (2/3 of the subgroup) and English-speaking women (1/3) from the same safety net system, probably revealing cultural differences between them (although not discussed).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Authors have to be careful in their word choice, starting in the abstract and throughout the manuscript:</p><p>– Home-based HPV testing, might give the reader the impression that women not only took the sample themselves but also obtained the result of the test at the same time, as with a pregnancy test. This is not the case for HPV testing which is up-to-now always performed in a laboratory. Better to formulate as home-based self-sampling for HPV testing.</p><p>– Authors should provide absolute numbers (n/N) next to percentages of the perceived barriers/motivators, instead of using non-scientific scorings like 'over half' and 'most' (for percentages ranging from 52.4% up to 69.3%?). 'Most' implies almost all.</p><p>– Are there other options for women besides going to a clinic to obtain the classic Pap smear? If so, rather use 'clinician-based' screening or sampling instead of 'clinic-based'.</p><p>The total overview of the PRESTIS study and the subgroup being part of the telephone survey is only clear from the CONSORT Flow Diagram, but the specific participants focusing on in this manuscript should be described in detail to inform the reader of the magnitude and representativeness of the survey group. Even from the Flow Diagram, it is not clear which number of respondents returned the self-sampling kit (presumably 153) and which part did not (N=80?).</p><p>The methods section describes the questions used in the questionnaire, but items like 'telehealth access' cannot be found in the tables or Results section. Moreover, the self-sampling kit is not detailed (vaginal brush/urine sample/…? Which specific device? Which procedure?).</p><p>The patient characteristics (demographic data, SES) presented in Table 1 are very limited and specifically 'age' and 'screening history' are lacking (besides 'employment' and 'marital status'), which are important risk factors for studying cervical cancer screening. These data could however easily be obtained during the phone calls, or might even be available from the overall PRESTIS study. Please add if available. These variables would have been very important in bivariate or multivariate analysis to determine the variables associated with HPV self-sampling uptake and the barrier outcomes, to enrich the basic descriptive statistic presented here. Furthermore, the denominator of Table 1 is indicated to be 233, but some variables have missing data, which are not indicated in the table, nor discussed. Specifically, the variable 'household income', being a very important SES factor, was only reported for 136 women. Please report all missing data, and how this could have influenced the distribution shown.</p><p>Table 4 should be structured better to make clear to the reader that question 2 only relates to the positive answers in question 1. The denominator shown in the title of this table (N=153) only applies to the first question, the last 3 show data for all 233 interviewed women. Please adjust accordingly.</p><p>A more thorough discussion on the overlapping barriers reported in different healthcare systems and the specific deviating barriers – and the reasons why they deviate – in this specific patient group, would have been very informative.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please find most recommendations in the public review, complete with:</p><p>(Abstract)</p><p>– … reported clinic(clinician)-based screening… discomfort seeing male providers.</p><p>Might be better formulated as: … is experiencing discomfort when seeing male providers.</p><p>– Do you 'complete' the kit or just 'use' it?</p><p>(Materials and methods)</p><p>– Can be clarified more.</p><p>– Leave the verbs away in the details on the inclusion criteria for the PRESTIS study.</p><p>(Results)</p><p>– Given results can be summarized and condensed, and should be enlarged with more in-depth analysis if the data are available.</p><p>– The percentage of the Mexico-born population should be corrected (39.4% in the text versus 39.7% in Table 1).</p><p>(Tables)</p><p>– Table 1: Give correct denominators for each variable.</p><p>– Table 2: give N for both Spanish- and English-speaking subgroups.</p><p>– Table 4: restructure and give the correct denominator for each question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides important information on barriers to cervical cancer screening participation, and the potential of self-sampling kits to increase participation, especially among ethnic and/or linguistic minority women.</p><p>The manuscript is clearly and concisely written. The tables lack important information (esp. age of the participating women). P-values in the text are not given as precise values but whether they are below some cutoff; this is not recommended. The flow of the manuscript can be improved. One of the conclusions (&quot;Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these barriers were exacerbated by economic, physical, and mental effects of the pandemic&quot;) is not substantiated and could be rephrased.</p><p>The main conclusion in the Discussion &quot;In conclusion, mailed at-home HPV self-sampling kits present an opportunity to reduce important barriers to cervical cancer screening among women in a safety net healthcare system&quot; stands and is an important message to cervical cancer screening organizations – there is a lot to gain with self-sampling kits.</p><p>p1, Abstract, and p7 and p8 Results: It is recommended to provide precise P values rather than stating P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05, for all P&gt;0. 0.001.</p><p>p7, Results: &quot;Significantly more Spanish-speaking participants reported that getting a Pap test is embarrassing compared to non-Hispanic and English-speaking participants, 66.4% vs. 30%, p&lt;0.01&quot; The comparison reported here is correct for &quot;English speaking participants&quot;, but was not shown in the analysis for non-Hispanics.</p><p>p7, Results: The order of reporting percentages and associations in the 2nd paragraph of Results is different from the order of reporting in Table 2. It is recommended to stick to the same order in the Table and text.</p><p>p7, Results: be consistent in the number of decimals given for percentages; throughout the Results, one decimal is provided, but in the 5th line from the bottom no decimal is given in &quot;78%&quot;.</p><p>p7-8, Results, third paragraph: please refer to the appropriate Table here (Table 4).</p><p>p8, Results, second paragraph: I'd suggest that the authors first report the number of participants returning the kit before they report analyses restricted to that group, e.g. &quot;153 (xx%) of participants returned the kit.&quot;</p><p>Results: it is recommended to number the Tables in order of appearance. Now Table 3 is first mentioned after Table 4 is mentioned.</p><p>Tables: it is recommended to provide full Table titles, stating Person, Place, and Time, so that a Table can be more easily understood on its own.</p><p>Table 1: It appears some data are missing (e.g. for Place of birth, Education, Household income). State in the body of the table or in a footnote which number of records had missing values for each variable.</p><p>Table 1 does not list age; age is crucial for any epidemiological analysis. Please add.</p><p>Table 2: the order of categories seems somewhat contra-intuitive: with the variable &quot;Uncomfortable with male provider&quot; the first category given is Yes, and the second No. Reverse order?</p><p>Same for the other variables in this Table 2?</p><p>Tables 2 and 3 and 4: Please provide the N above each of the three columns.</p><p>Table 2: Were P values calculates based on Yes and NO categories only, or also including the Unsure categories?</p><p>It appears &quot;Getting a Pap test is expensive&quot; has a missing value. Please note this in the body of the table or footnote.</p><p>Table 3: Indicate here in the title who is in the analysis, so as to explain there are only 153 in this Table rather than the 233 participants.</p><p>Discussion, p14: &quot;Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these barriers were exacerbated by economic, physical, and mental effects of the pandemic&quot;. I am not sure this has been demonstrated by the analyses the authors report.</p><p>References: Please check the rendering of ref 17.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors investigated attitudes toward HPV self-sampling as an alternative screening method for under-screened women who live with multiple social disadvantages in an urban area of the USA. Although their study included elements that were specific to the era of the COVID pandemic during which the study was undertaken, it once more confirmed that HPV self-sampling may be an attractive alternative for a proportion of under-screened women. Whether the positive attitudes described in the study would translate into increased screening participation, remains to be seen.</p><p>The authors could provide some more information on how women can seek screening from this health care provider. Does this provider offer cervical cancer screening, and did Arm 1 of the trial (control) actually represent &quot;usual care&quot;? If care is provided regardless of an individual's ability to pay, then why did some women complain that paps are too expensive? Do women need to seek screening themselves, or will they be reminded that they are (over)due? Around 2/3 of the women reported that they are uncomfortable around a male screening provider – how likely is it that a woman will be screened by a male vs. a female provider, and can she choose between the smear-taker's gender?</p><p>A question to clarify some of the exclusion criteria: why did women need to have had at least 2 visits with this health care provider in the last 3.5 years? Would this not tend to increase the likelihood that the study would not reach severely underscreened and never-screened women (e.g., those that do not engage with health care but could be motivated to do self-sampling)?</p><p>Why was the main analysis looking at English vs. Spanish-speaking participants? It may make sense for policy-making within the specific healthcare provider, but less so for the international audience. Could the authors report some other comparisons e.g., by age or certain other sociodemographic characteristics or the women's screening history? Also, from the exclusion criteria it seems that some women may have been screened only by paps. Did the attitudes towards HPV self-sampling among those women differ from the attitudes among women who were previously screened with co-testing (and indeed from the attitudes among unscreened women, if there were any in the study)? (A simple frequency distribution for such characteristics added to Table 1 would also be helpful)</p><p>The authors concluded that self-sampling &quot;may help to address disparities in cervical cancer screening adherence&quot;. This is an abstract statement but could be better supported by evidence from their study, for example by reporting how many of the women approached for the trial actually did self-sampling. We know that in theory self-sampling should be able to increase screening participation, but translation into practice has not been extremely successful. That is why statements like these would better not be made unless they can be supported with data.</p><p>This analysis of barriers to clinician collection and attitudes around self-sampling comes after more than a decade of intensive research and multiple systematic reviews. The paper should provide a better overview of the existing literature. Several studies have investigated attitudes towards self-sampling and self-sampling uptake in disadvantaged women from high-income countries, which would be consistent with the population in this study, so relevant for comparison.</p><p>Finally, the authors stated that their study is the first to describe barriers in obtaining cervical cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic (for a specific population). This may be correct, but for most people, whether one likes it or not, life has moved on a while ago. Could the authors find a way to make this paper more interesting (and informative) for a post-pandemic world?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper affords an interesting issue and the whole project, including the trial, will timely assess the effectiveness of self-sampling in reducing inequalities in cervical cancer access.</p><p>It is now time to start implementing self-sampling and try to exploit the potential benefits of this device in increasing HPV test coverage. To do that we need such research because implementation must be context specific. In fact, in this field context-specific, implementation research is needed and results observed in trials conducted in other countries or in different health systems cannot be transferred to a different situation. Furthermore, the acceptability of self-sampling depends on the social and cultural background of the women, but also on how it is offered by the provider and on how the communication between the provider and women occurs.</p><p>This study will integrate data from a survey and from a trial. In this paper, the authors report the results of the survey. It highlights that part of the barriers reducing access to screening of disadvantaged women can really be removed by self-sampling. The study shows that these barriers are now more important for Hispanic women. These findings are important, but more information from this survey can be exploited.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Data collection</p><p>I did not understand if all trial participants have been contacted for the interview. Furthermore, I did not understand if the consent was only to participate in the survey or in the trial (it would be a strong limitation to the trial including only those agreeing to participate, even if sometimes Ethics Committee or IRB imposes it).</p><p>I think it should be reported a description of the survey power or the sample size determination, whether it has been established on the basis of a formal sample size estimation or with a convenience constraint.</p><p>Measures</p><p>It is not clear if the different concepts (embarrassment, discomfort…) are measured in a single question or in separate items.</p><p>Results</p><p>It is important to report the response rate to the survey. It would be important also to report if the response was differential among those who returned the self-sample (or attended) and those who did not.</p><p>Why did the authors investigate only ethnicity as a possible determinant? Not the age, income, or education? Returning the kit or not? I think such analyses would be relevant to your objectives.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>It is balanced and well-written.</p><p>I suggest discussing the limitations in light of other results, not in a separate paragraph.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84664.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Although their study included elements that were specific to the era of the COVID pandemic during which the study was undertaken, it once more confirmed that HPV self-sampling may be an attractive alternative for a proportion of under-screened women. Whether the positive attitudes described in the study would translate into increased screening participation, remains to be seen.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments. We have added to the discussion to specify that trial results are needed to understand whether positive attitudes translate to increased screening participation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could provide some more information on how women can seek screening from this health care provider. Does this provider offer cervical cancer screening, and did Arm 1 of the trial (control) actually represent &quot;usual care&quot;? If care is provided regardless of an individual's ability to pay, then why did some women complain that paps are too expensive? Do women need to seek screening themselves, or will they be reminded that they are (over)due? Around 2/3 of the women reported that they are uncomfortable around a male screening provider – how likely is it that a woman will be screened by a male vs. a female provider, and can she choose between the smear-taker's gender?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added information under Setting to describe usual care cervical cancer screening practices in our health system, as well as augmented usual care provided through the trial. We appreciate the potentially confusion around cost barriers and the safety net health system’s provision of care. We have provided additional information about payment for cervical cancer screening in the <italic>Participants</italic> subsection (page 5). If a woman is determined not to be financially eligible for free care (i.e., she may be determined by the health system to have a plan that requires co-payment or self-payment), out of pocket expenses can still be a burden and barrier to care. While they may have been enrolled in a coverage/financial assistance plan at the time of the survey, the plan may still incur costs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A question to clarify some of the exclusion criteria: why did women need to have had at least 2 visits with this health care provider in the last 3.5 years? Would this not tend to increase the likelihood that the study would not reach severely underscreened and never-screened women (e.g., those that do not engage with health care but could be motivated to do self-sampling)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the need to explain the rationale for the 2 visits in the inclusion criteria. Because safety net systems are used to varying extent by population, we instituted eligibility and exclusion criteria to minimize the inclusion of women who use the health system only for emergency, inpatient, and specialty care but otherwise largely receive their primary care elsewhere (or nowhere). We explain in the Methods section that we limited inclusion to women who had visited a primary care clinic at least twice over the past five years and excluded women who had a documented primary care provider outside of the health system in order to capture patients who use the health system for their primary care.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why was the main analysis looking at English vs. Spanish-speaking participants? It may make sense for policy-making within the specific healthcare provider, but less so for the international audience. Could the authors report some other comparisons e.g., by age or certain other sociodemographic characteristics or the women's screening history? Also, from the exclusion criteria it seems that some women may have been screened only by paps. Did the attitudes towards HPV self-sampling among those women differ from the attitudes among women who were previously screened with co-testing (and indeed from the attitudes among unscreened women, if there were any in the study)? (A simple frequency distribution for such characteristics added to Table 1 would also be helpful)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. We have added a statement in the limitations paragraph that the main comparison may not be applicable to other health systems or for international audiences (page 16). However, this comparison is highly relevant to our population. Yes, some women were last screened with a Pap, and some with a co-test (the Health System recently switched to co-testing) but this was not included as an analysis since the clinical experience for both tests is nearly identical. Language is often used as a proxy for nativity, citizenship, immigration status and acculturation, so would be very relevant for policy makers during implementation planning for an HPV self-sampling program within the safety net healthcare system. We have added a statement to support this in the introduction. We have also added analyses to Tables 2-4 that include race/ethnicity, age and education level. We did not include income in these additional analyses because of the large number of missing data for this variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors concluded that self-sampling &quot;may help to address disparities in cervical cancer screening adherence&quot;. This is an abstract statement but could be better supported by evidence from their study, for example by reporting how many of the women approached for the trial actually did self-sampling. We know that in theory self-sampling should be able to increase screening participation, but translation into practice has not been extremely successful. That is why statements like these would better not be made unless they can be supported with data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this statement cannot be made based solely on the data from this study. We have modified the statement to specify that “If positive attitudes toward self-sampling translate into increased screening participation, self-sampling may help…….”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This analysis of barriers to clinician collection and attitudes around self-sampling comes after more than a decade of intensive research and multiple systematic reviews. The paper should provide a better overview of the existing literature. Several studies have investigated attitudes towards self-sampling and self-sampling uptake in disadvantaged women from high-income countries, which would be consistent with the population in this study, so relevant for comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have added references and context to the Introduction section (page 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors stated that their study is the first to describe barriers in obtaining cervical cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic (for a specific population). This may be correct, but for most people, whether one likes it or not, life has moved on a while ago. Could the authors find a way to make this paper more interesting (and informative) for a post-pandemic world?</p></disp-quote><p>We explain that self-sampling is a potential method to circumvent barriers to cervical cancer screening apart from COVID-related barriers. We’ve added statements to the introduction elaborating on this point and distinguishing COVID-related barriers and barriers that existed pre-pandemic (page 2). However, it’s important to note that the data collected for this analysis was collected at various time points during the pandemic, and the implications of pandemic-related barriers cannot be separated from the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper affords an interesting issue and the whole project, including the trial, will timely assess the effectiveness of self-sampling in reducing inequalities in cervical cancer access.</p><p>It is now time to start implementing self-sampling and try to exploit the potential benefits of this device in increasing HPV test coverage. To do that we need such research because implementation must be context specific. In fact, in this field context-specific, implementation research is needed and results observed in trials conducted in other countries or in different health systems cannot be transferred to a different situation. Furthermore, the acceptability of self-sampling depends on the social and cultural background of the women, but also on how it is offered by the provider and on how the communication between the provider and women occurs.</p><p>This study will integrate data from a survey and from a trial. In this paper, the authors report the results of the survey. It highlights that part of the barriers reducing access to screening of disadvantaged women can really be removed by self-sampling. The study shows that these barriers are now more important for Hispanic women. These findings are important, but more information from this survey can be exploited.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Data collection</p><p>I did not understand if all trial participants have been contacted for the interview. Furthermore, I did not understand if the consent was only to participate in the survey or in the trial (it would be a strong limitation to the trial including only those agreeing to participate, even if sometimes Ethics Committee or IRB imposes it).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for indicating the potential for confusion. We have modified the methods section to clarify who participated in the telephone survey. As stated under Data Collection, “a subset of randomly selected trial participants randomized to home-based self-sample sampling for HPV testing.” In the protocol paper for the original trial, we report that “All eligible women are enrolled in the trial under a waiver of consent in order to reduce participation bias. A waiver of written documentation of informed consent was granted for participants’ use of the kits, due to the minimal risks involved and to enhance generalizability of the findings. A research information letter (described below) is used in lieu of a formal informed consent form.” Verbal consent was obtained for the telephone survey, conducted among a subset of trial participants. All consent procedures were reviewed and approved by Baylor College of Medicine and Harris Health System IRBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think it should be reported a description of the survey power or the sample size determination, whether it has been established on the basis of a formal sample size estimation or with a convenience constraint.</p><p>Measures</p><p>It is not clear if the different concepts (embarrassment, discomfort…) are measured in a single question or in separate items.</p></disp-quote><p>These are measured in separate items on the survey, which is attached in the original submission.
