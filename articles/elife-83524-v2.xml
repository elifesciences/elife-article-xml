Recent work suggests that specialization first arose as an adaptation to long, hot dry seasons in the West African Sahel, where <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> relies on human-stored water for breeding. Here, we use whole-genome cross-coalescent analysis to date the emergence of human-specialist populationsand thus further probe the climate hypothesis. Importantly, we take advantage of the known migration of specialists out of Africa during the Atlantic Slave Trade to calibrate the coalescent clock and thus obtain a more precise estimate of the older evolutionary event than would otherwise be possible. We find that human-specialist mosquitoes diverged rapidly from ecological generalists approximately 5000 years ago, at the end of the African Humid Period—a time when the Sahara dried and water stored by humans became a uniquely stable, aquatic niche in the Sahel. We also use population genomic analyses to date a previously observed influx of human-specialist alleles into major West African cities. The characteristic length of tracts of human-specialist ancestry present on a generalist genetic background in Kumasi and Ouagadougou suggests the change in behavior occurred during rapid urbanization over the last 20–40 years. Taken together, we show that the timing and ecological context of two previously observed shifts towards human biting in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> differ; climate was likely the original driver, but urbanization has become increasingly important in recent decades.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aedes aegypti</kwd><kwd>coalescent</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>urban evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>Noah H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McBride</surname><given-names>Carolyn S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dengue and yellow fever mosquito first specialized on humans about 5000 years ago, but appears to use the same genes to thrive in urban environments today.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is thought to have originated as an ecological opportunist in forested areas of sub-Saharan Africa, and extant African populations of the subspecies <italic>Ae. aegypti formosus</italic> is relative generalists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Recent work suggests that human specialization in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> originally evolved as an adaptation to the extremely long, hot dry seasons of the Sahel region of West Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes lay their eggs just above the water line in small, contained bodies of water, and immature stages require water for development. The scarcity of natural tree-hole and rock-pool aquatic habitat for up to 9 months of the year in the Sahel likely forced <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to rely on human-stored water for survival, with adaptations to breeding in artificial containers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillett, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petersen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leahy et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Metz et al., 2023</xref>) and biting humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McBride et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouck, 1972</xref>) soon following. For example, adaptation to artificial containers involved changes in egg hatching behavior and larval starvation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saul et al., 1980</xref>) that allow immature stages to thrive in water that is relatively low in nutrients (e.g. bacteria and detritus) and high in oxygen. However, neither highly seasonal precipitation patterns nor human-derived pots of water were present in the Sahel until relatively recently in evolutionary time. Settled human societies practicing water storage in clay vessels likely developed within the last 10,000 years in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huysecom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehret, 2002</xref>). Meanwhile, the Sahara Desert and associated Sahelian biome have only existed in their present form for the past 5000 years; the region was a vast savannah during the African Humid Period from 15,000–5000 years ago. If <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> evolved to specialize in biting humans as a by-product of breeding among humans during the intense dry seasons of the West African Sahel (hereafter ‘Sahel’), then the shift should have occurred no more than 5000 years ago.</p><p>The idea that <italic>Ae. aegypti aegypti</italic> first emerged when all elements of its current niche were finally present approximately 5000 years ago and has been suggested multiple times in the vector biology literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petersen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peter, 2016</xref>), but has never been comprehensively tested with modern genomic data. A site-frequency-spectrum- (SFS-) based analysis of exome sequence data estimated that neighboring generalist and human-specialist populations in West Africa diverged about 15,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>), but this estimate was sensitive to model specification and parameterization. Conversely, a molecular clock-based phylogenetic analysis found that all African populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> have a common ancestor approximately 17,000–25,000 years ago, but did not precisely date the subsequent split between human-specialist and generalist subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soghigian et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding exactly when (and why) specialization occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the historical forces that led to the spread of <italic>Ae. aegypti aegypti</italic> out of Africa are better understood. Human-specialist <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is thought to have first migrated to the Americas on ships during the Atlantic Slave Trade approximately 500 years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Its arrival there coincided with the first recorded outbreaks of yellow fever in the New World in the 1600s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequent outbreaks of yellow fever exacted an enormous toll in the following centuries, especially among immunologically naive European and Indigenous populations, shaping not just health outcomes, but also the political and economic history of the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNeill, 2010</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>’s invasion of Asia and Oceania was followed by outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and later Zika, although yellow fever remains absent in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brady and Hay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>). Today, invasive populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the Americas and Asia are almost all closely related to each other and distinct from their ancestors in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gloria-Soria et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A third and putatively much more recent event in the evolutionary history of human-specialist <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> involves a shift towards human biting in growing African cities that would otherwise be expected to harbor generalist populations. Regardless of local climate, urban <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in places like Kumasi, Ghana and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso are consistently more responsive to humans than those from nearby rural areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare KUM to KIN and OGD to OHI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). This shift is associated with the same underlying ancestry component that defines human specialists in the Sahel and outside Africa, suggesting that it results from an influx of human-specialist alleles into urban areas rather than independent evolution of human biting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). Although the exact timing of the observed influx in places like Kumasi and Ouagadougou remains to be tested, it likely occurred recently; the cities involved have only reached the high levels of human population density associated with greater mosquito preference for humans within the past few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">United Nations, 2019</xref>). Urban populations that lack substantial admixture from this human-specialist ancestry component have also been described and posited to represent a genetically independent adaptation to human environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). However, when their behavior has been tested, these populations do not show an increased preference for human hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). This does not preclude other forms of adaptation to human habitats.</p><p>Here, we take advantage of existing population genomic data from diverse African and non-African populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>) to infer the timing of two key events in the evolutionary history of the human-specialist form of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and thereby more rigorously test key hypotheses concerning their underlying ecological drivers. First, we address the timing of the initial emergence of specialist populations in the Sahel <italic>via</italic> cross-coalescent analysis—a methodological framework developed for studying human evolution that has rarely been applied in other species. Importantly, we take advantage of the known migration of specialist <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> out of Africa 150–500 years ago to calibrate the coalescent clock and thus obtain a much more precise estimate than would otherwise be possible. Second, we use ancestry tract length analysis to infer the timing of the recent shift towards human biting in large West African cities. We find that human specialists originated with the emergence of the modern Sahelian climate approximately 5000 years ago, while the influx of human-specialist ancestry into urban areas coincides with rapid urbanization over the past 20–40 years.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dating the origin of human specialists within <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic></title><p>One way to date the evolution of specialization on humans in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is to examine the time course of divergence between specialist and generalist populations using cross-coalescent analysis. Coalescent approaches model relationships between haplotypes at a locus going backward in time, using the steady accumulation of mutations to estimate when haplotypes merge into a single ancestral sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiffels and Wang, 2020</xref>). Using the Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (MSMC), one can characterize the distribution of times to coalescence across genome-wide loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiffels and Wang, 2020</xref>). Patterns of relative cross-coalescence are particularly informative. This is the rate of coalescence of haplotypes from different populations relative to the rate of coalescence of haplotypes from the same population. It should start close to zero in the recent past when two populations are isolated, but eventually plateau at one when, going back in time, they have merged into a single ancestral population. Given a known mutation rate and generation time, patterns of relative cross-coalescence can be used to infer the timing of splits and subsequent gene flow between populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiffels and Wang, 2020</xref>).</p><p>One hurdle associated with the effective application of cross-coalescent analysis to real-world genomic data is the need for phased genomes. To meet this challenge, we leveraged statistical approaches and recently published short-read sequence data for 389 unrelated <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>) to generate a large phasing panel for this species. First, we used <italic>HAPCUT2</italic> to pre-phase individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edge et al., 2017</xref>). In this step, we used linkage information present in short reads and read pairs to locally phase adjacent variants; because nucleotide diversity in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is high (about 2% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>), multiple variants are often present within a single sequencing fragment, making pre-phasing highly effective in this species. Over 95% of prephase calls had maximal HAPCUT2 phred-scaled quality scores of 100, and prephase blocks (i.e. local haplotypes) were 728 bp long on average (interquartile range 199–1009 bp).

This parameter depends on the <italic>de novo</italic> mutation rate and generation time, neither of which is precisely known for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. The mutation rate is likely on the order of 3 × 10<sup>–9</sup> per generation given estimates from other insects (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster:</italic> 2.8 × 10<sup>–9</sup>, <italic>Bombus terrestris:</italic> 3.6 × 10<sup>–9</sup>, <italic>Heliconius melpomene:</italic> 2.9 × 10<sup>–9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keightley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keightley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and most populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> probably go through ~15 generations per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gloria-Soria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beserra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marinho et al., 2016</xref>). However, there is substantial uncertainty in both numbers (10 or 12 generations per year are also common estimates, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gloria-Soria et al., 2016</xref>), and any inference of the timing of specialization derived from these values would be extremely rough.</p><p>To overcome this problem, we decided to leverage the known timing of the spread of human-specialist <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> out of Africa to ground truth and calibrate our coalescent scaling factor. If the species did indeed escape Africa during the Atlantic Slave Trade, coalescent analysis of the relationship between human-specialist populations within and outside Africa should show a single strong pulse of migration that matches the timing of human-slave trafficking for plausible values of the mutation rate and generation time. If we then assume these values are constant through evolutionary time, we can use them in subsequent analyses of the older split between specialists and generalists.</p><p>We used <italic>MSMC2</italic> and <italic>MSMC-IM</italic> to fit an isolation-with-migration model of the relationship between a human-specialist population from the Sahel (Ngoye, Senegal [NGO], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and a human-specialist population from the invasive range (Santarem, Brazil [SAN], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiffels and Wang, 2020</xref>). As expected, this analysis revealed a single strong pulse of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset), which we presume corresponds to the Atlantic Slave Trade. NGO has experienced substantial admixture from nearby generalist populations and is almost certainly not the sole origin point of invasive populations. For example, populations in Luanda, Angola are more closely related to invasive populations in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kotsakiozi et al., 2018</xref>) (see Discussion). For this reason, some coalescence events between NGO and SAN may correspond to the specialist-generalist split or other historical events, in addition to the invasion dynamics we are interested in. Nevertheless, NGO provides the best available proxy for human-specialist populations in their native habitat, and the observed migration signal should largely reflect the time course of their spread to the Americas.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A calibrated coalescent scaling factor for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> suggests rapid evolution of human specialists at the end of the African Humid Period.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Calibration of a coalescent scaling factor for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.

Note that invasive populations have both recent (hundreds of years, as expected) and much older (thousands of years) pulses of coalescence with NGO. The older signals likely arise from the fact that both NGO and invasives have somewhat mixed ancestry. NGO has experienced substantial admixture from nearby generalists in recent years and is, therefore, an imperfect proxy for the African human-specialists that gave rise to invasive populations. Likewise, invasive populations have likely experienced gene flow from other African generalist populations (e.g. in Angola, a major slave trading hub) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiffels and Wang, 2020</xref>) that diverged from West African generalists long before they gave rise to specialists.

We chose to carry forward this calibrated scaling factor (corresponding to any combination of values found along the line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) into subsequent analyses. Note that using Bangkok, Thailand (BKK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as our reference invasive population instead of Santarem, Brazil produced a similar pattern, although the peak of the migration pulse was slightly older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M</xref> <italic>versus</italic> N). This could be noise, since bootstrap replicates vary in the position of the highest peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Alternatively, if BKK’s progenitor population became isolated from South American populations relatively early on, it could be that it did not experience the subsequent migration that SAN experienced. In both cases, time-calibrated demographic histories showed a bottleneck in invasive populations about 500 years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to examine the historical relationship between human-specialist and generalist populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> within Africa using our newly calibrated scaling factor.

We infer that these populations had similar effective population sizes ~10,000 years ago, which gradually expanded before diverging about 5000 years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Isolation-with-migration analysis also suggested that these populations abruptly diverged about 5000 years before the present. This can be seen in the cumulative migration signal, which should reach one when (going back in time) populations have merged into a single ancestral population. Cumulative migration begins dropping slowly 15,000–30,000 years ago, suggesting a small amount of genetic structure in ancient times, but then drops precipitously 3000–5000 years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This rapid divergence shows a striking correspondence to the end of the African Humid Period, as evidenced by the record of leaf wax isotopes present in marine sediments from the Atlantic Ocean floor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tierney et al., 2017</xref>).

However, even in places where most mosquitoes are generalists, urban populations tend to be more responsive to human hosts than their rural counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). This increased willingness to bite humans is strongly correlated with levels of admixture from a shared human-specialist ancestry component found across locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that the behavioral shift is the result of a recent influx of human-specialist alleles into rapidly growing cities. Before estimating the timing of this shift, we used the <italic>f3</italic> statistic to confirm that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations in the large cities of Kumasi, Ghana (KUM) and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (OGD), could be accurately modeled as mixtures of human-specialist and generalist populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peter, 2016</xref>). This statistic tests whether allele frequencies in a focal population are consistently intermediate between frequencies in two candidate source populations. If so, the genome-wide average <italic>f3</italic> should be negative, while a positive value provides evidence neither for nor against admixture. We used three different populations as candidate sources of human-specialist ancestry (West African NGO, American SAN, or Asian BKK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and two different populations as candidate sources of generalist ancestry (West African KIN or OHI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The resulting f3 values were substantially and significantly negative for both cities in almost all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). However, the use of NGO as a proxy for the human-specialist source resulted in only modestly negative values for KUM and positive values for OGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This ambiguous signal likely reflects the complex history of NGO, which is itself admixed despite its human-specialist ecology. The non-African specialists, in contrast, are geographically isolated from generalists. They may therefore be a better proxy for an unadmixed human-specialist source even if the specialist ancestry present in KUM and OGD came from within Africa. Denser sampling of human specialists both within and outside Africa will be necessary to come to a definitive conclusion about the true sources of admixture in these large cities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Long tracts of human-specialist ancestry in rapidly growing cities suggest a recent influx associated with modern urbanization.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) <italic>f3</italic> analysis confirming that Kumasi, Ghana (<bold>A</bold>, KUM) and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (<bold>B</bold>, OGD) can be modeled as a product of admixture between generalist and human-specialist <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations.

The distribution of human-specialist tracts was not entirely uniform; instead, they were more concentrated in a few key regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

It was at this time, approximately 5000 years ago, that the Sahara dried and the highly seasonal Sahel biome to its south came to be. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes inhabiting the area would have found themselves in a novel situation, devoid of rain-filled breeding sites for nine months of the year. This could have driven adaptation to human-derived breeding sites, such as the clay pots used for water storage by early pearl millet farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huysecom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgarella et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, pearl millet domestication is also estimated to have occurred ~5000 years ago in the western Sahel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgarella et al., 2018</xref>), bringing multiple aspects of this mosquito’s human-specialist niche together simultaneously in the region. In addition to the signal of rapid divergence 5000 years ago, we saw some evidence for steady population growth and accumulation of modest genetic structure starting 15,000–30,000 years ago. This observation is compatible with a model where some populations expanded into newly habitable parts of the present-day Sahara/Sahel at the start of the African Humid Period, giving rise to weak geographical structure, before rapidly diverging in response to a drying climate and the emergence of the human-specialist niche at its end. Although they seem to have occasionally interbred, specialist and generalist populations then became largely isolated and ecologically distinct.</p><p>It is widely accepted that human-specialist <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> spread to the Americas (and eventually throughout the global tropics) during the Atlantic Slave Trade, ushering in a new era of vector-borne disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>). We relied on this historical understanding to calibrate our coalescent scaling factor. However, our results also help establish its credibility. The cross-coalescent signal between Ngoye, Senegal, and Santarem, Brazil closely fit <italic>a priori</italic> expectations, even without calibration. Using literature values for average insect mutation rates and our best estimate of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> generation time would have also yielded good correspondence between the inferred timing of migration and the historical record of the Atlantic Slave Trade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The duration and sudden drop-off in migration observed in the coalescent signal also closely match expectations from the historical record (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Luanda, Angola was a major port during the Atlantic Slave Trade and likely served as the proximate source of many <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes introduced to the Americas. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations there show substantial human-specialist ancestry, similar to those from Senegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kotsakiozi et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the question of whether human-specialist populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> could have arisen in or around Angola rather than in the western Sahel. However, the closest generalist relatives of human-specialist populations are found in West Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kotsakiozi et al., 2018</xref>). Present distributions of populations may not perfectly match their historical distributions, but the most parsimonious explanation is that human specialists (the ‘proto-<italic>Ae. aegypti’</italic> described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2018</xref>) first arose in the western Sahel and later spread to both Luanda and the Americas during the slave trade.</p><p>While our cross-coalescent analyses are remarkably consistent with prior expectations, several caveats and open questions remain. First, the temporal resolution of our inferences is relatively low, and both previously published simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and our own bootstrap replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, gray lines) suggest relatively wide bounds for the precise timing of events. Second, it is difficult for us to validate the long-range statistical phasing upon which the analyses are based. Overall linkage disequilibrium is relatively low in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, dropping off quickly over a few kilobases and reaching half its maximum value within about 50 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>; this is likely sufficient for assembling shorter, high-confidence prephase blocks into longer haplotypes in many cases. However, phase-switch errors may be common across longer distances – potentially affecting inferences in the most recent time windows. Nevertheless, the similar results we obtain using different proxy populations (and thus different input haplotype structures) for human-specialist and generalist lineages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests that our results are robust to potential mistakes in long-range haplotype phasing.</p><p>Another important source of uncertainty comes from our assumption that the coalescent scaling factor should maximize the overlap between the peak of estimated <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> migration and the peak of the Atlantic Slave Trade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). If we instead consider alternative scenarios where peak migration occurred at the beginning of the slave trade era, around 1500, then our inferred mutation rate would be lower (about 2.4e-9, assuming 15 generations per year), pushing back the split of human-specialist lineages to ~10,000 years before present. This scenario seems less plausible, in part because our isolation-with-migration analyses suggest a gradual onset of migration between continents rather than a single, early-pulse model. It would also make it harder to explain the timing of the bottleneck observed in invasive populations; the first signs of this bottleneck occur at the beginning of the slave trade (~500 years ago) with our current calibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but would be pushed to a pre-trade date in this alternative scenario. We can also consider a scenario in which peak <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> migration occurred more recently, perhaps around 1850, corresponding to increased global shipping traffic outside the slave trade alone. In this case, our inferred mutation rate would be higher (or generation time lower), and the split of human-specialist lineages would be placed at about 3000 years ago. Overall, the best match between the existing literature and our data corresponds to our main estimates, but alternative scenarios could gain support if future research finds evidence for a different time course of invasion than is suggested by the epidemiological record.</p><p>This study represents one of the first applications of cross-coalescent analysis to a non-model system. Cross-coalescent analyses are a powerful tool for understanding historical relationships between populations, but they are difficult to implement in practice, largely due to the logistical/computational burden of developing a large genome phasing panel and the difficulty of estimating an accurate coalescent scaling factor. Accurate calibration of coalescent analysis is notoriously difficult even in well-understood systems like humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scally and Durbin, 2012</xref>). Here, we take advantage of a continent-wide set of genomes, combined with read-based prephasing and population-wide statistical phasing, to develop a phasing panel that will enable future studies in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with a lower barrier to entry. The same approach may work for other study organisms with similar population genomic properties; high levels of diversity are helpful for prephasing and at least moderate levels of linkage disequilibrium are important for the assembly of prephase blocks. Likewise, our use of the historical record to calibrate a coalescent scaling factor may be effective in other taxa whose history is characterized by known historical events as well as events with unknown timing. Similar calibrations have been used to understand the relationship between coalescent analyses and human history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Fallon and Fehren-Schmitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schiffels and Durbin, 2014</xref>), but the approach should be especially valuable in non-model organisms where mutation rates and generation times are less well characterized.</p><p>Human specialization first emerged within <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> thousands of years ago, but now, in the face of the rapid urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa, generalist populations of this species seem to be undergoing a new shift. We estimate an influx of human-specialist alleles into the rapidly growing cities of Kumasi and Ouagadougou within the past 20–40 years. Positive selection during adaptive introgression can increase tract lengths and make admixture appear more recent than it actually is. For this reason, we masked regions of the genome thought to underlie adaptation to human habitats before running our analysis. If selection has acted outside these regions, however, admixture may be somewhat older than we estimate. The exact geographic origin of the human-specialist ancestry tracts found in both cities also remains uncertain. They are likely derived from nearby specialist populations, with whom both KUM and OGD showed affinity in previous <italic>ADMIXTURE</italic> analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). They could alternatively (or additionally) be derived from distant specialist populations or even invasive populations outside Africa; dormant <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> eggs are often transported inadvertently, e.g., in the used-tire trade. More comprehensive sampling and analysis of human-specialist populations inside and outside Africa will be necessary to identify the precise origins of the genetic material currently transforming urban populations in Africa.</p><p>Regardless of the source, the influx of human-specialist ancestry into <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes inhabiting African cities will likely have important implications for human health. Human-specialist <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are both more likely to bite humans and more likely to serve as competent vectors of dengue, Zika, and yellow fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sylla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aubry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 1989</xref>). Ouagadougou has seen repeated outbreaks of dengue fever in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Im et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badolo et al., 2022</xref>), and mosquitoes there are still genetically and phenotypically intermediate between generalists and specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kotsakiozi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badolo et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that such populations will eventually become more specialized as urbanization continues. The emergence of urban yellow fever in Africa since 2016 may have also been hastened by the expansion of human-specialist populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraemer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klitting et al., 2018</xref>). For these reasons, monitoring and control of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, taking into account possible changes in the vector capacity of local populations over time, should remain a high priority in the native range of this key vector species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genome phasing</title><p>We developed a genomic phasing panel using 389 previously published <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genomes sequenced to 15 x coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>), including 359 from across the species’ native range in Africa, as well as 30 from invasive populations outside of Africa (16 from Bangkok, Thailand, and 14 from Santarem, Brazil) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). This panel also included four <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mascarensis</italic> individuals, but the phasing quality for these individuals may be lower due to the small number of individuals used. We used as input the full set of previously <italic>bcftools</italic>-called biallelic SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). We further filtered the panel to include variant sites with GQ &gt;20 and DP &gt;8, including only variants in putative single-copy regions (mean coverage 5–30 x), and excluding annotated centromeric and repeat regions, as well as the sex locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>). Ultimately, our phasing panel comprised 52,534,217 biallelic SNPs. We used a two-step phasing procedure. We first pre-phased nearby heterozygous sites using information present in sequencing reads within individuals using <italic>HAPCUT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gloria-Soria et al., 2016</xref>), and then carried out statistical phasing on a population level with <italic>SHAPEIT4.2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaneau et al., 2019</xref>), using a phase set error rate of 0.0001. Due to memory constraints, we carried out two separate <italic>SHAPEIT4.2</italic> runs – one with all samples from East and Central Africa, and a second with all samples from West Africa and outside of Africa. This strategy should maximize the use of phasing information from samples showing similar patterns of linkage disequilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>MSMC2 and MSMC-IM analyses</title><p>We used MSMC2 and MSMC-IM according to published best practices to carry out cross-coalescent and isolation-with-migration analyses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiffels and Wang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). For this family of analyses, the inference may be less accurate if the recombination rate is much higher than the mutation rate. This constraint is not a problem for the human genomic data that these analyses were originally designed for but may present a barrier to analyses in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sellinger et al., 2021</xref>). For <italic>Ae. aegypti,</italic> both recombination and mutation rates are likely about an order of magnitude lower than those observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a similar ratio to that observed in humans (~1) and providing support for the application of these analyses to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. We first generated genome-specific masks for each genome using the script bamCaller.py, which is provided with the MSMC2 package. We also used a general genomic mask that included only putative single-copy regions (mean coverage 5–30 x) and excluded annotated centromeric and repetitive regions. This general genomic mask further excluded regions previously identified as under selection between specialists and generalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>), as well as the sex locus, and sites that were annotated as uncallable using SNPable on the African consensus of the AaegL5 assembly, with parameters -l 150 r 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li, 2023</xref>). We used bcftools to extract phased genomes for focal individuals from our phasing panel. We then carried out cross-coalescent analyses using MSMC2. We carried forward the resulting MSMC2 output into MSMC-IM analysis, fitting isolation-with-migration models to the fitted cross-coalescent estimates, with default regularization settings. We bootstrapped MSMC2 and MSMC-IM analyses using ten replicates of three 400 Mb chromosomes composed of resampled blocks of 20 Mb.</p><p>We characterized rates of cross-coalescence and historically effective population sizes among five populations. We used Ngoye, Senegal (NGO) as a representative of human specialists living in Africa. We used Ouahigouya, Burkina Faso (OHI), and PK10, Senegal (PKT, a forest area outside of Kedougou, Senegal) as representatives of nearby generalist populations in West Africa. We used Bangkok, Thailand (BKK) and Santarem, Brazil (SAN) as representatives of invasive human-specialist populations outside of Africa. For each population, we used two representative individuals, one male, and one female. We confirmed the sex of these individuals by checking rates of read mapping at the sex locus (chromosome 1, positions 151680000–152950000) — males all had &gt;700 counts per million, and females all had &lt;400 counts per million. Note, however, that the sex locus was masked for coalescent analyses.</p><p>As discussed in the Results, our cross-coalescent analyses yielded results in coalescent units that need to be scaled by mutation rate and generation time to yield dates for key events. These parameters are difficult to calibrate even in well-characterized systems like humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For this reason, we used the well-described relationship between the Atlantic slave trade and the spread of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> out of Africa to ground truth and calibrate our coalescent scaling factor. We used the Bhattacharyya coefficient (implemented in a custom R function) to measure the degree of concordance between the inferred <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> migration rate between West Africa and the Americas (using Ngoye, Senegal, and Santarem, Brazil as reference populations) and the intensity of the Atlantic slave trade as documented in the Slave Voyages database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slave Voyages, 2023</xref>). We then used the coalescent scaling factor that gave the strongest concordance between inferred migration and slave trade intensity (corresponding to a mutation rate of 4.85 × 10<sup>–9</sup>, assuming 15 generations per year) to calibrate our subsequent analysis of divergence between human-specialist and generalist lineages.</p><p>The climate history of the Sahara and Sahel regions has been reconstructed from analysis of plant-derived marine sediments from the Eastern Atlantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tierney et al., 2017</xref>). We visualized the African Humid Period by using <italic>ImageJ/FIJI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rasband, 2015</xref>) to trace the four reconstructed records of precipitation over the past 25,000 years (GC27, GC37, GC49, GC69) in the Sahel and Sahara described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tierney et al., 2017</xref>.

We used block-jackknifed Z-scores to assess whether the resulting values were significantly negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peter, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>AncestryHMM analyses</title><p>We used AncestryHMM to detect tracts of human-specialist ancestry in KUM and OGD, using a single-pulse model, running a separate analysis for each chromosome. We filtered the previously described biallelic SNP set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>) to include only ancestry-informative sites characterized by an allele-frequency difference between populations of &gt;0.3 and a minimum of 10 sampled alleles per population. Sites were then thinned such that no two were closer than 10,000 bp apart. We estimated recombination rates between sites using the recombination map published with the AaegL5 genome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>). For each analysis, we used reference panels of 10 unrelated and unadmixed OHI individuals and 16 unrelated and unadmixed BKK individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>AncestryHMM</italic> requires estimates of admixture proportions for each chromosome as part of its input. We estimated admixture proportions on each chromosome using the set of 1,000,000 unlinked variants used to estimate genome-wide admixture proportions in a previous <italic>ADMIXTURE</italic> analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>), subsetting these variants for each chromosome. <italic>AncestryHMM</italic> simultaneously estimates admixture timing during model training – we used 80 bootstrap resampling blocks of 1000 ancestry-informative sites to construct 95% confidence intervals for admixture pulse timing for each chromosome in each population. Since selection associated with adaptation to urban habitats could shape lengths of admixture tracts, we masked regions previously identified as under selection between human specialists and generalists when estimating admixture timing—namely, the outlier regions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2020</xref>. However, we used an unmasked analysis to determine and visualize the genome-wide distribution of ancestries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Comparison of admixture patterns between cities</title><p>In order to determine whether the distribution of human-specialist ancestry across the genome was more similar between OGD and KUM than would be expected from random chance, we used circular chromosome permutation tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stainton et al., 2015</xref>). We first used Viterbi posteriors from each individual within a single population to calculate a population-specific local ancestry proportion at each site used in our <italic>AncestryHMM</italic> analysis and then calculated the Pearson correlation of local ancestry in KUM with that in OGD across all genomic loci. In each permutation, we randomly selected a new starting point for each chromosome, placing the preceding sequence at the end of the permuted chromosome but otherwise leaving the spatial relationship between loci undisturbed. We then recorded the Pearson correlation coefficient between the permuted distributions of ancestry in KUM and OGD, constructing a null distribution across 1000 permutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>AncestryHMM simulations</title><p>In order to be sure that the distribution of admixture tracts found by our <italic>AncestryHMM</italic> analysis reflects actual differences in local ancestry and not differences in our power to detect them, we carried out a series of simulations taking advantage of our phasing panel. We simulated heterozygous tracts of different sizes (500 kb, 1 Mb, 2 Mb, 10 Mb) derived from the first haplotype of a phased BKK genome (sample Debug_010_aegypti_Bangkok_Thailand_01) on the background of two different unadmixed OHI individuals (Debug023_aegypti_Ouahigouya_BurkinaFaso_F_11, Debug023_aegypti_Ouahigouya_BurkinaFaso_M_10), using <italic>bedtools random</italic> to generate random intervals in which to place the tracts, <italic>bcftools</italic> to extract the tracts from the BKK genome, and <italic>bedtools intersect</italic> to generate simulated input files for <italic>AncestryHMM</italic>. For each of the four tract lengths, we carried out 100 replicate simulations. We noticed that <italic>AncestryHMM</italic> found tracts of specialist ancestry across all simulations using a given OHI individual in some small regions of the genome. However, these regions differed between the two OHI individuals used in our simulations. We, therefore, suspect these regions are small <italic>bona fide</italic> tracts of human-specialist ancestry in these otherwise unadmixed OHI individuals rather than general features of the analysis or reference panels used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is affiliated with Verily Life Sciences.

non-model systems with an innovative approach to model parameter calibration based on known historical events. Using this approach, they convincingly show that human specialization in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes likely evolved due to a past climate event around 5,000 years ago, and that recent rapid urbanization has continued to fuel its spread in West Africa in the past 20-40 years. This work will be of broad interest to population geneticists working on demographic inference, and to mosquito biologists working on the monitoring and control of this important vector species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83524.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>George H</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04p491231</institution-id><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01an7q238</institution-id><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.09.507331">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.09.507331v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 1 peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nicolas Lou (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Before getting to the details, I first wanted to apologize for the exceedingly long amount of time that it took to reach this decision, and offer some explanation. We had three reviewers accept the invitation to review, and received one review promptly, but not the other two. Since there were two outstanding reviews I continually assumed that at least one would be submitted, if late… and with allowance for the intervening holidays and busy end-of-year period (and of course just the generally challenging times being faced by many), this stretched until now. To be brief from here, I am choosing to proceed with the positive decision on your paper at this point with one formally-submitted review, rather than add further time to the process to solicit wholly new reviews. This is partly due to my own comfort in evaluating your methods, results, and conclusions, as an unofficial second reviewer in this case. I fully support the comments of the submitted review and will add that I really like the paper – the methodological approach and the biological results are each outstanding on their own; together this is an outstanding paper in my view, with only relatively small changes needed prior to acceptance and publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Expand discussion regarding the specific assumptions made in your analyses, sources of uncertainty regarding the inputs, and how this impacts the certainty of your results. The inclusion of a formal uncertainty analysis could be warranted, with the expansion of this discussion to a mini-section of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83524.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Expand discussion regarding the specific assumptions made in your analyses, sources of uncertainty regarding the inputs, and how this impacts the certainty of your results.
