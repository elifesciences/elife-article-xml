subcomplex and its inhibitor, the GATOR2 subcomplex, sensitive to amino acid starvation. Previously, we identified fission yeast GATOR1 that prevents deregulated activation of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we report identification and characterization of GATOR2 in fission yeast. Unexpectedly, the GATOR2 subunit Sea3, an ortholog of mammalian WDR59, is physically and functionally proximal to GATOR1, rather than GATOR2, attenuating TORC1 activity. The fission yeast GATOR complex is dispensable for TORC1 regulation in response to amino acid starvation, which instead activates the Gcn2 pathway to inhibit TORC1 and induce autophagy. On the other hand, nitrogen starvation suppresses TORC1 through the combined actions of the GATOR1-Sea3 complex, the Gcn2 pathway, and the TSC complex, another conserved TORC1 inhibitor. Thus, multiple, parallel signaling pathways implement negative regulation of TORC1 to ensure proper cellular starvation responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group

kinase complex highly conserved among eukaryotes, is a central regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González and Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolfson and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). TORC1 potentiates cellular anabolic processes including protein synthesis by phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma and Blenis, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, TORC1 inhibits the catabolic process autophagy by phosphorylating the components of the autophagy initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puente et al., 2016</xref>). TORC1 has been extensively studied partly because of its potential as a target for anti-cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mossmann et al., 2018</xref>). Negative regulators of mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) are frequently mutated in cancer cells and inhibition of mTORC1 effectively suppresses growth of some human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabiner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimobayashi and Hall, 2016</xref>). Therefore, comprehensive understandings of TORC1 and its regulation are expected to provide critical insights into the molecular pathology of cancers as well as the growth control of normal cells.</p><p>TORC1 activity is responsive to diverse physiological and environmental cues, such as growth factors, various forms of stress, energy status, and nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González and Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolfson and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). In mammalian cells, the activity of mTORC1 is controlled on the lysosomal surface by the two types of small GTPases, Rheb and Rag. In its GTP-loaded state, Rheb activates mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saucedo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), and this Rheb function is negatively regulated by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of the tumor-suppressing TSC complex composed of TSC1, TSC2, and TBC1D7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dibble et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of growth factors or under energy stress, the TSC complex promotes the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rheb, leading to mTORC1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>). The Rag GTPases form a heterodimer of RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD, which is anchored to the lysosomal membrane through a scaffold protein complex called Ragulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). In the presence of amino acids, RagA/B becomes a GTP-loaded, active form and the Rag–﻿Ragulator complex recruits mTORC1 to lysosomes, facilitating mTORC1 activation by Rheb. RagA/B is negatively regulated by its GAP complex GATOR1 (<underline>G</underline>AP <underline>a</underline>ctivity <underline>to</underline>ward the <underline>R</underline>ag GTPases 1), which is composed of DEPDC5, Nprl2, and Nprl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>). Amino acid stimuli inactivate the GAP activity of GATOR1 through its inhibitor GATOR2, a complex of the five proteins named WDR24, WDR59, MIOS, SEH1L, and SEC13, leading to an increase in GTP-bound RagA/B and thus, mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>). The GATOR holocomplex composed of GATOR1 and GATOR2 serves as a conduit to transmit amino acid signals to mTORC1. Leucine and arginine are monitored by Sestrins and CASTOR1, respectively, both of which bind and inhibit GATOR2 to inactivate mTORC1 when cells are starved of these amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chantranupong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chantranupong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parmigiani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saxton et al., 2016</xref>). SAMTOR is a sensor for the methionine metabolite <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine and mediates methionine-induced mTORC1 activation through GATOR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The mTORC1 subunits as well as the mTORC1 regulators described above, such as the Rag GTPases, GATOR1, and GATOR2, are conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tatebe and Shiozaki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolfson and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The Gtr1–Gtr2 heterodimer, the SEACIT complex, and the SEACAT complex are the budding yeast counterparts of human RagA/B–RagC/D, GATOR1, and GATOR2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dokudovskaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the structural similarities, the Ego1–Ego2–Ego3 complex is a Ragulator equivalent in budding yeast, whereas no apparent Rheb and TSC orthologs are present in the TORC1 pathway of this yeast species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powis et al., 2015</xref>). In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, another model eukaryote phylogenetically distant from budding yeast, TORC1 is activated by the Rheb ortholog Rhb1, which is under the negative regulation by the TSC complex as in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Slegtenhorst et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, we previously identified GATOR1 and Ragulator counterparts in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and demonstrated that, even under nutrient-rich conditions, TORC1 activity is attenuated by these protein complexes through the Rag GTPase heterodimer Gtr1–Gtr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuda and Shiozaki, 2018</xref>). The GATOR1 function can be replaced by the GDP-locked mutant form of Gtr1, indicating that <italic>S. pombe</italic> GATOR1 functions as GAP for Gtr1. Interestingly, genetic experiments suggest that the negative regulation of TORC1 by the Gtr1–Gtr2 heterodimer is in parallel with that by the TSC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>); thus, the Rag GTPases in <italic>S. pombe</italic> have an ability to regulate TORC1 independent of the Rheb GTPase.</p><p>Here, we report the characterization of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> GATOR2 complex, which has been identified based on its physical interaction with GATOR1. Unexpectedly, Sea3, an evolutionarily conserved GATOR2 component, plays an important role in the GATOR1 function to negatively regulate TORC1. In addition, unlike in mammals, the GATOR complex is dispensable for TORC1 regulation in fission yeast under amino acid starvation. We have demonstrated that Gcn2, a protein kinase activated by uncharged tRNAs during amino acid starvation, is yet another negative regulator of TORC1 signaling. On the other hand, TORC1 suppression in the absence of any nitrogen source requires the combined actions of GATOR1, the Gcn2 pathway, and the TSC complex. It is likely that TORC1 activity is regulated by multiple, parallel pathways responsive to different types of nitrogen sources.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of GATOR2 in fission yeast</title><p>We previously identified the <italic>S. pombe</italic> GATOR1 complex through immunopurification of Npr2, an ortholog of the mammalian GATOR1 component Nprl2, followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the co-purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to Iml1 and Npr3 that constitute GATOR1, the analysis detected four additional proteins, Sea3, Sea4, Sec13, and Seh1, with sequence similarities to the mammalian GATOR2 components WDR59, MIOS, Sec13, and SEH1L, respectively. To confirm the conservation of GATOR2 that associates with GATOR1, we attempted to improve the purification procedure of GATOR1 by constructing strains where two GATOR1 components were tagged with different epitope tags for affinity purification. From the lysate of strains expressing Iml1 with the <italic>myc</italic> tag and either Npr2 or Npr3 with the FLAG tag, GATOR1 was purified by successive anti-FLAG and anti-<italic>myc</italic> immunoprecipitation procedures and co-purified proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The physical interaction of the five presumed GATOR2 components with GATOR1 was further corroborated by their co-immunoprecipitation with the GATOR1 component Iml1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, all of the five subunits of GATOR2 appear to be conserved in fission yeast and they form a complex with GATOR1 to constitute the GATOR holocomplex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of GATOR2 components as GATOR1-binding proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Affinity purification of the GATOR complex in fission yeast.

As Gcn2 is one of the key regulators of the cellular starvation response, we set out to assess its role in autophagy induction. First, in order to test whether amino acid starvation, the inducer of Gcn2 activation, brings about autophagy, leucine-auxotrophic fission yeast cells were shifted to the growth medium without leucine. Such leucine starvation induced Gcn2 activation, which was monitored by immunoblotting to detect phosphorylated eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

However, no GFP accumulation was detected in <italic>gcn2∆</italic> cells under leucine starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), demonstrating that the autophagy induced by leucine starvation is dependent on the Gcn2 kinase.

Therefore, the Gcn2 signaling pathway appears to be specifically responsible for induction of autophagy in response to amino acid starvation. Such a specific role of the Gcn2 pathway during amino acid starvation is also congruous with our observation that the Gcn2-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α and the Fil1 expression increased more significantly during starvation for leucine than that for nitrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Gcn2, the TSC complex, and GATOR1 attenuate TORC1 in parallel</title><p>As shown above, Gcn2 mediates amino acid starvation signals to inactivate TORC1 and induce autophagy, whereas nitrogen starvation can bring about autophagy even in the absence of Gcn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, we next examined whether the Gcn2-independent autophagy upon nitrogen starvation is controlled by the other negative regulators of TORC1, such as the TSC and GATOR1 complexes. In the <italic>gcn2∆ tsc2∆</italic> double-mutant cells starved of nitrogen, autophagy was severely reduced and delayed, in comparison to those in the wild-type and individual single-mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

In the <italic>gnc2∆ iml1∆ tsc2∆</italic> triple mutant, a trace of released GFP was detected only after 14 hr of nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), while autophagy takes place within 2 hr in wild-type cells after the starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data indicate that autophagy induction upon nitrogen starvation is dependent on the three negative regulators of TORC1 signaling, GATOR1, Gcn2, and the TSC complex. Not surprisingly, in strains lacking these regulators, severely impaired suppression of TORC1 activity during nitrogen starvation was confirmed by monitoring the TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of Psk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Especially, the <italic>gcn2∆ iml1∆</italic> double mutant exhibited a significant delay in the nitrogen starvation-responsive TORC1 inactivation, consistent with its severe defect in autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

It should be noted that such a significant contribution of Gcn2 to the nitrogen starvation-induced TORC1 inactivation and autophagy was observable only in the absence of the GATOR1 and TSC complexes, but not in their presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Indeed, nitrogen starvation provoked significant eIF2α phosphorylation in the GATOR1- and TSC-defective strains, but not in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>); the loss of the GATOR1 and TSC complexes may be compensated by activation of the Gcn2 kinase to attenuate TORC1.

These observations may reflect the contributions of the three negative regulators of TORC1 during nitrogen starvation; Gcn2 signaling contributes the most, whereas the TSC complex does the least among the three. Of note, the <italic>gcn2∆ tsc2∆</italic> mutant with functional GATOR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>), but not the <italic>gcn2∆ iml1∆ tsc2∆</italic> triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>), exhibited a transient reduction in TORC1 activity within 1 hr of nitrogen starvation. Therefore, it seems that GATOR1 can attenuate TORC1 promptly after the starvation, but negative feedback regulation that re-activates TORC1 or inhibits GATOR1 might be induced in response to the TORC1 attenuation. This GATOR1-dependent TORC1 attenuation preceded the Gcn2-mediated TORC1 inhibition, which became apparent after 2 hr of the starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In addition, in the <italic>gcn2∆</italic> single mutant that retains both GATOR1 and the TSC complex, a notable reduction in TORC1 activity was observed even earlier, within 10 min after the starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Thus, together with GATOR1, the TSC complex may be able to initiate the suppression of TORC1 activity much earlier than the Gcn2 pathway after nitrogen starvation. The relatively late contribution of Gcn2 to TORC1 attenuation in starved cells can be explained by the fact that Gcn2 functions through the Fil1-mediated transcriptional events. Indeed, eIF2α phosphorylation and Fil1 up-regulation were detectable as early as at 15 min after the starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2H</xref>), whereas the Gcn2-dependent TORC1 inactivation took place after 2 hr and later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Roles of the TORC1 negative regulators in the nutritional responses of fission yeast cells</title><p>Under nutrient-rich conditions, the TSC and GATOR1 complexes negatively regulate TORC1, moderating TORC1 signaling for optimal growth of fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>).

These observations indicate that the negative regulators of TORC1 are required for proper starvation responses, such as cell survival and sexual differentiation, in fission yeast.</p><p>In summary, under nutrient-rich conditions and during starvation, fission yeast TORC1 is negatively regulated by the TSC complex, the Gcn2 signaling pathway, and GATOR1, which requires the presumed GATOR2 component Sea3 for its full function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In mammalian cells, two classes of Ras-related small GTPases, Rheb and the Rag, serve as key regulators of mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González and Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolfson and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The TSC and GATOR1 complexes harbor GAP activity toward Rheb and RagA/B, respectively, and control these GTPases to negatively regulate mTORC1 activity. Growth factors and nutrient signals induce mTORC1 activation by suppressing the GAP function of these complexes to promote anabolism and restrain autophagy. We previously identified the GATOR1 complex in fission yeast and showed that the GATOR1 and TSC complexes attenuate TORC1 activity not only during nitrogen starvation but also under nutrient-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuda and Shiozaki, 2018</xref>). We also detected association of GATOR1 with four additional proteins homologous to the mammalian GATOR2 components, Sea3, Sea4, Sec13, and Seh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to them, the improved purification procedure for GATOR1 in this study successfully identified Sea2, an ortholog of the mammalian GATOR2 subunit WDR24, demonstrating the conservation of all the GATOR2 subunits in fission yeast. It has been reported that mammalian GATOR2 is inhibitory to GATOR1, promoting mTORC1 activation in the presence of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>). Unexpectedly, our characterization of Sea3, an ortholog of the mammalian GATOR2 subunit WDR59, implicated Sea3 in the GATOR1 function in fission yeast. First, the <italic>sea3∆</italic> mutation results in a growth defect to which the loss of GATOR1 is epistatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Second, suppression of TORC1 by rapamycin alleviates the <italic>sea3∆</italic> growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as has been found with the other GATOR1 component mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). Third, expression of the GDP-locked Gtr1 GTPase suppresses the <italic>sea3∆</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with the idea that Sea3 contributes to the GATOR1 function as Gtr1 GAP. Fourth, like the GATOR1-defective mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>), cells lacking Sea3 fails to promptly inactivate TORC1 upon nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, together with Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3, Sea3 appears to function as a fourth subunit of GATOR1 that suppresses TORC1 activity through the regulation of the Gtr1 GTPase. In line with such a notion, Sea3 binds to GATOR1 even in the absence of the other GATOR2 components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Seh1, Sea2, Sea4, and Sec13 can interact with GATOR1 only in the presence of Sea3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), implying that Sea3 mediates the interaction between GATOR1 and GATOR2. The predicted molecular architecture of the SEA complex, a GATOR equivalent in budding yeast, suggests that Sea3 also serves as an interaction hub among the constituting subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Algret et al., 2014</xref>), though the <italic>sea3∆</italic> mutation has little impact on TORC1 activity in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>). We found that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Sea3 is not required for the integrity or vacuolar localization of GATOR1, but promotes the GAP function of GATOR1 by enhancing the interaction between GATOR1 and the Gtr1 GTPase. On the other hand, the loss of Seh1, Sea2, and Sea4 yields no apparent phenotype, providing little clue to the functional relationship between GATOR1 and GATOR2, which are physically linked by Sea3.</p><p>Gcn2, an eIF2α kinase conserved among eukaryotes, is activated by uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in amino acid-starved cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wek et al., 1995</xref>). Phosphorylation of eIF2α inactivates translation initiation in general, while enhancing that of specific mRNAs encoding certain transcription factors, such as budding yeast Gcn4, mammalian ATF4, and fission yeast Fil1. Subsequently, they induce transcriptional programs to remedy the starvation stress. Our study has revealed that, in fission yeast, Gcn2 senses lack of different amino acids and induces autophagy through inhibition of TORC1. Phosphorylation of eIF2α followed by an increase in Fil1 is also involved in the Gcn2-mediated autophagy induction, indicating that the Gcn2-eIF2α-Fil1 pathway mediates amino acid starvation signals to negatively regulate TORC1. It should be noted that fission yeast Gcn2 was previously proposed to function downstream of TORC1 because inactivation of TORC1 stimulates Gcn2 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valbuena et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, a positive feedback loop may operate during starvation, where Gcn2 signaling suppresses TORC1 and the attenuation of TORC1 further enhances Gcn2 activity. Intricate interplay between TORC1 and Gcn2 signaling in response to different types of stress was also suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rødland et al., 2014</xref>). Also in budding yeast, Gcn2 has been shown to function both upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>) and downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cherkasova and Hinnebusch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kubota et al., 2003</xref>) of TORC1.</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which the Gcn2 pathway attenuates TORC1 is currently unknown. In budding yeast, Gcn2 was proposed to directly bind and phosphorylate one of the TORC1 subunits to inhibit TORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). However, a similar scenario is unlikely in fission yeast, where the effectors downstream of Gcn2, such as eIF2α, Gcn3, and the Fil1 transcription factor, are involved in the suppression of TORC1. Interestingly, Gcn4, a Fil1 counterpart in budding yeast, is also known to promote autophagy in response to amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, in mammalian cells, GCN2 contributes to mTORC1 suppression during amino acid starvation through the GCN2-activated transcription factor ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, TORC1 inactivation by the Gcn2-mediated transcriptional program during amino acid starvation is likely to be conserved among diverse eukaryotes. ATF4 induces expression of Sestrin2, which regulates mTORC1 activity via the GATOR complex and the Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chantranupong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parmigiani et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, our genetic data in this study suggest that the Gcn2 pathway in fission yeast regulates TORC1 independent of the GATOR–Rag pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>), implying a different type of TORC1 regulator(s) as a target of the Fil1 transcription factor. Gcn2 signaling in yeasts is known to control expression of genes involved in biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins, as well as stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duncan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Natarajan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tarumoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Udagawa et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is also possible that Fil1 does not directly regulate expression of TORC1 regulators; modulation of cellular metabolic, redox, or energy status by the Gcn2-induced transcriptional program may indirectly reduce TORC1 activity in a manner independent of the GATOR1 and TSC complexes.</p><p>While TORC1 inactivation in response to amino acid starvation is exclusively mediated by Gcn2, nitrogen starvation suppresses TORC1 through the parallel actions of at least three pathways including GATOR1, the TSC complex, and Gcn2. Among these three pathways, the contribution of Gcn2 is cryptic in the presence of the two others; the Gcn2 pathway mutants exhibit no apparent defect in the TORC1 suppression upon nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The kinetics of Psk1 dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) indicates that nitrogen starvation induces more swift TORC1 inactivation than does amino acid starvation; thus, nitrogen starvation may immediately suppress TORC1 without uncharged tRNA accumulation that activates Gcn2 signaling. Indeed, the Gcn2-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation is not very prominent after nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The acute TORC1 inactivation upon nitrogen starvation is likely to be mediated by GATOR1 and the TSC complex because, in their absence, TORC1 inactivation is significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, in strains lacking the GATOR1 and TSC complexes, nitrogen starvation leads to robust activation of Gcn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), possibly via uncharged tRNAs generated by short supply of amino acids in the absence of robust autophagy in those mutants. In addition, the <italic>gcn2∆</italic> mutation accentuates the defective TORC1 suppression during nitrogen starvation in strains lacking GATOR1 and the TSC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Therefore, it is very likely that GATOR1 and the TSC complex are primarily responsible for the nitrogen starvation-induced TORC1 inhibition and that their absence can be compensated by Gcn2 activation, which also suppresses TORC1 activity.</p><p>In mammalian cells, leucine and arginine bind to the amino acid sensors Sestrins and CASTOR1, respectively, releasing those sensor proteins from their inhibitory interaction with GATOR2, which then impedes the GATOR1-dependent suppression of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chantranupong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chantranupong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parmigiani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saxton et al., 2016</xref>). Sestrins and CASTOR1 are not conserved in fission yeast, and the Gcn2 pathway is instead responsible for the TORC1 attenuation upon leucine and arginine starvation. On the other hand, the GATOR1 and TSC complexes in fission yeast carry out the TORC1 suppression upon nitrogen starvation, though very little is known about how these complexes monitor the nitrogen availability. Thus, Gcn2, GATOR1, and the TSC complex are evolutionarily conserved, but their respective roles in TORC1 regulation may be choreographed differently from organism to organism in order to optimize cellular responses depending on the physiological constraints and requirements. For example, unicellular organisms such as yeast are exposed to dynamic fluctuations in nutritional environment. Fission yeast might have evolved multiple, yet distinct mechanisms that sense nitrogen starvation and induce timely responses in order to properly execute the intricate program of its sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mata et al., 2002</xref>). We believe that studies in fission yeast offer an invaluable perspective for comprehensive understanding of conserved and divergent mechanisms of TORC1 regulation in eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fission yeast strains and general techniques</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Fukuda demonstrate that, in fission yeast, the GATOR2 subunit Sea3 (an ortholog of mammalian WDR59) acts with GATOR1 to suppress TORC1 activity. However, GATOR2 is not required for TORC1 activation by amino acid starvation. In contrast, Sea3 does contribute to TORC1 activation caused by nitrogen starvation. These observations clarify the disparate roles of GATOR2 in the fission yeast and mammalian TORC1 pathways. Moreover, the analysis identifies roles for parallel and partially redundant signaling mechanisms that regulate TORC1 in fission yeast.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tripartite suppression of fission yeast TORC1 signaling by the GATOR1-Sea3 complex, the TSC complex and Gcn2 kinase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kuang Shen (Reviewer #2); Brendan D Manning (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Fukuda et al. identify <italic>S. pombe</italic> Sea3 as a component of the GATOR1 complex that inhibits TORC1 in response to nitrogen deprivation. This protein links the GATOR1 and 2 complexes and is required for the GATOR1-dependent localization of GATOR2 to the vacuolar surface. The authors identify three partially redundant mechanisms that inhibit TORC1 in conditions of nitrogen starvation, Gcn2, the TSC complex, and GATOR1, and determine that only Gcn2 is required to inhibit mTORC1 during starvation of the amino acid leucine.</p><p>This manuscript demonstrates the importance of three different nutrient-regulated pathways to suppression of mTORC1 following starvation. The study could be strengthened by a closer consideration of the overlapping functions of these pathways, in particular by addressing their different kinetics (e.g., signaling versus transcriptional responses) and speculation as to why these redundant mechanisms of regulation have evolved relative to mammalian systems.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript would be strengthened by a more careful analysis of the kinetics of TORC1 inhibition and induction of autophagy following nitrogen withdrawal at earlier time points. In the double-mutant strains where only one of Gcn2, Iml1, and Tsc2 are expressed, how do loss of P-Psk1, cleavage of Pgk1-GFP, and increased abundance of Fil1 change at early time points following nitrogen deprivation. Do the starvation-sensing pathways act at different times following starvation? The results shown in Figure 6 present data from time points where both post-translational and transcriptional effects would be expected to occur.</p><p>2) In Figure 2B and D, <italic>sea3∆</italic> appears to grow better than <italic>iml1∆</italic>, which suggests that loss of Sea3 does not impair GATOR1 function to the same extent as loss of core GATOR1 components. Is this observed when comparing P-Psk1 in these strains following nitrogen starvation as in Figure 2E?</p><p>3) One explanation for the inhibition of mTORC1 by Gcn2 during nitrogen starvation is that amino acid levels fall, resulting in activation of Gcn2 via its canonical regulation by uncharged tRNAs in agreement with the findings in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C. This could be tested or at least proposed as a likely mechanism for nitrogen sensing via Gcn2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60969.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript would be strengthened by a more careful analysis of the kinetics of TORC1 inhibition and induction of autophagy following nitrogen withdrawal at earlier time points.

The results suggest that Iml1 (GATOR1) and Tsc2 (TSC complex) initiate attenuation of TORC1 promptly after nitrogen starvation (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2G), though the attenuation cannot be sustained much longer in the absence of Gcn2 (“<italic>gcn2∆ tsc2∆</italic>” in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2E). On the other hand, the Gcn2-dependent TORC1 inhibition becomes detectable only after 2 hours of nitrogen starvation (“<italic>iml1∆ tsc2∆</italic>” in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2E). However, as shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2H, the Gcn2 kinase is activated within 15 min after nitrogen starvation, followed by increased expression of Fil1. It is conceivable that activation of the Gcn2 kinase does not immediately result in TORC1 attenuation, because TORC1 inhibition by the Gcn2 pathway involves the Fil1-mediated transcriptional program.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2B and D, sea3∆ appears to grow better than iml1∆, which suggests that loss of Sea3 does not impair GATOR1 function to the same extent as loss of core GATOR1 components.

We have also included new data showing that Hri1 and Hri2, two other eIF2α kinases mainly responsive to heat shock and arsenic stress (Zhan et al., 2004, cited in the manuscript), are not involved in autophagy induction upon nitrogen starvation (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). The results emphasize the specific role of the Gcn2 kinase in the starvation-induced eIF2α phosphorylation that leads to TORC1 attenuation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
