the mechanism by which these glycan conformational changes affect cartilage degeneration. An OA model was established in rabbits using mannosidase injection, which reduced high-mannose type N-glycans and led to cartilage degeneration. Further analysis of glycome in human OA cartilage identified specific corefucosylated N-glycan expression patterns. Inhibition of N-glycan corefucosylation in mice resulted in unrecoverable cartilage degeneration, while cartilage-specific blocking of corefucosylation led to accelerated development of aging-associated and instability-induced OA models. We conclude that α1,6 fucosyltransferase is required postnatally to prevent preosteoarthritic deterioration of articular cartilage. These findings provide a novel definition of early OA and identify glyco-phenotypes of OA cartilage, which may distinguish individuals at higher risk of progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fut8</kwd><kwd>high-mannose type N-glycan</kwd><kwd>corefucosylation</kwd><kwd>articular cartilage</kwd><kwd>glycome</kwd><kwd>early osteoarthritis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K15650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Norimasa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K22672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Norimasa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22H03917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Onodera</surname><given-names>Tomohiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K18516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Homan</surname><given-names>Kentaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP22zf01270004h0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Homan</surname><given-names>Kentaro</given-names></name><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Norimasa</given-names></name><name><surname>Onodera</surname><given-names>Tomohiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Corefucosylation contributes to the maintenance of the articular cartilage phenotype and depletion of FUT8 inhibits recovery from cartilage damage and promotes cartilage degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA), a degeneration of joint components, such as proteoglycans (PGs) and collagen, destroys cartilage and impairs joint function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillet et al., 2023</xref>). The global prevalence of OA is estimated to be &gt;500 million, which is a significant socioeconomic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Safiri et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, preventive measures must be implemented to reduce the future disease burden and disability. Once the cartilage is destroyed, it cannot be repaired homogeneously and progresses irreversibly thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thorstensson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huey et al., 2012</xref>). Since articular cartilage has no blood vessels and is not innervated, it is difficult for symptoms to appear. By the time clinical symptoms appear, the condition is often already considerably advanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glyn-Jones et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, from a preventive perspective, it is necessary to define and detect ‘pre-OA’, the stage before the onset of early OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahmoudian et al., 2021</xref>). Pre-OA is a knee with no pain, no motor function problems, and no arthroscopic or structural changes on radiography, only emerging cellular effects. Despite many studies, there is no gold standard for OA biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henrotin, 2022</xref>). It is important to characterize the disease state before OA to shift the paradigm from mitigation to late-onset disease prevention.</p><p>In the very early stages of OA, before cartilage matrix degeneration, cartilage destruction by enzymatic processes that degrade glycoproteins, PGs, and collagen, in that order, is underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vignon et al., 1987</xref>). Collagenolytic activity is largely unchanged on intact articular surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brew et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otero, 2012</xref>), and glycoprotein degradation is thought to be an early transient event in the enzymatic process of cartilage destruction because hexose degradation of glycoproteins promotes degradation of the protein portion of the molecule by proteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldring, 2012</xref>). Additionally, cartilage damage is reversible if type 2 collagen breakdown is mild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Meurs et al., 1999</xref>). Structural change analysis in glycoproteins is necessary for the early stages of OA but has not yet been performed sufficiently.</p><p>Matsuhashi et al<italic>.</italic>’s study showed that structural changes in N-glycans occurred in degenerated cartilage in a rabbit OA model before tissue changes occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matsuhashi et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Urita et al., 2011</xref> demonstrated that these N-glycans in degenerated mice and human cartilage are high-mannose type N-glycans. Furthermore, among several glycosidases, mannosidase activity was very high in OA joints, and its activity was high before the progression of cartilage fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Snelling et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that high-mannose type N-glycan plays an important role in OA pathogenesis. However, whether changes in the glycan structure are involved in OA pathogenesis is unclear.</p><p>This study analyzed the glycan structural changes that preceded OA degeneration and elucidated the mechanism of glycan structural changes in cartilage degeneration. For this purpose, the effects of mannosidase, a specific degrading enzyme of high-mannose type N-glycans associated with OA, on cartilage tissues and its molecular mechanisms were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mannosidase injection caused early OA-like change in vivo</title><p>A decrease in Safranin O staining in the right femoral condyle of the α-mannosidase-injected rabbit knee after 4 weeks was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

To achieve optimal activity, the pH range of 4–5 is ideal for mannosidase. In a physiological saline solution with a pH of 7 and a concentration of 100 μg/ml, it exhibited specific activity. Nevertheless, at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml, this activity was no longer present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Mice lacking <italic>Fut8</italic> exhibited severe growth retardation and died shortly after birth. Therefore, we decided to generate <italic>Fut8</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The tissue specificity of recombination was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of mouse genomic DNA that detected either the intact <italic>Fut8</italic><sup>loxP</sup> allele or the Cre-recombined <italic>Fut8</italic><sup>Δ</sup> allele in repeated crosses; N-glycan analysis of cartilage demonstrated the loss of corefucosylated sugar chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The proportion of high-mannose type N-glycan content was unchanged in cartilage lacking the <italic>Fut8</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Enzymatic degradation of high-mannose type N-glycans on the cartilage in <italic>Fut8</italic>-deficient mice exacerbated cartilage degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). In addition, reversible matrix repair by enzyme removal observed in control cartilage was not observed in <italic>Fut8</italic>-deficient cartilage explant cultures. To evaluate whether TGF-β1 decreases cartilage degeneration after mannosidase stimulation, TGF-β1 was exogenously added to <italic>Col2a1;Fut8</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cartilage in the presence of α-mannosidase stimulation for 24 hr.

Focusing on fucosylation, most of the complex/hybrid type glycans were modified with fucose.

A graphical abstract summarizing our findings is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. To test the hypothesis that structural changes in high-mannose type N-glycans may induce OA, we tested the effect of mannosidase loading on the structure of high-mannose type N-glycans. Consequently, modifying the structure of high-mannose type N-glycans by mannosidase loading induced OA-like histological alterations. Furthermore, the OA-like changes induced by mannosidase were recovered by enzyme removal. These results suggest that structural alterations of high-mannose type N-glycans lead to OA-like histological changes in articular cartilage but do not necessarily cause the pathogenesis of eventual OA. Subsequently, glycoblotting analysis revealed that core-fucose-containing glycans underwent complementary structural alterations per high-mannose type N-glycans. This suggests that the structural change of core-fucose-containing glycans may have some compensatory mechanism for OA-like alterations caused by the structural change of high-mannose type N-glycans. Furthermore, under the regulation of <italic>Fut8</italic> expression, which regulates the synthesis of core fucose, mannosidase was found to induce irreversible OA. The high-mannose/corefucosylation relationship estimated function to maintain formed cartilage. In endochondral ossification, the <italic>Fut8</italic> cKO growth plate had an enlarged hypertrophic zone and reduced primary spongiosa because it is involved in the next process of cartilage replacement into bone rather than the process of cartilage formation. These results provide the first evidence that structural alterations in glycans in the articular cartilage regulate eventual OA development.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract.</title><p>The corefucosylation of N-glycans is associated with the reduction of high-mannose type N-glycans in articular cartilage functions to maintain the formed vitreous cartilage as cartilage.

The degradation of non-collagenous molecules, such as aggrecan, occurs before the degradation of type II collagen in the early stages of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malfait et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigner et al., 2001</xref>). The histological analysis in this study revealed that the alteration in the structure of high-mannose type N-glycans resulted in a decrease in Safranin O staining (a decrease in glycosaminoglycans and/or PGs), whereas there was no change in collagen staining. These findings are consistent with alterations in the early stages of OA. Furthermore, we observed that removing mannosidase could cause PG loss to the control level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karsdal et al., 2008</xref> demonstrated that articular cartilage degradation is reversible in the presence of aggrecanase and concluded that the repair ability is not impaired before the degradation of aggrecan and type II collagen by MMPs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reimann et al., 1982</xref> observed that the glycosaminoglycans loss in articular cartilage is reversible and an early sign of OA before the ‘state of no return.’ The present results are consistent with the findings of previous reports on early OA and suggest that the mannosidase-loaded model can be considered an early OA-like alteration.</p><p>Since the structural change in high-mannose type N-glycans alone did not cause irreversible OA, we investigated other regulatory mechanisms related to high-mannose type N-glycans that could induce irreversible OA. The expression of corefucosylated N-glycans on a series of biosynthetic pathways was upregulated with structural changes in high-mannose type N-glycans. FUT8 is known to corefucosylate small oligomannose N-glycans (Man4-Man5GlcNAc2) but not large oligomannose N-glycans, such as Man8-Man9GlcNAc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang and Wang, 2016</xref>). This suggests that small oligomannose N-glycans trimmed by mannosidase could activate <italic>Fut8. Fut8</italic> is also upregulated in human OA chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Toegel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2023</xref>), and increased expression of these corefucosylated N-glycans has been observed during late chondrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Homan et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggested that these structural changes are related to OA-related glycosylation.</p><p>To clarify the relationship between the alteration of corefucosylated N-glycans and cartilage degeneration, <italic>Fut8</italic> cKO mice were used. Since the results of the ex vivo freeze-thaw model showed that cartilage degeneration was induced by changes in the glycan structure of chondrocytes, we used chondrocyte-specific KO mice. As a result, the reversibility of the cartilage degeneration model was diminished. This finding suggests that <italic>Fut8</italic>-mediated corefucosylation in chondrocytes plays a function in promoting glycan repair. Furthermore, to directly determine whether <italic>Fut8</italic> was involved in the inhibition of OA progression, the OA model was investigated. For the modeling of OA in <italic>Fut8</italic> cKO mice, the instability-induced OA model and the age-associated OA model were adapted. The former emphasizes mechanical stress factors in OA, the latter aging factors. OA is a multifactorial disease. Therefore, we thought it was appropriate to validate both aspects of OA. The results showed that conditional KO of <italic>Fut8</italic> in chondrocytes hastened the onset of OA. This suggests that cartilage corefucosylation associated with FUT8 plays a protective role against the attenuation of type II collagen in the OA process.</p><p>Finally, the expression of α1,6-linked core fucose on N-glycans in human cartilage is associated with OA, and corefucosylation was found to be one of the characteristics in OA cartilage. Total cellular glycome analysis, including N- and O-linked glycans derived from glycoproteins, GSL-glycans, GAGs, and fOSs, is informative for analyzing cell-specific characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujitani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa, 2017</xref>). Glycome profiling enabled the detection of corefucosylated N-glycans by sequential clustering of degenerated cartilage characteristics. Core fucose deficient mice generated by ablating the α1,6 fucosyltransferase enzyme, FUT8, were reported to have suppressed phosphorylation of Smad and increased expression of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) due to decreased binding of TGF-β ligand caused by the lack of core fucose addition to the TGF-β type II receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). The present study shows that treatment of cartilage with mannosidase caused corefucosylation, suppression of <italic>Mmp13</italic>, and increased expression of <italic>Tgfb</italic>. Moreover, treatment of FUT8-knockout cartilage with mannosidase resulted in the suppression of <italic>Tgfb</italic> expression and increased <italic>Mmp13</italic> expression. Here, the exogenous addition of TGF-β1 rescued them from cartilage degeneration. These results suggest that corefucosylation following the loss of high-mannose type N-glycans may provide chondroprotective effects via the TGF-β signaling pathway, which may have been lost by FUT8-knockout.</p><p>One limitation of this study was that we did not have access to cartilage samples from immediately before the onset of OA; thus, we do not know the expression of Fut8 in human cartilage in the early stage of OA onset and its influence on extracellular matrix degradation under homeostatic conditions. Obtaining cartilage specimens continues to be challenging, especially for those with early stages of OA.</p><p>In summary, we show for the first time a key role of FUT8 and glycan-dependent signaling mediators in extracellular matrix resilience associated with cartilage corefucosylation during early OA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Intra-articular injection of α-mannosidase in the rabbit knee</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Japanese Act on Welfare and Management of Animals. Our animal use protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University (Approval No. 17–0059). We injected mannosidase into rabbit knee joints following a previous paper showing that N-type glycans are altered prior to cartilage matrix degeneration. Japanese White rabbits weighing 3.10±0.15 kg purchased from a professional breeder (Japan SLC Inc, Hamamatsu, Japan) were used for this study according to established ethical guidelines approved by the local animal care committee. Animals were anesthetized with 10 mg/kg of intravenous ketamine, followed by isoflurane in oxygen gas.

Samples were from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for clinically and radiologically diagnosed OA (n=5; age range 61–84 years, mean 72.4; male: female ratio 1:4). Age-matched control articular cartilage was from patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fracture with no history of joint disease (n=5; age range 45–88 years, mean 61.2 years; male: female ratio 3:2). Each cartilage specimen was evaluated macroscopically by at least two veteran doctors to ensure that it had not suffered damage or degeneration and was treated within 9 hr of harvest in the operating room. Immediately upon receipt, isolated human cartilage was homogenized with a Polytron blender (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland), and then cold ethanol was added to separate the protein and lipid fractions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Total cartilage glycomic analysis</title><p>To determine whether the glycosylation detected is conserved across species, we analyzed the total glycome in human cartilage. N-glycans were released directly using cartilage lysates following deglycosylation by overnight treatment with peptide N-glycanase F (PNGase F, 2 U) (Roche, Switzerland). The supernatants containing GSLs and fOSs were dried with a centrifugal evaporator. GSL-glycans were isolated by enzymatic digestion using EGCase I (Takara Bio Inc Japan), whereas fOSs were recovered from an EGCase I-free fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fujitani et al., 2011</xref>). Cartilage lysate was delipidated and digested by GAG disaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takegawa et al., 2011</xref>). Extracted glycoproteins were subjected to BEP for O-glycan analysis. Detailed procedures and materials are provided elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furukawa et al., 2015</xref>). N-glycans, fOSs, GAGs, and GSL-glycans were subjected to glycoblotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Furukawa et al., 2008</xref>). Purified N-glycans, fOSs, O-glycans, and GSL-glycan solutions were mixed with 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid and subjected to Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). 2AB-labeled GAG disaccharides were analyzed by HPLC. The glycan compositions were manually determined by conducting database searches (i.e. a compositional search of the UniCarbKB database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unicarbkb.org/query">http://www.unicarbkb.org/query</ext-link>) for fOSs and N- and O-glycans and of the SphinGOMAP database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sphingomap.org/">http://www.sphingomap.org/</ext-link>) for GSL-glycans). All previously deposited GSL-glycans in the SphinGOMAP database were extracted and compiled as an in-house database to allow searching by the m/z value and/or composition. The absolute quantification was obtained by comparative analyses between the MS signal areas derived from each glycan and the internal standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data in this study are presented as the mean ± standard deviation and were repeated at least three times unless otherwise indicated.

Although the methods, data, and analyses broadly support the claims, the data shown by the authors are incomplete because the mechanism by which cartilage degeneration induced by changes in glycometabolism occurs has not been fully elucidated.

We had shown that the addition of mannosidase to an organ culture system of normal wild-type mouse cartilage increased TGF-β gene expression from 6 hours (Fig. 3E) and that TGF-β expression was even suppressed in chondrocytes from Fut8 cKO mice (Fig. 4D). In addition to these results, an early OA model in which mannosidase is added to the cartilage was used to test the effect of exogenous TGF-β. As a result, under TGF-β treated conditions, no degenerative changes occurred when high-mannose type N-glycans were trimmed, and proteoglycan leakage during the recovery period was significantly reduced. This was considered to be a very useful finding and it was decided to include the experimental results in Figure 4F, rather than making them supplement data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper consists of mostly descriptive data, judged from alpha-mannosidase-treated samples, in which they found an increase in core fucose, a product of Fut 8.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper is interesting in the clinical field, but unfortunately, the data is mostly descriptive and does not have a significant impact on the scientific community in general.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for their interest in our work and their overall positive report. In response to your comment about our attempts to show that glycan changes occur at the precursor stage of cartilage substrate degeneration and that this glycosylation is also what triggers substrate degeneration, we would like to add that reversing cartilage substrate degeneration is a very ambitious challenge. We are currently in the preparatory stages of characterizing the appropriate glycan-substrate relationships to 'rescue' cartilage tissue from degeneration, and we hope to use this approach to provide information on the pre-developmental stages of OA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>If core fucose is increased, at least the target glycan molecules of core fucose should be evaluated. They also found an increase in NO, suggesting that inflammatory processes also play an important role in OA in addition to glycan changes.</p></disp-quote><p>As the increase in NO was observed in the organ culture system and cartilage is a tissue without vascular invasion, we thought that the involvement of immune cells could be excluded. On the other hand, our research group has reported that chondrocytes themselves have inflammatory circuits (Ota et al., Arthritis Rheum. 2019. DOI:10.1002/art.41182), but as we did not find increased expression of NF-κB, an indicator of inflammatory amplifier activation, we concluded that inflammation was not involved in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It has already been reported that core fucose is decreased by administration of alpha-mannosidase inhibitors. Therefore, it is expected that alpha-mannosidase administration increases core fucose.</p></disp-quote><p>The report by Toegel et al. that the synthesis of complex-type N-glycans (Man2a1, Mgat2) is predicted in human OA chondrocytes along with the expression of Fut8 also led to the expectation that administration of α-mannosidase would increase core fucose. However, there was no conclusive evidence that administration of α-mannosidase increased core fucose; in 1987, Vignon et al performed an enzyme assay on experimental OA cartilage (rabbit ACLT model) and showed that mannosidase was very high in operated joints and that its activity increased and decreased with the severity of fibrosis in the cartilage. The results suggest that glycoprotein hexose degradation is an early transient event in the enzymatic process of cartilage destruction. These findings led to the conception of a novel 'pre-OA model' in which mannosidase is added to the joint. The present study is valuable in its demonstration that glycometabolism is a driver of degeneration.</p><p>(see manuscript REF. 25, 9)</p><p>Toegel et al., Arthritis Res. Ther. 2013.

Therefore, we evaluated the epiphyseal line of 4-week-old mice stained with toluidine, type 10 collagen, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. This is similar to the epiphyseal growth plate phenotype of Smad3ex8/ex8 mice by Yang et al. and is consistent with the finding that Smad3 deficiency does not affect chondrogenesis during developmental stages, but the hypertrophic zone is increased in 3-4 week-old Smad3 KO mice. Chondrocytes in Fut8 cKO mice were suppressed of Tgf-β expression (Fig. 4D), suggesting that inhibition of TGF-β signaling, which is suppressive for late hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, led to the increased height of the hypertrophic zone.</p><p>The results suggested that the growth plate of Fut8 cKO mice had an enlarged hypertrophic layer and decreased primary trabecular bone.

The sample size for this study was increased to n=5 to account for attrition. The summed OARSI score of the WT in this study was comparable to that of Ouhaddi et al. and the model was judged to be working accurately.
