on physiological context. It is currently unknown how serotonergic neurons mediate these opposing effects. Utilizing virus-based strategies and Tph2-Cre transgenic mice, we identified two anatomically separated populations of serotonergic hindbrain neurons located in the lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) and the medial hindbrain, which respectively innervate the superficial and deep spinal dorsal horn and have contrasting effects on sensory perception. Our tracing experiments revealed that serotonergic neurons of the LPGi were much more susceptible to transduction with spinally injected AAV2retro vectors than medial hindbrain serotonergic neurons. Taking advantage of this difference, we employed intersectional chemogenetic approaches to demonstrate that activation of the LPGi serotonergic projections decreases thermal sensitivity, whereas activation of medial serotonergic neurons increases sensitivity to mechanical von Frey stimulation. Together these results suggest that there are functionally distinct classes of serotonergic hindbrain neurons that differ in their anatomical location in the hindbrain, their postsynaptic targets in the spinal cord, and their impact on nociceptive sensitivity. The LPGi neurons that give rise to rather global and bilateral projections throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the spinal cord appear to be ideally poised to contribute to widespread systemic pain control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>hindbrain</kwd><kwd>projection neuron</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_197888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeilhofer</surname><given-names>Hanns Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Olga Mayenfisch Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wildner</surname><given-names>Hendrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two populations of serotonergic neurons are present in the medial and lateral hindbrain, which are shown to project to distinct spinal cord regions and have opposing effects on nociception in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Descending pain control is a critical endogenous mechanism of pain modulation that is required for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Millan, 2002</xref>), and allows an organism to respond in an appropriate context-dependent manner to external threats. Key brain structures involved in this system were discovered through stimulation-produced analgesia experiments and include the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) and the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Basbaum and Fields, 1984</xref>). This descending system acts to inhibit the flow of nociceptive information through the spinal dorsal horn and requires descending tracts within the dorsolateral funiculus to mediate its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basbaum et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basbaum et al., 1977</xref>). The RVM is also required for maintaining some chronic pain states through a process of descending facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Porreca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that this area has a bidirectional control over pain sensitivity. Both descending inhibition and facilitation will ultimately require the activation of descending tracts to modulate the neuronal activity within the dorsal horn. To understand the precise neuronal circuitry and transmitter systems underlying descending pain inhibition and facilitation, an understanding of the different projection neurons from the RVM to the spinal cord is needed.</p><p>Monoamines are important neurotransmitters involved in descending pain control, with serotonin (5-HT) being able to inhibit nociception when injected intrathecally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang, 1977</xref>). Spinal 5-HT is also known to contribute to certain forms of endogenous pain suppression, such as stress-induced analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yesilyurt et al., 2015</xref>) but is also required to maintain chronic pain in rodent models of nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2010</xref>). This pain facilitation in pre-clinical neuropathy models is thought to be a result of reduced tonic diffuse noxious inhibitory controls, due to increased spinal 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister and Dickenson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2015</xref>). The variety and abundance of 5-HT receptors within the spinal dorsal horn likely explains, at least in part, why these multiple effects are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bardoni, 2019</xref>). Clearly, spinal 5-HT and the serotonergic projections to this region have a complex and bidirectional control over pain perception that require further study.</p><p>Functional studies of specific descending projections have been facilitated by the development of viral retrograde tracers, such as AAV2retro and canine adenoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">François et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has been reported that the AAV2retro serotype, may not infect serotonergic hindbrain neurons as efficiently as other descending projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Further, despite the dense serotonergic innervation of the spinal dorsal horn, studies employing transsynaptic neuronal circuit tracing from dorsal horn neurons with modified rabies viruses rarely found labeled hindbrain serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">François et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This is surprising since both descending serotonergic neurons and dorsal horn interneurons are known to strongly influence nociception, and it is possible that these rabies-virus-based tracers fail to detect functional connections between serotonergic neurons and starter populations within the spinal cord. Together these reports would suggest that descending serotonergic projections of the hindbrain are particularly challenging to study using the currently available tools.</p><p>In an attempt to address this discrepancy, we compared the labeling efficiency of viral and non-viral tracers. Specifically, we examined the susceptibility of serotonergic hindbrain neurons to retrograde spinal transduction by AAV2retro serotype vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, we traced serotonergic neurons of the hindbrain with modified rabies viruses and tested whether they could be labeled from dorsal horn neuron starter populations with transsynaptic rabies tracing. To allow functional interrogation of descending serotonergic neurons, we assessed the specificity of the Tph2-Cre mouse line and used this together with the preferential transduction efficiency of AAV2retro to develop an intersectional system that allowed selective labeling and manipulation of serotonergic neurons in the lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi), or the medial serotonergic neurons including the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM). We find that the lateral and medial serotonergic neurons of the RVM are distinct in terms of their anatomical organization, susceptibility to AAV2retro transduction, and influence on acute nociception.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spinal injection of AAV2retro serotype vectors preferentially transduce TPH2-containing projection neurons in the lateral hindbrain</title><p>AAV vectors have been developed to permit the efficient retrograde labeling of projection neurons via their axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is debatable whether these vectors are capable of transducing serotonergic neurons that project to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). To test this, we used AAV2retro serotype vectors to retrogradely label hindbrain neurons that project to the spinal cord to assess their ability to transduce serotonergic projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Following intraspinal injection of AAV2retro.GFP, many transduced neurons were labeled within the RVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When we inspected the location of neurons that expressed both TPH2 and eGFP (according to scheme depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we found that the majority of these cells were located within the lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To study the anatomical organization of serotonergic pathways using a non-viral method, we used Cholera toxin b subunit (CTb) retrograde tracing and compared the hindbrain labeling with our AAV2retro tracing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, many CTb-labeled TPH2-expressing hindbrain neurons were found in the midline NRM, although CTb-containing TPH2-expressing neurons were also found in the LPGi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The location of these CTb + TPH2 + cells was more evenly divided between the NRM and LPGi that the eGFP + TPH2 + cells from the AAV2retro labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To directly test whether there were differences in labeling efficiency between AAV2retro and CTb, AAV2retro.GFP and CTb were co-injected into the spinal dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In total, more neurons in the ventral hindbrain were retrogradely labeled with CTb than AAV2retro.eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). When only TPH2-expressing retrogradely labeled neurons were examined, far fewer were labelled with AAV2retro.GFP relative to the overall population of traced neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, when the retrogradely labeled TPH2 + neurons were divided into separate areas, it was apparent that a lower percentage of neurons in the medial serotonergic nuclei including the NRM were labeled with eGFP compared to the LPGi, whereas the proportion of serotonergic neurons in the LPGi labeled with AAV2retro, CTb, and both AAV2retro and CTb were similar to the general population of retrogradely labeled hindbrain neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the reduced labeling of hindbrain serotonergic neurons with AAV2retro was due to a resistance of midline serotonergic neurons to AAV2retro-mediated transduction.

Transsynaptic rabies tracing is a commonly used technique for tracing neuronal circuits from genetically defined populations of neurons and provides useful information regarding the presynaptic inputs to a neuronal population. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wickersham et al., 2007b</xref>). However, in the case of serotonergic neurons, the results of previous studies have demonstrated that very few neurons of the hindbrain are traced from dorsal horn starter populations, despite the dense serotonergic innervation of the superficial dorsal horn and the important role of serotonin in pain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">François et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that serotonergic neurons are either traced with only limited efficacy, or that there is highly specific serotonergic innervation of some spinal neuron populations but not others.</p><p>To test whether serotonergic hindbrain neurons are susceptible to rabies virus infection, we injected a rabies virus, whose genome lacked the glycoprotein-encoding sequence but was pseudotyped with the SAD glycoprotein (SAD.RabiesΔG-eGFP (SAD-G)), into the spinal dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This virus can directly infect most neurons but cannot be propagated beyond the initially infected neurons due to the lack of the rabies glycoprotein required for transsynaptic spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albisetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wickersham et al., 2007a</xref>). Five days after injection of SAD.rabΔG-eGFP (SAD-G), 44% of the labeled hindbrain neurons contained detectable TPH2 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B, C</xref>). Notably, the percentage of labeled neurons dropped to only 12% of labeled hindbrain neurons at day 7 post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). This reduction may be a result of rabies virus toxicity, which could lead to a downregulation of cytoplasmic enzymes such as TPH2 to undetectable levels, and hence an underestimation of labeled serotonergic neurons. For this reason, we used a 5-day survival time for all subsequent experiments involving rabies viruses.</p><p>To determine whether serotonergic hindbrain neurons could be traced transsynaptically from the spinal dorsal horn, we used Hoxb8-Cre mice to define a broad starter population of spinal cord neurons. During development, Hoxb8-Cre is expressed transiently in almost all spinal neurons and astrocytes caudal to C4. It can be used to define a starter population that includes virtually all dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Witschi et al., 2010</xref>). We used Hoxb8-Cre; ROSA<sup>TVA</sup> mice to induce stable expression of TVA in most dorsal horn neurons during development, enabling their infection in the adult with EnvA pseudotyped rabies viruses (SAD.RabiesΔG-GFP (EnvA)). To allow transsynaptic spread from the starter population, a helper virus containing mCherry and rabies glycoprotein was injected two weeks prior to injection of SAD.RabiesΔG-GFP (EnvA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>).</p><p>Five days after rabies virus injection, neurons in the ventral hindbrain labeled with eGFP were assessed for TPH2 expression by immunostaining. On average, the number of eGFP-labeled hindbrain neurons counted per animal was similar between direct and transsynaptic tracing from the spinal cord (8.3 and 8.25, respectively), both of which had far lower labeling efficiency when compared to labeling with either CTb or AAV2retro labeling. We only observed coexpression of eGFP and TPH2 once in a total of 33 inspected neurons, corresponding to 3% of our total sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E, F</xref>). A summary of all rabies virus tracing experiments can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. In the hindbrain, we never observed colocalization of mCherry and eGFP, suggesting that all eGFP-expressing neurons in the hindbrain were transsynaptically traced from the dorsal horn. Together these data demonstrate that although TPH2-expressing hindbrain neurons can be directly infected with modified rabies viruses, they are largely underrepresented with transsynaptic tracing from the dorsal horn. This may partly explain their absence from many of the circuit tracing studies that have used this approach.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Neurons in the ventral hindbrain traced from the spinal cord with modified rabies viruses.</title><p>Number represents the total number of cells counted with the range of cells counted for each animal in parentheses.

TPH2-containing neurons of the LPGi were susceptible to retrograde transduction by AAV2retro in contrast to other serotonergic nuclei of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which would permit selective transduction of these neurons using AAV2retro. Further, mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase within defined neuronal populations have been widely and successfully used to functionally study a variety of spinal neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gatto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peirs et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore assessed the reliability of the Tph2-Cre mouse line as a marker of serotonergic neurons and a potential tool to gain genetic access to these cells. To determine whether the Cre expression in this mouse line was specific to serotonergic neurons that project to the spinal cord, we injected the lumbar dorsal horn of Tph2-Cre mice with an AAV2retro serotype vector containing a Cre-dependent eGFP construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

This strategy utilized AAV2retro serotype vectors containing a Cre-dependent optimized flippase (FLPo), which, when injected intraspinally, results in FLPo expression in Cre-expressing neurons that project to the dorsal horn. The AAV2retro serotype would also enable expression restricted to laterally located serotonin-expressing neurons. This construct also contained the coding sequence for mCherry, allowing these transduced cells to be visualized (AAV2retro.flex.FLPo.mCherry). The hindbrain was injected one week later with an AAV containing a flippase-dependent eGFP viral vector (AAV9.FRT.eGFP), to capture the neurons that were transduced from the spinal cord with AAV2retro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). This approach enables the quantification of intersectionally labeled serotonergic neurons (mCherry- and eGFP-expressing), relative to the population of neurons directly labeled from the spinal dorsal horn (mCherry-expressing). Therefore, the accuracy of the hindbrain injections and the proportion of the descending projection neurons captured within the injection site could be determined.</p><p>Different brain injection coordinates were tested to optimize the proportion of spinally projecting Tph2-Cre neurons that were captured with the stereotaxic brain injection. Bilateral injections of AAV9.FRT.eGFP (−6, ±0.5, –5.9 relative to Bregma) was the most efficient in terms of mCherry +eGFP + neurons labeled in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G and H</xref>). With this approach, we labeled 80.6% of all retrogradely transduced neurons with eGFP with the remaining 19.4% containing mCherry only, indicating that most retrogradely transduced neurons are labeled using this strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, this proportion was similar between the different areas containing retrogradely labeled serotonergic neurons (LPGi = 80.6%, Medial = 78.3%, other = 82.4%, labeled neurons containing eGFP), suggesting these injection sites encompass most regions that contain AAV2retro-labeled serotonergic projection neurons. Some cells only expressed eGFP without detectable mCherry staining, either due to non-specific recombination of the FRT sites or low to undetectable levels of mCherry present in these neurons. We found that a smaller proportion of eGFP-only neurons were present in the LPGi compared to the medial serotonergic nuclei (4.6% vs 16.9% respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).

To test this directly, we used the same chemogenetic receptor as our previous experiments to activate midline serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using the same strategy as the anatomical tracing experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we injected AAVs containing Cre-dependent hM3Dq.mCherry into the NRM.

These areas have later been shown to contain spinally-projecting neurons and together provide the spinal cord with serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwiat and Basbaum, 1992</xref>). Similarly, we were also able to label the same regions from the spinal cord with CTb tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, we found that most of the descending serotonergic neurons transducible with AAV2retro serotype vectors from the mouse spinal cord are located in the LPGi, similar to what has been previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We used this selectivity to devise a strategy to preferentially label midline or lateral serotonergic neurons and demonstrate that, in agreement with anterograde tracing studies, the innervation of the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn mainly originates from the LPGi and not the NRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gautier et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gautier et al., 2017</xref>), we found many axon terminals present within the ventral horn as well as the deep dorsal horn. Potentially this reflects a species difference (rat versus mouse), or the labeling of other midline serotonergic regions beyond the NRM, such as the ROb or the RPa in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hennessy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okaty et al., 2019</xref>). However, inclusion of these midline serotonergic neurons within the injection site demonstrates that they do not project to the superficial dorsal laminae. Therefore, it is likely that these pathways influence anatomically distinct neuron populations of the spinal cord, and likely play different functional roles.</p><p>The spinal dorsal horn is organized in a laminar structure that is closely linked to its function, such that thermal and nociceptive information is generally received and processed in the superficial laminae, whereas non-nociceptive mechanical and proprioceptive information is processed in deeper spinal laminae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Todd, 2010</xref>). This laminar organization can be seen in terms of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Häring et al., 2018</xref>), the termination zones of different primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cavanaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>), and the restricted laminar location of neuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das Gupta et al., 2021</xref>).

In support of this idea, the axons of these projections are densest in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and H</xref>), where temperature-related information is conveyed by TRPV1- and TRPM8-expressing sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavanaugh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cavanaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhaka et al., 2008</xref>). The presence of axons from lateral serotonergic neurons within the region that receives, and processes thermal information is consistent with the observation that activating these neurons affects thermal sensitivity.

These differences could be explained in part by the intensity and location of the stimulation used in experiments. In support of this idea, activation of the same neuron population with optogenetic or chemogenetic tools can produce distinct behaviors, likely due to differences in the strength or pattern of the neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sharif et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The activation of the midline serotonergic neurons influences multiple functionally different groups of neurons within the injection site, including the NRM, ROb, and RPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okaty et al., 2019</xref>). These more caudal nuclei are known to affect the motor system and respiratory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brust et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hennessy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iceman et al., 2013</xref>). Within the sensory assays tested, there was a rather selective change in mechanical responses and unaltered thermal responses, indicating that the effect was modality selective and unlikely due to motor effects alone. However, it cannot be excluded that serotonergic neurons in these distinct midline regions contribute to the reduced mechanical thresholds, either indirectly or by direct altering motor neuron activity in the ventral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Depuy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hennessy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawashima, 2018</xref>). Further studies of sensory function utilizing intersectional strategies to precisely capture and manipulate the midline populations will help to validate the present findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okaty et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Together the results of the chemogenetic experiments indicate that the same transmitter released into different spinal laminae can produce opposing effects on spinal nociception. Potential explanations for these findings include the 5-HTR subtypes that are engaged, the spinal neuron populations that are modulated, or a combination of both. Some 5-HTRs are known to have an excitatory influence when activated, whereas others have an inhibitory effect upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bardoni, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu and Perl, 2007</xref>). The activation of excitatory neurons and the inhibition of inhibitory neurons in the deep dorsal horn, corresponding to the termination zone of the medial serotonergic neurons, are known increase mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peirs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peirs et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, the activation of inhibitory neurons in the superficial dorsal horn, the region innervated by the lateral serotonergic neurons, and the inhibition of nociceptors through presynaptic inhibition of their central terminals could promote thermal hyposensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu and Perl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies are required to elucidate precisely which spinal 5-HT receptors and neuronal elements are mediating these opposing sensory phenomena.</p><p>Given the previously reported heterogeneity in biophysical properties of serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okaty et al., 2019</xref>), we found surprisingly little difference in the passive and active membrane properties between NRM and LPGi serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, none of the recorded neurons displayed spontaneous activity, which has been reported previously for serotonergic projection neurons of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). This may be attributable to differences in recording conditions, such as recording temperature, animal species, and recording solution composition. Additionally, these groups of neurons may exhibit differences in electophysiological properties, such as chemosensitivity, spontaneous activity, and responses to nociceptive stimuli, that are only detected in in vivo preparations or under recording conditions that differ from the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao and Mason, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao and Mason, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hennessy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mason et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potrebic et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richerson et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of transsynaptic rabies tracing of serotonergic RVM neurons</title><p>Transsynaptic rabies tracing has been widely used in recent years to identify presynaptic inputs to genetically defined neuronal populations and has become a frequently used tool for the study of neuronal circuits. Functional studies are limited due to the toxicity of first generation ΔG rabies viruses. However, other limitations of this technique are known, such as the resistance of some neuron types to infection by modified rabies viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albisetti et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that some types of hindbrain neurons are completely resistant to infection with modified rabies viruses, although this is not the case for serotonergic neurons, as they can be infected via their axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>). We show that although descending TPH2-expressing neurons are not resistant to infection from G-protein-deficient rabies viruses, they are rarely traced transsynaptically from dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The lack of transsynaptic labeling from the dorsal horn is possibly due to the synaptic organization of serotonergic axons at this site, since serotonin is known to mainly act via volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ridet et al., 1993</xref>). Since similar numbers of hindbrain neurons were labeled using direct rabies infection and transsynaptic rabies labeling, this could indicate an increased labeling efficiency of other neurons with the latter approach. Potentially this could be related to the synaptic density from these neurons to the starter population. However, both direct and transsynaptic rabies labeling were far less sensitive than the CTb or AAV2retro tracing, making interpretation of these findings complicated due to the comparatively small sample sizes.</p><p>Most serotonergic axons in the rat dorsal horn do not form synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maxwell et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ridet et al., 1993</xref>). However, some 5-HT-containing axonal boutons do form synapses within the dorsal horn, and these are observed as symmetrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polgár et al., 2002</xref>). Since projection neurons are approximately 5% of all lamina I neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cameron et al., 2015</xref>), the transsynaptic tracing from these neurons may not be detected in our experiments. Additionally, transsynaptic tracing from a primary afferent starter population was used to label serotonergic hindbrain neurons, suggesting axo-axonic synapses between descending serotonergic neurons and their central terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, the number of primary afferent neurons transduced from intraspinal injection of helper virus is likely small, since the AAV8 serotype and the inclusion of the hSyn promoter were used to reduce the transduction of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haenraets et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with the low number of mCherry-expressing cells found in the DRG taken from these animals. Taken together, these may explain why so few serotonergic hindbrain neurons were traced transsynaptically from the spinal dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">François et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Preferential transduction of LPGi serotonergic neurons with AAV2retro serotype vectors</title><p>The AAV2retro serotype has been developed for the retrograde delivery of genetic material to projection neurons via their axon terminals in a target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). Many projection neurons are found to display some resistance to transduction with these tools, for example dopaminergic neurons that project from the substantia nigra to the striatum and descending noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ganley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). Like others, we also find that midline neurons including the NRM serotonergic neurons are less sensitive to AAV2retro-mediated transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed that the serotonergic neurons of the lateral hindbrain do not display such resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This would suggest that these neurons are different in some property that allows the AAV2retro to enter their terminals or enhances the retrograde transport of the viral payload. The increased retrograde labeling efficiency of AAV2retro is not fully understood, although enhanced entry into axon terminals by increased spread of the vector in the injection site, entry into neurons via novel cell surface receptor interactions, and vesicular trafficking have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). AAV2retro-resistant neurons commonly use monoamines as neurotransmitters, suggesting that they likely share common features protecting them from transduction by these vectors.</p><p>Primarily, our data demonstrate that serotonergic neurons of the lateral hindbrain are antinociceptive when activated. These neurons project their axons to the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and can be targeted using AAV2retro vectors. In contrast, the medial serotonergic neurons are largely resistant to AAV2retro-mediated transduction, produce mechanical hypersensitivity upon acute activation, and project their axons to the deeper dorsal horn. Secondly, we highlight some of the limitations and challenges associated with AAV2retro-mediated and rabies-virus-based transsynaptic tracing from the spinal dorsal horn. These limitations are likely to have broader implications for transsynaptic rabies-based circuit tracing and the targeting of other projections that use biogenic amines, and possibly other transmitter systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice of either sex aged between 6 and 12 weeks were used for experiments.

Briefly, anesthesia of mice was induced with 5% Isoflurane in an induction chamber. Mice were then transferred to a stereotaxic injection setup and anesthesia was maintained with 1–3% Isoflurane delivered through a face mask. Body temperature was maintained using a heated mat placed beneath the animal. Vitamin A cream was applied to the eyes to prevent corneal drying during the operation and buprenorphine (0.1–0.2 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously prior to the operation. The back of the animal was shaved, and the skin was scrubbed with Betadine solution. Once dried, a midline incision was made above the vertebral column to expose the T13 vertebra, which was clamped using a pair of spinal adaptors to isolate movements from the animal’s breathing. This vertebra was selected since it is directly above the lumbar L3 spinal cord, which corresponds to the spinal cord segment receiving innervation from the hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haenraets et al., 2018</xref>). A borehole was made in the center of the left-hand side of the clamped vertebra and viruses, and/or 1% cholera toxin b (CTb) were injected into the dorsal horn at a depth of 300 μm below the spinal surface approximately 500 μm left of the central artery.

Rabies viruses pseudotyped with the SAD-G glycoprotein can directly infect most, but not all, types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albisetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wickersham et al., 2007a</xref>). The rabies viruses that are pseudotyped with the EnvA glycoprotein are only able to infect cells through binding to the TVA receptor. Therefore, the restricted expression of the TVA receptor to certain cell types allows the selective infection of those neurons with EnvA pseudotyped rabies viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wickersham et al., 2007b</xref>). For transsynaptic tracing experiments, the helper virus containing the rabies glycoprotein was injected two weeks prior to rabies virus injection to enable transsynaptic spread.</p><p>Animals were perfused 5 or 7 days after dorsal horn injection of rabies viruses. Hindbrain sections from rabies virus injected tissue were cut at 30 μm and mounted directly onto microscope slides. Tissues were immunostained for eGFP and TPH2 to determine the proportion of labeled hindbrain neurons that contained detectable TPH2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>For quantification of retrogradely labeled cells in the hindbrain, image stacks were acquired at 5 μm z-spacing using a Zeiss lsm 800 confocal microscope with Zen blue software. Confocal scans were made using 488, 561, and 640 nm lasers and the pinhole was set to 1 Airy Unit for reliable optical sectioning. Care was taken to acquire image stacks up to a depth where there was clear immunoreactivity of all antigens to avoid false negatives during quantification due to antibody penetration. Within each experiment, all acquisition settings were kept constant, and images were analyzed with FIJI using the cell counter plugin.</p><p>Alternatively, an automated cell quantification pipeline was designed in CellProfiler to count retrogradely labeled neurons in the RVM. We noticed that many large neurons within the RVM contained NeuN immunoreactivity that was present in more than one image in the image stacks (5 μm z-spacing). Automated counting of all images within each z-stack would lead to double counting a large proportion of cells present on multiple images within the image stack. However, if only one image was analyzed per image stack, numerous cells would be excluded from the analysis. Therefore, the acquired z-stacks were processed into either one to two orthogonal projections from two images to reduce the double counting of cells whilst ensuring the counting of most visible cells within each stack. One sample projection was then counted manually using the cell counter plugin of ImageJ, to serve as a guide in the development of the CellProfiler pipeline. All orthogonal projections were processed using the same CellProfiler pipeline with set parameters to ensure consistent data collection.</p><p>The images were loaded into this CellProfiler pipeline and the three channels (CTb, eGFP and NeuN) were separated from each other. NeuN- and CTb-stained neurons were identified as primary objects using the two-class Otsu method as a global thresholding strategy, whilst eGFP-containing objects were identified using the adaptive thresholding strategy (with an adaptive window of 50 pixels). NeuN stained cells were distinguished from the background based on their intensity, whereas the method used for detecting CTb and eGFP-positive cells was based on their shape. The NeuN objects were converted into a binary (black and white) image and the coexpression of eGFP or CTb was assessed. The object counts of eGFP/NeuN, CTb/NeuN, eGFP/CTb/NeuN, and NeuN-positive objects were then extracted and exported to a spreadsheet.</p><p>To determine whether serotonergic neurons were labeled using modified rabies virus tracing, eGFP-labeled neurons in the hindbrain were identified and immunostained against TPH2. These were scanned on a Zeiss 710 LSM confocal microscope, either as a short stack through the cell body, or as a single optical section through the center of the neuron. Scan settings were determined by the fluorescent intensity of the surrounding TPH2 immunoreactive regions in the NRM and lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) and were kept consistent for all experiments. Cell identities were catalogued and TPH2 immunoreactivity was determined for all sampled cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Slice preparation and electrophysiology</title><p>Hindbrain slices were prepared from Tph2-Cre animals that had received a bilateral injection of AAV9.flex.tdTomato into the ventral hindbrain. Animals were aged 3–6 weeks at the time of injection and were prepared for electrophysiological recordings 1–2 weeks later. Slices were prepared in a similar manner to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pedersen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Animals were decapitated and the brain was rapidly dissected and placed in ice cold oxygenated dissection solution (containing in mM (65 NaCl, 105 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>). The hindbrain was isolated, glued to a block of 2% agarose and installed in a slicing chamber. Transverse slices of hindbrain were cut at 250 μm on a vibrating blade microtome (D.S.K microslicer DTK1000), which were allowed to recover for at least 30 min in oxygenated aCSF at 34 °C prior to recording, containing (in mM) 120 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 5 HEPES, 14.6 glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>), pH 7.35–7.40, osmolarity 305–315 mOsm.</p><p>During recording, slices were perfused with aCSF at a flow rate of 2–3 ml/min. Targeted recordings were taken from tdTomato-expressing neurons using glass microelectrodes filled with a K-gluconate internal solution (containing 130 K-Gluconate, 5 NaCl, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP, 2 biocytin). Whole-cell recordings were acquired using a HEKA EPC10 amplifier with Patchmaster software at a sampling frequency of 20 kHz (HEKA Elektronik). A biophysical characterization of passive and active membrane properties was performed in current and voltage clamp modes, and the access resistance was monitored between recordings using a 10 mV voltage step protocol. Data were excluded if the access resistance changed &gt;30% during recording.</p><p>The relative position of the recorded/labeled neurons in each slice was noted, and slices were fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C at the end of each experiment. Slices were immunoreacted with primary antibodies against tdTOM and TPH2, which were revealed the next day with secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy3 or Alexa 647. Biocytin was revealed with Avidin-Alexa A488 and the position of the filled neurons was assigned to the NRM or the LPGi, which could be determined based on the pattern of TPH2 immunoreactivity in the slice. Cells located outside of these two regions were not analyzed further.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p>For specific DREADD-mediated activation of descending serotonergic pathways, an intersectional approach was used for labeling the lateral hindbrain neurons whereas direct labelling was used to label the medial neurons. Tph2-Cre mice received an intraspinal injection of AAV2retro.flex.FLPo.BFP, and 1 week later received bilateral injections into the ventral hindbrain with AAV1.FRT.hM3Dq.mCherry. Behavioral tests were performed after 10 days incubation time to allow the expression of the viral transgene. Before experiments mice were acclimatized to the behavioral setup for 1 hr in a room maintained at 20–22°C. For the Hargreaves plantar, cold plantar, electronic von Frey, and Rotarod assays, six measurements were taken for each time point and an average of these was reported. All measurements were taken from both hindlimbs of all animals. Alternatively, serotonergic neurons in the medial hindbrain were labelled by injection of AAV8.hsyn.flex.hM3Dq into the NRM (injection coordinates –6, 0, 5.9) and the same behavioral tests were performed with the same experimental design.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hargreaves</title><p>Sensitivity to heat stimuli was assessed with the Hargreaves plantar assay (IITC). Mice were placed on a pre-heated transparent platform set to a temperature of 30 °C, and the withdrawal latencies were recorded using a timed infrared heat source. A resting intensity of 5% and an active intensity of 20% was used for stimulations, and a maximum cutoff time of 32 s was set to avoid tissue damage. On average, naïve animals will withdraw to this stimulation at temperatures between 34 and 36°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cold plantar assay</title><p>Mice were placed on a 5 mm borosilicate glass platform and were stimulated from beneath with dry ice pellets. The time taken to withdraw the paw was measured using a stopclock and a maximum stimulation time of 20 s was used to avoid tissue damage.

Animals were adapted on a mesh surface, and the plantar surface of each paw was stimulated with a bendable plastic filament attached to a pressure sensitive probe.

The barrel rotated from 4 to 40 rpm over a period of 300 s, and increased speed constantly throughout each experiment. Values were discarded if the animal jumped from the barrel, and if the animal jumped in &gt;50% of trials for a given time point these data were discarded from the experiment. Two training sessions were given for all animals prior to the experiment being started to ensure a stable performance in the absence of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Drug application</title><p>For DREADD activation experiments, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 2 mg/kg, Enzo life sciences, product number BML-NS105-0025) or vehicle controls were injected intraperitoneally, with the experimenter being blinded to the injected substance. Animals were tested directly before and 1–3 hr following i.p. injection.

To test whether any differences observed in the behavioral assays were sex-specific, groups were divided into male and female cohorts and the male and female post-vehicle and post-CNO latencies and thresholds were compared using multiple t-tests with Holm-Sidak correction. In control experiments in which CNO or vehicle were injected in the absence of hM3Dq, a two tailed paired t-test was performed to detect differences between withdrawal latencies and thresholds post-vehicle and post-CNO injection. Statistical significance was taken as p&lt;0.05.</p><p>To compare membrane properties between medial and lateral serotonergic neurons, a normal distribution in values was assumed and an unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to test for differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data collection, storage, and presentation</title><p>Data obtained from the quantification of images were collected and processed in Microsoft Excel and were presented using GraphPad Prism 5.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Susan M Dymecki (Reviewer #2); Andrew Todd (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. General concerns that should be addressed:</p><p>What the authors consider nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) should be clarified (e.g. Bregma levels). The presented tissue sections appear fairly caudal and will include multiple subtypes of serotonergic neurons, one of which may innervate the dorsal spinal cord and another that innervates the ventral spinal cord motor centers and likely influences motor gain. The more caudal, the greater enrichment for the latter subtype. It is likely that multiple functionally distinct subtypes of serotonergic neurons are being manipulated in the hM3Dq experiments targeting the presumed NRM. This should be considered, and published work in this area should be referenced. This is particularly relevant because if the presumed NRM injections are too caudal, most of the midline serotonergic cells would be those projecting to the ventral (not dorsal) horn and indeed this is what is seen in Figure 4.</p><p>The authors did not study sex differences although such differences are well-documented in serotonin signaling and pain perception. Sex differences should be addressed.</p><p>Additional control experiments that document the extent of the spread of the virus from the site of injection should be done.</p><p>It is not clear whether the projections are different between lamina I and lamina II, or whether these vary along the rostrocaudal axis. Since distinct spinal cord lamina is innervated differentially by specific subtypes of peripheral neurons – the authors should consider co-labeling descending neuronal projections with known laminar and DRG subtype markers or comment on this.</p><p>2. Detailed concerns as they relate to the figures and text that should be addressed:</p><p>Figure 1 and Table 5:</p><p>This figure and table, while interesting, are tangential to the narrative and overall claims of the paper and thus might better serve the manuscript as a supplemental figure rather than the lead figure.</p><p>As well, the conclusions drawn from this figure and table might be recast for stronger alignment with the data. It is concluded that &quot;these data demonstrate that although TPH2-expressing hindbrain neurons can be directly infected with modified rabies viruses, they are largely underrepresented with monosynaptic tracing from the dorsal horn.&quot; While the latter is well supported by the data, the sentence construction suggests that the former direct labeling using SAD.RabiesΔG-eGFP (SAD-G) is effective, however, only a few cells were labeled (15 TPH2+ ventral hindbrain cells across 3 animals were marked using SAD.RabiesΔG-eGFP). Insertion of some caution might be helpful to the reader, perhaps stating that infectivity and/or labeling using SAD.RabiesΔG-eGFP occurs but is low, certainly as compared to CTb.</p><p>Given the differential efficacy of spinally injected AAV2retro.GFP to access LPGI versus NRM, it would be interesting to see if there is a bias for SAD.RabiesΔG-eGFP, yet no information is given as to the location of the few labeled cells summarized in panel C and Table 5. Further, panel B could be helped by including some anatomical landmarks or at least marking the ventral surface and midline.</p><p>– Panel C, y-axis labeling could be clearer, explicitly stating that plotted is the percentage of GFP+ cells that are also TPH2+.</p><p>– D: For the monosynaptic tracing experiment, it is stated that a similar total number of GFP+ cells are labeled in the hindbrain yet lacking are TPH2+ cells. This suggests that another population is captured that is not well represented in the direct labeling. Please clarify.</p><p>Table 5: columns 5 and 6 have the same headings. Presumably, column 6 is to reflect GFP neurons that fail to stain for TPH2. This needs correction.</p><p>Cre activity and presumed functional TVA levels in the desired dorsal horn cells should be demonstrated, as the conclusions around D-F depend on it. Further, the authors could consider performing monosynaptic tracing with AAV-Syn-TVA/G instead of R26-TVA, as this would have broader applicability to the work of many (few seem to use R26-TVA).</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>D-E: An important comparison to the AAV2retro.eGFP data would be the quantification and presentation of CTb+ TPH2+ double-positive cells (like that in panel C but for CTb); as well as the co-injection of AAV2retro.eGFP with CTb, as co-injection can produce unpredicted confounding effects. Very few eGFP+ cells are discernible in the LPGi in the representative image. There are clear eGFP+ cells in the NRM. Can you please explain this discrepancy?</p><p>CTb could have some biases itself. Consider using another non-viral retrograde tracer.</p><p>AAV2retr.eGFP shows preferential infectivity of LPGi-&gt;spinal cord cells versus NRM-&gt;spinal cord cells; the claim of &quot;highly susceptible&quot; versus &quot;resistant&quot; to infection should be modified to better align with the data. 20% of labeled cells are in the NRM (thus not negligible, not really &quot;resistant&quot;), 80% in the LPGi.</p><p>A description of the areas denoted as &quot;Other&quot; is warranted, especially given their inclusion in the cell counts.</p><p>This figure could be supplemental.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>The main narrative of the manuscript seems to start with Figure 3. This figure should have an associated table with actual cell numbers.</p><p>This analysis should be repeated for the specific viruses used in Figures 6 and 7, where it is even more relevant to establish the differential infectivity and efficacy of cell-type-specific expression.</p><p>Some of the references in the Results text don't match up. Specifically on p. 8 &quot;This resulted in TPH2-expressing neurons of the hindbrain being labelled with eGFP, particularly in the LPGi (Figure 2B)&quot;. This should presumably be referring to Figure 3B. And a bit later &quot;…many neurons were labeled in the ipsilateral DRG (Figure 2C)&quot;.

The presented tissue sections appear fairly caudal and will include multiple subtypes of serotonergic neurons, one of which may innervate the dorsal spinal cord and another that innervates the ventral spinal cord motor centers and likely influences motor gain. The more caudal, the greater enrichment for the latter subtype. It is likely that multiple functionally distinct subtypes of serotonergic neurons are being manipulated in the hM3Dq experiments targeting the presumed NRM. This should be considered, as well as published work in this area should be referenced.

We have also altered the wording in the Results section to make it clear that these injections include the NRM, but may extend to medial serotonergic neurons rostral and caudal to the injection site (page 11 line 9, and page 16 line 1).

These results are discussed in the Results section (page 14 line 23, and page 16 line 16).

Lateral serotonergic neurons of the LPGi are the only serotonergic neurons that densely innervate the superficial laminae (I-IIo), whereas the medial serotonergic neurons project to ventral laminae (ventral to the lamina IIi-III border).

Additionally, the viral titre typically achieved with rabies virus production is far lower than those that can be obtained with AAV production (1E9 vg/ml vs 1E13 vg/ml respectively) We have added text to the discussion to highlight that this is a small sample, the interpretation of which should be approached with caution.</p><p>“However, both direct and transsynaptic rabies labelling were far less sensitive than the CTb or AAV2retro tracing, making interpretation of these findings complicated due to the comparatively small sample sizes” (page 21 line 9).</p><p>However, we conclude that the overall interpretation that serotonergic neurons are not reliably labelled with transsynaptic tracing is correct, since almost half of the labelled RVM neurons contained TPH2 in the direct labelling experiments whereas virtually none were labelled with the transsynaptic tracing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the differential efficacy of spinally injected AAV2retro.GFP to access LPGI versus NRM, it would be interesting to see if there is a bias for SAD.RabiesΔG-eGFP, yet no information is given as to the location of the few labeled cells summarized in panel C and Table 5.

There is presumably an increased efficiency in labelling other non-serotonergic neurons in the transsynaptic tracing, although besides the fact that they do not express TPH2 we cannot say much more about the identity of these neurons.

We agree that the injection of AAV-Syn-TVA/G would be an interesting experiment more similar to those performed by others. However, in these experiments we wanted a way to visualise the starter cells with a fluorophore (mCherry), to be certain that all GFP+ neurons in the hindbrain were transsynaptically traced from the spinal cord. This meant that we would have had to inject two different helper viruses (owing to the genome capacity of AAVs, it is not possible for TVA, rabies G and a fluorophore to be contained in a single vector) and in our experience, injecting two AAVs can lead to greatly reduced efficiency of one of the viruses.

Further studies of sensory function utilizing intersectional strategies to precisely capture and manipulate the midline populations will help to validate the present findings.” (page 19 line 11)</p><p>However, as this altered behavior was only observed in the von Frey assay, rather than all assays, we are convinced that this is not solely caused by an effect on the motor system and is likely due to a sensory phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>H-I: Quantification of tdTom-5-HT double positive boutons (puncta) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The formal quantification of 5-HT in the boutons would be interesting, however this is challenging due to the difficulty in objectively distinguishing the axon boutons from the rest of the axon.

Without a specific marker for these, it can be difficult to give an unbiased count required for the quantification. However, we feel the quantification of TPH2 at the cell soma (which can be objectively defined by NeuN staining), demonstrates that the majority of the cells labelled are serotonergic (TPH2+), and the images in figure 4 (now figure 3) show that there is an overlap in 5-HT and tdTOM staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of markers in the spinal cord to identify the lamina would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional images from tissues containing labelled axons from the NRM and LPGi labelling experiments, which are immunostained for PKCg and CGRP to label laminae IIi and I-IIo respectively (figure 3 figure supplement 1).

We would be interested in following these up in a separate study. However, we feel that these experiments would be beyond the scope of this manuscript. The main purpose of this study primarily was to compare the anatomical properties and functional roles of lateral vs medial serotonergic hindbrain neurons, and the use of the AAV2retro was the most convenient tool to enable this. As we observed, many of the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of neurons in these areas are very similar, and are less likely to be responsible for the apparent behavioral differences seen between figures 6 and 7 (now figures 5 and 6). We assume that this is more likely a result of the anatomical features, such as soma location and axon termination pattern, which we document in more detail. Additionally, we attempted the suggested retrograde labelling of LPGi neurons for targeted recordings in preliminary experiments, and we generally found very few suitable cells for recording using this approach. We used the anatomical location of the cells in order to get a suitable number of recordings from fewer animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please include the number of animals from which the recordings were derived.</p></disp-quote><p>LPGi recordings from 3 animals</p><p>NRM recordings from 4 animals</p><p>This information has been added to the text in the figure legend for figure 4 and to table 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion here should include other biophysical properties that have been found to distinguish among caudal medullary serotonergic neuron subtypes (chemosensitivity, resting membrane potential, spontaneous spike frequency, response to thermal noxious stimuli, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestions, these are features that should be included in the discussion.

It is likely that multiple functionally distinct subtypes of serotonergic neurons are being manipulated in the hM3Dq experiments targeting the presumed NRM. This should be considered, as well as published work in this area should be referenced.
