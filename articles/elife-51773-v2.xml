scientific research and global political and funding agendas. Malaria models have consistently oversimplified how mass interventions are implemented. Here, we present an individual based, spatially explicit model of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria transmission that includes all the programmatic implementation details of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. We uncover how the impact of MDA campaigns is determined by the interaction between implementation logistics, patterns of human mobility and how transmission risk is distributed over space. Our results indicate that malaria elimination is only realistically achievable in settings with very low prevalence and can be hindered by spatial heterogeneities in risk. In highly mobile populations, accelerating MDA implementation increases likelihood of elimination; if populations are more static, deploying less teams would be cost optimal. We conclude that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in low endemicity areas, specifically when paired with effective vector control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MDA</kwd><kwd>logistics</kwd><kwd>mathematical model</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1110500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saralamba</surname><given-names>Sompob</given-names></name><name><surname>Lubell</surname><given-names>Yoel</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Lisa J</given-names></name><name><surname>Aguas</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1193472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name><name><surname>Aguas</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lubell</surname><given-names>Yoel</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Lisa J</given-names></name><name><surname>Dondorp</surname><given-names>Arjen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The impact of mass intervention campaigns is determined by the interaction between implementation logistics, patterns of human mobility and how transmission risk is distributed over space.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Southeast Asia, and particularly the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS), <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transmission has decreased substantially over the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">World Health Organization, 2010b</xref>), setting the stage for pre-elimination scenarios, with all GMS countries committing to ambitious elimination timelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">World Health Organization, 2013a</xref>). Alignment of global funding bodies’ goodwill with sound national malaria control programmes is crucial for elimination timelines to be met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">World Health Organization, 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso and Tanner, 2013</xref>), but spreading artemisinin resistance creates a race against time before malaria becomes untreatable with currently available drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">World Health Organization, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">World Health Organization, 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Vector control and early diagnosis followed by effective antimalarial treatment have been the mainstay of malaria control programmes, but modelling based projections indicate these approaches alone are unlikely to achieve <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria elimination before failing drug efficacy becomes an issue. Elimination will require more intensive measures to clear the infectious reservoir in asymptomatic populations, especially in the GMS where existing vector bionomics make vector control particularly challenging. The most abundant vector species in the GMS are exophilic (mainly bite outdoors), do not preferentially bite humans, and can bite quite early in the evening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sinka et al., 2011</xref>), rendering typical vector control measures such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) sub-optimal.</p><p>Population wide interventions, including mass drug administration (MDA), are under consideration to clear the infectious reservoir in asymptomatic populations and potentially hasten progress toward elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poirot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">World Health Organization, 2015a</xref>). The proportion of the target population receiving these interventions (‘coverage’) is believed to determine their success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">World Health Organization, 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slater et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuckey et al., 2016</xref>). This success can be considered at two spatial levels: global or local. Whilst malaria elimination campaigns have been carried out successfully in some countries or locally in specific regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">John et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">World Health Organization, 2015b</xref>), reintroductions of malaria from surrounding endemic areas are a constant threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galappaththy et al., 2013</xref>). The importance of mobile populations as a source of malaria transmission in the GMS has been emphasized in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pindolia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pindolia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Whittaker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guyant et al., 2015</xref>). Prompt treatment of new clinical cases through village malaria worker (VMW) or village health worker (VHW) networks has proven to be an effective case management strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maude et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rutta et al., 2012</xref>) and would be an essential barrier against malaria reintroduction.</p><p>We argue that the way in which mass interventions are deployed is what determines their success likelihood. The most efficient and effective roll-outs are laid on a solid community engagement foundation, thus ensuring subsequent adherence and coverage, while preventing malaria reintroduction from adjacent areas. Here, we model target areas as a collection of discrete villages (unit of intervention) and define coverage as the proportion of individuals receiving the intervention within a village and also as proportion of villages receiving the intervention within an area. Critically, we also simulate the minutia of mass intervention roll outs, with all its relevant deployment logistics, thus assigning coverage a temporal dimension which measures the time it takes for all target villages to receive the intervention.</p><p>Conducting enough clinical trials to understand the interaction between all variables at play during a mass drug administration, as well as their individual and combined contribution to the expected outcome, is prohibitive. Hence, we turn to computational modelling to explore the relationships between logistical aspects of MDA implementation and demographic aspects such as human population mobility in diverse epidemiological settings (characterized by prevalence, seasonality patterns and heterogeneity in mosquito densities across space). Our focus in on how the predicted impact of mass intervention strategies on malaria transmission changes when these logistical intricacies are taken into consideration, and its implication for the likelihood of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> elimination. Our research questions are threefold: 1) what is the relevance of logistical implementation details to the outcome of mass interventions? 2) How fast does target coverage need to be reached for the strategy to be successful? 3) What are the key modulators of malaria elimination likelihood in a short timeframe? To offer strategic guidance to national malaria control programmes we also need to understand how the answers to these questions hinge on key features of malaria transmission in specific areas such as artemisinin resistance levels, population mobility networks, transmission heterogeneity over space, and seasonality patterns.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Model description</title><p>We developed a modular simulation platform that is customizable to any malaria transmission setting to provide realistic outcome predictions for local and global level interventions. The modules are the building blocks of an individual based, discrete time, spatially explicit, stochastic model, with explicit mosquito population dynamics and human population movements. We thus have villages with different mosquito densities connected by a human flow network, on which different interventions are deployed at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We refrained from plotting the data error bars here, since the plot is already quite busy. We simulate a targeted MDA strategy in all similar to the one carried out in the aforementioned study, with a prevalence survey carried out in the year prior to MDA start and another exactly 12 months (M12) after the fist MDA round. The prevalence surveys consist of sampling 50 random individuals from each village and assessing the prevalence assuming a diagnostic sensitivity of 85%. For each village, only the runs in which that village was selected for MDA (having a baseline prevalence over 5%) are used to calculate the mean prevalence at baseline and month 12. Note that these are not meant to be the same villages. The modelled villages are synthetic villages with no relation to or input from the original dataset. The only commonality is that the modelled mean prevalence at baseline in the entire population (also including villages that do not receive MDA) is the same as that in the data (~5%).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51773-fig1-figsupp6-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Whilst previously published models are extremely good at representing the biological processes underlying malaria transmission, some even making very realistic assumptions on how coverage increases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nikolov et al., 2016</xref>), they fail to explicitly model how these interventions are carried out in the field. In practice, teams of workers visit villages sequentially one by one, usually spending 4–7 days to deploy one MDA round in each village, which is quite different from having an unlimited number of teams slowly treating everyone in the target population until a certain coverage is reached. The number of implementation teams is then an input parameter in our simulation platform and each team behaves as an agent. They remain in each village for a fixed period of time (<italic>process = 4 days</italic>), assumed to be the time needed to complete one round of MDA per village, and move to the next village according to a gravity model. Given a total number of villages <italic>V</italic>, and a processing time <italic>process</italic>, the total number of days taken from start of first MDA round in the first village to end of first MDA round in the final village (D) depends on the number of implementing teams (Teams): D = <italic>V</italic>*process/Teams.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Initially, we simulated thousands of parameter sets that explore how a wide range of key transmission parameters (e.g. mean initial parasite prevalence, proportion of artemisinin resistant parasites) and logistical constraints – <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> – modulate the expected outcome of MDA campaigns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the sensitivity of the predicted proportional decrease in prevalence over 5 years to each parameter. Clearly, the number of MDA campaigns and the initial mean prevalence across all villages are critical covariates when predicting MDA outcome. The distributions characterizing how malaria risk is distributed over space also seem quite important. Artemisinin resistance spread is very sensitive to those same covariates as well as to the number of intervention teams and the intensity of human population mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Multivariate sensitivity analysis of the predicted intervention impact on malaria prevalence and artemisinin resistance.</title><p>The box plots show the median and interquartile ranges of the proportional reduction in malaria prevalence for all simulated parameter sets.

Deploying a higher number of MDA teams will yield a higher likelihood of reaching malaria elimination within 2 years, only when population mobility is high – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Using a smaller number of intervention teams is predicted to be advantageous in a population of lower mobility, especially when there is only one annual transmission peak and when the MDA start is delayed to day 60 (instead of the default start at the beginning of the calendar year). In settings with 2 malaria seasons per year, the first transmission peak occurs earlier in the year, making the faster 400 team implementation a better option in general. The only exceptions are very static populations in which two MDA campaigns are deployed. We should note that overall, a slower implementation is preferable, especially for the single peak seasonal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the two peak scenarios, a higher number of teams would be beneficial as prevalence increases from 1%. When addressing how to maximize the chances of reaching elimination within a short time span by implementing an MDA strategy, we found that different transmission heterogeneity distributions (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) incur quite different prospects – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (Normal), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (Log-Normal), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> (Pareto). The likelihood of reaching elimination is strikingly different when comparing the Pareto distribution (most skewed) with the other two (Normal and Log-Normal distributions), except when an extremely efficient vector control program is carried out for a couple of years. Coupling vector control with an MDA campaign vastly improves the chances for elimination across the low prevalence settings explored here, and the longer vector control can be sustained the more likely elimination becomes. Once again, there seems to be a correlation between population mobility and number of MDA teams, with faster MDA implementations being preferred when the human population is more mobile – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Intervention implementation speed in different epidemiological contexts.</title><p>Demonstrates under what conditions using 400 implementation teams is preferable over 15 teams when deploying an MDA campaign.

For very efficacious vector control strategies, the vectorial capacity in the transmission foci will be greatly reduced, causing a greater drop in mean vectorial capacity across all villages in the more skewed distribution (where most villages have negligible numbers or no mosquitoes), compared to the others. This causes the likelihood of elimination in settings with a Pareto distributed risk of infection to be greater on the long-term under those circumstances.

Mapping MDA campaign expected outcomes to a specific malaria endemic setting is a complex multivariate problem. Here, we elucidate the way in which the most critical interactions determine MDA success:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Operational strategy design. Mass intervention strategies rely on a detailed protocol defining the proportion of villages targeted, the target population in each village reached (usually termed target coverage), and the number of intervention teams deployed (determining the speed with which all villages are covered). Unsurprisingly, the chosen number of MDA campaigns is the most significant intervention outcome determinant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is intuitive in a scenario where treatment failure due to drug resistance is not a serious issue. Assuming 80% of the target population receives each MDA round, and independent coverage between rounds (meaning the likelihood that someone adheres to round 3 for example is independent of their uptake in rounds 1 and 2), by increasing the number of MDA rounds, we are decreasing the proportion of the population not treated with at least one round of ACT. Even if adherence and compliance are correlated, increasing the number of rounds would assure individuals that received treatment would be less likely to become infectious, or be infectious for long, if infected via untreated individuals. Indeed, additional MDA rounds provide a powerful tool to disrupt any resurgence in transmission following the typical 3 round MDA campaigns. The likelihood of elimination being achieved is substantially higher for 2 campaigns of 3 MDA rounds compared to 1 campaign (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Transmission heterogeneity, described by different mosquito density distributions over space, and initial mean parasite prevalence in the human population also have a clear impact on the predicted reduction in prevalence with MDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Of note, MDA strategies on their own are not predicted to achieve elimination unless mean malaria prevalence is at very low levels (under 3%) – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Coverage speed, increased with a higher number of intervention teams, is programmatically beneficial only when elimination is achievable (prevalence &lt;3%) and in scenarios where MDA is deployed in well-connected populations (consisting of individuals with high mobility) – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Counterintuitively, in all other scenarios, a slower MDA implementation is optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). When the number of MDA teams is highest, all villages receive the first round within a couple of weeks, meaning a very large proportion of the population will be under treatment simultaneously. Whilst that translates into the largest possible increase in the likelihood of elimination, any resistant infections will have a large selective advantage at that point, causing resistance to spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Interestingly, this effect is less pronounced in populations with high mobility, due to a dilution effect described below. A slower deployment of MDA campaigns is then generally preferable in low mobility populations (here defined as settings where individuals spend on average less than 25 nights per year somewhere other than their home) due to a slower buildup of resistant infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interestingly, prioritizing the very first villages to receive MDA will have very little effect on the MDA campaign’s success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is solely due to the spatial dispersal of transmission foci. In a setting where transmission foci are scattered over space (as simulated here), not much can be gained by prioritizing high incidence villages to receive MDA fist, since once the intervention teams leave those villages, transmission will be re-seeded from lower incidence neighboring villages or forest areas. In fact, if there is only one seasonal peak and only one MDA campaign is carried out, staring in lower incidence villages is predicted to incur a statistically non-significant benefit. Note that in areas where foci are clustered in a small area, a targeted MDA approach would be preferable over a global MDA, with villages outside the foci area not receiving MDA.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Transmission topology. This is defined by the magnitude of transmission heterogeneity over space combined with the level of mixture between sub-populations through human movement. As mentioned above, spatial transmission heterogeneity has a dramatic effect on predicted outcomes, with more skewed distributions (suggesting most malaria infections occur in a few villages) presenting a challenge for control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We should note that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) has been reported to be spatially heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gryseels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erhart et al., 2005</xref>). However, there is very little evidence as to the relative abundance of the main vector species and no quantification of densities exists at a large enough scale, thus we investigated a spectrum of population mobility patterns which at one extreme consists of a set of isolated transmission foci (thus low population movement), where infections in each village are almost exclusively locally acquired (mosquitoes infecting someone will have had acquired that infection from someone else living in the same village). As population mobility increases, these foci become more and more connected, eventually merging with each other in the upper extreme of the spectrum, onto one large homogeneously mixed population (where mosquitoes infecting a person could have acquired that infection from anyone else).</p></list-item><list-item><p>In low connectivity populations (consisting of individuals with low mobility), the likelihood of resurgence in villages where MDA achieved local elimination is low, since there are only very sporadic introductions of parasites, typically insufficient to reseed endogenous transmission. In these settings, implementation speed should be sacrificed, and a low number of intervention teams deployed, to minimize resistance spread. In populations with high population movement, speed of implementation becomes more important (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) due to the propensity for recently eliminated intervention units to be reseeded by its neighbors, leading to local resurgences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Seasonality. The optimal timing of MDA campaigns relative to malaria seasonal peaks have been theoretically investigated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brady et al. (2017)</xref>. Critically, those models do not incorporate implementation logistics in a detailed manner, either simulating instantaneous MDA deployment in all villages, or having a synchronously increasing global coverage until a target coverage is reached. Here, we have explicit intervention teams that deploy sequential MDAs, one village at a time. This is much closer to reality in the field and creates an added dimension when comparing MDA start with malaria seasonal peaks. A very slow implementation that starts 3 months prior to the peak might only have reached a 50% coverage by the time transmission intensity hits the peak, whereas a very fast MDA deployment might start 1 month prior to the peak and end before it.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When there is only one transmission peak during the year, a slower MDA implementation seems to be preferable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), especially if the start of the MDA is set to start one month prior to the peak in vectorial capacity (not to be mistaken with the season malaria incidence peak which occurs later) instead of starting at the beginning of the year. It seems delaying the start of MDA campaigns improves the likelihood of malaria elimination compared to a start at the beginning of the year when a lower number of MDA teams is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is mostly due to how sensitive near instantaneous MDA campaigns are to the timing of the seasonal peak. In a single annual peak setting, where the incidence peak is at day 140, a near instantaneous MDA would end (all 3 rounds) 70 (for no delay) or 10 (with delay) days prior to the peak. Given the general cosine function simulated here, it seems a longer implementation lasting the whole duration of the high transmission season is optimal. For the two annual peaks scenario, a fast implementation of MDA (covering the whole of the first annual peak) seems preferable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dilution. We uncovered an interesting trade-off between population mobility, transmission heterogeneity and number of MDA teams that results in unexpectedly high predictions for intervention impact in highly mobile populations. This is due to a diluting effect, rooted in the sharing of parasite pools between high transmission foci and very low transmission villages, which is particularly relevant in the post MDA rebound period. Granted high population mobility, after the parasite pool is greatly reduced through MDA, the few infectious mosquitoes in transmission foci are likely to bite migrants, which upon return to low transmission villages, are unlikely to transmit those infections onwards. Increased mobility decreases the proportion of endogenous infections in each village, which consequently increases the radial impact of local interventions, thus also generally contributing to the dilution of artemisinin resistant emerging infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). In a scenario where village A with an extremely low vectorial capacity is very close to a high transmission village B and there is intense population movement between villages, it is likely that infections in people living in village A are almost exclusively acquired when they visit village B. Thus, an MDA in village B will have a positive knock-on effect on the incidence of malaria in village A.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Drug Resistance. We observe that increased transmission heterogeneity is detrimental to intervention success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), through a mechanism whereby high transmission foci provide a niche for resistance spread which is promoted by drug pressure incurred through multiple MDA rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, this effect is more pronounced for populations with the lowest mobility for all considered spatial heterogeneity distributions. This is due to the dilution effect mentioned above, causing artemisinin resistant parasites expanding in high transmission foci to be diluted across other villages, given a sufficiently high population movement. If the population is very static, however, resistant parasites can gradually outcompete sensitive ones in transmission foci receiving multiple MDA rounds. Drug resistance is also a key driver of why more heterogeneous topologies are predicted to have a lower MDA impact for low mobility populations (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, any concerns regarding the enhancement of artemisinin resistance spread with MDA hinge on the transmission heterogeneity of the setting in which MDA is deployed. This entails serious consequences for the likelihood of malaria elimination with an MDA approach in populations where resistance is already established.</p></list-item></list><p>Although the elucidation of these intricate relationships is of great scientific interest, National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) might find this exploration to be devoid of applicability, specifically those concerned with drug resistance issues. We have demonstrated that more MDA rounds translate into higher likelihoods of malaria elimination but also show how resistance is very likely to increase dramatically if elimination is not achieved. To explicitly inform policy decisions of NMCPs aiming to eliminate <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in a short time frame, we provide insights into integrated strategies that combine vector control interventions with a minimal number of MDA rounds:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Intervention layering and elimination prospects. While MDA strategies consisting of only 3 rounds of ACT are unlikely to interrupt transmission in all but very low prevalence (&lt;2% all-age true prevalence) settings, the village malaria worker (VMW) network providing operation support to MDA campaigns does provide a great foundation for additional interventions to be more easily deployed. Combining a complete VMW network with 3 rounds of MDA at 80% coverage and imperfect vector control strategies, we predict malaria elimination can be reached, provided the initial parasite prevalence is sufficiently low (under ~2%) – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Whilst vector control clearly provides a significant increase in the chances of reaching elimination, it would be unlikely to lead to elimination on its own as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. More than a theoretical possibility, elimination, even when in the presence of artemisinin resistance, has been demonstrated to be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lwin et al., 2015</xref>). This bistability phenomenon, first proposed for malaria a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguas et al., 2008</xref>) and since revisited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), provides the theoretical foundation for the determination of the minimum intervention effort sustained over a defined period of time, after which all intervention measures can be relaxed and elimination is still reached (provided clinical case management remains effective). We thus explored the prospects for elimination with realistic intervention packages coupling vector control with MDAs using our simulation platform – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We find that initial mean prevalence is a key determinant of success likelihood and determines the minimum effect size required from the vector control component, for elimination to be reached. We highlight how logistical constraints combine with human movement patterns to modulate the likelihood of an intervention strategy’s success. Clearly, when population mobility is high, elimination becomes likely even with low vector control effect sizes, if MDA is done near instantaneously (400 intervention teams). A much higher vector control effect size would be required if MDA implementation is significantly slower. Conversely, if the human population is static, a slower MDA implementation would increase the likelihood of elimination for the same vector control effect sizes. This illustrates quite well the value of the missing information in simulation models that convert the highly complex logistics of a global MDA administration into an instantaneous process.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Targeting interventions. Over the last few years, MDA interventions have moved towards a focal approach, where only a proportion of individuals within a village (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eisele et al., 2015</xref>), or a proportion of villages in the target area will receive treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">METF, 2016</xref>), to ease drug resistance spread concerns, and to minimize the number of ACT doses given to uninfected individuals. The purpose is to implement MDAs in high transmission foci only, thus bringing mean prevalence across the whole population down very quickly, and then relying on good clinical case management and vector control interventions to eventually reach elimination. The logistical implementation is also simplified, and its associated costs minimized, since only a fraction of MDAs are performed. We explored the likelihood of reaching malaria elimination within 5 years by implementing a targeted elimination program combining 3 rounds of MDA with different vector control intensities and found that the duration and effect size of the vector control component greatly influences the prospects for elimination. Interestingly, increasing the target size (number of villages receiving the intervention), minimizes the differences across transmission heterogeneities. In fact, the most skewed distribution offers better elimination prospects for higher prevalence settings where intense vector control measures (VC efficacy = 0.9) are put in place. The nature of the distribution provides the basis for this effect. Given that most villages have a negligible vectorial capacity, transmission is sustained by a few high transmission foci. If those are targeted efficiently, you can expect to have a disproportionately higher disruption of transmission compared to settings where the distribution of mosquitoes over space is more homogeneous.</p></list-item></list><p>We have refrained from doing a cost-effectiveness analysis, since we do not have enough information on most unit costs, which are currently being assessed in different settings, and are likely to be quite variable across countries in the GMS. Any recommendation and cost-effectiveness analysis would have to be tailored to each specific country/area. We also have not extensively addressed synchronous migration patterns but have included long term and seasonal migration events in the simulation platform. The sensitivity of the model’s predictions to these types of migration is much lower than to the general population’s short-term mobility actions explored to great lengths throughout. This is, in all likelihood, a result of the low proportion of seasonal or long-term migrants in the overall population. In settings where migrants constitute a more considerable (&gt;20%) fraction of the population, the predicted impact might vary. We also considered an uncorrelated uptake of ACT rounds during MDA, meaning there is no relationship between the likelihood of receiving a future ACT round and having received a previous one. This can be an issue in areas where religious and/or cultural beliefs cause individuals to refuse any and all drug treatments, but if that is the case, then it would manifest itself at the time of the prevalence survey, when blood would have to be drawn. In practice, we concede that we may be unable to deploy MDA in whole villages due to these constraints, but in the absence of data we refrain from making any assumptions. For simplicity, we have assumed that asymptomatic and clinical infections are equally infective to mosquitoes throughout. In reality, further empirical studies are greatly needed to better characterise this controversial quantity that bears critical consequences for malaria elimination prospects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguas et al., 2018</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> we demonstrate this critical nature, with malaria elimination becoming more amenable if asymptomatic infections are less infectious. To keep the mosquito population comparable to that in all other simulations shown here, we leverage the biting rate in simulations with lower infectivity of asymptomatic infection to obtain comparable prevalence levels. That means that for a given prevalence value, we took the mosquito density in previous simulations and calibrate the biting rate (proxy for effective number of human/mosquito contacts) needed to obtain the same prevalence at equilibrium when infectivity is lowered. Since the overall infectiousness of asymptomatic infections is decreased, the biting rate will have to increase to reach the same level of prevalence. Therefore, the infection pool will be sustained in a smaller population of mosquitoes which bite humans more frequently to make up for the decrease in human to mosquito infection efficiency. We can then conclude that the true catalyst of malaria elimination is the crash of the infectious population of mosquitoes after MDA, rather than a complete elimination of infections in the human population.</p><p>Here, we present a theoretical exploration of the potential impact of MDA strategies in different settings of the GMS, with special emphasis on the sensitivity of the predicted impact to logistical constraints, and transmission or population topologies. The ranges of parameters and distributions explored are meant to represent the current malaria situation in the GMS but need to be adjusted for application to specific areas/countries. In conclusion, we propose that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in the right context. The model presented here predicts that an MDA’s success likelihood is bounded by the initial malaria prevalence and we elucidate how those chances can be improved through tailoring of implementation logistics. Although MDA is being revisited by the global community, very little attention has been paid to implementation logistics, and there seems to be no protocol adjustment across settings with completely different seasonality and human mobility patters, thus risking a sub-optimal MDA outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We developed an individual based, discrete time, spatially explicit, stochastic model, with mosquito population dynamics and human population movement. The flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> describes the natural history of malaria infection in the human population. Details of how the dynamics of malaria transmission, human mobility and interventions are simulated are provided in the simulation protocol section below. All model parameters are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> along with their respective references when applicable. The simulated synthetic population mimics the demographics of a set of 1000 villages in SE Asia, with the distribution of villages over space, village sizes and age distribution of people likely not applicable to African settings. They should be generic enough to give a fair representation of rural settings in SE Asia. The parameter exploration presented here provides the limits of plausibility in terms of how people are expected to move, the levels of drug resistance and malaria prevalence, and how spatially heterogeneous transmission is.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>List of parameters used in the model.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th> #</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Value</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> 1</td><td><italic>V</italic></td><td>Set of villages</td><td>|<italic>V</italic>| = 1000</td><td/></tr><tr><td> 2</td><td><italic>N</italic></td><td>Set of individuals across all villages</td><td>|<italic>N</italic>| = 314,795</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 3</td><td><italic>ml</italic></td><td>Proportion of males in the population</td><td>0.48</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">National Institute of Statistics, 2008</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td> 4</td><td><italic>maxage</italic></td><td>Maximum age</td><td>80 years</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 5</td><td><italic>beta</italic></td><td>Biting rate</td><td>variable<sup>*</sup></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 6</td><td><italic>previ</italic></td><td>Initial proportion of infectious people</td><td>variable<sup>*</sup></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 7</td><td><italic>resit</italic></td><td>Initial proportion of artemisinin resistant infections</td><td>variable<sup>*</sup></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 8</td><td><italic>netuse</italic></td><td>Proportion of individuals that own an insecticide treated bed net</td><td>0.5</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 9</td><td><italic>itneffect</italic></td><td>proportional decrease of individual susceptibility/infectiousness related to ITN usage</td><td>0.2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 10</td><td><italic>ovstay</italic></td><td>Mean number of nights spent somewhere when undertaking short-term population movement</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 11</td><td><italic>crit</italic></td><td>Critical distance below which overnight stays somewhere other than your home are made very unlikely</td><td>4 km</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 12</td><td><italic>timecomp</italic></td><td>Mean time to complete ACT routine treatment</td><td>4 days</td><td>Best guess</td></tr><tr><td> 13</td><td><italic>fullcourse</italic></td><td>Proportion that receives treatment full course</td><td>0.8</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td> 14</td><td><italic>covab</italic></td><td>Proportion of symptomatic cases that receive antimalarials</td><td>0.6</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td> 15</td><td><italic>nomp</italic></td><td>Relative probability of receiving treatment in a non-malaria post village</td><td>0.1</td><td>Best guess</td></tr><tr><td> 16</td><td><italic>asymtreat</italic></td><td>Relative probability of receiving treatment without clinical symptom</td><td>10<sup>−4</sup></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 17</td><td><italic>tauab</italic></td><td>Daily probability of receiving ACT in a village under MDA</td><td>1/1.5</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td> 18</td><td><italic>gamma</italic></td><td>Mean liver stage duration</td><td>5 days</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Jeffery, 1999</xref>;

We assume villages are transmission units that encapsulate the village itself and the surrounding farms/forest areas. Whilst clearly a simplification of reality, we know that mosquitoes can easily cover the distance between village and proximal farms over the course of a single day, and most SE-Asian vector species engage in late afternoon biting (some even having a near flat biting rate throughout the day). Given that people tend to move freely within their village during those hours we can reasonably assume that all humans in one village can potentially be bitten by any one mosquito in that village. Having villages as both the transmission and intervention units is obviously computationally convenient, since all model processes related to transmission and intervention can then be evaluated at the same scale.</p><p>Malaria transmission in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) has been reported to be spatially heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gryseels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erhart et al., 2005</xref>). However, there is very little evidence as to the relative abundance of the main vector species and no quantification of densities exists at a large enough scale. Given the lack of data to inform the discrepancies in mosquito densities across different villages, we chose to explore three mosquito density distributions (<italic>Mn</italic>, <italic>Ml</italic>, and <italic>Mp</italic>). Two of those distributions represent extreme scenarios: one in which all villages have approximately the same biting rate (Gaussian distribution); another where the vast majority has very low biting rates with a few hotspots (Pareto).

The mosquito biting rate calibration was performed for each combination of transmission heterogeneity distribution, population mobility intensity and malaria mean prevalence. Thus, for each population mobility and mosquito density distribution, hundreds of model runs were performed until the desired mean malaria prevalence was reached with a specific mosquito biting rate within the first 5 years of simulation.</p><p>Population movement patterns and their importance for infectious disease transmission and emergence has recently garnered a lot of increased scientific interest, with new tools and analysis frameworks being developed for mobility inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tatem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tatem et al., 2009</xref>). Whilst census data and mobile phone data can help in proposing a connectivity network for a given region, the lack of general precision in questionnaires and the relative difficulty in capturing a lot of outside home overnight stays in mobile phone records, begs for a new source of data to resolve transmission relevant mobility patterns. Spatially explicit malaria models have in so far used gravity models to describe population movement, which is supported by some data (notably, daytime travel data). Whilst we agree that a gravity model can be the most appropriate to describe some seasonal and long-term migration patterns, we argue that overnight stays a very short distance from your home are generally unlikely. It is more likely for someone to return home for the night if they are within a certain critical distance threshold (<italic>crit</italic>) in km, instead of staying overnight somewhere else. We thus consider that daily population flow (<italic>FL_short</italic>) between villages <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> is best characterised by a modified gravity model given by:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>FL<sub>ij</sub></italic> refers to the daily population flow of a standard gravity model<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>pop</italic> refers to village population size, and <italic>dist</italic> to the Euclidean distance (in km) between villages <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>.</p><p>The frequency of general population’s short-term movements (very small number of nights spent somewhere other than their own village at a time) is given by the overall population mobility parameter – <italic>mobility –</italic> which is explored at length in the main text and assumes 2 extreme values (5 and 250 nights spent somewhere other than the home village, per year). The population is further partitioned into temporary (seasonal) or long-term migrant groups. Seasonal migration can only occur during a 3 month period. This roughly corresponds to the duration of crop seasons, at which time people typically go back to their village of origin to help their families harvest crops or for other economic/personal reasons. After 3 months they return to larger villages or surrounding cities following <italic>FL<sub>ij</sub></italic>. Long-term migrants only move between a priori defined (at random) economic hubs, comprising 2% of the target villages, spending an average of 6 months in each before moving to the next. For simplicity, we only explore the effects of short-term movements throughout this paper, excluding seasonal and long-term migration events from the simulations presented here. We should note that the sensitivity of the model’s predictions to seasonal and long-term migration is much lower than to the general population short-term movements explored to great lengths throughout this paper. We simulate malaria elimination strategies composed of MDA, a village malaria worker (VMW) network for improved case management, and an annual bed net distribution program. Villages are given an MDA of one full course (3 monthly rounds) of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) plus one dose of primaquine, irrespective of their illness or infection status. Logistically, intervention teams sweep through all villages and give out ACTs without any prior screening, staying for a given number of days and then moving on to the next village. The details of how implementation logistics were incorporated into the simulation protocol can be found in the Simulation Protocol below.</p><p>When exploring the factors driving MDA outcome prediction, we explored all possible combinations of parameter values presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, comprising 3888 sets of parameters. The model was run 100 times for each parameter set.</p><p>We also explored the layering of further intervention efforts on top of a global MDA initiative (with 3 ACT rounds), such as the implementation of indoor residual spraying (IRS) or larvicidal deployment, for example. Vector control effect size can be modelled as a reduction in vectorial capacity or EIR, as a direct consequence of a decrease in life expectancy, increase in sporogony cycle length and/or decreased biting rate on humans. Depending on what vector control measure one considers and how the mosquito life cycle is modelled, there might be interest in detailing the impact of a vector control intervention on a particular aspect of the mosquito life cycle. That is beyond the scope of what is intended in this paper, and we present vector control effect size as a measure of how much vectorial capacity is decreased when vector control interventions are in place. Thus, a transmission reduction efficacy of 0.10 means that the implemented vector control strategy reduces the number of infectious bites per person per year by 10%. Whilst MDA is programmatically well defined, with a specific number of ACT rounds being deployed, it is less clear how vector control strategies are sustained over time. Thus, we ran simulations for a range of vector control efficacy/duration of intervention pairs and evaluated the proportion of simulations in which elimination is reached.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Simulation protocol</title><p>In this section, we give detailed description of the agent-based malaria simulation model results from which were discussed in the main text.

The intervention’s outcome or effectiveness can then be derived from a direct comparison between the integral of the control scenario and that of the intervention scenario over the same time period. Throughout the manuscript we present simulations for settings of a specific malaria prevalence. That value is the mean malaria prevalence over the last year of a 200 year run of a control scenario. To calibrate model runs to a specific prevalence we vary a free parameter <italic>beta</italic> [5], the mosquito biting rate, whilst keeping all other parameters fixed.</p><p>From the end of each successful calibration run to a given prevalence, we extract individual level information to inform the age, immunity level, number of cumulative infections, and infection status of each individual. This information forms a human input file used for model initialisation in the runs where intervention is simulated. The calibrated vectorial capacity distributions used in the calibrated runs are added to a village input file containing village location and population size and is also used for model initialisation.</p><p>More specifically, the following processes are involved in setting up the human population and village properties at the start of the 200 year prevalence calibration runs:</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Human properties</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Gender and age</title><p>Age and gender information of human agents are generated according to parameterised distributions.

This is essentially due to the extremely fast timeframes of life events in mosquitoes compared to humans. The mosquito infection prevalence reaches equilibrium in a matter of days and thus its initialisation to non-zero values bears a negligible benefit. We use a free parameter <italic>beta</italic> [5], the mosquito biting rate, to calibrate each simulation to the desired malaria prevalence. Biting rates are calibrated for each combination of mobility, transmission distribution, and prevalence to ensure the system is at equilibrium.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model initialisation</title><p>The developed malaria micro-simulation platform takes inputs from two CSV-formatted input files and a JSON-formatted configuration file. The two input files provide the model with a list of villages and a list of humans respectively. Each row in these files describes the properties (as listed in the previous section) of either a village or a human agent. Model-wide and process-specific, as opposed to agent-specific, parameters are given by the configuration file. Most parameters specified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> of the main text are associated with processes and functions (rather than individual agents), and therefore are given by the configuration file. In this section, we use the numbers in square brackets to refer to the associated parameter number whose description and value can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>The initialisation process starts by processing the configuration file where the location of the input files is stored. Then a list of village agents and a list of human agents are created according to information given in the input files. Human agents are randomly assigned a home village from a list of all possible villages. Once all agents have been created, the software initialises the parameterised functions of the model using the information given in the rest of the configuration file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Implementation of malaria relevant dynamics</title><p>Once initialisation finishes, the main body of the model simulation starts. We assume time zero to be the 1<sup>st</sup> of January 5 years prior to the first malaria post establishment/MDA initiation.</p><p>The simulation protocols detailed in this section illustrate the flow of events and processes taking place each day. Each process has a daily probability of occurrence. For each individual and for every simulated daily time step, a uniform random number is drawn between 0 and 1 for each possible and valid (according to the individual’s status) transition process (e.g. whether the individual dies, is infected, is treated, etc) associated with that individual. The transition process occurs if and only if the number drawn is lower than its daily probability of occurrence. Note that not all events are valid to an individual given its status on a given day. For instance, a clinical resolution event is not valid to an individual until that individual develops clinical symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Human population dynamics</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Birth and death</title><p>The age profile presented here are taken from Cambodia census data. When we initialize individuals in the model and assign them a random age given the age frequencies in the data (through representative sampling), and run that model for 200 years, whilst assuming that individuals have a life expectancy of 1/mu, we end up with a different age profile from the one we started with. That means an adjustment in life expectancy is needed to reflect differences in mortality rates across ages. To that end, we fit the data age profile to an 8<sup>th</sup> order polynomial function, which we normalised to obtain representation weights for each age, <italic>w(a)</italic>.

Notably, the distribution of village population sizes and the shape of Euclidean distance network used to determine human population mobility are informed by data from the Thai-Myanmar border, whilst the age profile is extracted from the Cambodian population census. The population demographics simulated here should be generic enough to give a fair representation of rural settings in SE Asia but are not necessarily applicable to African settings.</p><p>To ensure the simulation platform produces outcomes that represent reasonable falciparum malaria transmission dynamics, we performed several model calibrations using malaria metadata. By doing so, we safeguard the generalizability of the results presented in the paper as well as the applicability of the model to any specific setting moving forward.

To do so we use a dataset of immunity markers collected in 4 Cambodian sites, that describes seroconversion rates over time and extrapolates age profiles of clinical immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2012</xref>). It is important to define what measured immunity means in this context. The data presents percent positivity of each collected specimen (hence single individual) as that defined by a cut-off of the mean optical density of the seronegative population plus three standard deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corran et al., 2008</xref>). More importantly, this refers to measured MSP-1<sub>19</sub> antibodies which have demonstrated a significant association with a decrease in clinical falciparum malaria incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fowkes et al., 2010</xref>), and display a very strong linear correlation with EIR (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.78) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corran et al., 2007</xref>). Critically, a 15% reduction in symptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> per doubling of antibody levels was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fowkes et al., 2010</xref>), thus painting a picture of piecemeal acquisition of clinical immunity over age, and explaining the quasi-linear relationship with EIR. We take the seroconversion rates reported in this paper as the probability of immune positivity and translate that into a probability function governing the likelihood that a newly infected person of a given age will eventually develop clinical symptoms and thus account for a new clinical malaria case. We then calibrate our model to the prevalence metrics reported for each setting and output the age, number of cumulative infections and immunity level of each person at the last timestep of the model.

Note that the Pareto distribution for vector density across villages (blue dots) replicates the observed prevalence variance for a fixed EIR value much better than the Gaussian equivalent (red dots).</p><p>We opted to plot a point per village for each simulation, to try to reproduce the variance observed in the real data, instead of plotting a single median prevalence value per EIR. This enables us to explore how the relationship between EIR and prevalence can be modulated by factors such as the existence of a village malaria worker, or proximity to a high/low incidence village.</p><p>The third calibration assessed the relationship between <italic>Pf</italic> prevalence and clinical case incidence. This calibration is done to the subset of SE-Asian datapoints contained in the dataset published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patil et al. (2009)</xref> and assumes the same relationship between true and measured prevalence as stated above. The incidence reported here is interpreted as the number of people with a febrile illness testing positive for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> independently of aetiology. We thus include a term (<italic>asymtreat</italic> [16]) to describe the proportion of malaria asymptomatic infections in the model outcome that might test <italic>Pf</italic> positive and have a concurrent fever of another aetiology, to adjust the model to the data. Here we present a calibrated model output assuming <italic>asymtreat</italic> = 10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The fourth model calibration is done in the absence of data, since we don’t have access to a sufficiently detailed dataset to inform the relationship between age and prevalence in SE-Asia. Instead, we present the patterns generated by our model and compare them with outputs from other models where a rigorous fitting procedure to such data was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffin et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> summarises how clinical cases are distributed across 4 age ranges according to prevalence.</p><p>Lastly, to assess the realism of the MDA implementations simulated throughout, we compare the predicted model outcomes after MDA, with those obtained in the MDA trials performed in the Thai-Myanmar border. We extracted the data on baseline and post MDA prevalence from a supplementary figure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Landier et al. (2018)</xref>. The model comparators are medians and percentiles of the prevalence in specific villages across one hundred simulations. The model was set up such that MDA would be done focally, that is, only villages with a prevalence over a certain threshold (5%) were eligible to receive an MDA. As per the trial protocol, during the year prior to MDA programme rollout, all 1000 villages were surveyed to establish a baseline prevalence. These surveys consisted of sampling 50 individuals from each village and perform a uPCR to determine their infection status. Here we assume that uPCR can detect 85% of all infections. Once a list of villages eligible to receive MDA is compiled, the model proceeds to compile a schedule for each village to be visited by an intervention team. This process is repeated 100 times, and for each village only the runs in which that village was selected for MDA are used to calculate the summary statistics. A comparison of the model’s output with the empirical trial is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

The authors especially emphasize the following aspects as previously underexplored or unexplored in other theoretical and model-based MDA studies: the role of gradual implementation of MDA due to realistic logistical constraints of finite MDA teams and how drug resistance affects optimal choice of implementation options. Other factors such as initial prevalence, interaction of MDA with other interventions such as case management and vector control, and timing relative to the transmission season are also considered here as they have been considered by a diverse set of other models. In all, this work has the potential to inform policymaking towards malaria elimination in specific areas.</p><p>Title:</p><p>Except for well-recognized acronyms and abbreviations, technical terms must be spelled out in manuscript titles. Every acronym must be spelled out at the first instance it is used. Once introduced, it may be used throughout. This rule applies to the Abstract and main text independently. Do not introduce an acronym or abbreviation if it will not be used again (Abstract and main text considered independently). An acronym must represent a minimum of three words.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Issues related to the model formulation:</p><p>The authors' conclusions on speed of implementation and role of resistance in determining optimal implementation strategy are rather subtle points. At the same time, I believe this is a previously unpublished model and thus its introduction in the literature should also contain a rigorous demonstration of its ability to recapture field data, particularly epidemiological data. While there are plots in the supplemental material that show model outputs around some basic epidemiological quantities (incidence by age and prevalence, for example), I did not see any comparison with field data, which is surprising since the authors are close collaborators with excellent field researchers specializing in malaria in Southeast Asia. Absent these basic comparisons with field and clinical data, it is difficult to assess whether the model's structure and parametrization adequately capture key phenomena to the point that claims around speed of malaria resurgence after MDA, and response of wild type and resistance infections to drug treatments (and thus selection pressure on these parasites) are to be believed.</p><p>In addition, there appears to have been a lost opportunity to further capture actual malaria transmission and historical MDA implementation in this set of villages. While the authors consider 3 possible distributions of transmission intensity across their village population, it would also be helpful to parameterize each village's transmission intensity based on field data collected in these villages, or at least to compare the actual distribution against the 3 modelled options (especially since outcomes were somewhat dependent on the nature of this distribution). Similarly, it is unclear to what extent the modelled MDA implementation (selection of random villages to begin, then moving MDA teams to adjacent untreated villages) resembles the actual implementation of the MDA in Karen State. As a naïve outsider I would guess that teams perhaps started in villages at one end of the area and worked their way together toward the other end (?), which seems logistically simpler for supply chain and transportation. Since this paper is about making models of interventions more operationally realistic, it would be great to include even more realism.</p><p>Questions on model structure and parameterization:</p><p>I'm curious about the decision not to model non-infected, non-infectious mosquitoes and how that could affect model outcomes, particularly around vector control effect size.</p><p>On immunity, my understanding is that individual acquire immunity to clinical symptoms but no other kind of immunity, such as to high-density asexual infections. Thus, the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals is identical. Is this an accurate assumption?</p><p>Similarly, the parameterization of symptomatic and asymptomatic infectiousness as equal is curious and seems to contradict some field data. Can the authors point to evidence that this is a reasonable choice for their setting?</p><p>The authors mention a 5-year initialization phase of their model and that to begin with, there is no immunity in the population. Looking at Figure 1—figure supplement 2, middle panel, it doesn't look to me like 5 years of initialization is sufficient to reach an equilibrated population immunity structure.</p><p>Case management rate in villages with malaria posts (0.6) seems low. I believe in many SE Asian villages, a clear reduction in malaria incidence is observable after the introduction of malaria posts, suggesting they have a considerable effect on reducing transmission. Does this also happen on the same timescale in the model, with case management rate as low as 0.6?</p><p>2) Issues related to interpretation:</p><p>My main comment is that the results presented did not quite show what is stated in the Abstract: &quot;We conclude that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in the right context, specifically when paired with effective vector control&quot; because:</p><p>a) It overstates the impact of MDA given that the probability of malaria elimination is extremely small unless done in a very low transmission setting</p><p>b) To justify this conclusion, the authors need to show a slightly different outcome – the 'increase in probability of elimination when MDA is carried out'. I.e. there is the issue that in many models the probability of stochastic elimination of the parasite without any interventions is significant in low transmission areas. So, the absolute probability of elimination in the presence of MDA is not that informative, it's better to know the increase in probability. The authors need to check the probability of elimination without MDA in their model and present those results in comparison to simulations in which MDA is included, which I believe is achievable within the timeframe of the journal's revision process.</p><p>Another key point is that although the authors nicely include variation in exposure to malaria across different villages, it's well quantified that this variation exists also within a village and has a strong effect on R0 and elimination probability – was this included in the model? (e.g. see Goncalves 2018 <italic>eLife:</italic> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357976 and Woolhouse 1997 PNAS: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8990210). It would be relatively straightforward to put this into an individual based model, by setting the force of infection to have a distribution around the mean, instead of being the same for each individual.</p><p>As a general comment the labelling of figures needs tightening up – e.g. lines, abbreviations, units on the axes are often not clearly defined (see below for specific comments). Ideally these should be understandable without going back to the main text and Materials and methods. It would be a shame if the interesting messages of the analysis did not get through because of being hard to interpret. Also, the model parameters need more justification and documentation in places (immunity, age structure, relative infectiousness of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections). It would be hard to reproduce the model from the description, although the code is provided. Some though not all of these could impact the MDA results.</p><p>3) Section-specific concerns:</p><p>The Abstract and Introduction read as if the paper is extremely general. Most of the time malaria, not a specific species, is discussed. In the second paragraph of the Introduction, falciparum is mentioned and many of the parameters seem to relate to falciparum. Furthermore, in the fifth paragraph the authors state that the &quot;modular simulation platform that is customizable to any malaria transmission setting&quot; but then in the Materials and methods first paragraph &quot;likely not applicable to Africa.&quot;</p><p>Inconsistent terminology makes the results unclear.</p><p>– MDA rounds refer to two things in the paper. Results first paragraph, it seems &quot;MDA rounds&quot; means MDA campaigns. This occurs again in the Discussion second paragraph. At other times in the same paragraph, what appears to be campaigns are referred to as sets, as in this case sets of rounds are discussed. Is MDA rounds here related to campaigns or the 3 standard rounds of implementation.</p><p>– Results paragraph one, how does Figure 2—figure supplement 5 relate to artemisinin spread. Further, what is &quot;outcome&quot; in this figure? It is not clear from the text or caption.</p><p>– Results paragraph two, how is &quot;a more static population&quot; defined? Mobility is not well defined in the main text. A brief description is finally given in the second paragraph of the Discussion. Furthermore, mobility is described both as a fraction and as a decimal, which makes it difficult to compare across figures. How does connectivity relate to mobility? How does &quot;well-connected&quot; relate to mobility? Discussion paragraph four, does &quot;low connectivity&quot; mean low mobility?</p><p>– Results paragraph two, what constitutes &quot;little difference&quot;? Many of the curves in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 seem to be separated.</p><p>– In the same paragraph what are the &quot;transmission heterogeneity distributions&quot;? later in the paragraph &quot;the other two&quot; are mentioned but not named. They are not described anywhere clearly. Figure 4 is referenced here as a comparison between distributions but only uses a single distribution.</p><p>– At the end of paragraph two, how is the &quot;significant correlation&quot; measured? There appear to be no statistical tests mentioned.</p><p>– Results paragraph three, how has vector control &quot;greatly improved&quot;? Is this measured? Visually they appear similar.</p><p>– Discussion paragraph two, how are the mentioned factors a distant second and third? Where is this quantified?</p><p>– How is a slower MDA implementation optimal? The solid line often appears to exceed the dashed line.</p><p>More information is needed in the Materials and methods.</p><p>– In paragraph seven mobility is briefly defined but referred to the main text, where there is not a good description. How are the nights chosen in the simulation? How does seasonal and long-term migration occur in the simulation? Does this effect the biting rate in places?</p><p>– In subsection “Simulation Protocol”, what other co-infecting parasites are considered?</p><p>– What drugs are used?</p><p>– Subsection “Model Initialisation”, do the data describe the initial properties of things like age, transmission status, etc.?</p><p>– Subsection “Model Initialisation” paragraph two, two different implementations of how human agents are assigned is given, which is it?</p><p>– Subsection “Human Properties”, are cumulative number of exposures and immunity level set to 0 for humans of all ages? This seems unrealistic.</p><p>– Subsection “Village Properties” is the calibration of biting rate stable when you introduce mobility and change malaria prevalence?</p><p>– Subsection “Implementation of malaria relevant dynamics”, the implementation is unclear. A random number is drawn to see if there is an event and then random number are drawn to see if there are each of several events. Does this mean that an individual could be infected and treated and die all in the same day? If so, why go through the earlier event draw?</p><p>– Subsection “Human Population Dynamics”, when death happens, are individuals replaced by an infant or by an individual of any age? If the latter, how are their initial properties chosen.</p><p>– Subsection “Human Population Dynamics”, <italic>moi, cml</italic>, and <italic>lvl</italic> are not in Table 2. Could a table be created for parameters that change over time with an individual?</p><p>– Can individuals be infectious immediately with program 1/<italic>sigma</italic>? This seems unrealistic. Why not use a fixed time delay?</p><p>– “Parasite killing rates depend on the person’s transmission status (𝑠), with parasite clearance”, s is not in Table 2. Similar comment to above.</p><p>– “Susceptibility/Infectiousness”, why include <italic>phic</italic> if the value is set to 1 (no increased/decreased relative infectiousness)?</p><p>– Subsection “Mosquito Dynamics – Survival”, it appears these values are inverted.</p><p>– &quot;uncommon for any female to reach multiparity&quot; Is this quantified?</p><p>– How does immunity work? It's not discussed in detail, although some figures pertain to it.</p><p>Figures/Tables are hard to interpret due to missing information.</p><p>– Figure 1: In A what are <italic>σ, ε,</italic> and <italic>ω</italic>? In C, what are the immunity levels? Is 1 higher or lower than 4?</p><p>– Figure 2: x-axis is not labeled.</p><p>– Figure 3: Lots of things are varied but none are mentioned in the caption.</p><p>– Figure 4: What is varied is not evident from the caption, nor is the distribution apparent.</p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1: Why cut off the distribution prior to 80 if that is the max?</p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 2: What is &quot;mean immunity level&quot;? Why does it go up and down with age?</p><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 1: The size of the dots makes it hard to tell how far the lines go.</p><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 2: What is outcome here?</p><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 3: What is outcome here?</p><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 5: What is outcome here?</p><p>– Table 2: What does variable mean for parameters such as <italic>beta, previ, resit, vcefficacy</italic>? Can these be listed somewhere?</p><p>– Table 2: Parameter 37 – 50 are never mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Not all MDAs should be created equal-determinants of MDA impact and designing MDAs towards malaria elimination&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

These seem to be justified in the response to the reviewer but not clearly in the manuscript.</p><p>Attempt to capture realistic operational conditions, given that the paper is about the impact of actual operational conditions on MDA outcome. The MDA distribution structure and its implication on the authors' results are still not clear. The authors are adamant that they are not attempting to model an actual MDA distribution, but it seems that randomly selecting starting villages with which to seed MDA teams is unlikely to be how MDA is actually implemented, and potentially there are interactions between the spatial pattern of MDA implementation and the role of migration in MDA outcome. The authors must either show that their method of random selection of starting villages is how someone has operationalized MDA, or that a more operationally realistic village visitation order does not impact their findings.</p><p>Infectivity: it is true that there is much that we do not understand quantitatively about infectivity/infectiousness. However, the simplifying assumption that all infected individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic, have the same infectivity seems a little strong, especially since the authors note that changing <italic>phic</italic> does impact the effectiveness of MDA. Might it not also impact how the outcome of the MDA depends on the logistical, demographic, and transmission factors explored in this paper?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51773.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title:</p><p>Except for well-recognized acronyms and abbreviations, technical terms must be spelled out in manuscript titles.

We have extended the Simulation Protocol by including a very extensive model calibration section.

At no point do we mention this model is a model of MDA implementation in Karen State. In fact, we purposefully kept the setting generic, even mentioning the age profile was adapted from the Cambodian census, and that the demographics modelled here are typical of a rural SE Asian setting, but not necessarily an African one. We do not use any data from Karen State to parameterise the version of the model presented here, apart from mean household size and relative Euclidean distance between villages. We are working on a separate paper where the model presented here is fitted to Karen State data and will re-create the exact timing of MDA in each of the villages. Here, we had to develop a sophisticated graph traversal algorithm to design a schedule for MDA in each village which minimised time travelled from a given starting village. We have made a few changes in the manuscript to hopefully made it clearer that the work enclosed here explores the relationships between logistical aspects of MDA delivery and population mobility in settings of varying transmission dynamics (characterised by prevalence, seasonality patterns and heterogeneity in risk across space).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Questions on model structure and parameterization:</p><p>I’m curious about the decision not to model non-infected, non-infectious mosquitoes and how that could affect model outcomes, particularly around vector control effect size.</p></disp-quote><p>Vector control effect size can be modelled as a reduction in vectorial capacity or EIR, as a direct consequence of a decrease in life expectancy, increase in sporogony cycle length and/or decreased biting rate on humans. Depending on what vector control measure one considers and how mosquito life cycles are modelled, there might be interest in detailing the impact of a vector control intervention on a particular aspect of the mosquito life cycle. That is beyond the scope of what is intended in this paper, and we present vector control effect size as a measure of how much vectorial capacity is decrease when a vector control intervention is in place. Given how we implemented the human/mosquito interface it is then straightforward that inclusion of susceptible mosquitoes is not necessary. Given a vectorial capacity, the number of new mosquito bites landing on humans per time step can be calculated. These bites are then allocated to adult mosquitoes which will be tracked over time as individual agents. This bears tremendous computational efficiency. We are currently preparing a technical paper for submission focusing exclusively on how this methodology performs compared to a typical ODE model and a full IBM model for the mosquito population both including susceptible mosquitoes as well. As the reviewer might appreciate that is in itself a lengthy standalone paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On immunity, my understanding is that individual acquire immunity to clinical symptoms but no other kind of immunity, such as to high-density asexual infections. Thus, the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals is identical. Is this an accurate assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>We need to make a distinction between infectivity and infectiousness. Infectivity is the probability that an infectious person transmits its infection to a mosquito upon a single bite. Infectiousness is the overall transmissibility of one malaria infection over the course of the time during which the infected person is infective to mosquitoes. We believe the reviewer is referring to infectivity in this context. Since we do not track human parasite densities, we must make some simplifying assumptions. We recently published a paper stressing the need for further empirical studies to better characterise this critical but very controversial quantity (Aguas et al., 2018). There is a pervasive conflation in the literature of how asexual parasitaemia levels correlate with infectivity to mosquitoes, since the parasite forms which are actually transmitted to the mosquito are much harder to measure and hardly ever modelled. In fact, parasite densities seem fluctuate considerably over time as a consequence of the interplay between antigenic variation and corresponding host immune responses. In one study, the proportion of total parasite density comprising gametocytes was shown to be markedly age dependent (Ouedraogo et al., Malar. J. 2010; 9:281), suggesting that the proportion of gametocyte positive individuals without detectable concomitant asexual parasitaemia increases with age. Another study shows that gametocyte density can be larger in asymptomatic individuals than in some symptomatic patients (Gouagna et al. Parasitology 2004; 128:235–243). This last study also reported increased infectivity of asymptomatic gametocyte carriers not correlated with gametocyte densities, suggesting other factors such as gametocyte maturity and/or human blood factors might influence their infectivity. This might help explain why high gametocytes densities do not necessarily result in mosquito infections (Bousema et al. PLoS One 2012; 7, Schneider et al. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2007; 76:470–474). The paper concludes that: “The relative infectivity of chronic infections has severe consequences for malaria elimination prospects. Reliable estimates to inform that parameter will require longitudinal follow-up studies of sufficient duration in both clinical and chronic infections, with serial mosquito-feeding assays. Although we appreciate the time-consuming efforts involved and the significant logistical burden (specifically on the insectary) required to perform such a study, we consider those concerns to be greatly outweighed by the dramatic expected impact on malaria elimination policy.”</p><p>To avoid getting into this controversy here, we have kept <italic>phi<sub>a</sub></italic>=1.

However, we should add that assuming <italic>phi<sub>a</sub></italic>=1 is not a conservative assumption, but rather a functional one. As explored in (Aguas et al., 2018,), higher values of <italic>phi<sub>a</sub></italic> make the dynamics more amenable to control through mass scale drug-centric approaches, whereas for lower values of <italic>phi<sub>a</sub></italic>, maximising clinical case management has a disproportionate impact whilst MDA style approaches are less effective. As this is already published, we opted to increase computational efficiency. Keeping in mind that our objective is not to accurately quantify the chances for malaria elimination in a single setting, but rather explore how the predicted outcome of MDA campaigns differs depending on several logistical, demographic and transmission factors; we chose the value of <italic>phi<sub>a</sub></italic>that would decrease the amount of simulations needed to run for such comparisons to become possible. We have now included some more text in the Simulation Protocol to justify this choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mention a 5-year initialization phase of their model and that to begin with, there is no immunity in the population. Looking at Figure 1—figure supplement 2, middle panel, it doesn’t look to me like 5 years of initialization is sufficient to reach an equilibrated population immunity structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for inadvertently raising confusion.

I believe in many SE Asian villages, a clear reduction in malaria incidence is observable after the introduction of malaria posts, suggesting they have a considerable effect on reducing transmission. Does this also happen on the same timescale in the model, with case management rate as low as 0.6?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a coverage of 60% is far from optimal, however it was the reported coverage in a very comprehensive study designed specifically to evaluate access to treatment in remote areas covered by the Cambodian village malaria worker network and/or malaria outreach teams (Yeung et al., 2008). Nevertheless, in Cambodia, the Thai-Myanmar border and other areas of Myanmar there has been a substantial decrease in incidence over the past 5 years, mostly due to better clinical case management. The model presented here does predict a substantial effect size on prevalence when village malaria posts are open for this low of a coverage value (~20% decrease for starting prevalence of 5%), but more work is needed to disentangle the true effect size of the malaria post network from the data itself.</p><p>The settings adopting this strategy had concurrent interventions, do not have rigorous estimates for village population sizes, and cannot account for treatment seeking behaviours in the private sector (even in remote areas of the GMS one can usually find a private chemist). As mentioned before, we are working hard to fit a version of the model presented here to incidence data in the Thai-Myanmar border which might lead to a better understanding of these processes through estimation of treatment seeking related parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Issues related to interpretation:</p><p>My main comment is that the results presented did not quite show what is stated in the Abstract: “We conclude that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in the right context, specifically when paired with effective vector control” because:</p><p>a) It overstates the impact of MDA given that the probability of malaria elimination is extremely small unless done in a very low transmission setting.</p></disp-quote><p>We were cautious to include the safeguard “in the right context” to assuage the previous qualification. The answer to the next point might satisfy the reviewer that MDA is a requirement for elimination to be reached in such a short time scale even in very low prevalence settings. Nonetheless, we have made it much clearer in the manuscript that elimination is predicted to be very unlikely in all but very low transmission settings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) To justify this conclusion, the authors need to show a slightly different outcome – the ‘increase in probability of elimination when MDA is carried out’. I.e. there is the issue that in many models the probability of stochastic elimination of the parasite without any interventions is significant in low transmission areas. So the absolute probability of elimination in the presence of MDA is not that informative, it’s better to know the increase in probability. The authors need to check the probability of elimination without MDA in their model and present those results in comparison to simulations in which MDA is included, which I believe is achievable within the timeframe of the journal’s revision process.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and have performed the suggested simulations. The results are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 3. It is strikingly clear that although a significant reduction in prevalence can be achieve with the 5-year time frame, elimination without MDA is incredibly unlikely. In fact, none of the 100 runs for each parameter set resulted in elimination. Thus, the previously presented value is the increase in probability, since the probability is zero for vector control only. These effects had been previously explored by us in (Aguas et al., 2018) and can be modulated by <italic>phi<sub>a</sub></italic>and changes in baseline treatment rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another key point is that although the authors nicely include variation in exposure to malaria across different villages, it’s well quantified that this variation exists also within a village and has a strong effect on R0 and elimination probability – was this included in the model? (e.g. see Goncalves 2018 eLife https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357976 and Woolhouse 1997 PNAS https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8990210). It would be relatively straightforward to put this into an individual based model, by setting the force of infection to have a distribution around the mean, instead of being the same for each individual.</p></disp-quote><p>This is one of the aspects that was not addressed in the original submission but gained prominence as we detailed the model calibration process. We have indeed incorporated different distributions to describe differential biting “attractiveness”, i.e., describing how mosquito bites are distributed across the human population. Given the model calibration to the EIR vs. prevalence metadata, we kept with a Gaussian distribution, with mean 1 and standard deviation of 0.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a general comment the labelling of figures needs tightening up – e.g. lines, abbreviations, units on the axes are often not clearly defined (see below for specific comments). Ideally these should be understandable without going back to the main text and Materials and methods. It would be a shame if the interesting messages of the analysis did not get through because of being hard to interpret. Also, the model parameters need more justification and documentation in places (immunity, age structure, relative infectiousness of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections). It would be hard to reproduce the model from the description, although the code is provided. Some though not all of these could impact the MDA results.</p></disp-quote><p>See detailed rebuttal to specific comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Section-specific concerns:</p><p>The Abstract and Introduction read as if the paper is extremely general. Most of the time malaria, not a specific species, is discussed. In the second paragraph of the Introduction, falciparum is mentioned and many of the parameters seem to relate to falciparum. Furthermore, in the fifth paragraph the authors state that the &quot;modular simulation platform that is customizable to any malaria transmission setting&quot; but then in the Materials and methods first paragraph &quot;likely not applicable to Africa.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the species we are referring to here should have been more at the forefront. We have hopefully rectified that in the revised manuscript. As for the second comment, we don’t see where a conflict exists and what is the source of confusion. The simulation platform is modular (functions can be removed and added without loss of function) and can be customised to any transmission setting. Because in this case we chose to customise it to SE-Asian settings (as further documented in the Materials and methods section) we cautioned against immediate applicability to African settings. By no means does that suppose we cannot customise the model to African settings and re-run the simulations presented here, but it is not in the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inconsistent terminology makes the results unclear.</p><p>– MDA rounds refer to two things in the paper. Results first paragraph, it seems &quot;MDA rounds&quot; means MDA campaigns. This occurs again in the Discussion second paragraph. At other times in the same paragraph, what appears to be campaigns are referred to as sets, as in this case sets of rounds are discussed. Is MDA rounds here related to campaigns or the 3 standard rounds of implementation.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve corrected the main text at these given locations by replacing “rounds” and “set” with “campaign(s)” where referring to 3 rounds of MDA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results paragraph one, how does Figure 2—figure supplement 5 relate to artemisinin spread. Further, what is &quot;outcome&quot; in this figure? It is not clear from the text or caption.</p></disp-quote><p>Outcome in this figure is proportional reduction in artemisinin resistance prevalence. Whilst is mentioned in the text, not having it in the legend was a glaring omission. Thank you for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results paragraph two, how is &quot;a more static population&quot; defined? Mobility is not well defined in the main text. A brief description is finally given in the second paragraph of the Discussion. Furthermore, mobility is described both as a fraction and as a decimal, which makes it difficult to compare across figures. How does connectivity relate to mobility? How does &quot;well-connected&quot; relate to mobility? Discussion paragraph four, does &quot;low connectivity&quot; mean low mobility?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a more detailed description on the definition of mobility values to Table 1 which would help the reader in interpreting the concept of mobility from early in the paper. Table 1 which is introduced to the reader at the beginning of the Results section gives an overall introduction to all the parameters varied in our simulations. We reworded “a more static population” to “a population of lower mobility” to avoid possible confusions. However, it should be clear that when individuals are highly mobile, villages become more connected, possibly sharing infection reservoirs. Surely, if there is no movement between two villages one could say they are not connected; and if there is a lot of population movement across two villages, those villages would be more connected. For consistency, we reworded these two lines to “…in well-connected populations (consisting of individuals with high mobility)…” and “…In low connectivity populations (consisting of individuals with low mobility) …” to avoid possible confusions to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results paragraph two, what constitutes &quot;little difference&quot;? Many of the curves in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 seem to be separated.</p></disp-quote><p>What we meant to convey was that even though the line in Figure 3 usually takes positive values early on, at year 10, it is either not very positive or visibly negative. In hindsight we acknowledge that it might have the opposite effect of what is intended and generate more confusion. We have removed that comparative argument from the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the same paragraph what are the &quot;transmission heterogeneity distributions&quot;? later in the paragraph &quot;the other two&quot; are mentioned but not named. They are not described anywhere clearly. Figure 4 is referenced here as a comparison between distributions but only uses a single distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the word “transmission heterogeneity distribution” to Table 1 to help the reader locate the definition and pointed to the distributions plotted in Figure 1. “the other two” refers to “Normal and Log-Normal distributions” and this should now be clear in the main text. We reworded the sentence to “Figure 4 (Normal), Figure 4 supplement 1 (Log-Normal), and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (Pareto)” to help direct the reader to the relevant figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– At the end of paragraph two, how is the &quot;significant correlation&quot; measured? There appear to be no statistical tests mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>This was not rigorously quantified. We have changed the wording to “…there seems to be a correlation between…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results paragraph three, how has vector control &quot;greatly improved&quot;? Is this measured? Visually they appear similar.</p></disp-quote><p>There seems to be some confusion here. The sentence states “…sustaining vector control for longer greatly improves…”. If we look at the figure mentioned at the end of that sentence, we see that the length of vector control period appears as the X-axis, and clearly has a major effect on the probability of elimination being reached. In some panels its effect goes as far as increasing the likelihood from 0 to over 90% for a fixed value of vector control efficacy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion paragraph two, how are the mentioned factors a distant second and third? Where is this quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>This was quantified through univariate sensitivity analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) which we chose not to present so as to not introduce too much entropy and focus primarily on the multivariate analysis in Figure 2. We have re-phrased this section of text to highlight that there are 3 variables the model is quite sensitive to, without quantifying the level of sensitivity. The sensitivity analyses already included as Figures 2—figure supplements 1-3 show how that sensitivity is manifested and how the different variables interact to produce an expected reduction in prevalence.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51773-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How is a slower MDA implementation optimal? The solid line often appears to exceed the dashed line.</p></disp-quote><p>This is in direct juxtaposition with the statement in the previous sentence, where the conditions for a higher number of teams to be beneficial are presented.

Table 1 now also directs the reader to the Mobility section in the Simulation Protocol which explains how short-term movements are simulated. We also detail how the probability of an individual sleeping some place other than their house is evaluated on a daily basis, and its consequences for local transmission. Although different migration patterns are possible in our simulation platform, we clearly state that the scenarios contained here only include short-term movement of people. We should stress that the sensitivity of the model’s predictions to seasonal and long-term migration is much lower than to the general population short-term movement explored to great lengths throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In subsection “Simulation Protocol”, what other co-infecting parasites are considered?</p></disp-quote><p>The framework is extremely flexible so as to explore multi-species dynamics.

In our simulations, biting rates are calibrated for each combination of mobility, heterogeneity distribution, and prevalence to ensure system stability. We’ve added this clarification to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Implementation of malaria relevant dynamics”, the implementation is unclear. A random number is drawn to see if there is an event and then random number are drawn to see if there are each of several events. Does this mean that an individual could be infected and treated and die all in the same day? If so, why go through the earlier event draw?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, multiple events may happen to an individual on the same day. However, not all events are possible/valid to an individual given its status on a given day. For instance, a clinical resolution event or a treatment seeking is not valid to an individual until that individual develops clinical symptoms. For each individual, only events valid for its status are checked for occurrence. We’ve modified the text in this section accordingly. This is an outstanding question in these types of discrete time event simulation models, and we have been trying to develop optimisation methods to minimise the number of events evaluated per time step.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Human Population Dynamics”, when death happens, are individuals replaced by an infant or by an individual of any age?

Parameters that change over time with an individual are given in that properties list.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can individuals be infectious immediately with program 1/sigma? This seems unrealistic. Why not use a fixed time delay?</p></disp-quote><p>Not right after a new infection has been acquired. Once an infection has entered an individual’s system, the intrinsic incubation process is scheduled to happen first. Once the infection has cleared the incubation process, its daily probability of becoming infectious is 1/<italic>sigma</italic>. However, only one of the three processes (1. acquisition of new infection, 2. incubation of the infection in the liver, 3. gametocytaemia) involved in the development of parasites in a human host may happen on a given day. A crucial part of the development and implementation process of the model was to benchmark the behaviour of each modular function, specifically by outputting the number of days it takes for specific human properties to change.</p><p>Fixed time delays can certainly be incorporated into our simulation platform. We conducted a brief comparison between the two methods and concluded that there are no significant qualitative differences in the results. We plan to integrate time delays to some of the model processes in future developments of our model so that a more formal comparison may be made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– “Parasite killing rates depend on the person’s transmission status (s), with parasite clearance”, s is not in Table 2. Similar comment to above.</p></disp-quote><p>Transmission status is listed as a Human property. It is denoted <italic>s</italic> here for the convenience of the equation. We’ve added some texts to further explain its meaning and relation to variables (37-50) in Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– “Susceptibility/Infectiousness”, why include phic if the value is set to 1 (no increased/decreased relative infectiousness)?</p></disp-quote><p>Because its malleability is already implemented in the code. It is there so that this parameter can be informed by measures of gametocytaemia, rather than having a static number that is identical across all individuals. Unfortunately, we have not yet had the chance to calibrate this with an adequate dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Mosquito Dynamics – Survival”, it appears these values are inverted.</p></disp-quote><p>Well spotted, thank you.

We changed the text to: “Their adult survivorship is quite limited though, making it uncommon for any female to reach multiparity with only 26% of female mosquitoes having more than one infection at the time of death. That number drops to ~14% for values of prevalence amenable to elimination.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How does immunity work? It's not discussed in detail, although some figures pertain to it.</p></disp-quote><p>“Immunity” is described as clinical immunity, i.e., protection against development of clinical symptoms, rather than a protection against infection.

The MDA distribution structure and its implication on the authors' results are still not clear. The authors are adamant that they are not attempting to model an actual MDA distribution, but it seems that randomly selecting starting villages with which to seed MDA teams is unlikely to be how MDA is actually implemented, and potentially there are interactions between the spatial pattern of MDA implementation and the role of migration in MDA outcome. The authors must either show that their method of random selection of starting villages is how someone has operationalized MDA, or that a more operationally realistic village visitation order does not impact their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Apart from targeted MDA strategies, where only a select few villages (selected according to some transmission metric) are to receive MDA, all other MDA strategies minimise the logistical entropy and will start in places where the logistical chains are more appropriate. This usually means radially from the control programmes’ headquarters. Since this is a synthetic population it seems appropriate to pick random locations. The assumption that a “strategic” MDA would obviously be better is baseless, since it is critically dependent on where the foci of transmission are. If they are heavily clustered over space then that could be something to consider, usually in a targeted MDA approach. In a full MDA approach where several foci can be scattered over space, random starting points should not be detrimental. Regardless, we have done thousands more simulations to unequivocally show that the operational MDA path is not a critical driver of success for areas in which foci can be scattered over space. This is now presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Not only do we show that prioritizing high transmission villages for MDA is not better than selecting starting points at random, we also show that it is not superior to prioritizing low transmission villages. Note that if transmission is only occurring in a small area in space, a global MDA would never be an acceptable choice, and any control programme would instead opt for a targeted approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Infectivity: it is true that there is much that we do not understand quantitatively about infectivity/infectiousness. However, the simplifying assumption that all infected individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic, have the same infectivity seems a little strong, especially since the authors note that changing phic does impact the effectiveness of MDA. Might it not also impact how the outcome of the MDA depends on the logistical, demographic, and transmission factors explored in this paper?</p></disp-quote><p>Essentially what the reviewer asked for here is a replica of 75% of all the work we had presented in the paper, with a different value for one of the parameters, which would take months. We opted to do the minimum set of simulations that we believe will satisfactorily resolve this issue and summarise their results in Figure 3—figure supplement 3. Consistently, and unlike models without explicit mosquito populations, when <italic>phia</italic> is low, there is an increased chance of elimination. After an extensive sensitivity analysis, we were able to determine this was solely due to the lower number of infectious sustaining transmission when <italic>phia</italic> is lower. To keep the mosquito population comparable to the simulations performed before, we leverage the biting rate in the associated <italic>phia</italic> simulations to obtain comparable prevalence levels. For a given prevalence value, we took the mosquito density in the <italic>phia</italic> =1 simulations and calibrated the biting rate (proxy for effective number of human/mosquito contacts) we would need when making <italic>phia</italic> = 0.2 to obtain the same prevalence at equilibrium. Since the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections is decreased, the biting rate will have to increase to reach the same level of prevalence. The result of this process is that the infection pool will be sustained in a smaller population of mosquitoes (which bite humans more frequently to make up for the decrease in human to mosquito infection efficiency). Thus, malaria elimination likelihood can be increased for <italic>phia</italic> = 0.2 due to a more likely crash of the population of infectious mosquitoes after MDA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
