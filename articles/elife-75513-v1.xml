Here, we use the stereotypical first division of the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo to test the role of the membrane-associated nucleoporin Ndc1 in coupling NPC assembly to NE formation and growth. 3D-EM tomography of reforming and expanded NEs establishes that Ndc1 determines NPC density. Loss of <italic>ndc1</italic> results in faster turnover of the outer scaffold nucleoporin Nup160 at the NE, providing an explanation for how Ndc1 controls NPC number. NE formation fails in the absence of both Ndc1 and the inner ring component Nup53, suggesting partially redundant roles in NPC assembly. Importantly, upregulation of membrane synthesis restored the slow rate of nuclear growth resulting from loss of <italic>ndc1</italic> but not from loss of <italic>nup53</italic>. Thus, membrane biogenesis can be decoupled from Ndc1-mediated NPC assembly to promote nuclear growth. Together, our data suggest that Ndc1 functions in parallel with Nup53 and membrane biogenesis to control NPC density and nuclear size.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NDC1</kwd><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd><kwd>lipid synthesis</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>Nup107-160 complex</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1846010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mauro</surname><given-names>Michael Sean</given-names></name><name><surname>Celma</surname><given-names>Gunta</given-names></name><name><surname>Bahmanyar</surname><given-names>Shirin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007223-S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mauro</surname><given-names>Michael Sean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bahmanyar</surname><given-names>Shirin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Discovery of how cells couple addition of membranes with insertion of nuclear pore complexes to form and grow the nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nuclear envelope (NE) is a large double-membrane sheet that partitions the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The NE is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which produces the bilayer lipids from which the NE forms and expands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barger et al., 2022</xref>). Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), large multiprotein channels that control the bidirectional traffic of macromolecules across the NE, are embedded at fusion points between the inner and outer nuclear membranes (also known as the pore membrane; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hetzer, 2010</xref>). NPCs are composed of ~30 different proteins (nucleoporins or Nups) that assemble in multiple copies to total ~1000 polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hampoelz et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hampoelz and Baumbach, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin and Hoelz, 2019</xref>). Multiple NPC subcomplexes assemble into an eightfold symmetric core scaffold (the outer ring Nup107-160 complex and the inner ring Nup93 complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kosinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) that surrounds the central channel and is attached to the cytoplasmic filaments and the nuclear basket, which are asymmetrically distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

NPCs disassemble into subcomplexes that then rapidly assemble onto segregated chromosomes as ER-derived membranes form the nuclear rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hetzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay et al., 2021</xref>). Nascent nuclear membranes initially cover the outer edges of chromatin where spindle microtubules (MTs) are less concentrated (ânon-coreâ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu and Pellman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Otsuka and Ellenberg, 2018</xref>). The majority of NPCs assemble at the ânon-coreâ region of reforming NEs. NPC assembly is less pronounced in the âcoreâ region where the NE adaptor for the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), LEMD2/LEM-2, and the ESCRT II-III related protein CHMP-7 accumulates to facilitate severing of spindle MTs with sealing of remaining holes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gatta and Carlton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lusk and Ader, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhen et al., 2021</xref>). Once nuclear transport is established, nuclear import and recruitment of additional membranes promote nuclear growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Levy, 2022</xref>). How NPC assembly is coupled to membrane recruitment is unclear; however, membrane-associated nucleoporins likely play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Magistris and Antonin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Otsuka and Ellenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are three transmembrane-containing nucleoporins in metazoans: gp210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerace et al., 1982</xref>), Ndc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stavru et al., 2006</xref>), and Pom121 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallberg et al., 1993</xref>) as well as several peripheral membrane binding Nups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamed and Antonin, 2021</xref>). gp210 is not ubiquitously expressed and is important for mammalian muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DâAngelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raices et al., 2017</xref>) and breakdown of the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galy et al., 2008</xref>). In mammalian cells, Ndc1 and Pom121 are necessary for NPC biogenesis, possibly through redundant roles in membrane recruitment and NPC anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>). Pom121 has been also shown to be necessary for the interphase pathway of NPC assembly, which requires insertion of NPCs into an intact NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>After open mitosis, the chromatin-associated protein Elys initiates NPC assembly by recruitment of the outer ring scaffold (also known as Y-complex or Nup107/160 complex) onto chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rasala et al., 2006</xref>). The recruitment and assembly of the Nup107/160 complex is an early, essential step in NPC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walther et al., 2003</xref>). In in vitro nuclear assembly reactions in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, ER vesicles containing Ndc1 and Pom121 establish connections between reforming nuclear membranes and the Y-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rasala et al., 2008</xref>). The recruitment of the inner ring component Nup53 (also referred to as Nup35) that is part of the Nup93 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin and Hoelz, 2019</xref>) initiates the assembly of the inner ring complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenhardt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2012</xref>). Nup53 recruits Nup155, which assembles proximal to the pore membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dultz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Magistris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenhardt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hampoelz et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin and Hoelz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2012</xref>). Nup155 and Nup53 interact with Pom121 and Ndc1 and also contain amphipathic helices that insert into membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamed and Antonin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">von Appen et al., 2015</xref>). The interaction between Ndc1 and Nup53 is conserved in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Onischenko et al., 2009</xref>); however, only the interphase pathway of NPC assembly exists in fungi because they undergo a closed mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay et al., 2021</xref>). Some evidence suggests a functional interaction between Ndc1 and Pom121 and members of the Nup107/160 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>), which also include Nups that directly bind to bilayer lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamed and Antonin, 2021</xref>). Thus, there are multiple connections that link the NPC to the pore membrane, yet their precise roles in NPC assembly remain poorly understood.</p><p>In addition to assembly of NPCs on chromatin through ELYS, recruitment of ER membranes with preassembled nucleoporins would effectively couple NPC assembly with nuclear formation and/or expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hampoelz and Baumbach, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay et al., 2021</xref>). Recent evidence in mammalian cells showed that mitotic ER membranes contain partially preassembled nuclear pores that initiate NPC assembly after chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2021</xref>). In support of this, ultrastructural work showed that the NE forms from highly fenestrated ER membrane sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Otsuka et al., 2018</xref>) that could contain some nucleoporins. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, nucleoporin condensates in the cytoplasm form the nuclear pore scaffold in a specialized ER domain called annulate lamellae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hampoelz et al., 2019b</xref>). These annulate lamellae feed NE expansion facilitating NPC insertion with rapid nuclear growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hampoelz et al., 2016</xref>). The molecular link between preassembled nucleoporins and ER membranes is not known but may involve transmembrane-containing Nups.</p><p>Here, we use the stereotypical first division of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos to understand the role of Ndc1 in coupling NPC biogenesis with ER membrane recruitment during nuclear formation and expansion. The stereotypical nuclear events in the first embryonic division make the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo an ideal system to study the direct effects of Ndc1 depletion on the first attempt at nuclear formation and expansion. Furthermore, Pom121 is not present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> providing the opportunity to understand the specific contribution of Ndc1 in NPC biogenesis independent of Pom121. Prior work has shown that Ndc1 is only partially essential in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and impacts NPCs, yet the focus on late-stage embryos made it difficult to parse out direct versus accumulated effects due to multiple rounds of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stavru et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We show that loss of Ndc1 results in small nuclei with reduced NPCs and nuclear import rates in early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos.

Fertilization of the oocyte by haploid sperm initiates two rounds of meiotic chromosome segregation. The sperm chromatin is devoid of a NE at the time of fertilization.

Transport competent pronuclei then expand ~30-fold in volume prior to the onset of nuclear permeabilization in mitosis, which occurs after pronuclear meeting and regression of the pseudocleavage (hereafter known as PC regression), thus providing an assay for measuring nuclear import rates directly following the first attempt at NE formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oegema and Hyman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear import monitored by a GFP reporter fused to a nuclear localization signal (GFP:NLS-LacI, hereafter referred to as GFP:NLS) shows nuclear accumulation of GFP fluorescence throughout the time course of nuclear expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>).

This suggests that Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG may dynamically associate with nascent NPCs. However, growth of nuclei could result in recovery of Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG through feeding of a new pool of membrane-associated Ndc1 and so we tested the turnover of Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG in the fully expanded nuclei of oocytes. Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG turnover was slow in oocyte NEs indicating that Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG was immobile in mature NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; average mobile fraction Â± S.D.=0.22 Â±- 0.2, n=9 embryos).

Thus, Ndc1 is necessary for the recruitment of Nup160:GFP to the nuclear rim and for assembly of nuclei, albeit in a defective manner, when Nup53 dimerization and membrane binding functions are compromised.</p><p>Failure to assemble an NE was also observed in fixed <italic>ndc1Î</italic> embryos RNAi depleted for <italic>nup53</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F-H</xref>).

These results suggest that when Ndc1 is absent, Nup53 association with Nup155 is sufficient for NPCs to assemble albeit at a less reduced level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data suggest a model in which Ndc1 functions early during NPC growth to couple incorporation of membranes to stable assembly of the nuclear pore scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the absence of Ndc1, NPC assembly coupled to membrane incorporation can occur through a parallel pathway that requires Nup53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, middle). In line with this, Nup53 binding to Ndc1 is dispensable for post-mitotic NPC assembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Nup53 binds directly to membranes and its overexpression causes membrane proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenhardt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body cells<italic>,</italic> overexpression of CTDNEP1/CNEP-1 affects the localization of NE-associated Nup53 possibly through disruption of lipid composition at the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacquemyn et al., 2021</xref>) also supporting the idea that Nup53 is sensitive to lipid content.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Independent requirements for Ndc1 and lipid synthesis in nuclear formation and expansion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the absence of Ndc1, the nuclear envelope (NE) is more continuous, and outer ring scaffold components in the NE are highly dynamic. Some NPCs still assemble and so nuclear transport is eventually established. Ndc1 functions at least in part redundantly to Nup53 in post-mitotic NPC assembly. Both Ndc1 and Nup53 may function through the shared factor Nup155. Loss of Ndc1 in combination with either <italic>cnep-1</italic> or <italic>chmp-7</italic> leads to additional sealing defects (represented by holes in the NE) that further delay nuclear formation. (<bold>B</bold>) Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes feed surface area expansion and nuclear import accumulates macromolecules inside the nucleus to increase nuclear volume. (<bold>C</bold>) Independent requirements for Ndc1 and membrane biogenesis promote nuclear growth.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75513-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Distinct roles for Ndc1 and Nup53 in membrane incorporation could explain why excess membranes feed nuclear growth in the absence of Ndc1, but not Nup53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). One possibility is that Ndc1 contributes to feeding of ER membranes containing preassembled NPC subcomplexes, whereas Nup53 is necessary for coupling membrane biogenesis to NPCs assembling directly on chromatin and/or in an intact NE. Indeed, the co-localized puncta of Ndc1 and Nup160 that exist in the cytoplasm of C. elegans embryos may represent annulate lamellae, which form from reserves of precursor NPC condensates to feed nuclear growth as shown in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hampoelz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hampoelz et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hampoelz et al., 2019b</xref>). The fact that loss of Ndc1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos also reduces Nup160 localization to cytoplasmic punctate structures suggests that Ndc1 is required for their stability/formation. Interestingly, NPC subcomplexes associate with mitotic ER membranes in mammalian cells to template the formation of mature pores in the reforming NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, annulate lamella also contribute to the rapid repopulation of NPCs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ren et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there may be a conserved role for Ndc1 in a post-mitotic NPC assembly pathway that involves preassembled NPCs on ER membranes. Future work on the distribution, dynamics, and identity of these Ndc1 containing cytoplasmic puncta in <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryos and during development will help to define their role in NPC assembly.</p><p>Successful NE formation requires Nup155, which assembles proximal to the membrane and links the outer and inner nuclear pore scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hampoelz et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">von Appen et al., 2015</xref>). Although Nup155 can itself bind to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">von Appen et al., 2015</xref>), we found that loss of Nup155 phenocopies loss of both Ndc1 and Nup53. This suggests Nup155 may require that either Ndc1 or Nup53 is present for its recruitment/assembly at the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, top). Stable incorporation of Nup160 also requires Ndc1, and so one possibility is that Ndc1 promotes the self-assembly of the nuclear pore scaffold through Nup155 to drive formation of NPCs. Ndc1 may help to recruit partially assembled nucleoporins that then oligomerize into stable assemblies (see above). Our data showing that Ndc1 is dynamic in growing NEs supports recent data using metabolic labeling in budding yeast showed that Ndc1, unlike other transmembrane nucleoporins, is readily exchanged in the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakhverdyan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Onischenko et al., 2020</xref>). However, we also found Ndc1 is highly stable in fully formed nuclei suggesting it serves as an anchor to mature NPCs. Future work is required to determine the mechanism by which Ndc1 drives NPC assembly.</p><p>In mammalian cells, Ndc1 slightly delays the onset of nuclear import and nuclear rim formation, consistent with a role in membrane recruitment and post-mitotic NPC assembly, but does not effect GFP:NLS accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>). A redundant role for Pom121, which is not present in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> in NPC assembly may account for the differences in nuclear accumulation of GFP:NLS after mitosis in these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>). We did not detect a delay in bulk membrane recruitment during nuclear formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, which could be explained by difficulties in detecting slight delays in membrane recruitment due to the fast speed of nuclear formation as well as limits in the resolution of confocal microscopy to detect defects in membrane incorporation directly at NPC assembly sites.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>cnep-1</italic> or <italic>chmp-7</italic> in the absence of Ndc1 further exacerbates the delayed onset of nuclear import resulting from loss of Ndc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right). Our prior work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos showed that regulation of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin by CNEP-1 contributes to effective NE sealing by restricting membranes to the surface of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, in budding yeast<italic>,</italic> CHMP7 is recruited to phosphatidic acid rich membranes at nuclear membrane herniations suggesting a role for lipid composition in recruiting CHMP7 to the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thaller et al., 2021</xref>). Together, our data suggest that the onset of nuclear cargo accumulation is likely limited by the number of assembled NPCs and the presence of holes that allow passive diffusion between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, which require closure through restricting lipid synthesis and ESCRT-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Membrane biogenesis coupled to NPC biogenesis has been proposed to drive faster NE expansion by both maintaining nuclear transport rates and supporting faster surface area expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kume et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kume et al., 2017</xref>). In budding yeast, nuclear extrusions resulting from increased nuclear membrane biogenesis through deletion of <italic>nem1</italic> (<italic>cnep-1/CTDNEP1</italic> in yeast) or its binding partner <italic>spo7</italic> contain NPCs suggesting that NPC assembly is coupled to membrane biogenesis under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaspersen and Ghosh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Santos-Rosa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siniossoglou, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siniossoglou et al., 1998</xref>). Our data show that faster rates of nuclear expansion driven by excess membrane biogenesis do not require NPC assembly via Ndc1 nor maintenance of normal rates of nuclear import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Why then is the rate of nuclear surface area expansion limited when the ER normally contains a large pool of available membranes? The amount of peripheral ER membranes determines the size of the nucleus in early sea urchin embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hara and Merten, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>cnep-1</italic> mutants contain excess ER membranes sheets proximal to the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahmanyar et al., 2014</xref>) supporting the possibility that a specific ER membrane pool controlled by CNEP-1 more readily feeds nuclear expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Additionally, CNEP-1/CTDNEP1 is enriched at the NE, and so membrane biogenesis may occur locally at the NE and couple to NPC assembly via a pathway that involves Nup53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahmanyar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacquemyn et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, local lipid composition may also be regulated by this pathway to direct membrane flow and NPC assembly.</p><p>Lipid synthesis is a universal mechanism that controls nuclear size and shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grillet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kume et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Merta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Santos-Rosa et al., 2005</xref>), and future work is needed to understand the direct and indirect relationships between ER/NE membrane biogenesis, NPC assembly pathways, and nuclear transport rates to regulate NPC density, nuclear expansion, and nuclear size.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for reagents or resources should be directed to Shirin Bahmanyar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mcdb.yale.edu/people/shirin-bahmanyar">shirin.bahmanyar@yale.edu</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and plasmids from this study are available from the Lead Contact upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>Strain maintenance and generation</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study are listed in the key resource table.

The synthesized RNAs were purified using phenol-chloroform and resuspended in 1Ã soaking buffer (32.7 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 16.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 6.3 mM NaCl, and 14.2 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl). RNA reactions were annealed at 68Â°C for 10 min followed by 37Â°C for 30 min. dsRNAs were brought to a final concentration of ~2000 ng/Î¼l whenever possible, and 2 Î¼l aliquots of the dsRNA were stored until use at â80Â°C. For each experiment, prior to injection, a fresh aliquot was diluted to ~1000 ng/Î¼l and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4Â°C. 0.35 Î¼l of the diluted dsRNA was loaded into the back of hand pulled capillary needles and injected into the gut of L4 worms.

However, there are several issues that the authors need to address prior to publication. Most importantly, some of the data presented appear contradictory, namely the decrease of different Nups at the NE upon Ndc1 RNAi and the unchanged mAb414 signal are not in line with the observed decrease in pore number. This should be discussed/studied in more detail. In addition, some important quantifications and controls are missing as specified below.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Lines 111 and 121 and 179 and 200: better say &quot;import&quot; instead of &quot;transport&quot; (since export has not been formally addressed).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now changed the text throughout to indicate import rather than transport.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 130: &quot;ndc1delta embryos contained small pronuclei (Figure 1B) there were similar in size to those RNAi-depleted for ndc1 (FigureS1C)&quot;. Quantifications are missing. Only the ndc1 RNAi pronuclei diameter is measured (Figure 1G), it would be good to have the size of the ndc1delta as well since this <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain is used throughout the paper and considered together with the Ndc1 RNAi embryo results to draw conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of the paternal pronuclear size of fixed one-cell stage embryos for control and ndc1 deleted embryos is now shown in new panel in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C. Note that this analysis had to be done on fixed one-cell stage embryos and so they represent a range of pronuclear diameters as compared to nuclear diameter measurements at a single time point in living embryos in Figure 1G. Overall, this analysis shows that pronuclei in both ndc1D and ndc1 RNAi-depletion are significantly smaller than pronuclei in control embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 136: there are no quantifications of the difference in embryo sizes of Ndc1delta worms, and they do not always appear smaller throughout the figures of the paper (although the authors claim this in figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the size of one-cell stage embryos is variable in the ndc1D worms. We now include measurements in fixed control and ndc1D one-cell stage embryos to provide a clearer representation of the range of embryo lengths we observe (see new lines #147-148).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 150: &quot;pseudocleavage&quot; Ã  PC acronym is missing, which is used throughout the paper</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this omission and we have fixed the manuscript text. We have now indicated the acronym after the first use of the word âpseudocleavageâ (new line #165) and use PC regression throughout to be consistent with the rest of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The videos play back fast and slower speed would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Where appropriate, we have slowed the videos (see new Videos 1-4, 10, and 11), as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 165: &quot;suggesting a role for Ndc1 is establishment of nuclear transport after mitosis (Anderson et al. 2009).&quot; Typo.</p></disp-quote><p>We have omitted this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 1F: Nice that the author show it so clearly but it is redundant and could go to supplementary material.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved this Figure panel to new Figure 1-supplement 1H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 172: &quot;Ndc1en:mNG also localizes to the ER as well as punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm&quot;. These structures seem asymmetrically distributed. Are they coming from the mother cell, as it was shown for RanBP2 granules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (Hampoelz et al. 2019)? Do these Ndc1 granules colocalize with RanBP2 or other Nups? While this would add to the manuscript, in our opinion it is not strictly required for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do agree that pursuing this line of research would likely yield interesting results, this would require the generation of strains and so we prefer to address these questions in a future study. We do provide some more direct interpretations of these puncta in relation to the role of Ndc1 in NPC assembly in the Discussion line #380-392.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 2E: why does it decrease at the end?</p></disp-quote><p>We now clarify that the decrease signal in the nuclear NLS:GFP reporter at the end of this time course is because the embryo has entered mitosis, which triggers permeabilization of the nuclear envelope resulting in equilibration of the nuclear and cytoplasmic components. See new line #204-206.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 2G: redundant information to Figure 2E, could be moved to supplementary material.</p></disp-quote><p>This panel has been moved to the supplement as the reviewer has suggested (see new Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F). To avoid further redundancy, we also removed part of the previous Figure S2E, which showed the individual normalized traces for the entire time course, and only show the first 300s of the graph that represent the shift in onset of nuclear import.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors state that it was previously shown that Ndc1 delays NE reformation thus delaying the nuclear import at the end of mitosis (Anderson et al. 2009). But this is not the case here, since NE reformation seems to occur at the same time as in the control. This should be commented on and the differences should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these comments and the differences in the new Discussion pg. 17, lines 407-415. Additionally, we did not detect a difference in ER recruitment between wildtype and ndc1 RNAi-depleted embryos during NE formation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75513-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Is the decrease in NPC density in ndc1delta embryos maintained beyond telophase? The authors could measure it in later time points by electron tomograms (or better by super resolution microscopy) and count the number of NPCs per square micrometer. A decrease is expected given that the export delays persist in later time points. Furthermore, analyzing NPC density will be important to support the tomography data that suggest a decreased number of NPCs but given the unchanged mAb414 signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now resolved the issue of the unchanged mAB414 signal in new Figure 3-figure supplment 2C (see also Response to Editor#1 and Reviewer1 #18 and #19). Importantly, we performed EM tomography on fully formed nuclei from multiple prepared samples of both control and ndc1D embryos at later time points (see new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and B and new Results text lines #2227-231).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Figure 2D: color code explanation is missing. Some statistics are necessary, not only measurements of single cells</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a clear color code to the figure legend to clarify the analysis (see new line #485). We also provide average value and standard deviation for when GFP:NLS are first observed in the nucleus in ndc1 RNAi-depleted embryos as well as the sample size to the text (see Results lines #201).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Lines 227-230: &quot;The fact that they colocalize with Ndc1 and do not form in ndc1 RNAi embryos, which also have lower levels of p160:GFP at the nuclear rim, suggested that Ndc1 may play a role in stabilizing scaffold components both in these cytoplasmic structures and in the NE.&quot; ALs have been suggested to play a role in the postmitotic NPC assembly and to contribute to the rapid repopulation of NEs with NPCs (Ren et al. 2019). Since the cytoplasmic Nup60 granules do not form in the absence of ndc1, it could be that a defect in this pathway contributes to the decrease in NPCs in late mitosis. Please discuss or address</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this reference and suggestion. We now address this in the new Discussion on pg. 16, lines 380-392.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Line 234: the authors claim that &quot;each component is approximately 50% less enriched at the nuclear rim in the absence of Ndc1 (Figure 3D)&quot;. Unfortunately, it is not explained how this 50% is calculated. This should be properly quantified</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text as to provide an explanation for how the 50% lower fluorescence signal at the nuclear rim was quantified in the absence of Ndc1. (See new line #245-250).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Figure 3D and 3G: ndc1delta embryo does not seem to be smaller than the ctrl in contradiction to the claim in the line 136 as discussed above.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see Reviewer1 #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. Figure S3H: since the authors claim that Ndc1 regulates NPC assembly (and does not regulate Nup protein levels) it would be important to check that Nup levels are not decreased, especially for the member of the Y complex ELYS (to make sure that postmitotic assembly is not being indirectly affected by Ndc1 through ELYS). Checking an importin would also be a nice control, to show that the effect on import is indeed due to decrease in NPC number</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We now show that NPC number is lower in both the reforming nuclei (Figure 3A and 3B) and at later time points in fully formed nuclei (see new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and B and new Results text line #227-231) indicating defects in NPC assembly result from loss of Ndc1. We now also show a reduction in mAB414-epitope containing nucleoporins signal in ndc1D embryos but overall levels are unchanged (see new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C and Reviewer1 #18 and #19) corroborating our results that there is a defect in NPC biogenesis without Ndc1. Based on the Reviewerâs suggestion, we added new data in new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F showing that the total protein levels of the main importin expressed in early embryos IMA-3 are unchanged between control and ndc1D worms further suggesting that the delay and reduced nuclear import is not due to reduced transport machinery. We were unable to reliably detect a band specifically corresponding to Elys after several attempts of using an endogenous antibody generously provided by Arshad Desaiâs lab (Hattersley et al. 2016) as well as a GFP antibody in a strain expressing ELYS:GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. The quality of the mAb414 WB on FigureS4D is not good. We expect to see 4 bands (corresponding to C.e. Nup358, Nup214, Nup153 and Nup62). Please repeat WB with tris acetate gel and wet transfer to see high molecular size proteins and check levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We purchased a new mAB414 antibody from a different company that clarified these discrepancies. Using this new antibody, we address the issues raised by this Reviewer in several ways.</p><p>1. As suggested by the Reviewer, we used a 3 â 8% Tris-Acetate gel with wet transfer to run lysate prepared from <italic>C. elegans</italic> (see new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D) and mammalian cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). In lysates prepared from mammalian cells, we detected 4 prominent bands recognized by mAB414 antibodies at the predicted molecular weights for Nup358 (Ce npp-4), Nup214 (Ce npp-14), Nup153 (Ce npp-7) and Nup62 (Ce npp-11), which are 95 kDa, 148 kDa, 124 KDa, and 77 kDa, respectively, for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). However, mAB414 antibodies recognized 3 protein species between 75 kDa and ~120 kDa in lysates prepared from <italic>C. elegans</italic> (see new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B and C</xref>). Thus, mAB414 detects distinct protein species in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as has also been shown in Galy et al. 2003.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75513-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>2. Based on Galy et al. 2003, one of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins recognized by mAB414 antibodies is Ce Nup98. We also show that the disappearance of the Nup98 protein species following RNAi-depletion and immunoblotting of worm lysates (see new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D) indicating that the mAB414 antibody is specific for at least Nup98 and likely other nucleoporins in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Line 241-243: &quot;Immunostaining of control and ndc1 mutant worms with mAB414, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes FG-nucleoporins, did not show a consistent difference in fluorescence signal at the nuclear rim in early stage ndc1 mutant embryos (Figure S4C)&quot;. How do the authors explain this? If there are fewer NPCs, mAb414 signal should also be affected. It is critical that the authors address this point. Furthermore, figure S4C shows embryos in different (more advanced?) stages than the ones imaged throughout the rest of the paper. Would this potentially explain the mAb414 levels? Are the decreased in earlier time points?

The observation that recruitment of the NUP107-NUP160 complex is strongly impaired in NDC1-depleted embryos is unexpected based on the Mansfeld study mentioned above (&quot;The NE association of Nup107, a component of the Nup107-160 subcomplex essential for NPC biogenesis was slightly reduced&quot;; Mansfeld et al., 2006). One explanation could be that the depletion of NDC1 is more efficient in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (known for its potent RNAi machinery). Alternatively, although many metazoans have three integral membrane nuclear pore proteins (NUP210, POM121, NDC1; as stated in line 69), POM121 seems to be absent in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The Mansfeld study reported that cells co-depleted for POM121 and NDC1 had more severe phenotypes than the single depletions. Perhaps <italic>C. elegans</italic> NDC1 carry out the functions of both vertebrate proteins (POM121 and NDC1) and thus the depletion produces a stronger effect. Although this is speculative, I suggest the authors to discuss this â or at least mention in line 69 that POM121 is not detected in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention. We agree that it is important to provide more information on POM121 and the fact that it is not detected in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may account for the differences we observe in these systems. We have now added new text to address this point in the new Introduction on p. 2-3, pg. 5 lines #118-123 and in the new Discussion on pp. 17 line #407-415.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The use of electron tomograms to evaluate NE formation is exciting. This is a powerful technique that to my knowledge has not been used before for this purpose in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. However, more details on the analysis and more observations are needed. For instance, how big are the areas that were quantified? Are the areas (2) in control; 3 areas in ndc1(0) from a single embryo? Even if 2 control and 3 ndc1(0) embryos were used, these are very low numbers and carry a potential risk that the embryos are not perfectly staged. NE and NPC reformation is an extremely fast process in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos and small variations in fixation time could introduce a bias in the number of NPCs/holes in the tomograms.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer seeing the novelty of this approach to evaluate NPC assembly upon nuclear reformation. Below we address your comments/suggestions:</p><p>i. How big are the areas that were quantified? Are the areas (2) in control; 3 areas in ndc1(0) from a single embryo? We quantified 4 areas from a single control embryo (0.14 mm<sup>2</sup>, 0.08 mm<sup>2</sup>, 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 0.04 mm<sup>2</sup>) and 4 areas from a single ndc1D embryo (0.22 mm<sup>2</sup>, 0.19 mm<sup>2</sup>, 0.18 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 0.17 mm<sup>2</sup>). We now clarify this in the main text and both in the Figure legend pg. 26 and in the Materials and methods pg. 49.</p><p>ii. We agree with the Reviewerâs concern regarding staging of embryos. We now provide data collected from tomographs of nuclei in two cell stage embryos increasing our sample size and the number of nuclei that we analyzed (see new text in Results line #227-231, new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and B, and new Materials Methods pp. 49). These data reveal a consistent decrease in NPC density in fully formed nuclei corroborating our immunofluorescence and live imaging data (see Figure 3D, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E and F, Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A and C) as well as the FRAP analysis of Nup160:GFP (see Figure 3F), reduced import rates and smaller nuclear size measurements (see Figure 1F and new Figure 4 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). The addition of these data together with the addition of new Figure 4 provides evidence for a role for Ndc1 in NPC assembly during nuclear formation and expansion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I'm concerned regarding the conclusion on Ndc1 mobility based on the FRAP assays presented. The nucleus in Figure 3G seems to grow in size during the course of the FRAP experiment. This growth presumably involves incorporation of ER membranes that might bring in new NPP-22 (not necessarily into NPCs; hence the difference with Nup106 in Figure 3E). The FRAP should be performed on fully grown nuclei although this will leave less time before the next cell division. Potentially could be performed in non-dividing cells. Because the authors state several times â including in the title â that Ndc1 is a dynamic protein, this is a critical point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this Reviewer for bringing up this critical point. The Reviewer is correct that the incorporation of new Ndc1::mNG-associated membrane could affect the dynamics of Ndc1 recovery that we report. The dynamics of Ndc1 no longer serves as a major point with the new addition of new Figure 4 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 that focuses on membrane addition and NPC assembly via Ndc1. Nevertheless, we performed FRAP on oocyte nuclei and found that Ndc1:mNG is immobile in these NEs (see new Figure 3E). Thus, we removed the conclusion that Ndc1 is dynamic at the NE from the manuscript title and throughout the manuscript. We also moved the original data to the supplement (see new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2G), and changed the Results text to read:</p><p>âIt has been proposed that transmembrane nucleoporins serve as an anchor to immobilize the NPC in the NE. In nuclei that were expanding, we found that Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG was highly mobile in the NE (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2G and Video 12; average mobile fraction Â± SD = 0.59 Â±- 0.09, n = 7 embryos). This suggests that Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG may dynamically associate with nascent NPCs. However, growth of nuclei could result in recovery of Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG through feeding of a new pool of membrane-associated Ndc1 and so we tested the turnover of Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG in the fully expanded nuclei of oocytes. Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG turnover was slow in oocyte NEs indicating that Ndc1<sup>en</sup>:mNG was immobile in mature NPCs (Figure 3E; average mobile fraction Â± SD = 0.22 Â±- 0.2, n = 9 embryos). Thus, NDC1 may serve an anchoring role for mature NPCs.â (Results lines # 266-275)</p><p>We also address this in the Discussion lines #401-406, which now reads:</p><p>âOur data showing that Ndc1 may be dynamic in growing NEs supports recent data using metabolic labeling in budding yeast showed that Ndc1, unlike other transmembrane nucleoporins, is readily exchanged in the NPC (Hakhverdyan et al., 2021; Onischenko et al., 2020).. However, we also found Ndc1 is highly stable in fully formed nuclei suggesting it serves as an anchor to mature NPCs. Future mechanistic work is required to determine the mechanism by which Ndc1 drives NPC assembly.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>4.

These data suggest a potentially distinct role for Ndc1 in coupling NPC assembly to membrane incorporation and provide insight into the connection between NPC numbers and nuclear size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 4: Generally, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NPC is not well-studied in the field, however, the surprising non-essential phenotype of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NDC1 partial knock-out strain (tm1845) has been previously established by the Goerlich laboratory (Stavru et al. JCB 2006). Using primarily fluorescence microscopy experiments and various genetically modified <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains that build on these previous results, the authors confirm the previous non-lethal phenotype of the tm1845 strain and by electron microscopy analysis confirm the previous conclusion that the partial NDC1 knock-out yields nuclear envelopes with vastly reduced NPC numbers. Using CRISPR/CAS9, the authors generated a complete knock-out of the NDC1 coding region, demonstrating a more severe but still viable phenotype. I am unaware whether the reported small nuclei phenotype has been observed previously in other organisms, but I find the proposed NPC number to nuclear size connection interesting, but unfortunately this aspect of the manuscript is not well developed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data (see new Figure 4, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, Video 13) in the revised manuscript demonstrating that the smaller nuclear size of ndc1 RNAi-depleted embryos can be rescued to near wild type levels by increasing membrane biogenesis. Importantly, increased membrane biogenesis restores nuclear size, but not reduced NPC levels or nuclear import rates resulting from loss of ndc1. Furthermore, increased membrane biogenesis does not rescue nuclear size in nup53 or nup153 RNAi-depleted embryos (new Figure 4J) suggesting that there is a distinct relationship between membrane incorporation and NPC assembly via Ndc1. Together, our data suggests that Ndc1 functions in parallel to Nup53 and membrane biogenesis to determine NPC density and nuclear size. This work goes well beyond the Stavru et al. paper on Ndc1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and provides an explanation for why Ndc1 is non-essential in worms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 4: The NPC schematics in Figure 4A does not represent the current state of knowledge.
