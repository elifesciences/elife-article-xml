retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) fates. As these fates arise, the OV assumes a cup shape, influenced by mechanical forces generated within the neural retina. Whether the RPE passively adapts to retinal changes or actively contributes to OV morphogenesis remains unexplored. We generated a zebrafish Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) line to track RPE morphogenesis and interrogate its participation in OV folding. We show that, in virtual absence of proliferation, RPE cells stretch and flatten, thereby matching the retinal curvature and promoting OV folding. Localized interference with the RPE cytoskeleton disrupts tissue stretching and OV folding. Thus, extreme RPE flattening and accelerated differentiation are efficient solutions adopted by fast-developing species to enable timely optic cup formation. This mechanism differs in amniotes, in which proliferation drives RPE expansion with a much-reduced need of cell flattening.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rounded eyeballs help to optimize vision – but how do they acquire their distinctive shape? In animals with backbones, including humans, the eye begins to form early in development. A single layer of embryonic tissue called the optic vesicle reorganizes itself into a two-layered structure: a thin outer layer of cells, known as the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE for short), and a thicker inner layer called the neural retina. If this process fails, the animal may be born blind or visually impaired.</p><p>How this flat two-layered structure becomes round is still being investigated. In fish, studies have shown that the inner cell layer – the neural retina – generates mechanical forces that cause the developing tissue to curve inwards to form a cup-like shape. But it was unclear whether the outer layer of cells (the RPE) also contributed to this process.</p><p>Moreno-Marmol et al. were able to investigate this question by genetically modifying zebrafish to make all new RPE cells fluoresce. Following the early development of the zebrafish eye under a microscope revealed that RPE cells flattened themselves into long thin structures that stretched to cover the entire neural retina. This change was made possible by the cell’s internal skeleton reorganizing. In fact, preventing this reorganization stopped the RPE cells from flattening, and precluded the optic cup from acquiring its curved shape. The results thus confirmed a direct role for the RPE in generating curvature.</p><p>The entire process did not require the RPE to produce new cells, allowing the curved shape to emerge in just a few hours. This is a major advantage for fast-developing species such as zebrafish. In species whose embryos develop more slowly, such as mice and humans, the RPE instead grows by producing additional cells – a process that takes many days. The development of the eye thus shows how various species use different evolutionary approaches to achieve a common goal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd>chick</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>medaka</kwd><kwd>optic cup</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>tissue tension</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>squamous epithelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Chick</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd>Medaka fish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-104186RB-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bovolenta</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RED2018-102553-T</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bovolenta</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-75412-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bovolenta</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-55918-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavodeassi</surname><given-names>Florencia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007406</institution-id><institution>BBVA Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N[16]_BBM_BAS_0078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavodeassi</surname><given-names>Florencia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundación Ramon Areces-2016</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bovolenta</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retinal pigment epithelium flattening is an efficient solution adopted by the fast-developing zebrafish to enable folding of the eye primordia, which contrasts with the proliferation-based mechanism used by amniotes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is an essential component of the vertebrate eye, composed of a monolayer of pigment-enriched epithelial cells abutting the neural retina (NR) with a primary role in photoreception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Letelier et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the acquisition of specialized epithelial properties, RPE cells have a neural origin and share progenitors with the NR. These progenitors are organized in a pseudostratified neuroepithelium, known as optic vesicle (OV) or eye primordium. In amniotes, the OVs appear as balloon-like structures positioned at the sides of the anterior neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreno-Marmol et al., 2018</xref>). In zebrafish instead, these primordia are flat and form two bi-layered structures with the outer and inner layers distally connected by a rim or hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Under the influence of inductive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallardo and Bovolenta, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cardozo et al., 2020</xref>), the two layers activate different genetic programs that specify the cells of the inner layer and ventral outer layer as NR and those of the dorsal outer layer as RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beccari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buono and Martinez-Morales, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>). Whilst this specification occurs, the OV bends assuming a cup-like shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez-Morales et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of the <italic>ojoplano</italic> medaka fish mutant – affecting a transmembrane protein localized at the basal end feet of NR cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>) – in which the OV remains unfolded, was instrumental to propose that basal constriction of NR progenitors is at the basis of OV bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>). This basal constriction is mediated by the redistribution of the actomyosin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicolas-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2016</xref>), which also enables the apical relaxation of retinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>), enhanced by focal adhesions of the apical surface with the extracellular matrix molecules (ECM) such as laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2016</xref>). The importance of concomitant apical relaxation, especially of the cells positioned at the hinge, has also been supported in studies of mammalian retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okuda et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless and independently of their relative contribution, the acquisition of apical convexity and basal concavity in the NR epithelium are accepted drivers of the biomechanical forces that induce OV folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okuda et al., 2018</xref>). In zebrafish, this mechanism is reinforced by rim involution or epithelial flow, a process whereby progenitors at the hinge emit dynamic lamellipodia at the basal side and actively translocate from the ventral outer layer of the OV into the inner/retinal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Picker et al., 2009</xref>). Periocular neural crest cells appear to facilitate this flow, in part by the deposition of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bryan et al., 2020</xref>) to which the lamellipodia attach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). The result of this flow is an unbalanced cell number between the two layers, which should favour NR bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). Whether this flow may also contribute to the concomitant cell shape modifications that the remaining outer layer cells undergo as they become specified into RPE, or conversely whether RPE specification favours the flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>), remain open questions.</p><p>Indeed as the OV folds, the pseudostratified neuroepithelial cells of the OV dorsal outer layer progressively align their nuclei becoming a cuboidal monolayer in amniotes species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreno-Marmol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez-Morales et al., 2004</xref>). In zebrafish, cuboidal cells further differentiate to a flat/squamous epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>) that spreads to cover the whole apical surface of the NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cechmanek and McFarlane, 2017</xref>). In mice, failure of RPE specification, as observed after genetic inactivation of key specifier genes (i.e. <italic>Otx1/Otx2</italic>, <italic>Mitf</italic>, <italic>Yap/Taz</italic>), enables RPE progenitors to acquire an NR fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez-Morales et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bharti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The resulting optic cups (OCs) present evident folding defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez-Morales et al., 2001</xref>), raising the possibility that specific RPE features are needed for OC formation. In line with this idea, a differential stiffness of the RPE vs. the NR layer has been proposed to drive the self-organization of mammalian organoids into an OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okuda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, generation of proper RPE cell numbers seems a requirement for correct OC folding in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carpenter et al., 2015</xref>). However, studies addressing the specific contribution of the RPE to OV folding are currently lacking.</p><p>Here, we report the generation of a Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) zebrafish transgenic line with which we followed the beginning of RPE morphogenesis under both normal and interfered conditions. We show that, whereas in amniotes, including humans, the developing RPE undergo proliferation to increase its surface with a less evident cell flattening, zebrafish RPE cells rapidly cease proliferation and expand their surface by reducing their length along the apico-basal axis and extending in the medio-lateral direction with a tissue autonomous process that depends on cytoskeletal reorganization. Localized interference with either the retinal or the RPE actomyosin and microtubule cytoskeleton shows that RPE flattening generates a mechanical force that actively contributes to OV folding, complementing the force generated by the basal constriction of the NR. This mechanism represents an efficient solution to match the increased apical surface of the NR layer in a fast-developing vertebrate species such as zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a specific reporter line to study zebrafish RPE development</title><p>Detailed analysis of zebrafish RPE morphogenesis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable transgenic line, in which RPE cells could be followed from their initial commitment.

GFP reporter expression appeared in a discrete group of neuroepithelial cells in the dorso-medial region of the OV (16–17 hpf) and expanded both posteriorly and ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>), so that, by 24 hpf, GFP-positive cells appeared to wrap around the entire inner NR layer. 3D reconstructions of selected embryos further confirmed the fast (about 7 hr) expansion of the GFP-positive domain forming an outer shell for the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Apart from a faint and very transient signal in some early NR progenitors — likely due to the existence of negative regulatory elements not included in the construct — no GFP expression was observed in regions other than the RPE during this process. However, after the formation of the OC, reporter expression appeared also in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ), the pineal gland, and few neural crest cells surrounding the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2 fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 1–3</xref>). These additional domains of expression coincided with the reported <italic>bhlhe40</italic> mRNA distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2006</xref>) and represented no obstacle for using the transgenic line as a tool to follow the early phases of RPE generation.

As soon as RPE progenitors begin to express the transgenic GFP reporter, their apico-basal length rapidly and progressively reduces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C’</xref>), so that the cells first assume a cuboidal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and B’</xref>) and then become flat, forming a squamous epithelial monolayer overlaying the apical surface of the NR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and C’</xref>).

Signal quantification showed that the eye underwent a marked and linear volume increase (slope: 5.54 × 10<sup>4</sup> μm<sup>3</sup>/hr from 17 to 22 hpf and 3.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> μm<sup>3</sup>/hr from 24 to 37 hpf) as compared to that of the RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and G</xref>). Between 20 and 22 hpf the reporter starts being expressed in the posterior and, to a lesser extent, in the anterior CMZ (GFP-CMZ domain, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2">Figure 1—videos 1 and 2</xref>).

Thus, in principle, RPE flattening might occur as a ‘passive’ process, triggered by the forces that the NR and hinge cells exert on the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreno-Marmol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, it might depend on cell or tissue autonomous cytoskeletal rearrangements, involving, for example, myosin II activity, which controls the acquisition of a flat epithelial morphology in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vishavkarma et al., 2014</xref>). Discriminating between these two possibilities has been technically difficult. Experiments directed to assess the mechanisms of OV folding have used whole embryo bathing in drugs such as blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicolas-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>), a specific myosin II inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rauscher et al., 2018</xref>). Such an approach hampers the assessment of the potential influence of NR over RPE morphogenesis (and vice versa) as well as the relative contribution of the two tissues to OV folding. We sought to overcome this limitation by spatially localized interference with the cytoskeletal organization of either the RPE or NR and by recording the tissue autonomous and non-autonomous consequences. Nevertheless, to begin with, we reproduced the whole embryo bathing approach used by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicolas-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>), focusing on the yet unreported effect that blebbistatin had on the RPE.</p><p>Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) embryos were bathed either in blebbistatin or its diluent (DMSO) at 17 hpf (the onset of RPE specification; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) and then let develop up to 19.5 hpf, when embryos were analysed. DMSO-treated (control) embryos developed normally forming an OC surrounded by a squamous RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In blebbistatin-treated embryos, NR cells did not undergo basal constriction and the OV remained unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicolas-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>). Notably, in almost all the embryos analysed (n = 44/49), RPE cells did not flatten but remained cuboidal in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A similar phenotype was observed after treatment with paranitroblebbistatin, a non-cytotoxic and photostable version of blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These observations support that lack of OV folding is associated with alterations in both the retina and RPE. To uncouple the two events, we turned to the photoactivable compound azidoblebbistatin (Ableb), which binds covalently to myosin II upon two-photon irradiation, thus permanently interfering with myosin II activity in a spatially restricted manner, as already proven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kepiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kepiro et al., 2015</xref>). Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) 17 hpf embryos were bathed in Ableb or in DMSO and irradiated in a small region of either the dorsal outer layer (RPE) or the inner retinal layer (retina) of the OV (see Materials and methods). Embryos were then let develop until 24 hpf. During this period, the irradiated RPE cells underwent anterior and medio-lateral spreading – likely coinciding with the reported pinwheel ‘movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>) – and were mostly found in the ventral half of the OV. Notably, Ableb photoactivation in the prospective RPE cells reproduced, although slightly less efficiently (n = 30/44 embryos), the phenotype observed upon whole embryo bathing in blebbistatin, in which RPE cells acquired a cuboidal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D, G, G'</xref>). No detectable alterations were found in the OV of irradiated/DMSO-treated embryos or in the contralateral non-irradiated OV of embryos incubated in Ableb regardless of the irradiated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F', H, I'</xref>). Cell shape quantifications showed a significantly longer apico-basal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E’–G’</xref>) in irradiated Ableb RPE cells, normalized to that of control (DMSO- and Ableb-treated non-irradiated) OVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>; Mann-Whitney U test, z = −5.088, p &lt; 0.001, control mean length 15.96 vs. Ableb-treated 38.03). Failure of cell flattening in the irradiated region of the RPE was consistently associated with a significant reduction of OV folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>), as assessed by measuring the invagination angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>), which was normalized to that of control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>; Mann-Whitney U test: z = −2.704, p &lt; 0.01, mean rank for control 21.60 vs. Ableb-treated 33.33). Photoactivation of Ableb in similar areas of the prospective NR basal region resulted in an elongated NR and a significantly impaired OV folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), as determined by the invagination angles normalized to those of control OV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>; Mann-Whitney U test: z = −3.035, p &lt; 0.01, mean rank control 10.29 vs. Ableb 20.06). Notably, disruption of NR morphogenesis had no consequences on RPE development in all the analysed embryos (n = 16/22): cells underwent normal flattening with apico-basal lengths comparable to those of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H’–J’ and M</xref>; Mann-Whitney U test: z = 0.582, p &gt; 0.05, mean rank control 14.50 vs. Ableb 16.38). These data strongly support that RPE flattening is not secondary to NR folding but rather a tissue autonomous event. They also indicate that OV folding requires forces independently generated in both the NR and RPE. Notably, blebbistatin or Ableb treatments did not compromise the expression of the Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) transgene in any experimental condition, indicating that cellular tension and morphology did not affect RPE specification.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) flattening is a myosin-dependent cell autonomous process required for proper optic vesicle (OV) folding.</title><p>(<bold>A–J</bold>) Confocal images of dorsally viewed Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) embryos before (17 hpf; <bold>A</bold>) and 2.5 hr after incubation (19.5 hpf) with either DMSO (<bold>B, E, H</bold>), blebbistatin (<bold>C</bold>), paranitroblebbistatin (<bold>D</bold>), or azidoblebbistatin (Ableb) (<bold>F, G, I, J</bold>) with (<bold>G, J</bold>) or without irradiation (<bold>F, I</bold>) in the prospective RPE (<bold>F–G</bold>) or neural retina (NR) (<bold>I–J</bold>).

Nocodazole treatment did not prevent the activation of the GFP reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or the acquisition/distribution of expected specification (<italic>otx1</italic> and <italic>mitf</italic>) and apico-basal polarity (zo-1 and laminin) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, although the NR layer appeared to bend inward, the RPE layer remained unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and outer layer cells accumulated at the hinge, suggesting a defect in rim involution. This defect may be due to the alteration of microtubule polymerization in rim cells. Alternatively, the lack of RPE stretching may prevent the translocation of rim cells to the NR layer.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Microtubule dynamics is required for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell flattening and optic vesicle (OV) folding.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Confocal images of dorsally viewed Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) embryos before (16 hpf A; 17 hpf D) and 2.5 hr after incubation (18.5 hpf B, C; 19.5 hpf E, F) with either DMSO (<bold>B, E</bold>) or nocodazolef (<bold>C, F</bold>).

At the earlier stage (17 hpf), BrdU-positive cells were scattered across the RPE with no easily identifiable geometry and accounted for 49% of the total RPE cells. This fraction dropped to about 20% at 19 hpf, when cells are flat, and then to 12% at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) when the epithelium is maturing. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between 17 and 20 hpf (Mann-Whitney U test: z = −2.619, p &lt; 0.01, mean rank for 17 hpf is 8 and for 19 hpf is 3) and a clear correlation between proliferation rate and developmental stage (Kruskal-Wallis test: χ<sup>2</sup>(df = 7, n = 40) = 32,023; p &lt; 0.001). During this period, the apico-basal axis of individual RPE cells flattened reaching a length of 3 μm at 22–23 hpf. Thus, acquisition of RPE identity, cell shape changes, and OV folding are associated with a progressive reduction of cell proliferation in the OV outer layer.</p><p>OC morphogenesis in the teleost medaka fish occurs with a choreography comparable to that of the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>) but the medaka fish RPE does not adopt an extreme squamous morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Notably, medaka fish develop slower than zebrafish embryos, so that, from first appearance, their OVs take about 8 hr more to reach a fully developed OC (26 vs. 18 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furutani-Seiki and Wittbrodt, 2004</xref>), a time compatible with an additional round of cell division. Consistent with this idea, BrdU incorporation in st18 to 22–23 medaka embryos showed that about 70% of the cells in the OV outer layer were actively cycling and this proportion dropped to about 48% at OC stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and E</xref>) with a slightly less evident decrease of the average apico-basal axis (st18: 21.3 µm vs. st23 3.5 µm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) as compared to the changes observed in zebrafish. An equivalent analysis in chick and mouse embryos showed similar results. In these species OV conversion into an OC takes about 27 and 48 hr, respectively. During this period a similar and almost constant proportion of RPE progenitors incorporated BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C and E</xref>), including when cells acquired the expression of the RPE differentiation marker Otx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, RPE cells only roughly halved their apico-basal axis (chick: HH12: 30.1 µm vs. HH18: 15.8 µm; mouse: E9.5: 23.7 µm vs. E11.5 13 µm <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>), suggesting that in slower developing species, proliferation but not stretching accounts for RPE surface increase. To corroborate this idea, we next analysed human embryos.</p><p>The human eye primordium is first visible at about 4–5 weeks of gestation corresponding to Carnegie stage (CS)13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O’Rahilly, 1983</xref>). A fully formed OC is reached only roughly 10 days after, at CS16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O’Rahilly, 1983</xref>). Immunostaining of paraffin sections from CS13 to CS16 embryos with antibodies against Ki67, a marker of the active phases of the cell cycle, demonstrated that the large majority of prospective RPE cells undergo a marked proliferation during the transition from OV to OC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Owing to the difficulties in obtaining early human embryonic samples, the percentage of proliferating cells could only be estimated, showing that in the OTX2-positive domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), Ki67-positive RPE cells represented about 85–75% of the total between CS13 and CS16. During this period, the prospective RPE layer always appeared as a rather thick pseudostratified epithelium with an organization resembling that of the NR composed of densely packed and elongated neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). During the formation of the OC, the RPE neuroepithelium only slightly flattened (apico-basal thickness: CS13: 45 µm vs. CS16: 33.6 µm), far from reaching the cuboidal appearance seen at postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that, in the absence of sufficient time for cell proliferation, flattening is an efficient solution adopted by zebrafish RPE cells to enlarge the whole tissue to the extent needed for OV folding. In other vertebrates, in which slower development allows for more rounds of cell division, the RPE grows in a conventional proliferation-based mode that correlates with a less evident flattening of RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The cup shape of the vertebrate eye is thought to optimize vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldsmith, 1990</xref>). This shape is acquired very early in development as the result of specification and morphogenetic events, during which the NR and the RPE arise. Studies in teleosts (zebrafish and medaka) together with mammalian organoid cultures have recently demonstrated a fundamental contribution of NR progenitors in driving the acquisition of this cup shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreno-Marmol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez-Morales et al., 2017</xref>). The role of the RPE progenitors in this process has instead not been properly clarified. In this study, we have filled this gap and analysed the folding of the zebrafish OV from the RPE perspective. This analysis has been possible thanks to the generation of a new RPE reporter line Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP), in which GFP expression appears in the domain fated to originate the RPE. Following the cells arising from this domain, we show that RPE surface expansion is an active and tissue autonomous process required for OV folding. This expansion largely occurs by extreme cell flattening with little contribution of cell proliferation, a mechanism that sets zebrafish RPE morphogenesis apart from that of other analysed vertebrate species, in which proliferation accounts for RPE growth.</p><p>Our analysis together with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cechmanek and McFarlane, 2017</xref>) shows that the onset <italic>bhlhe40</italic> expression coincides spatially and temporally with that of zebrafish RPE specification. Thus, the Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) line serves as an early tissue-specific marker that even precedes the appearance of previously accepted <italic>Otx</italic> or <italic>Mitf</italic> tissue specifiers, as confirmed in a parallel transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Bhlhe40</italic> expression in the RPE is conserved at least in mouse and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cohen-Tayar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a possible relevant function in this tissue. However, its CRISP/Cas9 inactivation, alone or in conjunction with that of the related <italic>bhlhe41, mitfa,</italic> and <italic>mitfb</italic>, had no evident consequences on zebrafish RPE development, at least in our hands (data not shown). One possible reason for the absence of an evident RPE phenotype is functional redundancy with other untested members of the large family of the BHLH transcription factors or that the gene has only later functions as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2006</xref>). However, we favour the alternative possibility that zebrafish RPE specification does not occur stepwise as in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez-Morales et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fuhrmann et al., 2014</xref>) but ‘en bloc’ with an almost simultaneous activation of all differentiation genes. This would make the inactivation of one or two genes insufficient to perturb fate acquisition. Such a mechanism is expected to provide robustness to a process that takes place in just few hours and finds support in present and past findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cechmanek and McFarlane, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, we and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cechmanek and McFarlane, 2017</xref> have shown that, by the time the OV starts to bend, the large majority of RPE cells have already left the cell cycle and have acquired a differentiated squamous morphology by undergoing a marked surface enlargement in the medio-lateral direction and a reduction of the apico-basal axis. The net result is an overall modest volume increase. Furthermore, blocking cell division as the OC forms does not interfere with RPE expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cechmanek and McFarlane, 2017</xref>), strongly supporting a primary role of cell stretching in RPE expansion. Consistently, transcriptomic analysis shows that during this same lag of time, RPE cells repress genes characteristic of 16 hpf OV progenitors, such as <italic>vsx1</italic>, and acquire the expression of RPE-specific genes. These include blocks of transcription factors, such as known RPE specifiers (i.e. <italic>otx</italic>, <italic>mitf</italic>) and regulators of epidermal specification (i.e. <italic>tfap</italic> family members, known regulator of keratin gene expression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leask et al., 1991</xref>) as well as several cytoskeletal components, most prominently a large number of keratins and other desmosomal components found in squamous epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, in just few hours (from 16 to 18 hpf) RPE cells acquire the molecular machinery required for their conversion from a neuroepithelial to a squamous and likely highly coupled epithelium. Our study shows that this conversion relays on a tissue autonomous cytoskeletal reorganization without the influence of the morphogenetic events occurring in the nearby NR. Indeed, local interference with actomyosin or microtubule dynamics is sufficient to retain RPE cells into a cuboidal or neuroepithelial configuration, respectively, without affecting their specification. In contrast, localized interference with NR bending has no effect on RPE flattening. Notably, our studies also suggest that the RPE acts in a ‘syncytial-like’ manner, as mosaic interference with microtubule polymerization seems to impact in the shape of the adjacent cells if not on the entire tissue. This is perhaps not surprising given that mature RPE cells have been reported to be chemically coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pearson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the presumptive RPE of the chick (unpublished observations) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>) expresses high levels of connexion proteins (i.e. Gap-43), which are responsible for the ‘syncytial-like’ behaviour observed in brain astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buskila et al., 2019</xref>). This together with the additional observation that st18 RPE cells express many desmosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>) indicate that the tissue becomes tightly connected very soon, perhaps behaving as a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurdon, 1988</xref>).</p><p>The extreme flattening of the zebrafish RPE cells makes the resolution of their cytoskeletal components difficult with in vivo confocal microscopy, hampering the complete understanding of how the actomyosin cytoskeleton promotes the acquisition of a squamous configuration. In other contexts, a flat morphology is associated with the presence of acto-myosin stress fibres that compress the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vishavkarma et al., 2014</xref>). Myosin II is essential for this compressive role and its inhibition with blebbistatin causes the loss of the flat morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vishavkarma et al., 2014</xref>), as we have observed in blebbistatin- and Ableb-treated embryos. It is thus possible that a similar nuclear compression may occur in the RPE cells as they flatten, although we were unable to detect stress fibres around the nucleus, likely due to plasma membrane proximity. Remodelling of the microtubular cytoskeleton seems to aid further RPE cell flattening. Microtubules change their orientation during RPE morphogenesis, from being aligned along the apico-basal axis of the cells at the onset of RPE morphogenesis, to becoming aligned with the planar axis in squamous RPE cells. A similar process has been described during the morphogenesis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> amnioserosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pope and Harris, 2008</xref>), in which cells also change from a columnar to a squamous morphology. In these cells, actin accumulation at the apical edge seems to provide resistance to the elongation of microtubules, which thus bend, leading to a 90° rotation of all subcellular components. This rotation is accompanied by a myosin-dependent remodelling of the adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pope and Harris, 2008</xref>), a process that may also take place during RPE flattening.</p><p>Although additional studies are needed to clarify the precise dynamics of the cytoskeletal reorganization underlying RPE differentiation, our study demonstrates that cytoskeletal dynamics occurs in a tissue autonomous manner. In contrast to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicolas-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>), we have used a photoactivable version of blebbistatin that has allowed us to determine the individual contribution of the NR and RPE to OV folding. As a drawback, this approach allows to activate the drug only in relatively small patches of tissue. It was thus rather remarkable to observe that failure of RPE flattening in small regions was sufficient to decrease OV folding. This suggests that RPE stretching represents an additional and relevant mechanical force that, together with retinal basal constriction and rim involution, contributes to zebrafish eye morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This flattening and stretching together with a substantial expression of keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>) may confer a particular mechanical strength to the zebrafish RPE, which, in turn, may constrain the NR at the same time favouring rim involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>). The latter possibility is supported by the observation that inner layer cells seem to accumulate at the hinge in the absence of RPE flattening. Alternatively, this accumulation may simply reflect that rim cell involution depends on intrinsic microtubule polymerization, although previous studies have discarded this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>). These marked morphogenetic rearrangements can thus be seen as an efficient solution adopted in fast-developing species to make eye morphogenesis feasible in a period that does not allow for proliferation-based tissue growth.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of species-specific modes of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) differentiation and its contribution to optic vesicle (OV) folding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The drawing on the top represent the dynamic of OV folding into an optic cup (OC).

In zebrafish, the RPE enlarges its surface by cell stretching; in amniotes, including in humans, the RPE instead expands by cell proliferation with a less pronounced need of cell flattening.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63396-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The perhaps obvious question is whether similar morphogenetic rearrangements are needed in other vertebrates to form the remarkably conserved cup shape of the eye. So far, rim involution has been reported only in teleost species where it may represent a fast mode of increasing the surface of the inner layer of the OV, thus favouring its bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). This idea is well in agreement with previous data showing that between 16 and 27 hpf the number of cells in the outer layer of the OV decreases from about 587 to 432, whereas that of the inner layer increases in a way that cannot be explained solely by proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). In other species, this cell displacement may not be needed as the layer can grow by cell division. In a similar way, we have shown here that in slower developing species, RPE cells maintain a higher proliferation rate that contributes substantially to the increase of RPE surface while undergoing less marked changes in cell shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This correlation is visible in medaka, despite its relative evolutionary proximity to zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furutani-Seiki and Wittbrodt, 2004</xref>), and is maximal in human embryos. Indeed, in humans, the RPE layer is composed of cells with a neuroepithelial appearance and a high proliferation rate, despite the expression of OTX2, considered a tissue specifier. Thus, in mammals, full commitment of the OV outer layer to an RPE identity may occur over a prolonged period of time and not ‘en bloc’ as in zebrafish, as suggested by comparing RNA-seq data of RPE cells from human CS13–16 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2019</xref>) with those from equivalent stages in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>). Human RPE cells from CS13 to CS16 embryos are still enriched in the expression of proliferation associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2019</xref>) but not of those typical of squamous epithelia as in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buono et al., 2021</xref>). A slow acquisition of RPE identity may also explain why, in mice, inactivation of genes such as <italic>Otx2</italic>, <italic>Mitf,</italic> or <italic>Yap</italic> causes the RPE layer to adopt NR characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez-Morales et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen and Arnheiter, 2000</xref>), whereas this feature that has never been reported after equivalent manipulations in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lane and Lister, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miesfeld et al., 2015</xref>), or why FGF8 can push the amniote but not the zebrafish RPE layer to acquire an NR identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez-Morales et al., 2005</xref>). As a reflection of this slower differentiation in amniotes, RPE cells can largely retain their neuroepithelial morphology and adopt a final cuboidal – but not squamous – appearance at a slower and species-specific pace.</p><p>We thus propose that RPE cell stretching vs. cell addition are different solutions adopted by species with different rates of development to reach a common goal: an appropriate equilibrium between the surface of the RPE and that of the NR. Indeed, the present study together with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carpenter et al., 2015</xref>) and in silico models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okuda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eiraku et al., 2012</xref>) support that this equilibrium is a prerequisite for proper OV folding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>bhlhe40</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSEMBL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSDARG0000004060</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ref. 28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type, adult cab strain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CBMSO fish room</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">NBRP Medaka (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/">https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/</ext-link>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type BALB/c</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CBMSO animal facility</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services">https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adult wild-type AB/tupl strain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CBMSO fish room</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZIRC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zebrafish.org/home/guide.ph">https://zebrafish.org/home/guide.ph</ext-link>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg(E1-bhlhe40:GFP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transgenic line generated in this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Details in Materials and methods, ‘Generation of the Tg(E1-bhlhe40:GFP) line’ section</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg(rx3:Gal4-VP16;UAS:GFP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22819672">22819672</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZFIN Cat# ZDB-GENO-121105-83, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:ZFIN_ZDB-GENO-121105-83">ZFIN_ZDB-GENO-121105-83</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ref. 48</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Paraffin sections of human embryonic eye primordia</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human Dev.

The percentage of RPE proliferating progenitors was determined as the proportion of BrdU-positive cells over the total number of GFP (for E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) or Otx2/Hoechst (medaka fish, chick, mouse embryos) positive cells in the RPE layer in each section. A minimum of three embryos and sections per embryo were counted (both eyes).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Zebrafish embryos at the corresponding stage for each experiment were fixed with 4% (wt/vol) PFA (Merck) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer overnight at 4°C. Whole-mount immunofluorescence was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cardozo et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, embryos were incubated in 15% sucrose – PBS overnight at 4°C, embedded in 7.5% gelatine (Sigma) 15% sucrose (Merck), frozen in isopentane (PanReac) between –30°C and –40°C and kept at –80°C. Cryo-sectioning was performed with a cryostat (Leica CM 1950) at 20 µm thickness and dried overnight at room temperature. Chick and mouse embryos were collected, fixed 4% PFA, equilibrated in sucrose, and cryo-sectioned as above. Paraffin sections of human embryonic tissue were de-paraffinized, washed in PBS, processed for antigen retrieval (10 mM citrate buffer, pH6, for 5 min at 110°C in a boiling chamber, Biocaremedical), and subsequently processed together with all other samples for immunofluorescence. Immunostaining was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cardozo et al., 2014</xref>) using the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-BrdU (1:200; Becton-Dickinson); chick anti-GFP (1:2000; Abcam); mouse anti-βcatenin (1:400, BD Transduction Laboratories); mouse anti-ZO-1 (1:400, Invitrogen); rabbit anti-laminin (1:200, Sigma); rabbit anti-Otx2 antibodies (1:1000; Abcam); rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:500, Abcam). The used secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa-488, Alexa-594, or Alexa-647 (1:500; Thermo Fisher). Sections were counterstained with Hoechst (Invitrogen), mounted in Mowiol, and analysed by conventional and confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Kaede photoconversion</title><p>Wild-type embryos were injected with Kaede mRNA. Embryos at 15 hpf with homogeneous green fluorescence were selected, mounted, and visualized under the Nikon AR1+ Confocal Microscope using a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn in the outer layer, corresponding to the putative position of the RPE progenitors, at a specific z-position and irradiated with the 405 nm laser at 21% of power for 10 loops to switch Kaede emission from green to red fluorescence. Due to confocality, photoconversion occasionally extended further than the selected plane, so that the tissues present above or below (i.e. ectoderm) also underwent photoconversion. After photoconversion embryos were let develop up to approximately 30 hpf stage, fixed and analysed by confocal microscopy for red fluorescence distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ableb photoactivation</title><p>Ableb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kepiro et al., 2012</xref>) was photoactivated with a Zeiss LSM 780 Upright multiphoton FLIM system with a W Plan-Apochromat 20×/1.0 DIC M27 75 mm WD 1.8 mm dipping objective. For each eye a specific ROI was drawn including RPE cells identified by GFP fluorescence.

RPE surface renderings were generated using Imaris (Bitplane), with a value of 6 in Surface Area Detail and 7 in Background Subtraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Morphometric analysis</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, morphometric analysis of cells and tissues was performed using Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) using the XYZ coordinates of the processed images or Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis was performed using previously processed fluorescent images from videos of Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP; <italic>rx3</italic>:GAL4;UAS:RFP) or Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) and H2B-RFP-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>), from which the signal corresponding to the RPE or the whole OV/OC were isolated semi-manually with the help of Fiji macros and tools designed to select 3D structures. The RPE-specific GFP signal was processed with a median filter. In the case of <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>, the background ramp for the GFP signal was neutralized in each frame via subtraction of a copy of itself after a grey-scale morphological operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hassanpour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arce, 2005</xref>). For all videos, the median intensity was thereafter established as the cutoff value for differentiating background and signal (i.e. pixel with an intensity lower than the cutoff were set to zero) for all images that were in both videos. The signal derived from H2B was localized in cell nuclei, and therefore it was post-processed with a grey-scale closing operation to fill empty spaces between nuclei. Morphometric analysis was performed in the resulting processed images. All values were calculated in microns by scaling the x, y, z coordinates according to the following: (0.62 μm × 0.62 μm × 1.37 μm) for <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref> and (0.62 μm × 0.62 μm × 1.07 μm) for <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>. Volumes (μm<sup>3</sup>) were calculated as the number of voxels with a value higher than 0. RPE surface (μm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated applying a second-order linear adjustment on the plane YZ corresponding to the plane of the OV/OC hinges with the fit function available in Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). RPE thickness (μm) was determined as the result of volume (μm<sup>3</sup>)/surface (μm<sup>2</sup>). Unfortunately, semi-manual RPE image extraction was not perfect, when GFP signal associated to CMZ development arises. To account for this problem, the GFP signal for each frame was divided into seven equivalent blocks using the x, y coordinates from the z-projection of each frame. In this case, RPE volume and surface were calculated independently in each one of the regions up to 20 hpf, when the most anterior block (now corresponding to the arising CMZ) was discarded from the analysis. For the subsequent frames the two anterior most blocks were discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The total OV/OC volume (μm<sup>3</sup>) was determined using the red fluorescence from the Tg(rx3:GAL4;UAS:RFP) embryos at 17–22hpf. H2B expression was used to determine the volume of the OC (H2B volume in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as follows for each frame of <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>: the maximum, Gaussian blur and minimum filters were applied to the image; subsequently, the convex hull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992</xref>) was calculated for the image to obtain the geometrical shape that covers all pixels with an intensity higher than 0, including the lens; finally, only the regions present in the image and the convex hull are used to define the H2B volume. Individual cell area was determined in cells located at a medial position of the OV for each cell type (progenitor, RPE, and NR); cell contour was drawn using the segmented line tool in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Apico-basal (A-B) length (µm) of individual cells was estimated by manually tracing a line from the basal to the apical membrane in the z-position in which the nucleus had its larger surface using the straight-line tool in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To account for possible developmental asynchrony when eyes from the same embryo were differentially treated (irradiated vs. non-irradiated), the A-B length of the irradiated eye was normalized with that of the non-irradiated eye. Values above 1 indicated less RPE cell flattening in experimental eyes. The invagination angle was determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidhaye and Norden, 2017</xref>) using manual drawing with the Fiji angle tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The vertex of the angle was placed approximately in the centre of the basal surface of the NR and the vectors were drawn up to the edges of the CMZ. Angles were measured in the z-positions in which the irradiated RPE was maximally affected and compared to equivalent positions of control non-irradiated eyes. Values were normalized with those of the contralateral non-treated eye, to account for possible asynchronies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0.

There is lost opportunity however, in that neither Gal4 nor Cre / CreERT2 lines were not also developed. This would have been useful in better parsing the interactions between RPE and NR progenitors. Still, experiments described in their paper convincingly demonstrate the RPE cell flattening in zebrafish occurs independent of the basal constriction / apical expansion of the NR progenitors cells. They also convincingly show that this process is affected when either the actomyosin activity or microtubule organization is perturbed. These are outstanding starting observations to provide a deeper understanding of RPE and optic cup morphogenesis, but given the limited scope of the analysis, this work is better suited for a more specialized journal.

This is particularly important given the use of a the rx3 promoter which expresses in both RPE and NR progenitors. Finally, given the migration of RPE cells, those that are isolated from non-expressing NR may have shortly before been quite proximal to NR that did express STMN1. A more elegant approach to distinguish the autonomous from non-autonomous effects would be to use promoters more specific to each cell type (such as the E1-bhlhe40 element for RPE).<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the present work, Moreno-Mármol and colleagues investigate the morphological changes of RPE cells during optic cup formation in zebrafish. Using a novel transgenic line that allows them to follow the process in 4D and from earlier stages than previously available lines, they show that RPE cells in zebrafish stretch during optic vesicle folding. Following a number of elegant approaches, they show an autonomous process happening in the RPE that accompanies the NR folding, and speculate that RPE flattening is an evolutionary adaptation due to the fast dynamics of the process. Finally they show comparative data using other vertebrates that develop slower – in what is perhaps the highest point of the manuscript – revealing a different strategy that involves a sustained proliferation of RPE cells; the additional number of cells, therefore, allows for the RPE covering the folding NR without the need of such a massive stretching.</p><p>I have some points that I would like the authors to address.</p><p>#1 It is clear from their results that flattening can occur in RPE cells regardless of OC folding (Figure 4J). But is it a driving force for the OC folding? I was left with the impression that the authors are ambiguous about it. Their interpretation from figure 5F is that retina can still fold in the absence of RPE flattening (although the OC folding is far from a control case). In 5J, however, they conclude that flattening is indeed affecting NR invagination. A unifying quantification of the NR folding (as presented in Figure 4) would help assessing the role of RPE flattening as a driving force for OC folding in zebrafish. In general, I would like to see a clearer statement on the co-occurence of both processes in the RPE and NR. Are both of them tissue-autonomous? Are they independent of each other? Or is there some degree of inter-dependance, and at what level does it happen?</p><p>#2 Section &quot;RPE flattening is a cell autonomous process required for proper OV folding&quot;. The authors show that RPE cell flattening is a tissue autonomous process, not a cell autonomous process. The experiments illustrated in Figure 4 report an all-or-non response in the RPE. Form the experiments shown on lines 275-276 (UAS:stmn1), it seems that the flattening effect is non cell autonomous. In fact, the authors use during the discussion &quot;tissue autonomous&quot;, which is more accurate. The authors should either demonstrate cell autonomy by generating a mosaic RPE in the experiments of figure 4, or change their statement to tissue autonomy. If they go for tissue autonomy (as their experiments demonstrate), please discuss about the non-cell autonomy of the flattening response.</p><p>#3 The experiments using UAS:stmn1 shown that, although the expression is clonal and targets only a few RPE cells, the non-flattening effects involved pretty much the entire RPE (Figure 5H). Is the RPE responding as one unit? Along the manuscript there is no case in which the RPE responds in a mosaic manner. Why is that? The authors leave this point unexplored. If RPE cells are coordinated in their response, how does it happen? Any hint in this regard will help framing the results in a better context.</p><p>#4 The data obtained by using UAS:ccnd1 contrasts with the quality of the other results shown along the manuscript. It is not clear to me whether the forced expression of ccnd1 is indeed promoting proliferation in this system (the authors should provide this data to validate the tool), nor whether the reported differences (52.5% vs 47.5%) are significant or not. They seem too small differences to be responsible of the reported phenotype. Given the FO mosaic approach implemented, the authors could rapidly assess more candidates to drive sustained proliferation in RPE cells. Being the last part of the manuscript about other species that resolve the same problem in a different manner – i.e., adding more cells rather than stretching the existing ones – I find this to be a critical point that needs to be shown clearly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Stretching of the retinal pigment epithelium contributes to zebrafish optic cup morphogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors describe a novel tool [Tg(E1-bhlhe40:GFP)] that can be used to monitor the earliest phases of zebrafish RPE development. Ideally, some experiments would have been better performed using promoters that drive gene expression specifically in RPE and NR progenitors, as opposed to the rx3 promoter which expresses in both cell types.

I highly encourage the Authors to follow through with updates on the planned experiments and the results as a &quot;Research Advance&quot; to be associated with this paper.<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the revised version of their manuscript, Moreno-Mármol and colleagues have addressed most of the main concerns I had raised. The authors have improved their previous versions by emphasising the main concept of the work and providing a better explanation for their hypothesis. Overall, the work now describes the inter-relation between the NR and the RPE during retinogenesis, highlighting that morphological changes occurring in the zebrafish RPE are critical for the retina morphogenesis. The authors report that species in which the RPE stretching does nor occur show an increase RP proliferation, suggesting two alternative ways to coordinate the grow of RPE and NR. The observation stays descriptive, since the attempts from the authors to switch stretching-to-proliferation modes in zebrafish were not successful – see recommendation for authors below.</p><p>One of my main points was to provide more accuracy in the &quot;cell-autonomous&quot; effect of RPE cells. The authors have now changed their statement to a &quot;tissue-autonomous&quot; effects, which in my view fits better the data they have acquired. The idea of the RPE behaving in a syncytial-like manner is very interesting indeed, and the discussion has been enriched by this addition.</p><p>The one point I do not find satisfactory addressed is the one concerning over-expression of ccnd1 in RPE cells – the point that sets the basis for the &quot;proliferation-OR-stretching&quot;. This is a point that was raised as well by reviewer 1; it was weak in the previous version and has not improved during the revision. I consider the experiment to be critical, in light of the exciting results the authors provide for different species. The generation of a new transgenic line is an enterprise that can take longer that the time allowed for a revision, but I understand that the authors already have the tools to go for it? (&quot;… a new construct we have developed&quot;). Furthermore, the mosaic approach followed by the authors in their initial submission allows the analysis in the injected generation and therefore within days, so I would have expected this point to be tackled experimentally. In their current form, the lines 320 to 330 are the most problematic of the entire manuscript, since they show only a weak trend (and not a &quot;small increase&quot; in proliferation, since the statistical analysis indicates that the differences are not significative). Presenting additional data in a subsequent &quot;Research Advance&quot; seems adequate for other experiments required by reviewer 1 and myself, but I feel this point is central to the story and I can not picture major problems in performing transient experiments to strengthen the proposed statement – keeping the proliferative state impairs RPE flattening. Is it realistic that the authors perform a transient over-expression of ccnd1 using an RPE specific promoter? – a construct they already have. If the authors are experiencing restrictions to the lab due to the pandemic and it is not possible to perform additional experiments, then I would suggest removing the lines 320 to 330. The manuscript would miss an interesting, important aspect but will gain in accuracy.</p><p>I would strongly encourage the authors to tackle this point in the present version of the manuscript, though. If so, I would ask the authors to consider reporting this dataset at the end of the manuscript – after the report on the difference species in Figure 7. In this manner, they could show: (a) first, the inverse correlation between flattening and proliferation across vertebrates, (b) then prove that in one model species the switch can be induced experimentally.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63396.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In their study, Moreno-Marmol and colleagues describe the general morphogenic rearrangements of zebrafish RPE cells during optic cup formation.

Unfortunately, the result was not satisfactory, as the line did not show the expected specificity, in retrospect, likely due to a problem of insulators. This is why we resorted to the use of the rx3:Gal4-line. To overcome such a problem, we have now taken a different approach and modified the original plasmid that we used to generate the Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP) line so that now we can use it to overexpress any gene of interest in the RPE. We have already verified that the new construct faithfully reproduces the pattern of the Tg(E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP), and we have further used it to generate new transgenic lines. We will exploit this construct to force STMN1 and <italic>ccnd1</italic> expression in the RPE as detailed below. However, these experiments will require several months and therefore, following the indication of the Editor, we will report them as a “Research Advances” later on, linking the obtained results to this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Substantive Concerns:</p><p>1.

We therefore used H2B to counterstain the optic primordium. Although a cytoplasmic marker would have avoided the process of artificially “filling the gaps”, H2B provided a bright and reliable signal. The methods used to fill the gaps and infer the volume of the whole eye primordium are explained in the “morphometric analysis” section of the methods section together with the procedures used to quantify the entire eye volume. The approach that we took has been carefully designed and does not affect the rigor of the analysis. We have now re-written and clarified this description (page 21-22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For the experiment described in Figure 4, inactivation of myosinII (ABleb irradiation) appears to have a stronger effect on RPE in the ventral part of the eye.

Inactiviation of actomyosin function at several stages might be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in the ABleb experiment the most severe alterations were observed in the RPE cells closer to the ventral region. As we now indicate in the text (page 8) this is likely because cells flatten and spread in the medio-lateral direction, exactly following the “pinwheel movement” described by Kwan et al., (2012 Development) -to which we believe the reviewer refers to. We cannot exclude that cell movements do exist and contribute to the localization of the cells ventrally. However, RPE cells spreading may give the impression of “migration”.</p><p>The reviewer also suggests interfering with actomyosin at several stages. There is a technical and a conceptual reason why we have not done so. We cannot assess the effect at earlier stages as we rely on the onset of expression of E1-<italic>bhlhe40</italic>:GFP to identify RPE cells, whereas at later stages the optic vesicle is already folded and the RPE already flattened, making it very challenging to irradiate exclusively RPE cells and in sufficient number. Besides, the question we addressed in our manuscript focuses on the contribution of RPE morphogenesis to OV folding. We expect that once the optic cup is formed, interference with RPE cytoskeleton will have only a minor impact on the overall shape of the eye.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. With regard to use of the bidirectional UAS constructs that facilitated expression of STMN1 or CCND1, how faithful is the concordance of GFP and STMN1 or CCND1 protein?</p></disp-quote><p>The bidirectional UAS construct we have used was originally described in Paquet et al., 2009, J Clin Inv. 119, 1382–1395 and then further used in Distel et al., 2010, J Cell Biol. 191, 875–90 and Distel et al., 2011, Commun Integr Biol. 4, 336-9. In the original publication, Paquet et al., show that the bidirectional UAS efficiently express both of the tested proteins at similar levels, although they did not perform an explicit stoichiometric analysis. This vector has been successfully used in several additional publications (see https://zfin.org/ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-111028-1 for a list). We are thus confident that there is concordance between GFP and either <italic>STMN1</italic> or <italic>ccnd1</italic> expression. To clarify this point we now mention how the vector works in the corresponding section in methods (page 18) and in results (page 8). We also added the reference of Paquet et al., not included in our previous version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, is it possible that low expressing cells (faint or undetectable GFP), still produce enough STMN1 or CCND1 protein to affect microtubule network / proliferation, even if stoichiometrically produced with GFP?

However, we have not done so in this manuscript as we felt and still feel that asking whether the RPE behaves in “syncytial-like” manner was somewhat distracting from the main question of the present manuscript: does RPE stretching contribute to OV folding? Although at present we can just offer a speculation, we believe that the RPE indeed acts in a “syncytial-like” manner. This kind of behavior is for example observed among astrocytes, which, through a Gap-43 mediated connections, can propagate Ca<sup>++</sup> waves in the brain (see, Buskila et al., 2019, Front. Neurosci. 13, 1125; for a review). In unpublished results, we have observed that Gap-43 is one of the earliest markers of RPE cells in different species. This expression is maintained at adult stages when gap junctions connecting RPE cells have been described (Kerr et al., IVOS 2010; Hoang et al., 2010, Mol Vis). Likely these connections are responsible of the described chemically coupling observed in RPE cells and the propagation of Ca<sup>++</sup> waves, as observed in astrocytes (Pearson et al., 2004, Eur J Neurosci; Bao et al., 2019, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci). In addition, in a parallel study (Buono et al., 2020, in the ref list), we have shown that st18 RPE cells already express many desmosomal proteins, indicating that the cells establish tight connections very soon. These connections promote cohesion that in other contexts, as for example zebrafish epiboly (i.e Song et al., 2013, Dev Cell 24: 486–501; Petridou et al., 2019 Nat Cell Biol 21: 169–178; Camacho-Macorra et al., 2020, bioRxiv doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407478), are known to promote coordinated cell spreading. Such a coordinated behavior seems to occur also in the RPE. Finally, it might be worth mentioning that the existence of “a community effect” during embryonic development has been described decades ago for different tissues, including the eye (Gurdon, 1988, Nature, 336, 772-4). We have included some of these ideas in the discussion to provide an answer to the reviewer questions (page 14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#4 The data obtained by using UAS:ccnd1 contrasts with the quality of the other results shown along the manuscript. It is not clear to me whether the forced expression of ccnd1 is indeed promoting proliferation in this system (the authors should provide this data to validate the tool), nor whether the reported differences (52.5% vs 47.5%) are significant or not. They seem too small differences to be responsible of the reported phenotype. Given the FO mosaic approach implemented, the authors could rapidly assess more candidates to drive sustained proliferation in RPE cells. Being the last part of the manuscript about other species that resolve the same problem in a different manner – i.e., adding more cells rather than stretching the existing ones – I find this to be a critical point that needs to be shown clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. As mentioned in our answer to reviewer 1 (point 1) we will repeat this experiment using RPE specific overexpression of <italic>ccnd1</italic> with a new construct we have developed. With this approach we will also use different genes that may force RPE proliferation. However, as we mentioned the results of these experiments will be reported later as a Research advance. Nevertheless, the use of the UAS:<italic>ccnd1</italic> construct shows that its forced expression prevents cell flattening and interferes <italic>bhlhe40</italic> expression, although the data related to forced proliferation are weak with no statistical significance (now indicated in the text), likely due to the limited number of embryos we could analyze.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The authors describe a novel tool [Tg(E1-bhlhe40:GFP)] that can be used to monitor the earliest phases of zebrafish RPE development. Ideally, some experiments would have been better performed using promoters that drive gene expression specifically in RPE and NR progenitors, as opposed to the rx3 promoter which expresses in both cell types. Still, experiments described in their paper convincingly demonstrate the RPE cell flattening in zebrafish occurs independent of the basal constriction / apical expansion of the NR progenitors cells. They also convincingly show that this process is affected when either the actomyosin activity or microtubule organization is perturbed. These are outstanding starting observations to provide a deeper understanding of RPE and optic cup morphogenesis. This study sets the stage for more in depth analysis of E1-bhlhe40 activation and conservation across species, as well as a more detailed mechanisms into the cytoskeletal regulation and reorganization required for RPE cell flattening.</p><p>The Authors have adequately addressed my concerns and the paper reads very nicely. Ideally, the cell type specific expression experiments would be included in this version, but experimental challenges and time to generate the new lines are appreciated. I highly encourage the Authors to follow through with updates on the planned experiments and the results as a &quot;Research Advance&quot; to be associated with this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and her/his appreciation of the experimental challenges associated with the generation of new zebrafish line. As we explain below in our answer to reviewer 3, so far, we have been unable to generate new lines limiting the expression of specific genes to the RPE. In particular, we failed to force proliferation in the RPE, likely because this tissue differentiates “en bloc”, as we suggest in our manuscript (see also below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the revised version of their manuscript, Moreno-Mármol and colleagues have addressed most of the main concerns I had raised. The authors have improved their previous versions by emphasising the main concept of the work and providing a better explanation for their hypothesis. Overall, the work now describes the inter-relation between the NR and the RPE during retinogenesis, highlighting that morphological changes occurring in the zebrafish RPE are critical for the retina morphogenesis. The authors report that species in which the RPE stretching does nor occur show an increase RP proliferation, suggesting two alternative ways to coordinate the grow of RPE and NR. The observation stays descriptive, since the attempts from the authors to switch stretching-to-proliferation modes in zebrafish were not successful – see recommendation for authors below.</p><p>One of my main points was to provide more accuracy in the &quot;cell-autonomous&quot; effect of RPE cells. The authors have now changed their statement to a &quot;tissue-autonomous&quot; effects, which in my view fits better the data they have acquired. The idea of the RPE behaving in a syncytial-like manner is very interesting indeed, and the discussion has been enriched by this addition.</p><p>The one point I do not find satisfactory addressed is the one concerning over-expression of ccnd1 in RPE cells – the point that sets the basis for the &quot;proliferation-OR-stretching&quot;. This is a point that was raised as well by reviewer 1; it was weak in the previous version and has not improved during the revision. I consider the experiment to be critical, in light of the exciting results the authors provide for different species. The generation of a new transgenic line is an enterprise that can take longer that the time allowed for a revision, but I understand that the authors already have the tools to go for it? (&quot;… a new construct we have developed&quot;). Furthermore, the mosaic approach followed by the authors in their initial submission allows the analysis in the injected generation and therefore within days, so I would have expected this point to be tackled experimentally. In their current form, the lines 320 to 330 are the most problematic of the entire manuscript, since they show only a weak trend (and not a &quot;small increase&quot; in proliferation, since the statistical analysis indicates that the differences are not significative). Presenting additional data in a subsequent &quot;Research Advance&quot; seems adequate for other experiments required by reviewer 1 and myself, but I feel this point is central to the story and I can not picture major problems in performing transient experiments to strengthen the proposed statement – keeping the proliferative state impairs RPE flattening. Is it realistic that the authors perform a transient over-expression of ccnd1 using an RPE specific promoter? – a construct they already have. If the authors are experiencing restrictions to the lab due to the pandemic and it is not possible to perform additional experiments, then I would suggest removing the lines 320 to 330. The manuscript would miss an interesting, important aspect but will gain in accuracy.</p><p>I would strongly encourage the authors to tackle this point in the present version of the manuscript, though. If so, I would ask the authors to consider reporting this dataset at the end of the manuscript – after the report on the difference species in Figure 7. In this manner, they could show: (a) first, the inverse correlation between flattening and proliferation across vertebrates, (b) then prove that in one model species the switch can be induced experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern and agree with her/him that the results we reported of forced cell proliferation in the zebrafish RPE were rather weak. We also felt that forcing proliferation in the zebrafish RPE would have allowed to “switch the zebrafish RPE” to “an amniote RPE”. We also could “not picture major problems in performing transient experiments to strengthen the proposed statement”, as the reviewer indicates. We proved ourselves wrong and perhaps for reasons that, eventually, should have been evident. To manipulate gene expression specifically in the forming RPE, we modified the original <italic>E1-bhlhe40:GFP</italic> construct contained in the ZED vector, replacing the GFP sequence for a multicloning site that allows for insertion of any gene of interest. To test that this modification did not interfere with tissue specificity, we re-inserted GFP and generated F0 embryos, in which the fluorescent signal was detected only in RPE cells. We then generated and injected an <italic>E1-bhlhe40:ccnd1-HA</italic> construct and determined the expression of cyclin D1 with antibodies against the HA tag. When the construct was injected in the embryos, we could detect only very few and sparse HA-positive cells in the RPE of the folding OV. These cells incorporated also EdU, although this was not always the case. More importantly, the large majority of HA+/EdU+ cells we detected were isolated and only very rarely we have observed small clusters of HA positive cells (2 or 4, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), strongly suggesting that despite cyclin D1 expression cells were unable to undergo a mitotic division. However, when they did, the RPE became “distorted” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We have injected hundreds of embryos, analyzing them at slightly different time points, thinking that a specific time window was needed. However, the results were very similar across all time windows and clusters of 2/4 cells were rare. By injecting the construct in the already available Tg(E1-bhlhe40:GFP) line, we have observed that <italic>ccnd1-HA</italic> presence is associated with the lack of <italic>bhlhe40</italic> reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting that the absence of enhancer activation may preclude further cyclin D1 expression. To our surprise, we have not been able to find viable funders when we attempted to raise a stable transgenic Tg(<italic>E1-bhlhe40:ccnd1-HA</italic>) line, which needed several months. We have crossed already a large number of grown up fishes with no success.</p><p>Although we cannot exclude that a different experimental design may provide the expected results, we have concluded that expression of a single proliferative gene (even as strong as <italic>ccdn1</italic>) is insufficient to force cell proliferation in the RPE. The best explanation is likely because the RPE differentiates “en bloc”, explaining why, at difference of the amniote RPE, the zebrafish one has not been reported to acquire a neural retina fate, as we discuss in our manuscript. Further explanations may relate to the lack of the enhancer activity as we have explained above, or because forced proliferation induces rapid cell death preventing the expansion of cell proliferation. Some apoptotic cells were for example observed when we used the <italic>UAS:ccd1</italic> in the <italic>Rx3Gal4</italic> line, perhaps explaining, in retrospective, the weak results.</p><p>Whatever the reason might be, we cannot provide the evidence that we (and the reviewer) were seeking for. We have thus taken the reviewer’ suggestion of removing lines 320 to 330 from the manuscript (the description of forced expression of cyclin D1). Although frustrating, this seems the easiest option. To reinforce the message that proliferation has a limited contribution to RPE enlargement, we have emphasized an experiment performed by the lab of S. McFarlane (ref 22) in which they show that blocking cell proliferation has no effect of the enlargement of the RPE.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effects observed after tissue specific overexpression of ccnd1 in the RPE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frontal cryostat section of 21 hpf Tg(<italic>E1-bhlhe40:GFP</italic>) embryo injected with the <italic>E1-bhlhe40:ccnd1-HA</italic> construct and immunestained for HA (magenta).
