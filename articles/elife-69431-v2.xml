Acute inflammation is tightly coordinated and begins with the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include toll-ike receptors (TLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Medzhitov and Janeway, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). These initial steps are followed by the activation of sequestered transcription factors (TFs), such as nuclear factor of kappa-B (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which orchestrate pro-inflammatory and antiviral response signals involved in pathogen clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). Once pathogens are cleared, macrophages express genes involved in the resolution of inflammation to return the host to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamidzadeh et al., 2017</xref>). Dysregulation of these pro-inflammatory pathways can have devastating consequences, leading to unresolved inflammation and chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the process of alternative splicing has emerged as another key mechanism by which the immune system is regulated. Alternative splicing is a regulated process enabling a single gene to produce many isoforms, thus increasing the complexity of gene function and the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boudreault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ivanov and Anderson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Much of this occurs in a cell-type-specific and signal-induced manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ergun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wells et al., 2006</xref>). Previous studies have shown that mouse and human macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli undergo alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Bruin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haque et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Janssen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pandya-Jones et al., 2013</xref>). Alternative splicing within the immune system can affect the type and magnitude of the inflammatory response, such as the production of a soluble form of TLR4 that is expressed upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which leads to inhibition of TNFα and NF-κB serving as a negative feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lynch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schaub and Glasmacher, 2017</xref>). Additionally, this mechanism has been characterized within signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blumhagen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shakola et al., 2015</xref>), including TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deng et al., 2008</xref>) and MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Arras and Alper, 2013</xref>), that produce the alternative RNA splice forms, TBK1s and MyD88s, respectively, which function to limit the extent of the pro-inflammatory response. Alternative splicing can also result in the production of inflammatory signaling molecules, such as TRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2010</xref>) and the proteins in the NFκB family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wells et al., 2006</xref>) with altered activity or stability. Beyond changing the ORF of an mRNA molecule, elongating or shortening the first or last exon can impact post-transcriptional gene regulation and are important to consider when elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of immune genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carpenter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ghiasvand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Leppek et al., 2018</xref>), specifically underlying motifs in 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Resch et al., 2009</xref>) and 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mariella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mayr, 2016</xref>).</p><p>While inflammation-induced alternative splicing in both human and mouse macrophages has been investigated on a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Bruin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haque et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Janssen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pandya-Jones et al., 2013</xref>), to our knowledge, long-read RNA-sequencing has not been utilized to generate a de novo transcriptome for primary murine macrophages. Such an approach is necessary to fully appreciate the extent of alternative transcript isoform usage as we know most transcriptome annotations are incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Workman et al., 2019</xref>) and isoforms generated are cell-type and treatment specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sapkota et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Weirather et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Workman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we used both long- and short-read RNA-sequencing to uncover novel isoforms and classes of alternative splicing events following inflammation in human and murine macrophages. Interestingly the dominant conserved class of alternative isoform usage observed following inflammation is alternative first exon (AFE) usage, which involves alternative transcription start sites (TSS) usage coupled with alternative splicing. AFE events can have multilevel effects on protein diversity, regulating genes through alterations of the 5′UTR region, and directing the locality of proteins through alternative N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Landry et al., 2003</xref>). We identified 95 unannotated AFE events in mice from native RNA-sequencing, one of which is in the cytosolic receptor for dsDNA and known inflammatory inducible gene, <italic>Aim2</italic>. We show that this unannotated AFE isoform of <italic>Aim2</italic> is the predominant isoform produced during inflammation and contains an iron-responsive element (IRE) in its 5′UTR, enabling mRNA translation to be controlled by iron levels. This work reveals that alternative transcript isoform usage plays a crucial role in shaping the transient nature of the inflammatory response. Isoform expression is an additional layer of regulation within the immune response and therefore a possible contributing factor to the development of auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. Understanding the exact isoforms of genes that are expressed during an inflammatory response will enable us to design better targets for therapeutic intervention of these diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global profiling of the cellular alternative splicing landscape in human and mouse macrophages post-inflammation</title><p>To identify alternative splicing events following inflammation, we performed whole transcriptome analysis on human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with and without LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In order to determine if there are additional splicing events that are not captured using the publicly available GENCODE M18 transcriptome annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garalde et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hsieh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pollard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Workman et al., 2019</xref>), we performed native RNA-sequencing of murine macrophages with and without LPS treatment to build a de novo murine macrophage specific transcriptome with an average read depth of 1 million. We identified isoforms using full-length alternative isoform analysis of RNA (FLAIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Workman et al., 2019</xref>) that also had promoter support identified from accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atianand et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tong et al., 2016</xref>). The FLAIR isoforms were then merged with the GENCODE M18 assembly (mm10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frankish et al., 2019</xref>) as a transcript reference to identify and quantify alternative splicing events using short-read sequencing, which has increased read depth, denoting this transcriptome as ‘GENCODE+ de novo’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Overall, the incorporation of long-read sequencing to generate a novel transcriptome led to the identification of 95 novel and statistically significant AFE events that occur following inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). A comparison of significant AS events between splicing events identified by using GENCODE M18 annotation and de novo FLAIR transcriptome shows an overall increase in the number of unique events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B,H</xref>). To gain confidence of the novel AFE events, we compared a comprehensive, 339 mouse sample, FANTOM CAGE-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">FANTOM Consortium and the RIKEN PMI and CLST (DGT), 2014</xref>) or annotated and unannotated TSSs as defined by the GENCODE M18 assembly. The caveat to this FANTOM data set is that there are no inflammatory stimulated samples. Even with this caveat, the analysis revealed the similarity of the distributions between CAGE scores associated with CAGE peaks overlapping known and those overlapping novel TSSs of FLAIR isoforms, further supporting the validity of the novel TSSs identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, we utilized a data set generated through application of machine learning methods to classify CAGE-seq peaks as true or false, where true corresponds to CAGE-seq peaks that overlap true TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kanamori-Katayama et al., 2011</xref>). Novel TSSs identified with FLAIR showed a 45% overlap with CAGE-seq peaks classified as true, providing us with confidence in the novel AFE events identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8C</xref>). Together these approaches provide us with confidence in the novel AFE events identified by direct RNA-seq.</p><p>Interestingly, when identifying gene expression changes, we found that ~50% of genes with AFE usage were not differentially expressed following inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6 supp7">Supplementary files 6–7</xref>), highlighting the importance of studying isoform usage for control of gene expression.

Predominant isoforms (≥10% of total gene expression in a sample) assembled from native RNA-sequencing with FLAIR identified the canonical isoform and five unannotated isoforms that use the inflammatory-activated promoter, revealing a new longer 5′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Native RNA-sequencing-based quantification provided additional support that the unannotated promoter usage is upregulated upon LPS stimulation. At steady state, approximately 20% of reads map to <italic>Aim2</italic>’s transcript with the canonical promoter and 65% of reads map to transcripts with the upstream promoter, while following inflammatory activation, 14% of the reads map to transcripts with the canonical promoter and 81% of reads map to transcripts with the upstream promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To validate the change in <italic>Aim2</italic> AFE usage upon LPS stimulation, RT-qPCR was performed using exon spanning primers that were either specific to the annotated AFE or the unannotated AFE, in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

However, iron repletion results in the inactivation of IRP1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Outten, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To experimentally test if the IRE motif within the unannotated 5′UTR acts as a translational repressor, we removed the element using site-directed mutagenesis, which led to an increase in GFP expression by ~20% compared to the annotated 5′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). Next, we exogenously added 100 µM ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to overload the cells with iron and determined if this can rescue the observed decrease in translational efficiency from our unannotated 5′UTR. Upon FAC administration, the relative GFP expression of the unannotated 5′UTR plasmid increased by ~50%, while mCherry control was unchanged, suggesting that the translational efficiency of the unannotated 5′UTR can be rescued with iron supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,K</xref>). From these results, we conclude that the predicted IRE motif within the unannotated 5′UTR of <italic>Aim2</italic> functions as an IRE to control translation.</p><p>To test if the IRE motif in the unannotated 5′UTR of <italic>Aim2</italic> acts as a translational regulator endogenously, we performed polysome profiling followed by RT-qPCR on primary BMDMs in the presence and absence of LPS for 18 hr to determine the translational competency of the isoforms of <italic>Aim2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L,M</xref>). As a negative control, we examined <italic>Neat1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nakagawa et al., 2014</xref>), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is not detected in polysomes, nor translated, and this is not dependent on LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). The relative distribution of our positive control gene, <italic>Gapdh</italic>, which encodes a highly expressed housekeeping protein, is enriched in the high polysome fraction, with or without LPS, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). Using isoform-specific primer sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) for the annotated and unannotated <italic>Aim2</italic> isoforms, we find that the annotated isoform is enriched in the high polysome fraction with and without LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>), while the novel isoform is enriched in the low polysome fraction with and without inflammatory stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>). Additionally, from our RNA-seq data we find that IRP1 and IRP2 are not transcriptionally regulated by inflammation, but based on Weiss et al. inflammation can affect the binding affinity of IRPs in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Weiss et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). These data show that the unannotated <italic>Aim2</italic> isoform has a lower translational efficiency compared to the canonical form.</p><p>To further validate the effect the post-transcriptional mechanism of the unannotated <italic>Aim2</italic> isoform, we performed time-course LPS stimulations. In primary BMDMs, a 72 hr, time-course stimulation with and without the treatment of iron (FAC) protein lysates was generated and Aim2 expression was measured by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R-S</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Aim2 is expressed basally and significantly decreases upon LPS treatment at the 48 hr time point, most likely as a control mechanism to return the pathway to homeostasis and limit the inflammatory stimulation. When FAC is added to cells, Aim2 expression does not decrease at the 48 hr time point suggesting that it is indeed the IRE that is driving this decrease in Aim2 observed in the wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R-S</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Finally, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to remove the Aim2 IRE endogenously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In these immortalized BMDMs, RT-qPCR was performed with an LPS time course. The annotated <italic>Aim2</italic> isoform shows no induction by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>), while the unannotated <italic>Aim2</italic> isoform and the CDS sequence are induced by twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D,E</xref>). There is no significant difference in transcriptional expression at the <italic>Aim2</italic> locus between the WT and IRE KO cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D,E</xref>).

At the 48 hr time point, there is a significant decrease in expression of Aim2 protein in WT cells, but not in the IRE KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4H</xref>), further indicating that endogenous Aim2 is regulated through the IRE motif located in the AFE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While we have come a long way in determining the transcriptomes of immune genes to better understand signaling pathways, very little work has focused on the role that mRNA isoforms play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Medzhitov and Janeway, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). Over 95% of genes have more than one mRNA transcript due to alternative splicing, but the regulatory importance of these splicing events is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carninci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). On a gene-by-gene approach, alternative splicing has been shown to play a role in health and disease by shaping the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nishiyama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">You et al., 2016</xref>). Globally, a number of labs have tackled the prevalence of alternative splicing in vitro and in vivo, showing that alternative splicing can affect both the nature and duration of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Janssen et al., 2020</xref>). To date, no one has examined the conservation of these mechanisms using primary cells or utilized long-read sequencing to build the transcriptome de novo to obtain a complete understanding of the extent of alternatively expressed isoforms generated following an immune response.</p><p>In our study, we demonstrate a conservation of splicing, specifically AFE events in both human and murine macrophages. We found that there are 11 genes that have AFE in both human and mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Most studies to date have focused on isoform changes linked to genes that are differentially expressed following inflammation, and interestingly these 11 genes would have been previously overlooked because many of them are not differentially expressed, emphasizing the importance in studying isoform expression in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Of the 11 conserved genes, 7 AFE isoforms have been previously studied in some context including <italic>Rps6ka1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Qin et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Ncoa7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Singer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Rcan1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pang et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Wars</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Miyanokoshi et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Arap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kulzer et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Tsc22d1</italic> (PMID:21448135), and <italic>Sgk1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteaga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kobayashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lang et al., 2006</xref>). While this validates our technique, it is important to note that none of these genes had been connected to inflammation or formally shown to be conserved mechanisms of regulation, besides <italic>Wars</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Miyanokoshi et al., 2013</xref>). This also highlights our method’s ability to accurately identify inflammatory regulated RNA isoforms, in addition to the uncharacterized AFE events of <italic>Ampd3</italic>, <italic>Snx10</italic>, <italic>Shisa5,</italic> and <italic>Tspan4</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>Snx10</italic> is studied outside the context of inflammation, has been implicated in chronic inflammatory disease, and our study may suggest new insights into how alternative splicing could be regulating these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">You et al., 2016</xref>). We further validated <italic>Ncoa7</italic>, <italic>Rcan1,</italic> and <italic>Ampd3</italic> in human and murine macrophages using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>To overcome the current limitations of any transcriptome build, we used direct RNA nanopore technology on primary murine macrophages to build our own transcriptome de novo with the aim of identifying novel full-length transcriptional isoforms that are expressed with and without inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Workman et al., 2019</xref>). The limitation of direct RNA-sequencing is read depth, and our average read depth was about 1 million reads per treatment. In a previous study of direct RNA-sequencing, we found that increased sequencing depth will result in additional isoforms detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Workman et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we expect to see additional unannotated AFE and other AS events with increased sequencing depth. However, even with 1 million reads, we were able to build a transcriptome that led to the identification of 154 novel AS events. Following this, we identified hundreds of novel isoforms resulting in 95 novel AFE events, supported by CAGE-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>), including an unannotated mRNA isoform of the well-studied gene protein absent in melanoma 2 (<italic>Aim2</italic>).</p><p><italic>Aim2</italic> is characterized as an interferon-inducible gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnstone and Trapani, 1999</xref>) (PMID:10454530), functioning as a cytoplasmic dsDNA sensor leading to the formation of an inflammasome and eventual cleavage and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines of IL1β and IL18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bürckstümmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hornung et al., 2009</xref>). Our study highlights that it is an alternative mRNA isoform of <italic>Aim2</italic> that is inducible, and that this upregulated transcript is translated less efficiently compared to the canonical isoform. This novel finding goes against the existing assumption that induced gene expression results in induced protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). FLAIR-identified transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Workman et al., 2019</xref>) show three clear AFEs for <italic>Aim2,</italic> and only one of those first exons is inflammatory inducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). RT-qPCR further confirms that the annotated TSS of <italic>Aim2</italic> is not inducible, while the unannotated AFE of <italic>Aim2</italic> is LPS inducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). This result highlights the need for cell-type and treatment-specific transcriptome annotations if one is to have a complete understanding of the transcriptome and proteome of a given cell.</p><p>We further investigated what drove the expression of this novel <italic>Aim2</italic> isoform, as well as what drove the expression of all the AFE genes. Using ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tong et al., 2016</xref>) and ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tong et al., 2016</xref>) data sets, we were able to determine that 50% of the AFE events were driven partially by chromatin accessibility and inflammatory-specific TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using HOMER, a TF motif enrichment tool, we identified that the majority of TFs that regulate the expression of the AFE genes are involved in metabolism pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, another mechanism that can drive AFE usage is the splicing of internal exons that activate proximal upstream promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fiszbein et al., 2019</xref>). Further analysis incorporating more TFs and coupling multiple splicing events will be necessary to determine the definitive regulatory mechanism of all AFEs. Interestingly, the annotated <italic>Aim2</italic> promoter accessibility is constitutively open across all hematopoietic cells, while the unannotated <italic>Aim2</italic> promoter is only accessible in myeloid progenitors or terminally differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), meaning that the novel <italic>Aim2</italic> isoform may be specific to myeloid cells. Furthermore, <italic>Aim2</italic> annotated and unannotated promoter usage is not driven by chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) but is driven by the activation of inflammatory-specific TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2L</xref>).</p><p>There is no difference in the open reading frame of the novel isoform of Aim2 when compared to the annotated transcript using NCBI ORFfinder; therefore, we turned our attention to a possible regulatory mechanism within the 5′UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mignone et al., 2002</xref>). Broadly, UTRs play crucial roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, including alteration of the mRNA translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van der Velden and Thomas, 1999</xref>), subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jansen, 2001</xref>), and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bashirullah et al., 2001</xref>). Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of Aim2 have not been previously studied. Using RegRNA2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) globally, we identify that LPS-activated AFEs contain more regulatory elements than basal first exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). More importantly, we identified an IRE, a regulatory motif unique to only the novel 5′UTR of <italic>Aim2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Utilizing a GFP reporter plasmid, we were able to determine that the IRE motif was functional, by recapitulating the same experiments used on the protein Ferritin, the first functional IRE motif ever studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leedman et al., 1996</xref>). Then, we showed the inflammatory-specific mechanism regulating Aim2 protein expression by performing a western blot on primary BMDMs with and without FAC during a 72 hr LPS time-course experiment. Aim2 protein is basally expressed, and while the transcript is inducible, specifically the novel isoform, we do not observe an increase in expression of Aim2 protein by western blot. In fact, we find that Aim2 protein decreases following inflammation, and this can be reversed by iron supplementation. Finally, we confirmed the IRE mechanism by using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate an IRE KO clonal cell line. Once our cell line was characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A–E</xref>), we performed an LPS time-course stimulation and measured Aim2 protein expression. At the 48 hr time point, we see a significant rescue of Aim2 protein expression in the IRE KO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4F–H</xref>). This could be a critical regulatory step that has evolved to ensure the Aim2 pathway is switched off following its formation and activation of the inflammasome.</p><p>These results demonstrate that the inflammatory-specific mRNA isoform of <italic>Aim2</italic> has lower translational efficiency than the canonical form and that protein translation can be increased by the addition of iron. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crane et al., 2014</xref> demonstrate that ROS can contribute to activation of Aim2 inflammasome in mouse macrophages. Our proposed mechanism of translational regulation of Aim2 is through an IRE, which is known to directly interact with IRP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Outten, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rouault, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, IRP2 degradation can be driven not only through iron, but also through ROS and RNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanson and Leibold, 1999</xref>), further supporting this novel IRE regulatory mechanism of Aim2 protein expression. Finally, Cheng et al. have shown that AIM2 is regulated by oxidative stress and show that overactivation of AIM2 inflammasome can contribute to pancreatic tumorigenesis, all within the environment of mitochondrial iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2018</xref>). This newly identified isoform, with an IRE-specific translational mechanism, provides mechanistic understanding to these recent studies of Aim2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2018</xref>). These findings could have significance for better understanding the mechanisms driving pathology in inflammatory disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corbett, 2018</xref>). AIM2 expression levels have been correlated with severity of inflammation in SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and it is well known that iron is dysregulated in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vanarsa et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that AIM2 levels remain high in SLE patients due to dysregulated iron; therefore, homeostasis in macrophages cannot be maintained.</p><p>In summary, signaling within macrophages enables us to fight infection but also can contribute to pathological inflammation associated with a wide variety of diseases. While there are multiple regulatory checkpoints in place to control inflammation, we propose that alternative splicing and translational regulation play critical roles in maintaining this type of control. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control inflammatory-regulated genes, including <italic>Aim2,</italic> could provide new targets for therapeutic intervention of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Maintenance of mice</title><p>UCSC and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee maintained mice under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities of University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in accordance with the guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Human PBMC-derived macrophage differentiation and in vitro stimulation</title><p>Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were enriched by density gradient centrifugation of peripheral blood from healthy human donors through a Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) gradient.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time.</p><p>There was significant enthusiasm for the work. However, it seems that considerable effort including additional experiments will be required to firm up the conclusions and make the paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.

In this regard, addressing both functional relevance and mechanism would be ideal, but addressing one of these topics will be sufficient.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Our understanding of the transcriptomic impact of innate immune signaling remains incomplete. Here Robinson et al., use both long and short read RNA sequencing to gain further insight into LPS-induced changes to mRNA isoform expression in human and mouse macrophages. Their studies report the novel observation that the most common change in isoform expression is alternative use of the first exon. Such changes are indicative of transcriptional regulation, and is thus consistent with the known impact of innate immune signaling on activation of multiple transcription factors. Despite some minor concerns with details of the study, this is a well-executed and important study that will be of interest and importance to many studying innate immunity, as well as those interested in gene regulation.</p><p>1. In some ways this is minor, but the authors should be careful to not describe alternative first exon use as alternative splicing. While a novel splice junction is created, mechanistically this is driven by changing transcriptional regulation, and then splicing occurs in the only pattern available to that TSS. In general this is described appropriately in the manuscript, but at a few points there is confusing terminology.</p><p>2. An interesting and somewhat surprising point in the manuscript is that 50% of the AFE events don't show an overall change in gene expression. For Aim2, which does change, the authors show that the AFE change is due to activated use of the unannotated TSS in LPS-stimulated cells. For those genes for which AFE use doesn't correlate with a change in gene expression (e.g. Ncoa7, Rcan1, Ampd3 – Figure S3) is there still transcriptional activation of one TSS and transcriptional silencing of the other? In other words, is there coordinated regulation of the two TSSs to ensure overall message abundance doesn't change, or does activation of one TSS inherently shut off the other (more akin to splice site competition in traditional AS)?</p><p>3. The data suggesting that an IRE regulates translation of the induced 5'UTR is compelling, but more work should be done to confirm. Most importantly, the experiment in Figure 4J should be repeated with the deltaIRE version of the unannotated UTR. Also is the IRE regulation controlled upon LPS-stimulation, or just the presence of the IRE element? In other words, what is the distribution of the annotated and unannotated isoforms in the polysome in the absence of LPS (i.e. repeat 4P without LPS)? Can the authors comment on whether the level of iron or the activity of IRP1/2 change in LPS-stimulated cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Robinson et al. presents an interesting and timely analysis of a wealth of transcriptome data upon immune stimulation. The unique combination of long-read Oxford Nanopore and short-read Illumina high-throughput sequencing across both human and mouse samples presents an opportunity many interesting inter-species immune response comparisons, as well as elucidation of full-length transcript information. This paper is well-written and has interesting validation and discussions regarding Aim2. My major concern is that the paper seems to narrow in on the characterization of Aim2 and class of RNA processing changes (alternative first exons) quite quickly without really delving into the rest of the data and how they arrived there. Below are my major comments and suggestions:</p><p>1. I would have liked the authors to provide more insight into how they honed-in on specifically talking about first exon changes, by discussing more of the other RNA processing changes they found. There is cursory mention in the text and figures of other alternative exon or splice site changes. Firstly, other studies (including those referenced by the authors) have found hundreds RNA processing changes genome-wide upon immune stimulation – especially of cassette exons, alternative splice sites, and last exon/3'UTR changes. However here, the authors only find tens of changes (Figure 1B). Are they underpowered to identify changes and can they do any sort of analyses to show that they are sufficiently powered (# of sequencing reads and junctions, complexity of reads, etc)?</p><p>2. Similarly, I would also be interested in seeing an analysis indicating whether the 50 AFE events that overlap between the long-read and short-read sequencing analyses is a statistically significant overlap. Particularly, how many overlapping events would be expected given the difference in quantification power between the two methods? How many real AFE differences might the authors be missing because the long-read sequencing methods often do not have the power to identify them (ie. lower expressed genes in one or the other condition, thus dropout of isoforms and perhaps fewer isoform differences for differentially expressed genes).</p><p>3. Second, for the non-AFE changes that they did find, there is very little discussion about what those changes might represent. Specifically: (a) how many changes are validated with long-read data?, (b) is there any insight into specific domains being included/changed, especially using the long-read data?, (c) how many of these non-AFE changes overlap between species? and (d) which types of genes show higher overlap between species and what are their characteristics (binding sites, etc)? To my knowledge, this is the first study that is really designed to properly really look at the <italic>conservation</italic> of splicing or RNA processing changes after immune activation, so I would love to see more analysis and discussion of this aspect genome-wide.</p><p>4. The authors define significant splicing changes as those with a p-value &lt;= 0.25 and |dPSI| &gt;= 10. I'd like some more clarification on whether this is an adjusted p-value (BH, FDR, or some other multiple test-corrected p-value). Especially if this is adjusted, I find it surprising that the authors are choosing such a liberal statistical confidence level and that even with such a liberal threshold, they are only getting tens of significant events. I would like the authors to at least show these same trends across multiple p-value thresholds or with rank threshold analysis (top 5%, top 10%, top 20%) to show biological trends.</p><p>5. The authors introduce their long-read sequencing data by mentioning that they wanted to identify &quot;additional splicing events that are not captured using short-read sequencing.&quot; They then go onto to only talk about novel first exon events identified with the long-read sequencing data. Did they identify any other non-AFE events in using the long-read that could then be quantified with the short read data? And second, how do they quantify confidence for novel AFE isoforms, when long-read data seems to have lots of issues with properly sequencing the terminal ends of transcripts (particularly the 5' end when polyA primed, as occurs in ONT DirectRNA sequencing)? They mention the use of ATAC-seq data to show putative promoter support, but mention at one point in their methods that ATAC regions within 10kb of AFEs are considered. These seems like it could be a rather large region to be sure that the ATAC peak is specific to a novel AFE – what is the average distance between AFEs? Finally, I would love to also see the incorporation of CAGE-seq data (or other 5'end data) to validate the specific AFEs sites – which I believe the FANTOM consortium has across many human and mouse tissues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Robinson et al., identified alternative first exon (AFE) switching events conserved between mouse and human following macrophage inflammation. Using short and long-read sequencing, the authors identified a few unannotated transcription initiation sites (TSS) that are specific of an inflammatory response. Among those, they centered on an unannotated TSS in the Aim2 gene that drives expression of a novel isoform regulated by an iron-responsive element in its 5′UTR.</p><p>While previous work had documented crucial AFE switching events in many other biological contexts, Robinson et al. presents here an interesting AFE switching event that can have potential implications for our understanding of the molecular regulation of the innate immune response. For publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, I would expect further progress on global mechanisms and biological relevance of these AFE switching events, as well as evidence that the AFE are truly first exons/TSSs.</p><p>1. Are the AFEs truly first exons/TSS? While both short-read and long-read sequencing detected changes in alternative splicing choices, neither of those are optimal methodologies to analyze first exons. Therefore, I suggest to use a more specialized method to identify (and quantify) more accurately the usage of first exons. Globally, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) would be ideal. For validation of specific AFE changes, the qPCR technique has a few issues. First, it does not have nucleotide resolution, so the authors should not refer to TSSs if they used this technique for validation. Second, many downstream first exons are also used as internal exons in other isoforms. There is not a direct technology to analyze specifically first exons/TSSs here. Also, RNA-sequencing technologies, depending on their depth, can definitely miss specific isoforms. Considering a low coverage in 5'end of genes in RNA-seq analysis, this is particularly important for first exons. A qPCR would only analyze the well-known TSSs. Thus, 5'RACE or a similar technology should be perform to assess the relative usage of AFE specifically.</p><p>2. Global mechanism. The authors assumed that the mechanism of AFE switching is generated by transcription initiation and looked for transcription factors binding and chromatin structure modifications in promoters. However, they did not ruled out the possibility that the global switching effect is a post-transcriptional regulation, such as differential mRNA stability. A transcription initiation measurement (e.g., 4SU metabolic labelling) is necessary to demonstrate that the changes in AFE usage are co-transcriptional. In addition, in terms of their ATAC-Seq analysis, the chromatin structure changes in promoters can be cause or consequence of transcription initiation. Thus, it should not be listed as one mechanism driving the expression of AFE events (line 145). Also, to demonstrate a mechanism based on transcription factor binding more than 2 transcription factors should be considered. In any case, the expression patterns of the transcription factors considered are not clear. As a minor note, the bioinformatic analysis of the two promoters regions driving the isoforms of Aim2 (line 156) is not explained in the method section.</p><p>3. Biological relevance. Could the authors evaluate whether the translation regulation of Aim2 based on its AFE switching is a more generalized phenomenon? Are there any global gene regulation changes triggered by the other genes with significant changes is AFE usage?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Inflammation Drives Alternative First Exon usage to Regulate Immune Genes including a Novel Iron Regulated Isoform of Aim2&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.

This new version of the manuscript is significantly stronger and it represents an important contribution to the literature. However, I still have concerns about the evidence the authors present to demonstrate that the AFE are &quot;true&quot; first exons/TSSs.</p><p>In my previous report, I suggested the authors use CAGE instead of RNA-seq (either short or long-reads) and 5'RACE instead of qPCR, both specific techniques to analyze first exons/TSSs. In this version, the authors used CAGE data from the FANTOM project to classify their first exon calls as &quot;true&quot; TSS. They found that only 45% of the novel TSS identified overlap with CAGE peaks. In my opinion, this raise the possibility that the other 55% are not &quot;true&quot; TSSs. Further, before publication, I would expect 5'RACE or any other direct method to validate that specific TSS are &quot;true&quot; TSS, at least for Denr, Arhgef7 and Aim2 which they validated using RT-qPCR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1. While the authors have now included a brief discussion about whether AFEs are regulated by transcription, splicing, or both in their discussion, I still think the authors should tone down the mechanistic implications of the language throughout the rest of the text, perhaps use the term &quot;alternative RNA processing changes&quot; instead of &quot;alternative splicing changes&quot;?</p><p>2. The authors mention that they implemented a new parameter in their FLAIR analysis to incorporate a bed file of ATAC annotations to calibrate the identification of novel AFEs. Do the authors plan to release this new parameter as an update to their existing software? I think this would be of great use to the community that analyzes long-read RNA data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have fully addressed all of the concerns raised by adding additional data.

There are a couple of nuances that we would like to address and that we hope clarifies our use of language throughout this manuscript. We now clearly define that AFEs involve alternative TSS usage coupled with alternative splicing and thus changed the terminology to “Alternative Isoform Usage”, where more appropriate. Not all of the AFE events are only changed due to transcriptional regulation. In the literature, we do see evidence of alternative splicing coupled with a new TSS and upstream exon. A recent study by Fiszbein et al. challenges the notion that promoter choice is first, but rather the splicing of internal exons can impact promoter choice (PMID: 31787377). This study shows that internal exons can dictate which first exon is spliced in the mature RNA molecule. We hope that using “Alternative Isoform Usage” strikes a balance that is clearer in this version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An interesting and somewhat surprising point in the manuscript is that 50% of the AFE events don't show an overall change in gene expression. For Aim2, which does change, the authors show that the AFE change is due to activated use of the unannotated TSS in LPS-stimulated cells. For those genes for which AFE use doesn't correlate with a change in gene expression (e.g. Ncoa7, Rcan1, Ampd3 – Figure S3) is there still transcriptional activation of one TSS and transcriptional silencing of the other? In other words, is there coordinated regulation of the two TSSs to ensure overall message abundance doesn't change, or does activation of one TSS inherently shut off the other (more akin to splice site competition in traditional AS)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your interest in the other AFE genes. We have now included further characterization information of inclusion and exclusion isoforms of Ncoa7, Rcan1, Ampd3, Denr and Arhgef7 in supplemental figure 11. We show that of the 5 candidates, only Denr is significantly differentially expressed, with a log2 fold change more than 2 or -2. While Ncoa7, Rcan1, Ampd3 and Arhgef7 are not significantly differentially expressed with a log2FC more than 2. However, more importantly, these normalized counts show that all genes are expressed with or without LPS stimulation. Furthermore, looking at figure 1 (G-H) it is clear that Arhgef7 exclusion TSS is shut off by LPS, while both the Denr isoforms, at low amounts, are expressed with or without LPS.</p><p>Supplemental figure 11G shows that Ncoa7 inclusion TSS isoform is solely expressed with LPS, 11H shows that Rcan1 exclusion TSS closes with LPS, and 11I shows Ampd3 has both isoforms expressed with and without LPS.</p><p>Now to take a step further to determine the potential mechanism of how the promoters for these AFE are regulated, we have utilized publicly available tracks tracks including ATACseq (GSE74191), PU.1 ChIPseq (GSE109965), p65 ChIPseq (GSE67343) and IRF3 ChIP seq (GSE67343). In supplemental figure 11F for Ncoa7, we cannot conclude a mechanism driving from inflammatory TFs since there are no p65 or IRF3 binding driving the inclusion isoform and the PU.1, myeloid specific transcription factor is most enriched to the exclusion isoform. Interestingly, The ATAC peak for the inclusion isoform for Ncoa7 is more open for the LPS BMDM sample, which could conclude that the promoter is opened by LPS. Rcan1, SupFig11H, shows ATAC opening by inflammation for the inclusion isoform, this promoter also shows enrichment of IRF3 for the inclusion isoform promoter. SupFig11I for Ampd3, it is clear that the inclusion isoform is driven by p65 and IRF3 binding, however the promoter of the exclusion is less clear since the ATACseq shows the promoter to be closed. Arhgef7, SupFig11J, shows a clear strong promoter for the novel inclusion isoform. This is shown by the strong PU.1 binding, ATACseq reads, as well as IRF3 and p65 binding. The exclusion isoform is open as shown by ATACseq reads and has PU.1 binding, but much less in comparison to the inclusion isoform. Finally, SupFig11K for Denr, shows a convoluted promoter region. These two isoforms TSSs are about 250bp away from one another, therefore the ATACseq reads, p65 and IRF3 binding are not distinct between promoters, but to give confidence to the promoter regions it is clear that there are unique promoters by examining the PU.1 binding in BMDMs +/-LPS. In conclusion the mechanisms governing TSS choice and isoform usage are complex and gene and context specific.

We have generated a ΔIRE BMDM cell line data in supplemental figure 15, which supports our findings and strengthens our new mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation of Aim2. To generate a ΔIRE we used our lab’s previously published CRISPR/Cas9 immortalized BMDM cell line (PMID: 29051223) and gRNAs were chosen based off of the CRISPR/Cas9 target tracks on the genome browser (PMID: 27380939, https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?hgsid=1041360567_lXenOcRdA3sNMjAw8PODB1MiRgWj&amp;c=chr1&amp;g=crisp).</p><p>After careful selection of 3 gRNAs, we electroporated them in our BMDM Cas9 cell line, and through immediate cellular dilution we generated a KO IRE cell line. Performing LPS time course experiments, similar to that of Fig4R-S, we determine that the Aim2 protein is regulated by this IRE motif. Our WT BMDM Cas9 cell line shows a loss of protein at the 48 hr LPS time point while our ΔIRE BMDM Cas9 cell line shows a significant increase in Aim2 protein at this time point.

Additionally, we have generated a new cell line that lacks the IRE hairpin, genomically, and the Aim2 protein is no longer regulated by LPS, shown in supplemental figure 15. Finally, in figure 4Q, we redid the polysome profiling experiment to include unstimulated macrophages. In these data, we see that the annotated transcript is still enriched in the high polysome fraction and the unannotated transcript is enriched in the low polysome fraction, and these data are not dependent on LPS.

To determine this, we utilized both primary human and mouse macrophages and analyzed them using both JuncBASE and DRIMSeq to determine the significant differential splicing events. It was clear that in both species Alternative First Exon (AFE) changes are the most prevalent event-type of the significant events. To ensure that our AFE signature is inflammatory specific, we reanalyzed the datasets generated by Pai et al. using methods mirroring those we used for analyzing our own data. Following this, in supplemental figure 4 A-D we see that the results show a higher prevalence of AFE events using either adjusted p-value thresholds of.05 or.25 (PMID: 27690314). On the other hand, in the Pai publication, their figure 2A and C shows the AFE exons are prevalent amongst the significant events in both experimental conditions, even more prevalent than cassette exons (PMID: 27690314). (Manuscript Lines 110-114).</p><p>While AFE events are not the most prevalent amongst all event types in their analysis, this may be due to other factors such as difference in methodologies applied. We focused on alternative isoform changes that are coupled with alternative splice site usage; therefore, we did not examine TandemUTR events. To define alternative splicing events, we used JuncBASE which has features that allows for defining alternative first exons with higher confidence (PMID: 26294686). For statistical testing, we used a t-test through the JuncBASE package or DRIMSeq, which applies a Dirichlet multinomial framework. On the other hand, Pai et al., evaluated changes in RNA processing events with MISO, which uses Bayesian inference in order to detect differentially expressed isoforms. MISO identifies differentially expressed isoforms based on annotation, while JuncBASE allows for the detection of unannotated splicing changes. In addition, significance was defined differently between both studies. In our method, significance was generally defined as AS events with a corrected p-value &lt;= 0.25 and |ΔPSI| &gt;= 10%. In Pai et al., significance is designated to events following infection were defined as those with at least at least 10% of individuals having a Bayes Factor (BF) &gt; = 5 and the | mean ΔPSI| ≥ 5%. The smaller threshold of | mean ΔPSI| ≥ 5% attributes to the increase in the number of splicing changes reported in Pai et al. compared to those reported in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

To my knowledge, this is the first study that is really designed to properly really look at the conservation of splicing or RNA processing changes after immune activation, so I would love to see more analysis and discussion of this aspect genome-wide.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this inquiry, and hope to take a deeper look into this on our next project. The scope of this study was primarily focused on alternative first exons since they are the most prevalent event type across species after inflammatory activation. Our first step to take a global approach in assessing the exclusion and inclusion of AFE was to look at length. It is known that longer 5’UTRs lead to a decrease in translational efficiency of a transcript (PMID: 11897027); therefore we looked at the length of all inclusion and exclusion exons (SFigure 12A). There is no significant difference between the length of inclusion and exclusion exons. However, it is important to see that the average ΔAFE was 37, meaning there is a slight shift in a longer 5’UTR in the inclusion AFEs. Furthermore, we took a deeper approach to investigate the possible motifs in the mouse inclusion (LPS) and exclusion (CTL) exons (SFigure 12C) by using RegRNA2.0. This is a web server that takes an unbiased approach to scan for 44 potential murine motifs. We show that there are more motifs identified in inclusion (LPS) exons, and the most prominent motif is the musashi binding element (MBE).

I'd like some more clarification on whether this is an adjusted p-value (BH, FDR, or some other multiple test-corrected p-value). Especially if this is adjusted, I find it surprising that the authors are choosing such a liberal statistical confidence level and that even with such a liberal threshold, they are only getting tens of significant events. I would like the authors to at least show these same trends across multiple p-value thresholds or with rank threshold analysis (top 5%, top 10%, top 20%) to show biological trends.</p></disp-quote><p>Adjusted p-values from JuncBASE are adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) by implementing the option --<monospace>mt_correction BH</monospace>. The adjusted p-values from DRIMSeq are also adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) by default (Nowicka, M, et al.). A 0.05 significance threshold is somewhat of an arbitrary significance threshold that has been designated in the field and an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.25 has been used in a variety of other studies in genomics (e.g. PMID: 30124010, PMID:27818134, PMID: 16199517) We felt that a less stringent threshold of 0.25 would be appropriate to use in this study as the identification of alternative splicing events following LPS stimulation began as an exploratory analysis and the implementation of a 0.05 adjusted p-value threshold yielded few results. As requested by the reviewer we performed a rank threshold analysis of the top 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% based on uncorrected p-values and they show that alternative first exon events remains amongst the most prevalent significant events (SFigure 2-3). (Manuscript Lines 107-114).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors introduce their long-read sequencing data by mentioning that they wanted to identify &quot;additional splicing events that are not captured using short-read sequencing.&quot; They then go onto to only talk about novel first exon events identified with the long-read sequencing data. Did they identify any other non-AFE events in using the long-read that could then be quantified with the short read data?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking this question. This is a very critical point, and we hope our corrections make this point clearer throughout the manuscript. With our study we first did a differential splicing analysis, using the publicly available gencode gtf file. We took this a step further, by then performing long-read direct RNA sequencing to generate a new macrophage specific gtf file using FLAIR. We then reanalyzed our short-read RNAseq data with our de novo transcriptome. From this new transcriptome file, we did find other differential splicing events that were novel to macrophages, as well as events that were identified in the short read sequencing that were supported by our new gft file. This data can be found in both Figure 1C, as well as in the venn diagrams of supplemental figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And second, how do they quantify confidence for novel AFE isoforms, when long-read data seems to have lots of issues with properly sequencing the terminal ends of transcripts (particularly the 5' end when polyA primed, as occurs in ONT DirectRNA sequencing)?

In addition, we implemented an optional parameter of FLAIR collapse (-p) which instructs the tool to use an input file of coordinates (a BED file) corresponding to promoter regions to aid with distinguishing isoform start sites. When implementing this parameter, we only used promoter regions that were also supported by ATAC-seq data. The ATAC regions within 10kb of AFEs are considered for a separate analysis looking into chromatin accessibility.

Finally, I would love to also see the incorporation of CAGE-seq data (or other 5'end data) to validate the specific AFEs sites – which I believe the FANTOM consortium has across many human and mouse tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the inquiry. To address this comment, we elected to use the</p><p>FANTOM5 CAGE data and complete two analyses. In both analyses, “known” TSS are those that overlap TSS in the Gencode M18 annotation and “novel” TSS are those that do not. In the first analysis, we plotted the distribution of CAGE scores of the CAGE peaks that overlap known and novel TSS. The similarity in the distribution between the known and novel CAGE score distribution indicates to us that the novel TSS identified using Nanopore sequencing coupled with the bioinformatics tool, FLAIR, are truly TSS. A second analysis to further support that claim was completed in order to observe the proportion of known and novel TSS that overlap CAGE data corresponding to “true” TSS as classified with machine learning methods (PMID: 21596820). 45% of the novel and ~62% of known TSS overlap with CAGE peaks corresponding to “true” TSS, respectively. Because FANTOM5 CAGE data is an aggregation of data collected from multiple studies using different cell-types and experimental conditions, we expect that many of the non-overlapping CAGE peaks classified as “true” TSS are a result of these experimental differences. (Main text: 141-153, 333, Methods: 825-842).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>In this manuscript, Robinson et al., identified alternative first exon (AFE) switching events conserved between mouse and human following macrophage inflammation. Using short and long-read sequencing, the authors identified a few unannotated transcription initiation sites (TSS) that are specific of an inflammatory response. Among those, they centered on an unannotated TSS in the Aim2 gene that drives expression of a novel isoform regulated by an iron-responsive element in its 5′UTR.</p><p>While previous work had documented crucial AFE switching events in many other biological contexts, Robinson et al. presents here an interesting AFE switching event that can have potential implications for our understanding of the molecular regulation of the innate immune response. For publication in eLife, I would expect further progress on global mechanisms and biological relevance of these AFE switching events, as well as evidence that the AFE are truly first exons/TSSs.</p><p>1. Are the AFEs truly first exons/TSS? While both short-read and long-read sequencing detected changes in alternative splicing choices, neither of those are optimal methodologies to analyze first exons. Therefore, I suggest to use a more specialized method to identify (and quantify) more accurately the usage of first exons. Globally, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) would be ideal. For validation of specific AFE changes, the qPCR technique has a few issues. First, it does not have nucleotide resolution, so the authors should not refer to TSSs if they used this technique for validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the inquiry about the confidence of our isoforms that have novel TSS.

There is not a direct technology to analyze specifically first exons/TSSs here. Also, RNA-sequencing technologies, depending on their depth, can definitely miss specific isoforms. Considering a low coverage in 5'end of genes in RNA-seq analysis, this is particularly important for first exons. A qPCR would only analyze the well-known TSSs. Thus, 5'RACE or a similar technology should be perform to assess the relative usage of AFE specifically.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that there are limitations of these RNA sequencing technologies to determine the true first nucleotide, we still are able to determine nearly all splice junctions depending on read depth. Our illumina sequencing run was very deep, around 30million per library. Our nanopore sequencing libraries were much lower, at 1million reads per library, but they were used to generate a new transcriptome using FLAIR. The limitations of nanopore, as discovered by Mulroney et al. show that direct-RNA long read nanopore sequencing is unable to detect the first ~11nt of a transcript (DOI: 10.1101/2020.11.18.389049). Then we re-analyzed our illumina RNA-sequencing libraries using our new transcriptome. Thus the exact transcriptional start site is not critical in the definition of alternative first exon. We also used orthogonal ATAC-seq data to provide additional confidence that the first exon was at a putative promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Global mechanism. The authors assumed that the mechanism of AFE switching is generated by transcription initiation and looked for transcription factors binding and chromatin structure modifications in promoters. However, they did not ruled out the possibility that the global switching effect is a post-transcriptional regulation, such as differential mRNA stability. A transcription initiation measurement (e.g., 4SU metabolic labelling) is necessary to demonstrate that the changes in AFE usage are co-transcriptional.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this astute point. While we did not assess differential mRNA stability of the identified isoforms, we can confirm many of the events by using our ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq analysis. For instance, by examining the p65 and IRF3 transcription factors, we were able to show that 37 of the promoters are regulated by either p65 or IRF3. Additionally, 26 promoters of the AFE genes undergo chromatic accessibility changes during LPS stimulation (Figure 3). While 47 of the 95 AFE events are unaccounted for, this can be explained by our global assessment of promoters of the AFE events (Figure 3B), showing that many of the transcription factors enriched are regulated by metabolism and other biological processes (Line 203-205, 353-355). Assessing additional mechanisms that may be driving these AFE events we fell are outside the scope of this current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, in terms of their ATAC-Seq analysis, the chromatin structure changes in promoters can be cause or consequence of transcription initiation. Thus, it should not be listed as one mechanism driving the expression of AFE events (line 145). Also, to demonstrate a mechanism based on transcription factor binding more than 2 transcription factors should be considered. In any case, the expression patterns of the transcription factors considered are not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this astute point, we have changed the text to address this concern. We investigated transcription factor binding as another potential contributing factor to the changes in AFE usage. The transcription factors we chose, p65 and IRF3, are two of the key inflammatory transcription factors driving thousands of immune response genes (described line 4346). Additionally, there are not many ChIP-seq datasets available for transcription factors of interest in primary BMDMs. The datasets chosen are for an inflammatory time course, 0-120min, with 120min chosen for analysis. This is the time point in which the highest binding of IRF3 or p65 is seen. While additional examination of other TFs could provide more mechanistic understanding we feel those studies are outside the scope of this paper. However, as an alternative approach to analyzing more ChIP-seq data from primary BMDMs, we performed a HOMER analysis of all AFE promoters (Figure 3B). We found that the majority of TFs are regulated by metabolism (Manuscript Lines 203-205, 353-355).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a minor note, the bioinformatic analysis of the two promoters regions driving the isoforms of Aim2 (line 156) is not explained in the method section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point, we have edited our methods to include the promoter analysis on Aim2 (Manuscript Lines 892-899).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Biological relevance. Could the authors evaluate whether the translation regulation of Aim2 based on its AFE switching is a more generalized phenomenon?</p></disp-quote><p>The general phenomenon of AFE usage has been seen previously in a handful of plant or <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies, but in the context of inflammation in mammalian cells is a novel finding (PMID: 17941993, PMID: 16344560, PMID: 19178699). For our results within this manuscript, we can definitively say that the AFE of Aim2 downregulates the protein expression through an IRE motif by our GFP expression experiments, polysome profiling experiments, western blot analysis of primary BMDMs and our Cas9 IRE KO experiments in immortalized BMDMs (Figure 4 and SFigure 15). (Line 374-389).</p><p>Furthermore, we took a deeper approach to investigate the possible motifs in the mouse inclusion (LPS) and exclusion (CTL) exons (SFigure 12C) by using RegRNA2.0.

We show that there are more motifs identified in inclusion (LPS) exons, and the most prominent motif is the musashi binding element (MBE). (Line 232-234, 372-374) IRE motifs were not found in any other AFE event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there any global gene regulation changes triggered by the other genes with significant changes is AFE usage?</p></disp-quote><p>After performing a global assessment of all inclusion and exclusion AFEs, using RegRNA2.0, we found that the inclusion AFE events had more motifs than the exclusion exons (SFigure 12, line 232-234). This could mean that there are additional post-transcriptional regulations affecting the translation of the genes during inflammation. It was beyond the scope of the paper to do another global sequencing experiment to assess gene regulation of the isoforms, such as polysome profiling or ribosome profiling. While our study does not look at the global translational implication of all AFE events, it does unearth a novel mechanism of an AFE event in the Aim2 protein coding gene. Aim2 was originally identified in a seminal 1997 study (PMID: 9242382) as an interferon inducible gene. From our work we now know that it is this alternative isoform that is inducible and it leads to a decrease in protein expression most likely as a way to control the pathway and return it to homeostasis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
