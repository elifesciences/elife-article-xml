vitamin K cycle, activating vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors. VKOR is also the target of the widely used anticoagulant drug, warfarin. Despite VKOR’s pivotal role in coagulation, its structure and active site remain poorly understood. In addition, VKOR variants can cause vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency or alter warfarin response. Here, we used multiplexed, sequencing-based assays to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR missense variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity in cultured human cells. The large-scale functional data, along with an evolutionary coupling analysis, supports a four transmembrane domain topology, with variants in transmembrane domains exhibiting strongly deleterious effects on abundance and activity. Functionally constrained regions of the protein define the active site, and we find that, of four conserved cysteines putatively critical for function, only three are absolutely required. Finally, 25% of human VKOR missense variants show reduced abundance or activity, possibly conferring warfarin sensitivity or causing disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>pharmacogenetics</kwd><kwd>multiplex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24GM115277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>Douglas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01GM116691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>Douglas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-191853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rollins</surname><given-names>Nathan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Debora S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiasson</surname><given-names>Melissa A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002784</institution-id><institution>Canada Excellence Research Chairs, Government of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>Douglas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>Douglas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) has a four transmembrane domain topology that supports the use of a homology model, enabling identification of active site residues and human variant impact.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) drives the vitamin K cycle, which activates blood coagulation factors. VKOR, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized transmembrane protein encoded by the gene <italic>VKORC1</italic>, reduces vitamin K quinone and vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K hydroquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rost et al., 2004</xref>). Vitamin K hydroquinone is required to enable gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) to carboxylate Gla domains on vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors. VKOR is inhibited by the anticoagulant drug warfarin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Czogalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zimmermann and Matschiner, 1974</xref>), and <italic>VKORC1</italic> polymorphisms contribute to an estimated ~25% of warfarin dosing variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Owen et al., 2010</xref>). For example, variation in <italic>VKORC1</italic> noncoding and coding sequence can cause warfarin resistance (weekly warfarin dose &gt;105 mg) or warfarin sensitivity (weekly warfarin dose &lt;~10 mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osinbowale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Though 15 million prescriptions are written for warfarin each year (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clincalc.com">https://www.clincalc.com</ext-link>), fundamental questions remain regarding its target, VKOR. For example, the structure of human VKOR is unsolved, though a bacterial homolog has been crystallized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>). A homology model based on bacterial VKOR has four transmembrane domains, but the quality of the homology model is unclear, as human VKOR has only 12% sequence identity to bacterial VKOR. Moreover, experimental validation of VKOR topology yielded mixed results: similar biochemical assays suggested either three- or four- transmembrane- domain topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schulman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Topology informs basic aspects of VKOR function including where vitamin K and warfarin bind, so determining the correct topology and validating the homology model is critical. In particular, VKOR has four functionally important, absolutely conserved cysteines at positions 43, 51, 132, and 135, the orientation of which differs between the two proposed topologies. In the four transmembrane domain topology, all four cysteines are located on the ER lumenal side of the enzyme. In this topology, cysteines 43 and 51 are hypothesized to be ‘loop cysteines’ that pass electrons from an ER-anchored reductase, possibly transmembrane thioredoxin-related protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schulman et al., 2010</xref>), to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rishavy et al., 2011</xref>). However, in the three transmembrane domain topology, these cysteines are located in the cytoplasm and other pathways would be required to convey electrons to the redox center. Even for non-catalytic residues, topology plays an important role. For example, vitamin K presumably binds near the redox center, and topology dictates which residues make up the substrate binding site.</p><p>To understand the effect of human variants and to define the vitamin K and warfarin binding sites, VKOR variant activity has been extensively studied in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Czogalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tie et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to activity, VKOR protein abundance has also been studied because abundance is an important driver of disease and warfarin response. For example, VKOR R98W is a decreased- abundance variant that, in homozygous carriers, causes vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rost et al., 2004</xref>). A 5’ UTR polymorphism reduces VKOR abundance and can be used to predict warfarin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gong et al., 2011</xref>). However, so far, the activity and abundance of only a handful of VKOR variants has been tested.</p><p>Here, we used multiplexed, sequencing-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gasperini et al., 2016</xref>) to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR missense variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity. Our analysis of the large-scale functional data supports a four transmembrane domain topology, which an orthogonal evolutionary coupling analysis confirmed. Next, we identified distinct mutational tolerance groups, which are concordant with a four transmembrane homology model. Combining this homology model with variant abundance and activity effects, we identified an active site that contains the catalytic residues C132 and C135 and shares six positions with a previously proposed vitamin K binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Czogalla et al., 2017</xref>). We found that of four conserved cysteines putatively critical for function, only three are absolutely required, and analyzed the mutational signatures of two putative ER retention motifs. Human <italic>VKORC1</italic> variants present in genetic databases and contributed by a commercial genetic testing laboratory were each classified based on abundance and activity. While most variants show wild type-like activity, 25% show low abundance or activity, which could confer warfarin sensitivity or cause disease in a homozygous context. Finally, we analyzed warfarin resistance variants and found that they span a range of abundances, indicating that increased abundance is an uncommon mechanism of warfarin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiplexed measurement of VKOR variant abundance using VAMP-seq</title><p>To measure the abundance of VKOR variants, we applied Variant Abundance by Massively Parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), an assay we recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matreyek et al., 2018</xref>). In VAMP-seq, a protein variant is fused to eGFP with a short amino acid linker. If the variant is stable and properly folded, then the eGFP fusion will not be degraded, and cells will have high eGFP fluorescence. In contrast, if the variant causes the protein to misfold, protein quality control machinery will detect and degrade the eGFP fusion, leading to a decrease in eGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). mCherry is also expressed from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) to control for expression. Differences in abundance are measured on a flow cytometer using the ratio of eGFP to mCherry signal. To determine whether VAMP-seq could be applied to VKOR, we fused eGFP to VKOR N- or C-terminally and found that both orientations had high eGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We compared N-terminally tagged wild type (WT) VKOR to R98W, a variant that ablates a putative ER retention motif and reduces abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Czogalla et al., 2014</xref>), and to TMD1Δ, a deletion of residues 10–30 which comprise the putative first transmembrane domain (TMD1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Both reduced abundance variants exhibited much lower eGFP:mCherry ratios than WT, demonstrating that VAMP-seq could be applied to VKOR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiplexed measurement of VKOR variant abundance using VAMP-seq.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) To measure abundance, an eGFP reporter is fused to VKOR. eGFP-tagged WT VKOR is folded correctly, leading to high eGFP fluorescence.

The predicted tertiary structure had a four-helix topology, with antiparallel contacts between the full lengths of transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) and between the full lengths of transmembrane domains 1 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). These antiparallel contacts would not be present in a three-helix topology and are only possible in a four-helix topology. This topology is also supported when we restricted our analysis to 1118 eukaryotic sequences exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of our abundance data to the energy required to insert different amino acids into the membrane yielded additional evidence for the four transmembrane domain model. The apparent change in free energy (ΔΔG<sub>app</sub>) of insertion relative to wild type for every amino acid has been determined experimentally using deep mutational scanning of bacterial membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elazar et al., 2016a</xref>). Median abundance score and ΔΔG<sub>app</sub> for each amino acid are correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). In particular, the large energetic cost of insertion of transmembrane domains with charged amino acids is apparent, including within the second transmembrane domain TMD2. Beyond insertion energies of individual amino acids, the overall hydrophobicity of transmembrane helices contributes to membrane protein insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elazar et al., 2016a</xref>), as well as topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elazar et al., 2016b</xref>) and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guerriero et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether overall helix hydrophobicity was a large factor contributing to abundance scores, we calculated the free energy for insertion (ΔG<sub>helix</sub>) of each helix in the four transmembrane domain model using the ΔG prediction server v1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hessa et al., 2007</xref>) and TopGraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elazar et al., 2016b</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed that TMD3 has a high density of substitutions with WT-like scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</xref>), suggesting that TMD3’s favorable insertion energy might explain its mutational tolerance. In addition, the high concordance of hydrophobicity indices from bacterial and mammalian multiple sequence alignments further supports the conservation of a four transmembrane domain topology between bacteria and mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Detailed structural context of VKOR variant abundance effects</title><p>Having confirmed that human VKOR has four transmembrane domains, we next explored the detailed pattern of mutational effects we observed in the context of a four transmembrane domain homology model.

At four Group one positions, K30, R33, R35, and R37, almost every substitution increased abundance. These positively charged positions are positioned either at the edge of TMD1 (K30) or in the ER lumen directly abutting the top of TMD1 (R33, R35, and R37). The ‘positive inside rule’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Heijne, 1989</xref>), suggests that positive charges in membrane proteins generally reside in the cytoplasm, and this phenomenon is important for driving topology and membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elazar et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nilsson and von Heijne, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Heijne, 1989</xref>). K30, R33, R35, and R37 violate the positive inside rule, and substitutions at these positions may increase abundance by reducing charge inside the ER, reducing topological frustration or increasing membrane insertion efficiency. Compared to the other 12 arginine and lysine positions in WT VKOR, K30, R33, R35, and R37 are the only ones where substitutions generally increased abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our observations are consistent with a screen of rat VKOR variants intended to improve protein expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> where deletion of positions 31 to 33 increased protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatahet et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In Group two, charged amino acids or proline substitutions generally decreased abundance. Group two consisted mostly of transmembrane positions that had side chains projecting into the lipid bilayer. Such transmembrane positions usually have hydrophobic, nonpolar side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ulmschneider and Sansom, 2001</xref>). Proline has poor helix forming propensity, explaining why proline substitutions decreased abundance at these positions. Group 3 consisted of a mixture of cytoplasmic, ER lumenal and transmembrane positions where most substitutions decreased abundance. The cytoplasmic positions in this group included the putative dilysine ER localization motif at positions 159 and 161. Also in this group were R98, part of another putative ER retention motif at positions 98 and 100, and a glycine adjacent to TMD1 at position nine. The transmembrane positions had side chains projecting towards neighboring transmembrane helices, suggesting that, as for other membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fleming and Engelman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mravic et al., 2019</xref>), intramolecular sidechain packing is important for abundance.</p><p>Finally, substitutions in Group 4, consisting of positions G19, Y88, I141, and L145, resulted in catastrophic loss of abundance. These positions are all in transmembrane domains with side chains projecting into the interior of the protein. On the basis of strict mutational intolerance of these positions, we hypothesized that their coordinated side chain packing comprises the core of the VKOR four helix bundle. Indeed, Group four residues had dramatically lower relative solvent accessibility than Groups 1–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>The four transmembrane domain homology models also allowed us to explain VKOR’s unusual trimodal distribution of variant abundance scores. Previous VAMP-seq derived abundance score distributions for the cytosolic proteins TPMT and PTEN were bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matreyek et al., 2018</xref>), and 15 of 16 deep mutational scans of other soluble proteins using a variety of other assays also exhibited bimodal functional score distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 2017</xref>). Because VKOR is an ER resident, transmembrane protein, we hypothesized that its unusual trimodal abundance score distribution resulted from transmembrane domain substitutions. Indeed, the lowest mode of the distribution was composed almost exclusively of deleterious transmembrane domain substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). In contrast, the intermediate mode consisted of substitutions in the ER lumen, cytoplasm, and transmembrane domains. Similarly, substitutions that profoundly decreased activity occurred in transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Variant activity and abundance identify functionally constrained regions of VKOR</title><p>We reasoned that our activity and abundance data could reveal the location of functionally important positions in VKOR, including the active site, since functionally important positions should have many loss-of-activity but few loss-of-abundance variants. Thus, we calculated the specific activity for each variant by taking the ratio of its rescaled activity score and abundance score (see Methods). We computed the median specific activity for each position; substitutions at positions with low median specific activity generally have low activity relative to their abundance. We set a specific activity threshold based on two absolutely conserved cysteines that form VKOR’s redox center, C132 and C135. Using this threshold, positions with the lowest 12.5% of specific activity scores and with at least four variants scored for activity were deemed functionally constrained and mapped on the homology model of VKOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the four transmembrane domain model, C43 and C51 are postulated to be loop cysteines that relay electrons to the C132/C135 redox center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). We classified C43 as having low specific activity, but we only observed one variant at this position, so it was not included in our set of functionally constrained positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, substitutions at C51 resulted in only modest activity loss, a phenomenon that has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, every substitution at C51 and 15 of 19 at C132 decreased VKOR abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Inside cells, the majority of VKOR molecules have a C51-C132 disulfide bond, and warfarin binds to this redox state of VKOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Since disruption of this disulfide bond apparently impacts abundance as well as activity, this bond may be important for VKOR folding and stability.</p><p>VKOR is thought to contain two sequences important for ER localization. The first is a diarginine motif (RxR) at positions 98–100, and the second is a dilysine motif (KXKXX) at positions 159–163. While we did not directly measure localization, we found that only six of 19 R98 variants and seven of 14 R100 variants resulted in low abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, nearly all variants at K159 (14 of 18) and K161 (17 of 19) resulted in low abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). A histidine substitution was tolerated at position 161, which mimics the KXHXX motif commonly found in coronaviruses and a small number of human proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma and Goldberg, 2013</xref>). Because protein localization and degradation are coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hessa et al., 2011</xref>), we suggest that the reductions in abundance we observe are the result of degradation caused by mislocalization, and that the dilysine motif at positions 159–163 is essential for VKOR ER localization. Overall, comparison of VKOR variant activity and abundance revealed functionally important regions, refining our understanding of the active site, redox-active cysteines, and ER retention motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional consequences of VKOR variants observed in humans</title><p>Variation in VKOR is linked to both disease and warfarin response, but the overwhelming majority of VKOR variants found in humans so far have unknown effects.

As expected, W5X was low abundance, reinforcing that heterozygous loss of VKOR is the cause of warfarin sensitivity in carriers of this variant. Warfarin resistance variants, on the other hand, are predicted to abrogate warfarin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2010</xref>), but it is unclear whether these variants have appreciable effects on abundance or activity. We found that warfarin resistance variants span a range of abundances and that the distribution of warfarin resistant variant abundance was not different from missense variants generally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p=0.438). Five warfarin-resistance variants had low abundance, suggesting that these variants must block drug binding or increase activity to confer resistance. One variant, A26T, had high abundance, a possible mechanism of warfarin resistance. The five warfarin resistance variants, R58G, W59L, V66M, G71A, and N77S, whose activity we scored, were all WT-like. Thus, our abundance and activity data are consistent with warfarin resistance arising largely from variants that block warfarin binding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We conducted multiplexed assays to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity. Both abundance and activity data provided evidence for a four transmembrane topology, which was further supported by evolutionary couplings analysis. We evaluated a VKOR homology model in the context of the patterns of variant effects on abundance we measured and found that the homology model could explain these patterns. Low specific activity residues mapped onto this homology model identify, at least in part, the active site, which largely overlaps with the results of a vitamin K docking simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Czogalla et al., 2017</xref>). Our active site is shallower than what the docking simulation predicts; this is the result of low abundance scores at some of the deeper, transmembrane positions predicted by docking to bind the isoprenoid chain of vitamin K (F87, Y88), and poor coverage of activity scores for other positions (V112, S113). In light of the fact that substitutions at F87 and Y88 resulted in low abundance, we note that the modeled vitamin K binding mode would disrupt packing of VKOR core residues and require repacking of helices to maintain protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merkle et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the active site, substitutions at the dilysine and, to a lesser extent, the diarginine ER localization motifs caused abundance loss.</p><p>We also used our large-scale functional data to analyze 215 VKOR variants found in humans. 16% of these variants affect neither activity nor abundance; we identified 54 previously uncharacterized low abundance or low activity variants that could be pathogenic or alter warfarin response. We found that only one warfarin resistance variant had increased abundance, indicating that increased abundance is not a pervasive warfarin resistance mechanism. Many of the other warfarin resistant variants have warfarin IC50s that are 10- to 100-fold higher than wildtype VKOR in cell assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen et al., 2018</xref>), and this high level of resistance probably cannot be gained through increased protein abundance alone. All five of the warfarin resistance variants whose activity we scored were WT-like. Taken together these data support the notion that warfarin resistance generally involves alterations to warfarin binding rather than abundance or activity. We analyzed one known warfarin sensitivity variant, W5X, and found that it is low abundance, suggesting the possibility that any of the 53 other low abundance variants, if found in a person, might also confer warfarin sensitivity.</p><p>While our VKOR variant abundance and activity data illuminates various aspects of VKOR’s structure and function, the data have limitations. For example, neither assay captures variant effects on mRNA splicing, which means we cannot determine the effect of human splice site variants on VKOR activity or abundance. In addition, as a result of how these assays were engineered, both have limited dynamic ranges. Thus, subtle effects on abundance or activity cannot be discerned, and it is difficult to translate the scores these assays generated to a more precise biochemical measure, like absolute VKOR molecules present or enzymatic kinetics. In addition, both assays have inherent noise, largely arising from the limited number of cells we can sample due to the bottleneck of cell sorting. We account for this noise by filtering each dataset based on variant frequency and presenting a confidence interval for each abundance and activity score. Reengineering the assay to be growth-based, instead of flow cytometry-based, would increase the number of cells sampled and would most likely improve library coverage and score estimation.</p><p>In the future, we envision that the assays we used could be employed to better understand VKOR’s interaction with warfarin. Here, we could measure warfarin’s effect on both variant abundance and activity, mapping the warfarin binding site more finely. In addition, we could identify warfarin resistance mutations that have not yet been observed in the clinic and group variants by their putative resistance mechanism. Overall, our work highlights the value of multiplexed assays of variant effect for better understanding protein structure, function and human variant effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Murine anti-Factor IX carboxylated Gla domain (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Green Mountain Antibodies</td><td valign="top">Cat#GMA-001</td><td valign="top">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">HRP Anti-beta-actin antibody (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#ab20272;

Briefly, for each protein variant, frequencies in each bin were calculated by dividing counts by total counts. From there, we filtered variants based on the number of experiments in which it was observed (F<sub>expt</sub> = 2) and their frequency (F<sub>freq</sub> = 10<sup>−4</sup>), after noticing that low frequency variants introduced noise to the analysis. These frequencies were then each weighted by multiplying by 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and one in a bin-wise fashion. We generated a replicate score for each variant by using min-max normalization: normalizing to the median weighted average of the nonsense distribution set at 0 and the median weighted average of the synonymous distribution set at 1. We then averaged those scores for a final, experiment-wide variant score. Standard deviation and standard error were also calculated for each variant, and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using standard error, assuming a normal distribution. Abundance and activity classifications were assigned by assessing variant score and confidence intervals in relation to synonymous variant distribution. To do this, we established a cut-off that separated the 5% of synonymous variants with the lowest abundance (or activity) scores from the 95% of synonymous variants with higher abundance (or activity) scores. Variants with both scores and upper confidence intervals below this threshold were classified as ‘low,’ while those with scores below but upper confidence above were classified as ‘possibly low.’ Variants with scores and lower confidence intervals above the threshold were classified as ‘WT-like’, while those with scores above lower confidence intervals below the threshold were classified as ‘possibly WT-like.’ Finally, another threshold was set that separated the 5% of synonymous variants with the highest scores from the rest of the synonymous distribution. Variants that had scores above this threshold, with lower confidence intervals above the lower threshold were classified as ‘high'.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Windowed abundance and activity analysis</title><p>Windowed averages of abundance and activity scores were calculated using a window length of 10 positions with center alignment.

Despite being a major drug target, little is known about this protein's structure. Using deep mutational scanning and structural bioinformatics analyses, they make several structural and functional inferences, for example, on the protein's topology, its functional site and positions that may be critical for folding versus activity. The relative abundance of the mutations helps to interpret those causing warfarin sensitivity and clotting deficiency. Overall, these conclusions are well supported by the massive data which afford a thorough assessment of the mutational space. For instance, the authors propose that the clinically observed warfarin resistance due to VKOR polymorphisms is likely to be due to differences in warfarin binding rather than to protein abundance or activity. To conduct this study, the authors developed reporters to measure both the protein abundance and its activity providing a much more informative dataset than most studies that employ deep mutational scanning on membrane proteins. In summary, the study leverages large-scale functional data generated by the parallel multiplex assays to go beyond what a purely structural modeling study could achieve. The authors also provide a very detailed Materials and methods section that will be a valuable resource for future studies using multiplexed functional analysis of genetic variants.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Topology inferences:</p><p>1) In the evolutionary-coupling analysis, the authors used sequences from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but they mention previously that the topology of the bacterial proteins could have been different from the eukaryotic ones. Can the authors provide evidence that the EVcouplings analysis is not biased to bacterial sequences, for instance by excluding them? If this analysis cannot be carried out, then please state how many bacterial sequences were used and perhaps add a caveat that this analysis may be biased towards the topology observed in bacteria (the work provides ample evidence from other analyses that the four TMD topology is correct).</p><p>2) While the large body of abundance, activity and evolutionary coupling data (Figure 3) is consistent with a four-helix topology, the authors do not explicitly rule out the possibility that TM2 is re-entrant (as suggested by hydropathy patterns predicted by the server octopus), and thus inverting the topology of the last two TMs as in the 3-TM model. The overall demonstration of the four-helix topology would be more convincing if a three TM model were shown to heavily violate some of the functional and coupling data.</p><p>3) The authors use the Hessa scale to compute helix-insertion energies but this scale is known to yield relatively high, even positive, energies to known TM domains, as the authors find here for three of four TMDs. Out of curiosity, I ran the human VKOR sequence in TopGraph, which uses the Elazar insertion energetics, and got four TMDs that match the authors' four quite closely and all insertion energies are negative. It may therefore be useful to include additional topology calculators.</p><p>4) To further support their conclusion, could the authors provide a comparison of abundance/activity to a hydropathy plot, and/or a comparison of hydropathy and lipophilicity (that can be calculated using the LIPS server) between VKOR homologs to support that the 4 TM topology is conserved between bacteria and mammals?</p><p>5) Introduction, second paragraph, when referring to the previous topology studies, Shen et al., 2017, provides a more definitive answer than those cited via looking at the disulfide bond pattern of human VKOR.</p><p>Structure modeling:</p><p>6) The authors used both I-TASSER and evfold. Why was this necessary? And, can the authors comment on the differences between the two models as well as provide the EVFold model in the supplement in addition to the I-TASSER one? Not surprisingly, the I-TASSER model seems heavily biased towards the 4 TM bacterial structure which is used as a starting template in the modeling simulations. The pre-TM2 loop that is not present in the bacterial structure contains some of the warfarin resistance mutants, so those residues might play a larger role in scaffolding the binding site, instead of forming the loop 'appendage' in the I-TASSER model. Do the evolutionary and I-TASSER models significantly differ in that region?</p><p>Localisation:</p><p>7) The authors mentioned that they did not directly measure localization of the VKOR variants, but didn't discuss whether this represents a limitation or not. To what extent would the abundance and activity data be affected by changes in trafficking and localization, for mutations in the ER localization sequences or elsewhere? Obviously, the localization of 2'695 (or even 697) variants could not be checked. But could the authors measure it for a representative subset of each cluster group with characteristic mutational pattern effects on abundance (Figure 4B)?</p><p>8) More generally, while the authors briefly mentioned the limitations of the approach (Discussion, third paragraph), they should make an effort to discuss them in the context of the distinct assays and data interpretation. How would the findings and conclusions of the study differ if these technical limitations could be addressed?</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) There should be a control that correlates the GFP signal of mutant/truncation (e.g., those in Figure 1B) with the VKOR protein level (by western) to support that one can reliable deduce the relative abundance level from GFP signal for membrane proteins. In addition, in the text, it should be clarified whether N- or C- GFP is used in the mass abundance measurements and whether this makes any difference. The problem is that N- and C-GFP fused to a membrane protein have different effects. The C-GFP is a better reporter because if the N-terminal membrane protein is not folded properly, and the C-GFP may not be either. On the other hand, the N-GFP may be folded disregarding the misfolding of the C-terminal membrane protein. In addition, it is known that in mammalian cells the C-GFP may show fluorescence even the membrane protein is not properly folded.</p><p>2) Figure 1A TMD-del. The GFP should be on the ER luminal side.</p><p>3) There should be a representative supplementary figure showing the error bar of the specific activity (activity/abundance). It will be good to get a general feeling about how reliable this number is with the mass measurements. That said, in Figure 5 the overall conclusion looks quite convincing. The residues showing large changes should be labeled in Figure 5.</p><p>4) The abundance level of resistant mutations only changes by 2-3 fold in Figure 6C. It seems not a surprise that abundance is not causative of resistance because strong resistant mutations generally show several to hundred-fold of difference in IC50. The Discussion may benefit from some rewording.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58026.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Topology inferences:</p><p>1) In the evolutionary-coupling analysis, the authors used sequences from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but they mention previously that the topology of the bacterial proteins could have been different from the eukaryotic ones.

Therefore the ITASSER model may represent a more precise fold in places where there are few couplings or minimizing distances is a weak approximation. But the EVcouplings model may be more accurate where human VKOR is dissimilar to the bacterial. All in all, the ITASSER relies on the hypothesis that human VKOR has the same features as bacterial VKOR which has the potential to be more accurate because the template model has atomic resolution. We have confidence in that model in part because of its similarity to the EVcouplings results.</p><p>We examined how similar structurally the models were. Including all residues, RMSD is 6.556 Å.​ However, if we exclude the ER lumenal loop (residues 37-78), RMSD is 2.911 Å. The ER loop is largely unstructured and flexible, with the exception of a half helix that is hypothesized to run from positions 52 to 57. This half helix is only present in the ITASSER model; it is absent in our EVcouplings model. Beyond this, generally we observe that the ER loop in the EVcouplings model runs around the periphery of the protein, while the ITASSER model’s ER loop traverses the central cavity of the protein. Both models could be correct; it is most likely that the ER loop is dynamic, as it is involved in the transfer of electrons to the active site but also must allow for vitamin K to dock in the central cavity of the protein. While this ER loop contributes to a large RMSD overall, it most likely is reflecting dynamic biological states.</p><p>We have provided both EVcouplings model and the ITASSER model as Supplementary files 1 and 2, respectively, for readers to compare.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Localisation:</p><p>7) The authors mentioned that they did not directly measure localization of the VKOR variants, but didn't discuss whether this represents a limitation or not.

In panel F, we present the histogram of specific activity coefficient of variation (CV), with 72% of variants showing CVs less than 0.25.
