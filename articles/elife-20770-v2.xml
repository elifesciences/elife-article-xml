may be interdependent. The mechanisms that regulate the radial dispersion of neocortical interneurons are incompletely understood. Here we report that disruption of TCA innervation, or TCA-derived glutamate, affected the laminar distribution of GABAergic interneurons in mouse neocortex, resulting in abnormal accumulation in deep layers of interneurons that failed to switch from tangential to radial orientation. Expression of the KCC2 cotransporter was elevated in interneurons of denervated cortex, and KCC2 deletion restored normal interneuron lamination in the absence of TCAs. Disruption of interneuron NMDA receptors or pharmacological inhibition of calpain also led to increased KCC2 expression and defective radial dispersion of interneurons. Thus, although TCAs are not required to guide the tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons, they provide crucial signals that restrict interneuron KCC2 levels, allowing coordinated neocortical invasion of TCAs and interneurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20770.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20770.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Gbx2</kwd><kwd>KCC2</kwd><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>TCA</kwd><kwd>calpain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibáñez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibáñez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibáñez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001388</institution-id><institution>Wenner-Gren Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zechel</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibáñez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Glutamate derived from thalamo-cortical axons regulates the radial dispersion of interneurons in the developing mouse neocortex by limiting the level of expression of the K/Cl co-transporter KCC2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interneurons of the mammalian neocortex are generated in transient neurogenic structures of the embryonic ventral forebrain, including the lateral, medial, and caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE, MGE, and CGE, respectively), the preoptic area (POA) and the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartolini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</xref>). As the developing brain expands, interneurons migrate tangentially to the overlying neocortex over a period of several days in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbin et al., 2001</xref>). They enter the cortex through a deep path following the subplate and intermediate zone (IZ) and a superficial path in the marginal zone (MZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marín, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marín and Rubenstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wichterle et al., 2001</xref>). The MGE contributes 50–60% of all cortical interneurons, including the majority of parvalbumin and somatostatin-expressing neurons of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gelman and Marín, 2010</xref>). MGE-derived interneurons develop from precursors that express the transcription factor Nkx2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2004</xref>) and are later distinguished by the expression of the LIM/homeobox gene <italic>Lhx6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavdas et al., 1999</xref>). Several molecular signals have been identified that regulate the tangential migration and dispersion of interneurons towards and within the neocortex, including Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flames et al., 2004</xref>), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Powell et al., 2001</xref>), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pozas and Ibáñez, 2005</xref>) and the chemokine Cxcl12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López-Bendito et al., 2008</xref>). After their tangential dispersion through the neocortex, interneurons switch their mode of migration from tangential to radial and invade the cortical plate. MGE-derived interneurons migrating through the IZ move dorsally to occupy positions in different cortical layers; early-born interneurons in layers V and VI, later-born in layers II-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartolini et al., 2013</xref>). Despite significant progress in the identification of signals controlling tangential migration of cortical interneurons, the mechanisms that regulate their radial dispersion and laminar distribution are less well understood.</p><p>Thalamo-cortical axons (TCAs) make ipsilateral connections between distinct thalamic nuclei and cortical areas, thereby relying sensory information to the neocortex. The development of the thalamo-cortical projection has been widely used as a model system for the study of mechanisms controlling circuit wiring in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garel and López-Bendito, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopez-Bendito and Molnár, 2003</xref>). There are several intriguing parallels between TCA pathfinding and GABAergic interneuron migration to the neocortex. After crossing the internal capsule —at about embryonic day 13 (E13) in the mouse— TCAs advance through the subpallium following a trajectory that overlaps with that used by migrating GABAergic interneurons exiting the MGE. At around E14, TCAs cross the pallial-subpallial boundary and, similar to GABAergic interneurons, enter the neocortex through the IZ, arriving at the appropriate cortical regions by E16. TCAs then wait in the IZ/subplate for 1 to 2 days before branching, invading the cortical plate and forming synapses at the appropriate layers. A similar waiting period has been observed for GABAergic interneurons entering through the IZ prior to their switching from tangential to radial migration and cortical invasion by E18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López-Bendito et al., 2008</xref>). These parallels suggest that GABAergic interneuron migration and TCA pathfinding may be interdependent and/or share common signals.</p><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TCAs may provide guidance to MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons for their tangential migration to the neocortex and subsequent radial dispersion and cortical invasion. For this purpose, we studied interneuron distribution and migration in the neocortex of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutant mouse, which lacks TCAs as a consequence of abnormal thalamic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hevner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wassarman et al., 1997</xref>). We found that MGE-derived interneurons reached the neocortex in normal numbers in mutant mice lacking Gbx2 either globally or specifically in the thalamus. However, in the absence of TCAs, or TCA-derived glutamate, a significant proportion of interneurons failed to invade the cortex and accumulated in deep cortical layers. Ablation of the KCC2 co-transporter (also known as Slc12a5) rescued this phenotype, indicating that TCAs control radial dispersion of interneurons by supplying signals, such as glutamate, that restrain interneuron KCC2 levels, allowing the normal laminar distribution of neocortical interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abnormal laminar distribution of GABAergic interneurons in neocortex lacking TCAs</title><p>In order to investigate the role of TCAs in tangential migration and radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons, we took advantage of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutant mouse, which lacks TCAs as a consequence of abnormal thalamic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hevner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wassarman et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As mice lacking Gbx2 die shortly after birth, our initial studies were focused on newborn animals. Despite the lack of TCAs, the laminar organization of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutant cortex was normal at birth, as assessed by immunostaining for several layer-specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Likewise, the area specification of prospective visual and somatosensory cortices in newborn <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutants was comparable to that of wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We visualized MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons using the Lhx6-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grigoriou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavdas et al., 1999</xref>) and quantitatively assessed their distribution across three equally-sized sectors encompassing upper, middle and lower layers of the newborn cortex, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The upper sector included layers II to V, demarcated by the expression of Cux1 (layers II-IV) and CTIP2 (layer V). The middle sector consisted mainly of layer VIa and encompassed the majority of the Tbr1<sup>+</sup> territory between the CTIP2 and CTGF markers. The lower sector included layer VIb (or subplate), expressing CTGF, and the underlying intermediate zone (IZ). Across all three primary cortices examined (i.e. prospective M1, S1 and V1), the neocortex of newborn <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice showed reduced numbers of GABAergic interneurons in the upper layers of the cortical plate compared to wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The number of GABAergic interneurons in the middle sector was comparable in mutant and wild type cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). On the other hand, more than twice as many GABAergic interneurons were found in the lower cortical sector of <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). Despite the differences between upper and lower layers, the combined counts of GABAergic interneurons across all cortical layers were not significantly different between wild type and <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This indicated that, despite their abnormal layer distribution, MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons can reach the neocortex in normal numbers in the absence of TCAs. In agreement with this, there was no difference in cell proliferation in the E12.5 MGE of <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out embryos as assessed by BrdU labeling (data not shown). Neither was the total thickness of the cortical plate (from layer I to VI) different between the two genotypes at birth (data not shown). As GABAergic interneurons enter the cortical plate through both superficial and deep routes, we investigated whether the abnormal accumulation of interneurons in deeper cortical layers of <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice was due to a higher proportion of interneurons taking the deep route of tangential migration. However, the number of Lhx6-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in superficial (MZ) versus deep (SVZ and IZ) routes was not different between wild type and <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting a defect in the radial dispersion of deep layer interneurons in the mutant.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20770.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Abnormal laminar distribution of cortical GABAergic interneurons in <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lhx6-GFP<sup>+</sup> interneurons (green) combined with immunostaining (red) for CTIP2 (layer V marker, left panel) or Tbr1 (layer VI marker, right panel) in prospective somatosensory cortex of newborn wild type (wt) and <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out (ko) mice.

In order to evaluate this, we assessed the proportion of radially oriented MGE-derived interneurons in upper and lower layers of M1, S1 and V1 primary cortical areas in <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out and wild type mice. GABAergic interneurons were considered to be in a radial orientation if their main process was at or less than a 25° angle from the radial axis of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martini et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Above this value, interneurons were considered to be in a tangential orientation. We found that fewer Lhx6-GFP<sup>+</sup> interneurons were oriented radially in the neocortex of <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). This was most pronounced in the lower cortical layers, where the proportion of radially oriented interneurons was reduced by over 50% in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) These data suggested that, in the absence of TCAs, excess GABAergic interneurons in the lower cortical layers remain in a tangential orientation. Changes in branching morphology of the leading process have been linked to tangential to radial migration switch in migrating MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baudoin et al., 2012</xref>). We analyzed the morphology of the leading process in cortical areas of newborn <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out and wild type mice. We found significantly elevated frequency of highly branched leading processes in GABAergic interneurons of the mutants compared to wild type controls in both upper and lower cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).

Alternatively, TCAs could supply signals that facilitate the tangential to radial orientation switch in GABAergic interneurons, thereby promoting their radial dispersion. The K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter KCC2 contributes to the hyperpolarizing influx of chloride ions which underlies the inhibitory function of GABA in the mature CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rivera et al., 1999</xref>). KCC2 becomes upregulated in cortical interneurons as they mature, stop migrating and adopt their final position in the cortex. In vitro studies have indicated that upregulation of KCC2 is both necessary and sufficient to reduce interneuron motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortone and Polleux, 2009</xref>), leading to the idea that KCC2 may function as a stop signal for migratory GABAergic interneurons once they reach their destination in the neocortex. We therefore investigated possible alterations in KCC2 expression among Lhx6-GFP<sup>+</sup> interneurons in upper and lower cortical layers of <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutant and wild type neocortex. At birth, most KCC2-expressing cells were also positive for Lhx6-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of GABAergic interneurons expressing KCC2 was significantly elevated in the lower cortical layers of <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggested that abnormal upregulation of KCC2 expression may restrict the radial dispersion of interneurons in the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutant. In order to test this notion, we examined the cerebral cortices of mutant mice lacking KCC2 and double mutants lacking both KCC2 and Gbx2. In the <italic>Kcc2</italic> mutant, we observed significantly more Lhx6-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the cortical plate at E16.5 compared to wild type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), suggesting premature tangential to radial orientation switch and dispersion of GABAergic interneurons in the absence of KCC2. By E18.5, the number of GABAergic interneurons in upper cortical layers was comparable in wild type and mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) and this was also maintained at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). As before, <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice presented excess GABAergic interneurons in lower cortical layers, but fewer in upper layers, compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Interestingly, this defect was rescued upon deletion of <italic>Kcc2</italic> in the double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), supporting the notion that KCC2 restrains radial dispersion of MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons. We verified these results by specifically targeting KCC2 expression in MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation directed to the ventral telencephalon. For these experiments, we used a short-hairpin RNA targeting the <italic>KCC2</italic> mRNA (shKCC2) along with a construct encoding GFP under the control of a <italic>Dlx5/6</italic> promoter (Dlx5/6-GFP), to specifically mark prospective cortical GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Marco García et al., 2011</xref>). Electroporation was performed at E13.5 in <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out and wild type embryos and the distribution of electroporated Dlx5/6-GFP<sup>+</sup> interneurons was analyzed at birth along with immunohistochemistry for KCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As expected, <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out embryos that received a control shRNA construct showed a higher accumulation of GABAergic interneurons in lower layers and lower numbers in upper layers compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, electroporation of shKCC2 normalized the distribution of GABAergic interneurons in the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutants, eliminating their differences compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>); a result that was in agreement with the data obtained in double knock-out embryos. Together, these results suggested the possibility that TCA-derived signals may be responsible for limiting KCC2 levels in migratory GABAergic interneurons thereby facilitating their tangential to radial orientation switch and cortical invasion.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20770.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Elevated KCC2 expression in GABAergic interneurons of lower cortical layers lacking TCAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of KCC2 (red) in Lhx6-GFP<sup>+</sup> interneurons (green) detected by immunohistochemistry in prospective somatosensory neocortex of newborn wild type (wt) and <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out (<italic>Gbx2</italic> ko) mice.

We speculated that TCA-derived glutamate, acting through the NMDAR/calpain pathway, could provide a mechanism to limit KCC2 levels in migratory GABAergic interneurons thereby allowing their radial dispersion in the cortical plate. In order to test the role of TCA-derived glutamate in the laminar dispersion of GABAergic interneurons, we used mice lacking the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 (also known as Slc17a6) in the thalamus, obtained by breeding <italic>Vglut2</italic><sup>Δ/fx</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moechars et al., 2006</xref>) to <italic>Olig3-Cre</italic><sup>ERT2</sup> animals.

In newborn mice, however, we found that neither thalamic nuclei nor TCAs (as labeled by 5HTT immunostaining) nor neocortex express detectable levels of VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), a result that is in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaneko and Fujiyama, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>).

Electrophysiological and expression studies have shown that, at birth, NMDARs in MGE-derived interneurons primarily contain the NR2B subunit (also known as Grin2b), with NR2A expression appearing at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manent et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monyer et al., 1994</xref>). Selective downregulation of NR2B expression in GABAergic interneurons was achieved by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation directed to the ventral telencephalon. These experiments used two different short-hairpin RNAs targeting the <italic>NR2B</italic> mRNA (shNR2Bm and shNR2Bi), used together (m+i) or separately, along with the Dlx5/6-GFP to mark electroporated MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons, and a third construct to express red fluorescent protein (RFP) in all electroplated cells. The efficiency of shNR2Bm+i constructs was tested by assessing NR2B expression in cultures of MGE cells derived from embryos that were subjected to <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Expression of NR2B in Dlx5/6-GFP<sup>+</sup> MGE cells was down regulated by shNR2Bm+i but not by a control short hairpin RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming the efficacy of the shNR2B constructs.

They are exquisitely coordinated in space and time to ensure appropriate formation of neural circuits. The thalamocortical projection, one of the most prominent tracts in the forebrain, and MGE-derived interneurons, the farthest-reaching migratory cell population in the developing telencephalon, share a similar trajectory, directionality, site of cortical entry and timing of cortical invasion during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartolini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopez-Bendito and Molnár, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marín, 2013</xref>). Whether MGE-derived interneurons derive guidance cues from TCAs for tangential migration and cortical invasion has been a matter of speculation but never directly demonstrated. Based mainly on in vitro studies, it was initially proposed that GABAergic interneurons may be guided by corticofugal axons in their migration towards the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denaxa et al., 2001</xref>). However, later studies using mutant mice lacking those axons reached contradicting results, reporting either normal or partially reduced numbers of cortical GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ying et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Mice lacking doublecortin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friocourt et al., 2007</xref>) or the protocadherin Flamingo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ying et al., 2009</xref>) have been reported to show defects in the cortical invasion of GABAergic interneurons accompanied by an overall reduction in cortex thickness. However, due to the wide expression of those proteins, both in GABAergic interneurons and many other cells, as well as the global nature of the mouse mutants employed, it remains unclear to which extent the effects observed were cell-autonomous or caused by other cortical abnormalities. For GABAergic interneurons derived from the CGE, the serotonin receptor 3A was recently found to play a role in cortical plate invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murthy et al., 2014</xref>). Here we showed that MGE-derived interneurons can reach the neocortex in normal numbers in the absence of TCAs, indicating that they do not require this axonal tract for tangential migration from the ventral telencephalon nor for tangential dispersion through the subplate and IZ. However, we found that MGE-derived interneurons did require TCAs for proper radial dispersion and cortical invasion. Importantly, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutants used in this study showed no abnormalities in neocortical lamination, arealization or thickness. We further showed that signals derived from TCAs, such as glutamate, rather than the axons themselves, are required for the normal radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons. Mechanistically, we obtained genetic and pharmacological evidence supporting the cell-autonomous involvement of a NMDAR-calpain-KCC2 signaling cascade in this process.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Thalamo-cortical axons regulate the radial dispersion of neocortical GABAergic interneurons</title><p>We have presented two lines of evidence demonstrating that the effects of <italic>Gbx2</italic> deletion on the laminar distribution of MGE-derived interneurons were caused non-cell-autonomously by disruption of the thalamocortical projection.

Second, specific deletion of <italic>Gbx2</italic> in the MGE had no effect on the radial dispersion and laminar distribution of GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex. Our study of the orientation of the leading process of MGE-derived interneurons indicated that the switch from a tangential to a radial orientation is defective in the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutant. In the mutant neocortex, many interneurons failed to align their leading processes in a radial orientation, including several neurons that had succeeded to enter the cortical plate, suggesting an incomplete tangential to radial switch. This switch requires branching and elongation of the leading process, as well as retraction of the non-preferred branch in its bifurcated tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellion et al., 2005</xref>). Complete turning from a tangential to a radial position likely requires several cycles of leading process branching, branch selection, branch elongation and movement of the cell nucleus. In the <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutants, a higher proportion of interneurons remained in a tangential orientation with a highly branched leading process, a morphology that has previously been linked to abnormal tangential to radial orientation switch in MGE-derived interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baudoin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>KCC2 negatively regulates the radial dispersion of neocortical GABAergic interneurons</title><p>The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the migration of cells with a bifurcated leading process are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López-Bendito et al., 2008</xref>). KCC2 expression increases upon maturation of cortical GABAergic interneurons and has been shown to function as a stop signal for the migration of these cells in in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortone and Polleux, 2009</xref>). This effect was proposed to be mediated by KCC2’s ability to reduce membrane potential upon activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, thereby decreasing the activity of voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) and overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortone and Polleux, 2009</xref>). KCC2 has also been shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton to regulate spine formation, an activity that appears to be independent from its chloride transport function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Llano et al., 2015</xref>). Further work will be required to determine whether KCC2 regulates tangential to radial switch and laminar dispersion of cortical GABAergic interneurons through its effects on GABA signaling, the cytoskeleton or some other mechanism. In either case, high KCC2 levels may slow down the branching cycles of the leading process of GABAergic interneurons, resulting in an insufficient number of cycles for proper tangential to radial turning. In the <italic>Kcc2</italic> knock-out, a higher frequency of branching cycles may explain the premature radial dispersion of GABAergic interneurons that we observed at E16.5. Deletion or knockdown of <italic>Kcc2</italic> rescued the radial dispersion phenotype of MGE-derived interneurons in the neocortex of <italic>Gbx2</italic> knock-out mice. As the neocortex in these double mutants is also expected to lack TCAs, it can be concluded that neither tangential to radial orientation switch nor radial dispersion of cortical GABAergic interneurons require the actual presence of TCAs in the cortex. Thus, GABAergic interneurons do not appear to require TCAs as guide or substrate for laminar invasion. Instead, our results indicate that radial dispersion of GABAergic interneurons requires signals derived from TCAs and that this requirement can be circumvented by depletion of KCC2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TCA-derived glutamate facilitates cortical invasion of GABAergic interneurons through regulation of KCC2 levels</title><p>It has been reported that KCC2 has a high turnover in neurons, being significantly or totally replaced within 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rivera et al., 2004</xref>). The ability of the NMDA receptor to regulate KCC2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puskarjov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2012a</xref>) indicated the possibility that glutamate derived from TCAs regulates KCC2 levels in cortical GABAergic interneurons at the time of their tangential to radial switch. Our analysis of <italic>Vglut2</italic> conditional mutant mice brings support to this idea. Vglut2 was found to be the main vesicular glutamate transporter in TCAs of newborn mice. Ablation of <italic>Vglut2</italic> in thalamic nuclei phenocopied <italic>Gbx2</italic> mutants in both the abnormal laminar distribution of and increased KCC2 expression in cortical GABAergic interneurons. We propose that the release of glutamate by TCAs in the environment of the subplate and IZ limits KCC2 expression in migratory GABAergic interneurons, facilitating completion of tangential to radial orientation switch and cortical invasion. By restricting KCC2 levels in migrating interneurons, TCA-derived glutamate may not only contribute to coordinate TCA and interneuron cortical invasion but also allow interneurons to reach their final laminar position in the neocortex before their full maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of the NMDAR-calpain-KCC2 cascade in the control of GABAergic interneuron migration into the neocortex</title><p>The discovery of the NMDAR-calpain-KCC2 cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puskarjov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2012a</xref>) offered a plausible molecular mechanism for the control of interneuron KCC2 levels. Interneurons express NMDAR subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manent et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monyer et al., 1994</xref>) and NMDAR activation increases their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortone and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soria and Valdeolmillos, 2002</xref>). In our studies, we found that downregulation of the NR2B subunit in MGE-derived interneurons hinders their radial dispersion, in agreement with a cell-autonomous role of NMDAR signaling in the regulation of cortical invasion of GABAergic interneurons. NMDAR activity and calcium influx have been proposed to restrict KCC2 levels through proteolytic cleavage by the calcium-activated protease calpain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puskarjov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2012a</xref>). The human genome has revealed over a dozen calpains, with calpain isoforms 1 and 2 being the most abundant in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Calpain substrates include many cytoskeletal and signaling proteins and there is abundant evidence linking calpains to the regulation of cell migration, although to date mainly in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franco and Huttenlocher, 2005</xref>). Calpain activity has been shown to contribute to the regulation of leading process branching in cultured cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lysko et al., 2014</xref>), one of the key steps in tangential to radial orientation switch. Our studies show that pharmacological blockade of calpain increases KCC2 expression in cortical GABAergic interneurons and hampers the radial dispersion. Importantly, inhibition of calpain had no effect on the laminar distribution of GABAergic interneurons in <italic>Kcc2</italic> mutant mice, indicating that the ability of calpain to affect migratory interneurons is dependent on KCC2. These findings provide the first demonstration of a role for calpain in the radial dispersion of interneurons in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>GABAergic interneuron deficits in postnatal neocortex lacking TCAs</title><p>Deficits in PV and SST interneurons in the neocortex of 3 week old conditional <italic>Olig3-Cre;Gbx2</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup> mice indicate that the absence of TCAs did not simply cause a delay in radial dispersion of GABAergic cells but resulted in permanent deficits in the normal complement of cortical interneurons. It is possible that such deficits are the direct consequence of the initial interneuron deficit in the upper cortical layers of newborn mutants. It should also be noted that, after invading the cortical plate by radial migration, GABAergic interneurons continue sorting into specific cortical layers during the first days after birth; by 3 weeks of age, their laminar positioning is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyoshi and Fishell, 2011</xref>). It is therefore possible that this sorting process is altered in the mutants due to the lack of TCA input. In the deeper cortical layers, the normal complement of PV and SST interneurons in three week old mutants suggests that the initial excess of interneurons in the lower layers was subsequently eliminated, or that the excess cells did not differentiate into mature PV and SST cells. We note that we have not detected increased cell death, as assessed by immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, in neocortex of newborn or 3-week old <italic>Olig3-Cre;Gbx2</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup> mice (data not shown), indicating that any cell loss should have occurred between P0 and P21.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting manuscript from Zechel and colleagues characterizes the role of thalamocortical axons (TCAs) in the radial migration of interneurons. It is known that interneurons colonize cortical layers in an inside-out pattern that is similar to pyramidal neurons, with early-born cells mainly populating deeper layers and late-born cells mainly committed to upper layers. Although some factors such as cues provided by pyramidal neurons and timing of neurogenesis influence the layering of interneurons, little is known about the mechanisms regulating this process. Here, the authors find that interneurons accumulate in lower cortical layers of mutant cortices lacking thalamocortical innervation. Interestingly, impaired radial migration of interneurons correlated with high levels of the KCC2 transporter whose removal was sufficient to restore interneuron lamination. Keeping KCC2 levels low, the authors argue, permits interneurons to migrate into the cortical plate. The authors go on to characterize the mechanisms controlling KCC2 levels and suggest that both disruption of interneuron NMDA receptors and inhibition of calpain activity lead to increased KCC2 expression.</p><p>This manuscript brings multiple transgenic mouse models to bear on this question. However, the observation of impaired interneuron migration in the absence of TCAs is more compelling than the proposed molecular mechanism and some additional data and discussion is required to support the overall story.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, there seems to be an increased proportion of interneurons expressing KCC2 in <italic>Gbx2</italic> KO cortices. However, the presented images are not very convincing representations of the quantification, and the data would be more compelling with better images.</p><p>2) The authors state that KCC2 upregulation impairs radial migration of interneurons because the defects observed in <italic>Gbx2</italic> KO cortices were rescued upon deletion of KCC2 in the double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, non-cell-autonomous effects cannot be ruled out on the basis that KCC2 was also depleted in cortical neurons, which affects their maturation and activity (Cancedda et al., 2007). To make the strong point that KCC2 expression in interneurons is causative for their migration would require cell-type specific manipulations of KCC2 expression selectively in interneurons, and although the reviewers would be very interested to see this, we do not consider this experiment required for this manuscript. However in lieu of those data, the authors need to back off on the mechanism and discuss the likelihood the effects are cell-autonomous or not.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> the authors show that depleting the NR2B NMDA subunit alters interneuron cortical layering. However, it is unclear whether these effects correlate with increased expression of KCC2 levels in interneurons, which would be expected on the basis of the model. The authors would strengthen their model (and provide an alternative way to deal with the concern in point 3) if they present images and quantify KCC2 protein levels in NR2B knockdown neurons similar to the quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We do not consider the experiment to be essential, but a discussion of this point should be added to the text if the experiment is not included.</p><p>4) It is a minimum standard in the field for knockdown experiments to show a second independent shRNA against the target of interest that shows the same phenotype. These experiments need to be included.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> the images were meant to demonstrate that there is a reduction of both parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in upper layers of the cortex. The effects are small and the images not very convincing. Moreover, the reduction in the numbers of interneurons populating upper layers was not accompanied by an accumulation in lower layers as shown in newborn sections. Could an increase in interneuron cell death account for the lack of accumulation in deeper layers and/or significant reduction in parvalbumin+ total numbers? These points should be discussed in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20770.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, there seems to be an increased proportion of interneurons expressing KCC2 in Gbx2 KO cortices.

Thus, depleting the NR2B NMDA subunit alters interneuron cortical layering, and this correlates with increased expression of KCC2 levels in the interneurons. This result is in agreement with the negative regulation of KCC2 expression by NMDAR activity.</p><p><italic>4) It is a minimum standard in the field for knockdown experiments to show a second independent shRNA against the target of interest that shows the same phenotype. These experiments need to be included.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>: We now show knockdown of NR2B expression by in utero electroporation using two independent shRNA sequences as requested.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> the images were meant to demonstrate that there is a reduction of both parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in upper layers of the cortex. The effects are small and the images not very convincing. Moreover, the reduction in the numbers of interneurons populating upper layers was not accompanied by an accumulation in lower layers as shown in newborn sections. Could an increase in interneuron cell death account for the lack of accumulation in deeper layers and/or significant reduction in parvalbumin+ total numbers? These points should be discussed in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have not detected increased cell death, as assessed by immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, in neocortex of newborn or 3-week old <italic>Olig3-Cre;Gbx2</italic>fx/fx mice (data not shown), indicating that any cell loss should have occurred between P0 and P21. This is now discussed in the text as requested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
