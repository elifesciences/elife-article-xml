significant roles in nutrient acquisition and immune evasion in the host. While the factors that are involved in the synthesis and delivery of SLPs in the inner membrane are well characterized, the molecular machinery required for the movement of SLPs to the surface are still not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the translocation of a SLP TbpB through a Slam1-dependent pathway. Using purified components, we developed an in vitro translocation assay where unfolded TbpB is transported through Slam1-containing proteoliposomes, confirming Slam1 as an outer membrane translocon. While looking to identify factors to increase translocation efficiency, we discovered the periplasmic chaperone Skp interacted with TbpB in the periplasm of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The presence of Skp was found to increase the translocation efficiency of TbpB in the reconstituted translocation assays. A knockout of Skp in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> revealed that Skp is essential for functional translocation of TbpB to the bacterial surface. Taken together, we propose a pathway for surface destined lipoproteins, where Skp acts as a holdase for Slam-mediated TbpB translocation across the outer membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>surface lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>Gram negative</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>membrane proteins</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd><kwd><italic>Neisseria</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-148795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moraes</surname><given-names>Trevor F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Slam is an outer membrane protein translocon that functions with the periplasmic chaperone Skp to translocate protein substrates across the outer membrane of Gram-negative cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transport of proteins to their correct spatiotemporal location is imperative for cell survival. This key process often requires the movement of proteins across lipid bilayers through a translocation channel which is also referred to as a translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walter and Lingappa, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schnell and Hebert, 2003</xref>). Translocons are found in all living organisms and include the Sec translocon that is responsible for the bulk of protein transport across the inner plasma membrane (in prokaryotes) and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (in eukaryotes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson and van Waes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsirigotaki et al., 2017</xref>). Gram-negative bacteria contain an additional outer membrane that is separated from the plasma membrane (or inner membrane – IM) by the periplasm and a peptidoglycan layer. A number of outer membrane translocons have been previously identified and use different molecular mechanisms to export proteins to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karuppiah et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Surface lipoproteins (SLPs) are peripheral membrane proteins that are anchored to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. These proteins play critical roles in bacterial physiology and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilson and Bernstein, 2016</xref>). Many SLPs were shown to improve bacterial fitness and survival in the host environment, especially for pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Neisseria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, and <italic>Spirochetes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hooda and Moraes, 2018</xref>). SLPs contain an N-terminal signal peptide that allows their translocation across the inner membrane by the Sec or Tat machinery. In the periplasmic space, the SLPs are modified by three biosynthetic enzymes that cleave the signal peptide and add a lipid group to the N-terminal cysteine residue which anchors them to the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zückert, 2014</xref>). Most of these lipidated SLPs are recognized by the Lol system, which then delivers SLPs across the periplasm to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szewczyk and Collet, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Okuda and Tokuda, 2011</xref>). In the outer membrane, the protein machinery responsible for the translocation of SLPs across the outer membrane is known only for a handful of SLPs. Recently, an outer membrane protein named Slam (<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>urface <bold><underline>l</underline></bold>ipoprotein <bold><underline>a</underline></bold>ssembly <bold><underline>m</underline></bold>odulator) was identified in the human pathogen <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> that is necessary for the surface display of the SLP transferrin binding protein B or TbpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>). Slam-like proteins were subsequently found in several Gram-negative bacteria from the phylum <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hooda et al., 2017b</xref>) and has been designated as a type XI secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Grossman et al., 2021</xref>). Coexpression of Slam1 (the first Slam discovered) with TbpB in the model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which lacks both Slam1 and TbpB genes, allows for functional surface display of TbpB. Further, Slam1 was found to interact with TbpB in the outer membrane through coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Taken together, these results confirmed that Slam1 plays a critical role in the transport of TbpB across the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>). However, the genetic experiments in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and the heterologous expression experiments in <italic>E. coli</italic> did not yield a concrete answer as to the exact role of Slam during SLP translocation.</p><p>In this study, we developed an in vitro functional assay that allowed us to investigate the role of Slam1 in TbpB translocation. Such assays have been previously developed to study the role of outer membrane protein translocons such as the Bam complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hagan et al., 2011</xref>), the autotransporter EspP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roman-Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>), the two-partner secretion system protein B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Norell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fan et al., 2012</xref>) and the lipopolysaccharide translocon LptD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sherman et al., 2018</xref>). By reconstituting Slam1-mediated TbpB translocation in vitro, we demonstrate that Slam1 acts as an autonomous translocon for the movement of TbpB across the membrane. Using in vitro translocation assays developed in this study, we reveal the first mechanistic insight of Slam-dependent translocation of unfolded lipoproteins across the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, we discovered that the periplasmic chaperone, Skp, interacts with TbpB and another Slam-dependent SLP, named HpuA in the periplasm. We also found that the presence of Skp is crucial for the efficient translocation of TbpB to the surface of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. Taken together, we propose a pathway for the localization of SLPs from the cytoplasm to the surface of Slam containing Gram-negative bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Incorporation of Slam1 into liposomes for functional study</title><p>Although Slam1 was first discovered in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>), expressing <italic>Neisseria</italic> Slam1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> for purification and structural study has been proven a challenge in terms of yield and protein stability. Fortunately, our bioinformatic study later revealed hundreds of homologs of <italic>Neisseria</italic> Slam1 in other Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hooda et al., 2017a</xref>) including the <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> Slam1 (Mcat Slam1) that has 40.3% sequence identity. The purification of Mcat Slam1 in <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-B-<sc>D</sc>-maltoside (DDM) proved to be more stable and resulted in much higher yields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the feasibility of characterizing the function of <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> Slam1 (Mcat Slam1) in SLP translocation, we coexpressed Mcat Slam1 with its substrate Mcat TbpB and examined the display of Mcat TbpB on the surface of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The results showed that TbpB was successfully reconstituted on the surface of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells when it was coexpressed with either <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> Slam1 or <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> Slam1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Coexpression of TbpB with the negative control Slam2, a homolog of Slam in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> that are responsible for the surface display of another SLP, hemoglobin–haptoglobin utilization protein A (HpuA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hooda et al., 2017a</xref>), failed to reconstitute TbpB on the surface of <italic>E. coli</italic>. This experiment illustrated that TbpB is specifically reconstituted on the bacterial cell surface by Slam1 and suggested that the components from <italic>E. coli</italic> are sufficient for Slam1-dependent TbpB translocation. Thus, <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> Slam1 was used as a model for functional studies in this paper.</p><p>To determine whether Slam1 is an outer membrane translocon working independently from other major translocation systems such as the Bam complex, we attempted to reconstitute the Slam1-dependent TbpB translocation with minimal components. First, we tested the incorporation of purified Mcat Slam1–DDM complex (N-terminal his-tag) into liposomes. Detergent removal allowed for successful insertion of Mcat Slam1 as seen by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), and western blot analysis using α-his antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To examine liposome insertion, we used the <italic>E. coli</italic> BamABCDE complex as a control. BamABCDE was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hagan et al., 2011</xref>) and could potentiate the insertion of the outer membrane protein OmpA into liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Insertion of Mcat Slam1 or Bam complex into liposomes did not affect the stability of liposomes as proteoliposomes containing these proteins were able to float to the top of sucrose gradients upon ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a</xref>). Further, to examine the orientation of Mcat Slam1 and Bam complex in proteoliposomes, we incubated the Mcat Slam1 and BamABCDE containing proteoliposomes with proteinase K. The addition of proteinase K led to formation of low-molecular weights bands in an SDS–PAGE gel (marked with asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5b</xref>, left panel) and loss of Slam1 band in an α-His western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5b</xref>, right panel), indicating that over 80% of Slam is inserted with its periplasmic domain protruding from the surface – the ‘inside-out’ orientation required for the in vitro translocation assay.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Slam1 proteoliposomes translocate purified unfolded substrate</title><p>Once we established a proteoliposome with Slam1 incorporation, we attempted to detect the Slam-mediated transport of SLPs across the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>). To this end, we purified lipidated functional <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> TbpB in DDM detergent for the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) and then unfolded the proteins using urea. DDM was removed by SM2 biobeads, and the urea concentration was reduced upon diluting the urea-unfolded TbpB into the preformed proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Translocation of TbpB was assessed by sensitivity to proteinase K. Only the urea-unfolded TbpB was successfully translocated into Slam1 proteoliposomes (~3% protection), but not in empty liposomes or Bam proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Although the protection is low, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test determined the translocation efficiency is significant between Slam1 proteoliposomes and the two negative controls for unfolded TbpB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This protection results from translocation of TbpB into the lumen of the Slam containing proteoliposome and not from Slam1–TbpB interactions, as a proteinase K digestion of TbpB in the presence of Slam1–DDM results in completely digested TbpB in the solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref> – upper panel). Moreover, the protection of TbpB was specific to Slam1 proteoliposomes only, as Slam1 proteoliposomes did not protect the negative control AfuA, a nonlipoprotein that typically resides in the periplasm of <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7f</xref> – lower panel). The addition of the Bam complex did not affect the TbpB translocation efficiency, suggesting that Bam complex does not play a role in this translocation process. Finally, the low efficiency of insertion observed for the defined system, together with the observation that translocation across Slam1 proteoliposomes occurs only when the TbpB is denatured by urea, lead us to hypothesize that there are likely additional periplasmic factors that keep the SLP unfolded for an efficient translocation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Slam1 is necessary for translocation of unfolded TbpB.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Model of a defined in vitro assay for TbpB translocation. <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> TbpB (folded and urea-unfolded) is translocated inside Slam1-containing proteoliposomes.

Many OMPs require inner membrane factors for energy transduction such as TonB-dependent receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pawelek et al., 2006</xref>) or chaperone activity TamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stubenrauch et al., 2016</xref>) to perform their function. Studies of the Lol system have shown that LolA shuttles between the inner membrane and the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szewczyk and Collet, 2016</xref>), and hence we predicted that Slam-mediated SLP translocation does not require any inner membrane factors unlike the Lpt system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sherman et al., 2018</xref>). To validate this hypothesis, we incubated the empty, Bam, Slam1, or Bam + Slam1 proteoliposomes with the supernatant isolated from spheroplasts that were expressing TbpB (spheroplast-independent translocation). As seen previously in the spheroplast-dependent translocation assay, we observed similar TbpB protection from proteinase K in proteoliposomes containing Slam1 (~40% protection) and Bam + Slam1 (~35%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> – lower panel) but not empty (~7%) nor Bam (~5%) proteoliposomes. Interestingly, we did not observe any loss in translocation efficiency between spheroplast-dependent and -independent assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), confirming that Slam-mediated SLP translocation is independent of SLP release from the inner membrane.

Meanwhile, the TbpB that is translocated and protected by Slam1 proteoliposomes was shown to retain its functionality through binding to human transferrin-conjugated resin.

Two other periplasmic chaperones which are known to be involved in the transport of OMPs, SurA, and DegP were also examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, none of the chaperones pulled down the negative control protein AfuA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> – first panel). Although chaperones SurA and DegP showed no binding to TbpB, a small amount of HpuA was detected in the elution fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> – third panel). However, these interactions were probably nonspecific since the intensity of HpuA bands detected in SurA and DegP elutions are similar to the nonspecific binding levels detected in the negative control Ni-NTA beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> – third panel). The coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that only the periplasmic chaperone Skp interacts with the spheroplast-released TbpB and HpuA, as these lipoproteins were found in the elution (E) fraction of the Skp pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> – second and third panels). Skp is a well-studied homotrimeric chaperone which is known to bind unfolded proteins in the periplasm to prevent their aggregation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Volokhina et al., 2011</xref>).

TbpB that was secreted from K12 spheroplast mutants that lacked Skp or DegP, was incubated with Slam1 proteoliposomes for translocation. The overall results were consistent with the in vivo translocation in K12 <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In comparison with wild-type spheroplast TbpB, the <italic>Δskp</italic>-spheroplast-secreted TbpB failed to translocate inside of Slam1 proteoliposomes, while the translocation efficiency of <italic>Δdegp</italic>-spheroplast-secreted TbpB was only marginally reduced. This suggests that Slam-mediated translocation of SLPs requires the periplasmic chaperone Skp.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Skp increases the translocation of purified TbpB in Slam1-containing proteoliposomes</title><p>Given that Skp is necessary for Slam-mediated translocation, we hypothesized that addition of purified <italic>E. coli</italic> Skp should increase the translocation efficiency of purified TbpB into Slam1 proteoliposomes. To test this hypothesis, we purified <italic>E. coli</italic> Skp and LolA and added these to urea-denatured TbpB prior to incubation with Slam1-containing proteoliposomes. Periplasmic chaperone SurA was also purified and used as a negative control as we have shown that SurA does not interact with TbpB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> – second panel). As expected, with the addition of Skp to Slam1 proteoliposomes, the translocation efficiency of TbpB significantly increased by 10-fold (30% protection) in comparison with addition of SurA into the same proteoliposomes (3.5% protection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Notably, the addition of Skp to the empty liposomes also increased TbpB’s protection by 3-fold (up to 10% protection) relative to the control SurA + Slam1 proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> – right panel). This result is comparable to with the background protection observed for the empty liposomes in the translocation assays which used TbpB secreted directly from spheroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The protection might be due to protease resistance that chaperones provide for their substrates in the periplasm which has previously also been reported for unfolded OMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the background protection is from the protease resistance of chaperone–substrate complexes, the samples were spun down against a sucrose gradient (0–60% wt/vol) after the proteinase K treatment to isolate only the proteoliposomes. The western blots and Coomassie blue stained SDS–PAGE showed a clear separation of the two components, the intact proteoliposomes in the top layer and unincorporated proteins in the middle and bottom layers of the sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> – left panel). While most of the unincorporated proteins were located in the bottom and middle fractions, significant amounts of Slam1 and TbpB were found only in the top fractions of Slam1 proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> – upper left panel). In comparison to the SurA + Slam1 proteoliposomes, the addition of Skp to Slam1 proteoliposomes increased translocation efficiency for TbpB by almost 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> – right panel). This ratio supports the previous result of the 3-fold increase in protection from proteinase K observed when comparing the Skp–TbpB chaperone-mediated protection with the translocation-mediated protection observed with Skp–TbpB + Slam1 proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> – right panel). There was no trace of TbpB in either of the negative controls which could be attributed to the presence of trace amounts of proteinase K which could have continuously degraded the unfolded TbpB during the 18 hr ultracentrifuge run. Taken together, these results suggest that Skp plays an important role in the translocation of TbpB to the surface via Slam1, likely through its holdase function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Deletion of Skp in B16B6 decreases the exposure of TbpB on the surface of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic></title><p>To examine the role of Skp in the Slam-dependent translocation of SLPs in B16B6 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> that contains endogenous TbpB and Slam1, we deleted the gene <italic>skp</italic> (Δskp strain) and examined its effect on surface display of TbpB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Such experiments have been previously done in other studies for periplasmic chaperones SurA, Skp, and DegQ (homolog of DegP) in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> in which a single deletion of either one of the chaperones did not affect cell vitality nor the expression of OMPs or their insertion into the outer membrane via the Bam complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Volokhina et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, the deletion of <italic>skp</italic> (<italic>Δskp</italic>) overall did not affect the growth of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> as the cells reached the optimal OD<sub>600</sub> after 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a</xref>). However, the total amount of TbpB detected after 18 hr of growth was significantly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Such a reduction was also observed in a <italic>Δslam1</italic> strain, and it has been shown in the previous study that in the absence of Slam1, the built-up TbpB in the periplasm was subjected to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>). Similar rationale can be made here for the reduction of TbpB in <italic>Δskp</italic> strain, as without Skp to keep unfolded TbpB for Slam1 translocation, the built-up TbpB was eventually degraded by periplasmic proteases. To examine whether the deletion of Skp only affected the translocation of TbpB to the surface, equal expression of TbpB is also needed for the comparison. Thus, the cells were treated with 0.1 mM deferoxamine, an iron-chelating agent, to induce the expression of proteins that are involved in iron acquisition such as TbpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fegan et al., 2019</xref>). In this assay, we used α-TbpB antibody to probe for TbpB on the cell surface. Unlike the two negative controls (<italic>ΔtbpB</italic> and <italic>Δslam1</italic>) which completely inhibit the translocation of TbpB, deletion of Skp reduces the amount of TbpB on the surface about 50% comparing to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> – top panel). Whole cells samples of these strains were analyzed on western blots to assess the expression of the Slam1–TbpB pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The results indicated that the amount of TbpB within the mutant strains (<italic>Δslam1</italic> and <italic>Δskp</italic>) were successfully induced by deferoxamine to a comparable level of TbpB expression in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> – top panel) and depletion of Skp did not affect the expression level of Slam1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> – middle panel). Thus, the reduction of TbpB on the surface of the <italic>Δskp</italic> strain is likely due to the decrease in translocation activity of Slam1. This result is comparable to the translocation of Mcat TbpB to the surface of the <italic>E. coli Δskp</italic> mutant in which the signal from a C-terminal flag-tag was used to assess the surface display of the lipoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Periplasmic chaperone Skp is important for translocation of TbpB to the surface of <italic>N.</italic> <italic>meningitidis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Relative fluorescence intensity accessing the presence of TbpB (65 kDa) on the surface of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> mutants using α-TbpB antibody (exposure – top) and biotinylated human transferrin (functional – bottom).

By using an in vitro assay to reconstitute the translocation of TbpB across a biological membrane, we showed that Slam1 is necessary to translocate TbpB in absence of other outer membrane machinery such as the Bam complex. Unlike other translocons that require energy such as ATP or proton motive force to mediate translocation, we found that Slam1 instead requires periplasmic chaperones to keep prefolded TbpB available for efficient translocation. Using an <italic>E. coli</italic> model, Skp was found to interact with TbpB and HpuA in the periplasm after these SLPs were released from the inner membrane. Existing in the trimeric form, chaperone Skp is known to act as a holdase for the prefolded OMPs as they localize across the periplasm prior to their insertion into the outer membrane by the Bam complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mas et al., 2019</xref>). Given that TbpB and HpuA contain at least one beta-barrel domain similar to OMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calmettes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), Skp might interact with these SLPs in similar manner to keep them in their prefolded states prior to translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walton et al., 2009</xref>). In our in vitro reconstitution assays, the presence of Skp is important for efficient translocation of TbpB into Slam1 proteoliposomes. The deletion of <italic>skp</italic> in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> did not affect the expression of the OMP Slam1; however, it resulted in the loss of functional TbpB on the surface of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. Although a fraction of TbpB could be detected on the surface in the <italic>Δskp</italic> mutant, it is not clear whether these TbpB were misfolded after the translocation or only a fraction of TbpB was exposed on the surface. Further investigation will be needed to understand how TbpB–Skp complex is recognized and translocated by Slam1, as well as how TbpB is folded once it is localized to the surface. Taken together, our data suggest that periplasmic chaperone Skp is required to keep SLPs in their prefolded states in the periplasm for proper translocation to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria via the Slam translocon.</p><p>Combined with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>), we propose a model for the SLPs localization from the inner membrane to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Upon emerging from the Sec translocon, periplasmic chaperone Skp binds to SLPs and keeps them in the prefolded state. The SLPs are then modified and lipidated by the three enzymes – Lgt, Lsp, and Lnt before being transferred to the Lol complex. As the SLPs are released into the periplasm, LolA accommodates the N-terminal triacyl lipid group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tajima et al., 1998</xref>), while Skp remains bound to the SLPs to prevent them from prematurely folding prior to being translocated by Slam. Upon being released to the periplasm, SLP complexes are recognized by Slam for translocation to the cell surface. Drawing from similarities between two-partner secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guérin et al., 2017</xref>) and the Slam system, we propose the movement of the SLP across the outer membrane occurs via the Slam membrane domain. Interestingly, Slam substrates such as TbpB or HpuA also contain a lipid anchor which most likely needs to be flipped from the inner leaflet of the outer leaflet. The presence of a lateral opening in the Slam transmembrane domain would allow the hydrophobic lipid anchor access to the hydrophobic membrane environment, which is similar to functions of lateral gates observed in BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>) and LptD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gu et al., 2015</xref>) outermembrane translocons. Given that the Slam translocon does not require ATP as an energy source, we speculate that the folding of SLPs on the surface might provide a driving force to further pull the substrates through Slam barrel domain. High resolution structural and additional biochemical studies of Slam will be required to reveal these mechanistic details of Slam-dependent SLP translocation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of localization for Slam-dependent surface lipoproteins in Gram-negative bacteria.</title><p>Once the surface lipoproteins emerged from the Sec complex, periplasmic chaperone Skp binds to the SLPs to prevent early folding while their N-terminus is modified and lipidated by Lgt, Lsp, and Lnt before getting passed to the Lol complex. LolA then releases lipidated SLPs to the periplasm while Skp stays bound to prevent SLPs folding. LolB in the outer membrane (OM) might serve as the receiver for the LolA–SLP–Skp complex. The ‘specificity motif’ present at the C-terminus of the unfolded SLP is recognized by Slam and then transported across the outer membrane through the Slam channel and folds on the other side. Once the entire length of the SLP is transported, the Slam lateral gate allows the lipid anchor to ‘flip’ from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72822-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains used in this study are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> were grown in LB media containing antibiotics when necessary – 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml erythromycin, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, reviewers agree that the reconstitution of Slam-mediated protein translocation potentially has a high impact and the identification of Skp as a specific vehicle for proper targeting and assembly is a novel finding.</p><p>We hope that authors will constructively address the points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I. Major scientific concerns:</p><p>1) Please further emphasize the novelty of this work in a more persuasive way for general readers and researchers in the field.</p><p>Reviewer 1 raised critical concerns on the rationale of this work. More specifically,</p><p>1-i) Have we learned novel molecular insights besides the confirmation of the group's previous discovery?</p><p>1-ii) The specific role of Skp in translocation is interesting but not surprising, considering that periplasmic holdases are already known to be extensively involved in the biogenesis of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins.</p><p>2) To claim that TbpB has been indeed translocated by Slam in the liposomal system, more convincing data need to be provided in addition to Proteinase K (PK) protection. Reviewers ask the following specific questions:</p><p>2-i) Does the portion of TbpB that is protected from PK have correct conformation and membrane-topology? (Reviewers 1 and 3)</p><p>2-ii) How can authors rule out the possibility that binding of TpbB to Slam1 does not protect TbpB from PK digestion? (Reviewer 3)</p><p>2-iii) Showing the time-dependence of the translocation process and comparing it to the timescale of other reported translocation processes across the outer membrane (for example, membrane-insertion rates of BAM-mediated OMP translocation in vitro) will further support authors' conclusion that TbpB is translocated across the outer membrane. (Reviewer 3)</p><p>2-iv) Please consider using a model unfolded protein other than TpbB as a control in the translocation assay to verify the specificity of Slam for TpbB. (Reviewer 3)</p><p>3) Please, address the following questions that can be potentially raised by readers.</p><p>3i) Is the lipidation of TpbB required for translocation? (Reviewer 3)</p><p>3ii) Figure S2: a permeabilization control should be included: what if Slam1 overexpression changes the permeability of the OM?

Lines 119-127: More explanations are needed regarding what are the effects of urea on liposomes, conformation of TbpB, Slam1 and Bam:</p><p>&gt;Is 0.66M urea enough to keep TbpB unfolded and Slam1 and Bam still functional?</p><p>&gt;Would there be any osmotic stress on liposomes, which may affect the translocation of TbpB?</p><p>&gt;Is 3% translocation efficiency enough to say that the translocation has actually occurred?</p><p>2. Figure 1b: More explanations are needed on the band patterns:</p><p>&gt; Why is the TbpB band split into three-two at ~75 kD and one at ~63 kD (+ProK and -Triton) in the presence of urea?</p><p>&gt; The additional weak lower band of TbpB (~63 kD, +Proteinase K and -Triton) should be explained as in the asterisk-marked Figure 2b.</p><p>3.

More explanation is needed to completely exclude the contribution of DegP.</p><p>7. Lines 248-251: &quot;The western blots and Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE showed a clear separation of the two components (Figure 4d). While most of the proteins were in the bottom and middle fraction, significant amount of Slam1 and TbpB were found only in the liposomes fraction collected from the top layer.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Figure 4d is not fully convincing. If there is no Slam1 in liposomes (empty), Tbp or Tbp/Skp proteins should be separated from the liposomes and stay at the bottom. But, there is no Tbp detected at the bottom.</p><p>8. Line 277: An explanation is needed for the B16B6 Δskp strain. It popped up out of nowhere.</p><p>9. Skp is known as a highly basic protein and electrostatic interaction are known to be important for binding of clients. It should be discussed whether the sequence of TbpB has any local or global sequence features for interacting with Skp.</p><p>10. Lines 322-323: &quot;Upon their insertion into the inner leaflet of the outer membrane, LolA:SLP:Skp complexes are recognized by Slam for translocation to the cell surface.&quot;</p><p>&gt; There seems no evidence regarding whether the LolA:SLP:Skp complexes bind the outer membrane first and then are recognized by Slam. They could be directly recruited by Slam.</p><p>11. Lines 330-332: &quot;Given that Slam translocon seems to require no energy input, we speculate that the folding of SLPs on the surface might provide driving force to further pull the SLPs through Slam barrel domain.&quot;</p><p>&gt; This claim (no energy input is required) may be toned down because the reconstitution system always yields low translocation efficiency compare to the cell-based system.</p><p>12.

Here we demonstrate that Slam is autonomously able to translocate proteins across membranes. To date there has been no study has demonstrated the interaction of Skp with lipoproteins prior to translocation across the outer membrane in a Slam-dependent manner. So far, there are only studies describing Skp as a holdase for OMPs (transmembrane only) and quality control for unfolded proteins in the periplasm. Furthermore, LolA is the only known periplasmic factor that binds to the triacyl-lipid at the N-terminal of lipoproteins in these biogenesis studies. The fate of lipoproteins in the periplasm in term of stability, folding or interactions have not been studied. What we propose in this paper is that LolA binds to the triacyl-lipid and the chaperone Skp binds the surface lipoproteins in the periplasm to prevent them from early folding for more efficient and functional translocation via the Slam outer membrane protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To claim that TbpB has been indeed translocated by Slam in the liposomal system, more convincing data need to be provided in addition to Proteinase K (PK) protection. Reviewers ask the following specific questions:</p><p>2-i) Does the portion of TbpB that is protected from PK have correct conformation and membrane-topology? (Reviewers 1 and 3)</p></disp-quote><p>TbpB is not transmembrane protein, therefore we did not look into TbpB membrane topology after translocation. However, we have performed a functional pulldown assay for the translocated TbpB in the Slam-proteoliposomes using human transferrin conjugated beads to show that these TbpB molecules are correctly folded and functional. Blots and explanation are attached in the revised manuscript (see Figure 2 —figure supplement 2 and discussion in main text line 197-207).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2-ii) How can authors rule out the possibility that binding of TpbB to Slam1 does not protect TbpB from PK digestion? (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question we have performed Proteinase K digestion using purified Slam, TbpB in DDM detergent (Slam-DDM-TbpB). We have included a new supplementary (Figure 1—figure supplement 7 – upper panel and line 133-136). The Slam-DDM-TbpB protein mixture did not protect TbpB from the proteinase K digestion. Also, in our liposome translocation assay, TritonX was used as a control to dissolve liposomes and reveal the contents. In the PK<sup>+</sup>/T+ treatment, the portion of TbpB that was seen protected from PK treatment (no TritonX) disappeared indicating that the liposomes protected TbpB rather than Slam (as TritonX dissolves liposomes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2-iii) Showing the time-dependence of the translocation process and comparing it to the timescale of other reported translocation processes across the outer membrane (for example, membrane-insertion rates of BAM-mediated OMP translocation in vitro) will further support authors' conclusion that TbpB is translocated across the outer membrane. (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the time-dependent translocation assay as recommended by the reviewers and the included the result in updated as Figure 2d and 2e, line 211-224. The time course reveals a peak translocation time of 15-30min on a similar timescale to the Bam complex for membrane protein insertion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2-iv) Please consider using a model unfolded protein other than TpbB as a control in the translocation assay to verify the specificity of Slam for TpbB. (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a negative control translocation assay using the periplasmic binding protein AfuA – a glucose-6-phosphate binding protein that is localized to the periplasm. The blot is included in Figure 1 —figure supplement 7 – lower panel and line 136-140.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please, address the following questions that can be potentially raised by readers.</p><p>3i) Is the lipidation of TpbB required for translocation? (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>The lipidation of TbpB is not required for translocation as i) We have other Slam-secreted proteins (non-lipidated proteins) pairs that our lab is currently studying (See Bateman et al. Nature Communications 2021). ii) We have data to support that removing the N-terminal cystine residue (where the lipid is added on by Lgt) does not affect the translocation of TbpB by Slam and the non-lipidated TbpB can be now secreted into the extracellular side rather that getting anchored to the surface (this data will be presented in an upcoming paper by another member of the lab).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3ii) Figure S2: a permeabilization control should be included: what if Slam1 overexpression changes the permeability of the OM? (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>In the Figure S2, we also have included Slam2-TbpB pair as a control where the expression of a Slam homolog does not increase lead to TbpB exposure due to permeability (This figure is now Figure 1 —figure supplement 2). This was also addressed in Hooda et al. Nature Microbiology 2016 where the Slam2 homolog of Slam1 does not translocate TbpB. If the overexpression of Slam affects the permeability of the outer membrane, we should also expect a high portion of TbpB displayed by Slam2 too in this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please, move the data demonstrating the functionality of BamA using OmpA as a model substrate (Supplementary Figure 4) to the main figures. (Reviewer 2)</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the functionality of Bam has been established in previous papers and prefer to leave this control (Bam functional assay) in the Figure 1 —figure supplement 4 (updated according to e<italic>Life</italic> format) as we want to focus the main figures on Slam.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Lines 119-127: More explanations are needed regarding what are the effects of urea on liposomes, conformation of TbpB, Slam1 and Bam:</p><p>&gt;Is 0.66M urea enough to keep TbpB unfolded and Slam1 and Bam still functional?</p></disp-quote><p>The protocol used herein was adapted from a similar protocol used to examine urea-OmpA incorporation into Bam proteoliposomes (Hagan et al. 2010) and Bam has been shown to be functional at 0.66M urea. We have used a Nanotemper Tycho instrument to measure the unfolding event of protein (TbpB) in the presence of 8M, 4M, 1M and 0.66M urea illustrating that TbpB is unfolded in 8M Urea and begins to fold at 0.8 M urea (for reference information on the Tycho instrument see: https://resources.nanotempertech.com/tycho/nanotemper-tycho-brochure).</p><p>The melting temperatures (indicative of folding) illustrate that TbpB is at least partially folded at 0.66M Urea. We recognize that at this concentration of Urea the interactions between TbpB and Slam may not be optimal and may not approach the ~40% translocation efficiency from supernatant extracts (figure 2) but we can still increase translocation in the presence of skp showing that holdases due also influence the translocation efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&gt;Would there be any osmotic stress on liposomes, which may affect the translocation of TbpB?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t believe there would be any osmotic stress imposed in the in vitro translocation assay as the same buffer that was used to make the liposomes was also used during the in vitro translocation creating an isotonic solution. Thus, there would be no electrochemical gradient across the lipid bilayer, except for the TbpB concentration that would be higher on the outside of the liposomes.</p><p>For the spheroplast release assay, the media might have additional factors including the 2% of glucose and 0.125M sucrose in the extractions, but if they are the major contribute factors, we would have seen similar contribution in the other 4 experimental controls (empty, Bam, Slam1 and Slam1+Bam proteoliposomes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&gt;Is 3% translocation efficiency enough to say that the translocation has actually occurred?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, when we compare the 3% of the unfolded TbpB translocated by Slam to the negative control (empty and Bam proteoliposomes), our analysis suggested that this 3% is statistically significant.
