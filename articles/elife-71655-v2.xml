Somatosensation and nociception are finely mapped and aligned in the adult somatosensory (S1) cortex, but in infancy, when pain behaviour is disorganised and poorly directed, nociceptive maps may be less refined. We compared the topographic pattern of S1 activation following noxious (clinically required heel lance) and innocuous (touch) mechanical stimulation of the same skin region in newborn infants (<italic>n</italic> = 32) using multioptode functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Within S1 cortex, touch and lance of the heel elicit localised, partially overlapping increases in oxygenated haemoglobin concentration (Δ[HbO]), but while touch activation was restricted to the heel area, lance activation extended into cortical hand regions.

Poor spatial tuning of nociceptive reflexes and receptive fields is a feature of the developing somatosensory system, followed by the emergence of adult organisation through activity-dependent refinement of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beggs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schouenborg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch and Fitzgerald, 2013</xref>). We hypothesised that this developmental process is reflected in ascending nociceptive signals to S1, leading to widespread S1 activation and poor spatial localisation of noxious events in early life.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used multioptode fNIRS to map nociceptive and innocuous mechanoreceptive activity across the infant sensorimotor cortex. fNIRS is a non-invasive measure of cerebral haemodynamic changes which can be performed at the bedside, while in skin-to-skin holding and in a naturalistic hospital setting during clinically required procedures. Using the temporal and spatial profiles of haemodynamic responses to a noxious heel lance and an innocuous touch of the hand and the heel, we show that haemodynamic activity elicited by noxious and innocuous mechanical stimuli have partially overlapping topographies in the human infant S1 cortex but that the two maps are not aligned. Noxious stimulation of the heel in the newborn evokes more widespread S1 activation than innocuous stimulation, that extends into inferior regions, normally associated with representation of the hand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Innocuous hand and heel touch evoked activity is somatotopically organised in the newborn infant S1 cortex</title><p>We first established the cortical topography of touch activation in newborn infants by mapping the extent of activation in the contralateral somatosensory (S1) cortex following innocuous mechanical stimulation (touch) of the hand and heel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref> shows a significant and localised increase in average concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin (Δ[HbO]) in contralateral optode channels following touch of each body area (<italic>n</italic> = 11, hand touch; <italic>n</italic> = 16 heel touch).

The adult primate S1 has a defined somatotopic organisation of tactile and nociceptive cortical receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenshalo et al., 2000</xref>) including spatially precise cortical maps of Aδ and Aβ afferent fibre input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Human fMRI studies show that adult somatotopic maps of noxious and non-noxious mechanical stimulation substantially overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lui et al., 2008</xref>) and detailed analysis reveals a fine-grained somatotopy for nociceptive inputs in S1 cortex that are highly aligned with maps of innocuous tactile stimuli, suggesting comparable cortical representations for mechanoreceptive and nociceptive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mancini et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have shown that this comparable representation is not present in the newborn infant S1 cortex.</p><p>Noxious mechanical stimulation evokes a larger peak increase in concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin (Δ[HbO]) and decrease in concentration of deoxygenated haemoglobin (Δ[Hb]) compared to innocuous stimulation of the same body area at comparable location and latency as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartocci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slater et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verriotis et al., 2016b</xref>). The fact that the noxious activation is greater than the touch evoked activity is presumably due to hyperaemia associated with greater depolarisation and spike activity within the activated areas. However, it does not explain the differing topography of the overall area of activation reported here. Although a lance, being a more intense stimulus, could be thought to cause more widespread cortical activation throughout the cortex, here the response to the lance is only significantly larger than touch in 50% of lance-only area of activation, 26% of the lance and touch overlap area, and nowhere in the touch-only activation area. Our results instead suggest that the response to a noxious and innocuous mechanical stimulus is not spatially aligned. Within S1 itself, the infant has a distinct somatotopic map for touch, similar to that described in adults, with the area representing the foot lying in the superomedial postcentral gyrus, and the area for the hand located more inferiorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blake et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akselrod et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with previous reports in newborn infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dall’Orso et al., 2018</xref>). Noxious heel lance, on the other hand, evokes widespread activity within S1, peaking in a similar area of the superomedial postcentral gyrus as touch activity, but extending to the hand representation area. All stimuli elicited a significant response in the control channel which may suggest that the responses extended more posteriorly to S1, nevertheless, our data shows that the S1 somatotopic nociceptive map is not as precise as the touch map in the newborn.</p><p>It should be noted that fNIRS is an indirect measure of neuronal activation and may be confounded by systemic vascular changes such as increases in blood pressure, which may be more likely following a noxious vs. innocuous stimulus. However, we removed global changes common across channels using principal component analysis (PCA), and our results point to misaligned noxious and innocuous activity, with widespread noxious activity across the S1 specifically, but not the whole cortex as one would expect following systemic changes. Several channels/nodes did not show a significant response following the heel lance compared to baseline, and the heel lance did not have a greater response compared to heel touch at every node. Together, these findings suggest that the greater magnitude of the heel lance response is not due to systemic changes elicited by the noxious stimulus. However, as fNIRS (as with fMRI) is a measure of the vascular response following neuronal activity, the precise degree of localisation of either neuronal response is limited.</p><p>Measuring the cortical haemodynamic response to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation in neonates fNIRS is ideally suited to a study of this kind as recording and sensory stimulation, including clinically required heel lance, can be performed at the infant cotside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartocci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slater et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kashou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verriotis et al., 2016b</xref>). Other methods of measuring this either do not provide sufficient spatial information and source localisation, such as EEG recording of nociceptive-related ERPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fabrizi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2018</xref>) or are limited by the use of experimental ‘pinprick’ stimulators, that for ethical reasons are not actually painful, such as in fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goksan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The change in the Δ[HbO] and Δ[Hb] following sensory stimulation is an indirect measure of neural activity: simultaneous vertex EEG and fNIRS recordings over S1 show that haemodynamic and neural responses are related in magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verriotis et al., 2016b</xref>). Following all stimuli, and consistent with the mature canonical response, channels showing a significant increase in Δ[HbO] also had a smaller decrease in Δ[Hb]. Regional overperfusion following neuronal activation, beyond that required by metabolic demands, means that less Hb is removed from the region compared to the oversupply of HbO. However, the decrease in Δ[Hb] was more widespread (but smaller in magnitude) compared to the localised increase in Δ[HbO]. This type of response, not previously reported in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Roever et al., 2018</xref>), suggests that more blood is leaving the region (removing Hb) compared to the incoming supply (no significant change in Δ[HbO] in peripheral channels) due to immature regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). There are multiple mechanisms by which blood vessels dilate and CBF increases following neural activation, including arterial CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which relax/contract the smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries and arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kety and Schmidt, 1948</xref>), and astrocyte and pericyte activity which controls vessel diameter and the propagation of vasodilation along the vascular tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2018</xref>), many of which are still developing in the newborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pryds and Greisen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binmöller and Müller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujimoto, 1995</xref>) leading to rapid changes in CBF over the first postnatal days as cerebral circulation adapts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meek et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The infants in this study were held skin to skin, swaddled in their mother’s arms in a naturalistic setting, which is a major advantage of fNIRS recording over fMRI for human developmental studies of brain function. Video recording and investigator scoring confirmed that while some infant movement and maternal touching did take place and that some babies did move following the lance, these movements spanned different body parts and latencies such that any associated cortical response would be cancelled during the averaging process. Indeed, comparison of the time-series following heel touch with and without removing trials with known movement showed no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, 33–50% of babies did grimace for up to 7 s following the lance, but if these facial movements mediated the response following the lance, this would have prolonged the peak or duration of the change in [HbO], while in fact the latency and time course of the response to both stimuli was the same (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Differential development of somatosensory and nociceptive topographic maps</title><p>A whole-body topographical map of innocuous mechanical stimulation develops in the sensorimotor cortices over the early postnatal period in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seelke et al., 2012</xref>), which represents the human final gestational trimester. In humans, distinct representations of the hands and feet can be observed from 31 weeks’ gestation, using fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dall’Orso et al., 2018</xref>), and from 28 weeks using neural activity recorded from the scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donadio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Whitehead et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitehead et al., 2019</xref>). The response to innocuous mechanical stimulation was more localised in S1 than the wider and less refined topographical map of noxious mechanical stimulation, suggesting a slower maturation of the S1 circuitry involved in nociceptive processing compared to touch processing in the infant brain.</p><p>In rodents, at every level of the developing somatosensory central nervous system, tactile processing matures before nociceptive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fitzgerald, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch and Fitzgerald, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verriotis et al., 2016a</xref>) consistent with a delayed refinement of a cortical nociceptive map. Widespread nociceptive cortical maps are consistent with infant pain behaviour, characterised by exaggerated and disorganised nociceptive reflexes in both rodent pups and human neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fitzgerald, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fitzgerald, 2015</xref>), and which can fail to remove a body part from the source of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Waldenström et al., 2003</xref>). Nociceptive reflexes following noxious heel lance are larger in magnitude and significantly more prolonged in human infants compared to adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornelissen et al., 2013</xref>) and have widespread cutaneous receptive fields that encompass the whole lower limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews and Fitzgerald, 1994</xref>). This lack of organisation could be reflected in the ascending spinothalamic and thalamocortical projections, delaying the maturation of S1 cortical nociceptive maps in the newborn. Topographic maps are established and aligned via multiple mechanisms, including molecular cues, spontaneous or sensory-dependent remodelling, and refinement. Initially, somatosensory maps are diffuse and overlapping, but in the rodent somatosensory cortex, excitatory thalamocortical afferents undergo activity-dependent refinement to sharpen these maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwasato et al., 1997</xref>). Equally important is the maturation of inhibitory interneuron sensory maps which, in contrast, expand over development in an experience-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quast et al., 2017</xref>). Slow developmental broadening of an inhibitory nociceptive network may explain the widespread nociceptive map in S1 and also the greater amplitude of EEG noxious responses in infants compared to adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fabrizi et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pain and the developing S1 cortex</title><p>This study highlights the importance of understanding the development of touch and pain processing in the human infant brain.

We first assessed if hand and foot touch and foot lance evoked a significant response in Δ[HbO] and Δ[Hb], by comparing their peak change to baseline. To do that, we averaged the image time-series and found the latency at which the maximum change occurred anywhere across the cortex. For each node, significant changes at that latency in Δ[HbO] and Δ[Hb] were assessed with a two-tailed t-test (<italic>α</italic> = 0.01) comparing the 5 s window around the identified peak latency against the 5 s baseline. As in channel-wise analysis peak signal and baseline distributions were estimated by concatenating the individual baselines (−5 to 0 s pre-stimulus) and peak windows (−2.5 to 2.5 s around peak latency). Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons (784,391 nodes = 784,391 comparisons). To display these results, we: (1) reconstructed an image using the average channel-wise data within the 5 s window around the peak latency (averaged in time) for hand touch, heel touch, and lance and (2) masked this image according to the result of the statistical test above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>Comparison of peak changes in Δ[HbO] and Δ[Hb] between heel lance and touch</title><p>Next, we compared the significant changes in Δ[HbO] and Δ[Hb] between the heel lance and touch conditions in two ways: (1) comparing the magnitude of the response at peak latency at every node using a Student’s t-test, (2) comparing the characteristics of the peak response (overall area of activation and latency, location, and spread of the peak change in Δ[HbO] and Δ[Hb]) using a non-parametric test.</p><p>Overall area of activation was defined by starting at the node with the peak change and continually expanding to include neighbouring nodes that (1) were connected by three face edges and (2) had a significant change from baseline. Difference in peak location was the Euclidean distance between the peaks. Spread of the peak was defined as the part of the overall area of activation around the peak where changes in Δ[HbO] (or Δ[Hb]) were at least half of the peak change (full-width half-maximum, FWHM).</p><p>The non-parametric null distribution was derived by calculating these differences between randomly selected sets of surrogate image time-series (bootstrapping on surrogate data). We here describe how we obtained surrogate image time-series and then how we conducted bootstrapping.</p><p>Each individual recording (i.e image time-series) can be considered as the linear sum of a signal of interest (i.e. the response to the stimulus) and a stationary random noise component. The assumption is that the signal is the same in each recording while the noise changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Drongelen, 2007</xref>). Therefore, if we were to conduct another recording on another subject, the new data would be the linear sum of the <italic>same</italic> signal that we find in the original data but <italic>different</italic> random noise. Creating surrogate data consists in generating new random noise to add to the signal estimated from our data. To do this we: (1) estimate the signal by averaging across individual recordings (i.e. subjects) in response to the same stimulus modality; (2) isolate the noise in our data by subtracting this estimate from each recording; (3) <italic>phase-randomise</italic> each noise time-series. Phase-randomisation is applied independently to each node time-series in the frequency domain. This means that the phase component of the complex-valued signal is rotated at each frequency by an independent random variable chosen from the uniformly distributed range of 0 and 2π (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Theiler et al., 1992</xref>). At the end of this process, we have a new set of surrogate noise time-series.</p><p>To generate the full non-parametric null distribution against which to compare our data, we used bootstrapping. To estimate each sample of the null distribution, we calculated the differences in overall area of activation and peak amplitude, latency, position, and FWHM between two random sets of surrogate data without any systematic difference. To create the random sets, we: (1) pooled together all the newly obtained surrogate noise time-series; (2) added the grand average (across lance and touch) signal (as we do not want systematic differences between sets to estimate a null distribution); (3) randomly split (with repetition) these surrogate data into two sets. We repeated this 1000 times in order to obtain the full non-parametric null distribution (bootstrapping). An experimental difference outside the 95% confidence interval was considered significant (p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Clinical supervision, Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Ethical approval for this study was given by the NHS Health Research Authority (London - Surrey Borders) and the study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Chris Baker as Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please fully address the concerns and suggestions of the reviewers as laid out in their reviews below. Specifically:</p><p>1) Address the statistical concerns raised by both reviewers with new analyses. In particular, this will require including direct statistical testing of the two maps (R1) as well as addressing concerns around circularity (R1) and the different numbers of trials for each condition (R2).</p><p>2) Reconsider use of the term &quot;widespread&quot; to describe responses to the painful stimuli (R1 and R2). Terms such as &quot;mislocalized&quot; or &quot;disorganized&quot; may be more appropriate.</p><p>3) Treat motion equivalently for the two conditions in the analyses (R2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Differences in regions of activations constituting touch maps and nociceptive maps are never actually statistically tested:</p><p>See the public review for an outline of the issue. The suggested solution is to directly compare the noxious and touch evoked activations and demonstrate statistically significant differences between them.</p><p>2. Nociceptive maps are equally as widespread as touch maps:</p><p>See the public review for an outline of the issue. The distinction between &quot;mislocalisation&quot; versus &quot;widespread&quot; needs to be clarified, as the claim that nociceptive maps are widespread is ubiquitous and currently not sufficiently contextualised relative to the touch maps. Or at least the apparent tension between this core claim and the lack of difference in area of activation for the noxious and non-noxious stimulus needs explicit discussion. Of course, the &quot;mislocalisation&quot; claim would have to be backed up by a demonstration of statistically significant differences between the maps, which is currently not provided (see comment 1 above).</p><p>3. The analyses that produce areas of activation in source space (image space) are circular:</p><p>See the public review for an outline of the issue. The core message of this manuscript is that infants' nociceptive maps are more poorly localised than touch maps. This could be demonstrated in sensor space without any need to do source reconstruction. As outlined in comment 1 above, a direct statistical comparison of noxious evoked and touch evoked activity in sensor space would demonstrate the core message the authors wish to convey, and does not need source reconstruction meaning the circular analysis can be omitted altogether. And as mentioned above, all statistically significant results found in source space are not novel, so very little would be lost in keeping the analysis and results in sensor space and simple establishing statistically significant differences between the nociceptive and touch maps.</p><p>4. Limitations of the fNRIS technique and of the link between properties of nociceptive maps (widespread/mislocalisation) and poorly directed behaviour are not adequately discussed:</p><p>See the public review for an outline of the issue. This major limitation of the fNIRS technique requires much more serious and explicit discussion.</p><p>5. Linking comments 1, 2, and 4 to the initial hypothesis:</p><p>The hypothesis stated in the introduction is as follows: &quot;We hypothesised that this developmental process is reflected in ascending nociceptive signals to SI, leading to widespread cortical activation and poor spatial localisation of noxious events in early life&quot;. The assessment of the poor localisation and widespread activation of noxious evoked activity is assessed and explicitly interpreted relative to touch evoked activity: &quot;Noxious stimulation of the heel in the newborn evokes a more widespread cortical activation than innocuous stimulation, that extends into inferior regions of S1, normally associated with representation of the hand.&quot;.</p><p>However, using statistical tests to directly compare the noxious evoked activity to the touch evoked activity, there was neither a statistically significant difference between the noxious and touch peak localisations (i.e. peak locations do not differ) nor their extent of cortical activations (i.e. areas of activations do not differ). This subset of results seem to directly go against the initial hypothesis and interpreted conclusions.</p><p>A much clearer link between the tests run, results provided, and hypothesis put forward needs to be outlined, as it is currently very unclear why some results (e.g. activations assessed relative to baseline) should be considered supportive of the initial hypothesis but not indicative of fNIRS-related haemodynamic confounds (e.g. non-neural cardiovascular response signals such as tissue-damage evoked blood pressure changes), while other results (e.g. direct statistical comparisons between noxious and touch evoked activations) that seem to contradict the initial hypothesis are not considered as such by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In order to address the issue of repetition suppression in the touch condition, it would be of interest to see either an analysis of change in the touch responses across trials, or a comparison between touch and nociceptive trials based on only the first touch trial.</p><p>There is some small irregularity in the reporting of motion in the pain condition. The N for this condition in Table 1 is 11, but when reporting motion the authors state that 2 participants didn't move, 6 made small movements, and 4 made large movements.</p><p>Perhaps I am misreading the analysis procedure, but if the authors really are averaging responses to the touch/pain conditions and using a single, mean value for each time point in statistical tests (compared in a one-sample t-test to the baseline distribution?), then I do believe these analyses should be adjusted to retain variability across participants in response to the stimuli of interest.</p><p>I was also surprised by the information on Bonferroni corrections. The authors were really multiplying their p values by thousands (channel-wise analyses) or hundreds of thousands (image-based analyses) of comparisons and arriving at corrected p values less than p = .001, in tests with 11 infants and a single trial per infant? I would not expect this sort of effect size in infant fNIRS research. Am I misunderstanding how a Bonferroni correction would be applied here?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Widespread nociceptive maps in the human neonatal somatosensory cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Chris Baker (Senior Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but the reviewers raised some remaining concerns and made some good suggestions. There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>– Please show the S1 ROI as suggested by R1</p><p>– In the revision, you show that there is no discernible impact of motion on the heel touch trials in response to a concern raised by R2. However, this does not necessarily solve the issue raised. The suggestion to treat both trial types equally (as raised in the first round of review) should be followed.</p><p>– Both reviewers and myself had a hard time following exactly how the image space analyses are conducted and whether the concern about circularity has been addressed or not. It sounds as if different nodes or timepoints are being selected on the basis of the responses observed, which still has the potential to introduce a selection bias (i.e. circularity). Please clarify and expand the text in describing the analyses.</p><p>– As noted by R2, the text at the top of page 5 is confusing. More generally, the descriptions in the text tend to be quite dense and complicated. Please revise the section noted and consider simplifying the text throughout to make the descriptions of the analyses and the corresponding conclusions easier to follow.</p><p>– As suggested by R2, please consider providing the preprocessed data in addition to the raw files.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript has improved since initial submission, and the authors have appropriately addressed the points in my previous review. I have one final suggestion that I think would greatly help the reader and improve the manuscript further.</p><p>It would be very helpful to see an outline of the S1 area, as defined and used in this study. The brain surface onto which the activity has been projected during image reconstruction is very smooth (see Figures2-4); it is not easy to make out with any confidence where any of the key landmarks are e.g. central sulcus, precentral sulcus, postcentral sulcus. In all of your source space maps, only two brain orientations are used: view from above and view from behind. I would suggest adding an additional supplementary figure of these two brain orientations with the S1 area clearly delineated. Or alternatively, putting in a fourth panel into Figure 4 to delineate the area, as Figure 4 already contains quite a bit of localisation/orientation information (regarding optode setup), so seems a sensible place for defining the ROI of interest i.e. area S1.</p><p>Having this area clearly defined and detailing how it was defined (e.g. anatomically or functionally defined; manually or automatically outlined; use of an established functional or structural atlas, etc) will really help readers interpret the activity maps more accurately.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, the authors made clear and reasonable edits to their manuscript that addressed many of the concerns with the original paper. I do, however, think there are a few points that still need attention:</p><p>– One of my original concerns was that motion-contaminated trials were dropped in the heel touch condition but not the heel lance condition. In their revision, the authors compare heel touch data with and without motion-contaminated trials and find no significant differences, but I'm not sure this is the right way to deal with this concern; instead I still think motion should be treated the same across the two conditions. Large artifacts introduced by motion could fail to create systematic differences in heel touch data with and without motion, but still account for apparent differences between lance and touch data. If motion artifacts aren't a significant concern to include in the lance condition because they average one another out, that approach ought to be fine for the heel touch condition as well. If artifacts make the heel touch data too noisy, despite the greater number of trials, then their presence in the single-trial lance data ought to be treated as a serious source of contamination in the lance data and excluded from both.</p><p>– The authors dealt with Reviewer 1's concern about circularity in the image space analysis by using the image space peak, rather than the source space peak, to select the time period for statistical testing. If anything, I think this makes the circularity problem worse. Selecting a subset of the data based on one feature (proximity to peak concentration values), and then using those data in a subsequent statistical test to characterize the functional properties of the cortical location in question is the issue; the data used to select need to be independent of the data used to test. This seems like a tricky problem to solve here, but maybe a leave-one-subject-out procedure, in which the authors iterate through leaving out one subject when selecting the peak, extract response data from that subject, and then move onto the next iteration in order to obtain their test data would help? (Though I agree with Reviewer 1's original point that there's nothing wrong with just analyzing the data in source space, and omitting the image space analysis entirely).</p><p>– I was confused by the new text at the top of page 5, which (as far as I can tell) states that at every location where there was a significant effect of lance &gt; baseline, there was also a significant lance &gt; heel touch effect; and conversely that at every location where touch &gt; baseline, there was also a touch &gt; lance effect. Given that there was overlap in the effects of lance &gt; baseline and touch &gt; baseline, how could this possibly be true? Maybe this is not what the authors were trying to say, and they only meant that there are some regions in which there is a significant lance&gt; touch effect and others in which there is a significant touch&gt;lance effect (as shown in Figure 3c). If that's the case, I would suggest rewording this new text, as it was difficult to parse.</p><p>– I went to check the data files, and it seems that the authors only provide the raw.nirs files and demographic characteristics in the repository. Reconstructing their preprocessing stream would be extremely time consuming; I suggest they should also provide the data in the form used for statistical tests.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71655.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please fully address the concerns and suggestions of the reviewers as laid out in their reviews below.

Although the foot touch and lance HbO responses have the same size area of activation, the response to foot touch is localised within the S1, but extends beyond this into the motor cortex. However, the response to lance does not extend into the same area of the motor cortex, and instead extends into the entire S1. Thus, although the two maps are misaligned, the more important point here is that nociceptive maps are widespread in terms of S1 activation. We have made small clarifications throughout the manuscript to ensure there is no confusion regarding our use of the word widespread.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Treat motion equivalently for the two conditions in the analyses (R2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional analyses comparing the heel touch data with and without removing the trials with known movement.

The suggested solution is to directly compare the noxious and touch evoked activations and demonstrate statistically significant differences between them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this analysis in the manuscript: ‘In regions significantly active following the lance stimulus, direct comparison at each node shows that the response following the heel lance was indeed larger than the response following the heel touch, conversely, the response following the heel lance was significantly smaller in the region only active following the heel touch’. We have also added an image of these results to figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Nociceptive maps are equally as widespread as touch maps:</p><p>See the public review for an outline of the issue. The distinction between &quot;mislocalisation&quot; versus &quot;widespread&quot; needs to be clarified, as the claim that nociceptive maps are widespread is ubiquitous and currently not sufficiently contextualised relative to the touch maps. Or at least the apparent tension between this core claim and the lack of difference in area of activation for the noxious and non-noxious stimulus needs explicit discussion. Of course, the &quot;mislocalisation&quot; claim would have to be backed up by a demonstration of statistically significant differences between the maps, which is currently not provided (see comment 1 above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have been careful throughout the manuscript to only refer to a ‘widespread’ or ‘localised’ response specifically within the S1 cortex. Although the heel touch and lance HbO responses have the same size area of activation, the response to heel touch is localised within the S1 (but extends beyond this into the motor cortex), and the heel lance response is widespread within the S1. The spread within the S1 is the important point here, rather than the size of the overall responses. We have also added the requested analysis to help further this point (see above) and have made small edits to clarify throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The analyses that produce areas of activation in source space (image space) are circular:</p><p>See the public review for an outline of the issue. The core message of this manuscript is that infants' nociceptive maps are more poorly localised than touch maps. This could be demonstrated in sensor space without any need to do source reconstruction. As outlined in comment 1 above, a direct statistical comparison of noxious evoked and touch evoked activity in sensor space would demonstrate the core message the authors wish to convey, and does not need source reconstruction meaning the circular analysis can be omitted altogether. And as mentioned above, all statistically significant results found in source space are not novel, so very little would be lost in keeping the analysis and results in sensor space and simple establishing statistically significant differences between the nociceptive and touch maps.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the latency restriction from the source-space analysis (i.e. we find the peak response in source-space rather than use the peak latency identified from the channel-space) and updated the results appropriately; the results have not changed as a consequence of this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Limitations of the fNRIS technique and of the link between properties of nociceptive maps (widespread/mislocalisation) and poorly directed behaviour are not adequately discussed:</p><p>See the public review for an outline of the issue. This major limitation of the fNIRS technique requires much more serious and explicit discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that systemic responses due to an increase in blood pressure may still be an issue following a lance stimulus. However, we believe that this is not a contributing factor in our results. If there was any remaining systemic response across the scalp following the heel lance, then we would expect all nodes to have a larger response following the lance compared to heel touch, or at least all channels/nodes to show a significant increase from baseline. However, despite the majority of the S1 (Figures 2c and 3a) being significantly active following the heel lance, there are still 9/17 channels that do not have a significant increase in HbO from baseline, and a region of the cortex which is more active following heel touch stimulation.</p><p>Moreover, although the control channel had a significant increase from baseline following the heel lance, this is not evidence that the heel lance elicited widespread systemic changes, as the heel touch also elicited a response in the control channel.</p><p>The overall areas of activation are the same for both stimuli, but they are not aligned. Although we use the term ‘widespread’, we are careful to only say as such within the S1, and not widespread across the whole cortex. Only a widespread response across the whole cortex could be viewed as being confounded by systemic changes. We have now added the discussion of systemic changes to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Linking comments 1, 2, and 4 to the initial hypothesis:</p><p>The hypothesis stated in the introduction is as follows: &quot;We hypothesised that this developmental process is reflected in ascending nociceptive signals to SI, leading to widespread cortical activation and poor spatial localisation of noxious events in early life&quot;. The assessment of the poor localisation and widespread activation of noxious evoked activity is assessed and explicitly interpreted relative to touch evoked activity: &quot;Noxious stimulation of the heel in the newborn evokes a more widespread cortical activation than innocuous stimulation, that extends into inferior regions of S1, normally associated with representation of the hand.&quot;.</p><p>However, using statistical tests to directly compare the noxious evoked activity to the touch evoked activity, there was neither a statistically significant difference between the noxious and touch peak localisations (i.e. peak locations do not differ) nor their extent of cortical activations (i.e. areas of activations do not differ). This subset of results seem to directly go against the initial hypothesis and interpreted conclusions.</p><p>A much clearer link between the tests run, results provided, and hypothesis put forward needs to be outlined, as it is currently very unclear why some results (e.g. activations assessed relative to baseline) should be considered supportive of the initial hypothesis but not indicative of fNIRS-related haemodynamic confounds (e.g. non-neural cardiovascular response signals such as tissue-damage evoked blood pressure changes), while other results (e.g. direct statistical comparisons between noxious and touch evoked activations) that seem to contradict the initial hypothesis are not considered as such by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see previous responses.</p><p>We have now added the discussion of systemic changes to the manuscript and altered the hypothesis to state that we expected widespread activation within the S1 specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In order to address the issue of repetition suppression in the touch condition, it would be of interest to see either an analysis of change in the touch responses across trials, or a comparison between touch and nociceptive trials based on only the first touch trial.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this, we have carried out a statistical comparison of the first and last 50% of foot touch trials at each sample post-lance across all channels.
