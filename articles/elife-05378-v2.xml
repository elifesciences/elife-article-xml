origins and evolution, is unclear. Through RNA sequencing of 70 arthropod species we discovered 112 novel viruses that appear to be ancestral to much of the documented genetic diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses, a number of which are also present as endogenous genomic copies. With this greatly enriched diversity we revealed that arthropods contain viruses that fall basal to major virus groups, including the vertebrate-specific arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, influenza viruses, lyssaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. We similarly documented a remarkable diversity of genome structures in arthropod viruses, including a putative circular form, that sheds new light on the evolution of genome organization. Hence, arthropods are a major reservoir of viral genetic diversity and have likely been central to viral evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05378.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05378.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many illnesses, including influenza, hemorrhagic fever, and rabies, are caused by a group of viruses called negative-sense RNA viruses. The genetic information—or genome—of these viruses is encoded in strands of RNA that must be copied before they can be translated into the proteins needed to build new viruses. It is currently known that there are at least eight different families of these viruses, which have a wide range of shapes and sizes and arrange their RNA in different ways.</p><p>Insects, spiders, and other arthropods carry many different RNA viruses. Many of these viruses have not previously been studied, and those that have been studied so far are mainly those that cause diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Researchers therefore only know a limited amount about the diversity of the negative-sense RNA viruses that arthropods harbor and how these viruses evolved. Studying how viruses evolve helps scientists to understand what makes some viruses deadly and others harmless and can also help develop treatments or vaccines for the diseases caused by the viruses.</p><p>Li, Shi, Tian, Lin, Kang et al. collected 70 species of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other arthropods in China and sequenced all the negative-sense RNA viruses in the creatures. This revealed an enormous number of negative-sense RNA viruses, including 112 new viruses. Many of the newly discovered arthropod viruses appear to be the ancestors of disease-causing viruses, including influenza viruses and the filoviruses—the group that includes the Ebola virus. Indeed, it appears that arthropods host many—if not all—of the negative-sense RNA viruses that cause disease in vertebrates and plants.</p><p>While documenting the new RNA viruses and how they are related to each other, Li et al. found many different genome structures. Some genomes were segmented, which may play an important role in evolution as segments can be easily swapped to create new genetic combinations. Non-segmented and circular genomes were also found. This genetic diversity suggests that arthropods are likely to have played a key role in the evolution of new viruses by acting as a site where many different viruses can interact and exchange genetic information.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05378.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05378.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA virus</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>arthropods</kwd><kwd>segmentation</kwd><kwd>negative-sense</kwd><kwd>phylogeny</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81290343, 81273014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ci-Xiu</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Mang</given-names></name><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Jun-Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xian-Dan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Yan-Jun</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Liang-Jun</given-names></name><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Xin-Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jianguo</given-names></name><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>Edward C</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong-Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014ZX10004001-005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong-Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AF30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>Edward C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extensive genetic diversity and novel genome structures in RNA viruses from arthropods shed important new light on the ancestry and evolutionary history of major classes of vertebrate and plant viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Negative-sense RNA viruses are important pathogens that cause a variety of diseases in humans including influenza, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and rabies. Taxonomically, those negative-sense RNA viruses described to date comprise at least eight virus families and four unassigned genera or species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">King et al., 2012</xref>). Although they share (i) a homologous RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), (ii) inverted complementary genome ends, and (iii) an encapsidated negative-sense RNA genome, these viruses display substantial diversity in terms of virion morphology and genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">King et al., 2012</xref>). One key aspect of genome organization is the number of distinct segments, which is also central to virus classification. Among negative-sense RNA viruses, the number of segments varies from one (order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>; unsegmented) to two (family <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>), three (<italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), three-to-four (<italic>Ophioviridae</italic>), and six-to-eight (<italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>) and is further complicated by differences in the number, structure, and arrangement of the encoded genes.</p><p>Despite their diversity and importance in infectious disease, the origins and evolutionary history of the negative-sense RNA viruses are largely obscure. Arthropods harbor a diverse range of RNA viruses, which are often divergent from those that infect vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Marklewitz et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cook et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Qin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tokarz et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014b</xref>). However, those arthropod viruses sampled to date are generally those that have a relationship with vertebrates or are known to be agents of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Junglen and Drosten, 2013</xref>). To determine the extent of viral diversity harbored by arthropods, as well as their evolutionary history, we performed a systematic survey of negative-sense RNA viruses using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on a wide range of arthropods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Discovery of highly divergent negative-sense RNA viruses</title><p>We focused our study of virus biodiversity and evolution on 70 potential host species from four arthropod classes: Insecta, Arachnida, Chilopoda, and Malacostraca (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). From these samples, 16 separate cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced, resulting in a total of 147.4 Gb of 100-base pair-end reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Blastx comparisons against protein sequences of negative-sense RNA virus revealed 108 distinct types of complete or nearly complete large (L) proteins (or polymerase protein 1 (PB1) in the case of orthomyxoviruses) that encode the relatively conserved RdRp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3 tbl4">Tables 2–4</xref>). Four additional types of previously undescribed RdRp sequence (&gt;1000 amino acids) were identified from the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database. Together, these proteins exhibited an enormous diversity in terms of sequence variation and structure. Most notably, this data set of RdRp sequences is distinct from both previously described sequences and from each other, with the most divergent showing as little as 15.8% amino acid sequence identity to its closest relatives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3 tbl4">Tables 2–4</xref>). Overall, these data provide evidence for at least 16 potentially new families and genera of negative-sense RNA viruses, defined as whose RdRp sequences shared less than 25% amino acid identity with existing taxa.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Host and geographic information and data output

These data greatly expand the documented diversity of four viral families/orders—the <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>, <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, and <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>—as well as of three floating genera—<italic>Tenuivirus</italic>, <italic>Emaravirus</italic>, and <italic>Varicosavirus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">King et al., 2012</xref>). Most of the newly described arthropod viruses fell basal to the known genetic diversity in these taxa: their diversity either engulfed that of previously described viruses, as in the case of phlebovirus, nairovirus, and dimarhabdovirus, or appeared as novel lineages sandwiched between existing genera or families, and hence filling in a number of phylogenetic ‘gaps’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). One important example was a large monophyletic group of newly discovered viruses that fell between the major groups of segmented and unsegmented viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); we name this putative new virus family the ‘Chuviridae’ reflecting the geographic location in China where most of this family were identified (‘Chu’ is a historical term referring to large area of China encompassing the middle and lower reaches of the Yangzi River). Also of note was that some of the previously defined families no longer appear as monophyletic. For example, although classified as distinct families, the family <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> fell within the genetic diversity of the family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and as a sister group to viruses of the genus <italic>Nairovirus</italic>. Furthermore, the floating genus <italic>Tenuivirus</italic> was nested within the Phlebovirus-like clade, and another floating genus, <italic>Emaravirus</italic>, formed a monophyletic group with the <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> and <italic>Tospovirus</italic> genera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Indeed, it is striking that all vertebrate-specific segmented and unsegmented viruses (arenavirus, bornavirus, filovirus, hantavirus, influenza viruses, lyssavirus, and paramyxovirus) fall within the genetic diversity of arthropod-associated viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figures 3, 5</xref>). Also nested with arthropod-associated diversity were plant viruses (emaravirus, tospovirus, tenuiviruses, nucleorhabdovirus, cytorhabdovirus, and varicosavirus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figures 3, 5</xref>). Surprisingly, our phylogeny similarly placed two non-arthropod invertebrate viruses, found in nematodes (<italic>Heterodera glycines</italic>) and flatworms (<italic>Procotyla fluviatilis</italic>), within arthropod-associated diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the role of non-arthropod invertebrates should be explored further. Finally, it was striking that although individual arthropod species can harbor a rich diversity of RNA viruses, many viruses seemed to be associated with different arthropod species that share the same ecological niche (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3 tbl4">Tables 2–4</xref>). Interestingly, host species in the same niche had similar viral contents that were generally incongruent with the host phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Such a pattern is indicative of frequent cross-species and occasional cross-genus virus transmission in the context of ecological and geographic proximity.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The unrooted ML phylogeny of negative-sense RNA viruses (RdRp) with the common names of the principle arthropod hosts analyzed in this study indicated.</title><p>Vertebrate-specific viruses are shaded red, those infecting both vertebrates and arthropods (or with unknown vectors) are shaded yellow, those infecting both plants and arthropods are shaded green, those infecting non-arthropod invertebrates are shaded blue, and the remainder (arthropod only) are shaded black.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05378.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05378.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05378-fig5-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic congruence between viruses (M segments) and hosts.</title><p>The comparisons include (<bold>A</bold>) Wuhan Horsefly Virus, (<bold>B</bold>) Wuhan Fly Virus 1, (<bold>C</bold>) Wuhan Mosquito Virus 2, and (<bold>D</bold>) Wuhan Mosquito Virus 1.

This can easily be documented with respect to the evolution of genome segmentation. The number of genome segments in negative-sense RNA viruses varies from one to eight. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed no particular trend for this number to increase or decrease through evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Hence, genome segmentation (i.e., genomes with &gt;1 segment) has clearly evolved on multiple occasions within the negative-sense RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), such that it is a relatively flexible genetic trait. Although most segmented viruses were distantly related to those with a single segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), close phylogenetic ties were seen in other cases supporting the relatively recent evolution of multiple segments, with the plant-infecting varicosavirus (two segments) and orchid fleck virus (bipartite) serving as informative examples.</p><p>In this context, it is notable that the newly discovered chuviruses fell ‘between’ the phylogenetic diversity of segmented and the unsegmented viruses. Although monophyletic, the chuviruses display a wide variety of genome organizations including unsegmented, bi-segmented, and a circular form, each of which appeared multiple times in the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4, 7</xref>). The circular genomic form, which was confirmed by ‘around-the-genome’ RT-PCR and by the mapping of sequencing reads to the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), is a unique feature of the Chuviridae and can be distinguished from a pseudo-circular structure seen in some other negative-sense RNA viruses including the family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and the family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. Furthermore, this circular genomic form was also present in both segments of the segmented chuviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, the chuviruses displayed a diverse number and arrangement of predicted open reading frames that were markedly different from the genomic arrangement seen in the order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> even though these viruses are relatively closely related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4, 7</xref>). In particular, the chuviruses had unique and variable orders of genes: the linear chuvirus genomes began with the glycoprotein (G) gene, followed by the nucleoprotein (N) gene, and then the polymerase (L) gene, whereas the majority of circular chuviruses were most likely arranged in the order L-(G)-N (i.e., if displayed in a linear form) as the only low coverage point throughout the genome lay between the 5′ end of N gene and the 3′ end of L gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, the genome organizations of the chuviruses were far more concise than those of the order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, with ORFs encoding only 2–3 major (&gt;20 kDa) proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and hence showing more similarity to segmented viruses in this respect.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The differing genome organizations in the Chuviridae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ML trees of three main putative proteins conserved among the chuviruses.

Accordingly, we were able to find the segments encoding matching structural proteins (mainly glycoproteins and nucleoproteins) for many of the viral RdRp sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), although extensive sequence divergence prevented this in some cases. Surprisingly, M segments were apparently absent in a group of tick phleboviruses whose RdRps and nucleoproteins showed relatively high sequence similarity to Uukuniemi virus (genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Genomes with missing glycoprotein genes were also found in the chuviruses (Changping Tick Viruses 3 and 5, Wuhan Louse Viruses 6 and 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and the unsegmented dimarhabdovirus (Taishun Tick Virus, Wuhan Tick Virus 1, Tacheng Tick Virus 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Although it is possible that the glycoprotein gene may have been replaced with a highly divergent or even non-homologous sequence, we failed to find any candidate G proteins within the no-Blastx-hit set of sequences under the following criteria: (i) structural resemblance to G proteins, (ii) similar level of abundance to the corresponding RdRp and nucleoprotein genes, and (iii) comparable phylogenies or levels of divergence (among related viruses) to those of RdRps and nucleoproteins. The cause and biological significance of these seemingly ‘incomplete’ virus genomes require further study. Finally, it was also of interest that a virus with four segments was discovered in the horsefly pool. Although the predicted proteins of all four segments showed sequence homology to their counterparts in Tenuivirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Falk and Tsai, 1998</xref>), this virus lacked the ambisense coding strategy of tenuiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). While the capability of this virus to infect plants is unknown, it is possible that it represents a transitional form between plant-infecting and arthropod-specific viruses.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Genome structures of segmented negative-sense RNA viruses.</title><p>Predicted viral proteins homologous to known viral proteins are shown and colored according to their putative functions.

As expected given their endogenous status, most of these sequences have disrupted reading frames and many are found within transposon elements, suggesting that transposons have been central to their integration. Interestingly, in some cases, such as the putative glycoprotein gene of chuviruses, the homologous EVEs from within a family (Culicidae) or even an order (Hymenoptera) form monophyletic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). However, they are unlikely to be orthologous because they do not share homologous integration sites in the host genome as determined by an analysis of flanking sequences, which in turn limited the applicability of molecular-clock based dating techniques. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of those EVEs shared among different host species revealed extremely complex tree topologies which do not exhibit simple matches to the host phylogeny at both the species and genera levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B–C</xref>).

This is further supported by the high abundance of viral RNA in the arthropod transcriptome, as well as by the high frequencies of endogenous copies of these viruses in the arthropod genome, greatly expanding the known biodiversity of these genomic ‘fossils’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cui and Holmes, 2012</xref>). The often basal position of the arthropod viruses in our phylogenetic trees is also compatible with the idea that the negative-sense RNA viruses found in vertebrates and plants ultimately have their ancestry in arthropods, although this will only be confirmed with a far wider sample of virus biodiversity.</p><p>The rich genetic and phylogenetic diversity of arthropod RNA viruses may in part reflect the enormous species number and diversity of arthropods, and that they sometimes live in large and very dense populations that provide abundant hosts to fuel virus transmission. Furthermore, arthropods are involved in almost all ecological guilds and actively interact with other eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi, such that it is possible that they serve as both sources and sinks for viruses present in the environment. In addition, not only were diverse viruses present, but they were often highly abundant. For example, in the pool containing 12 individuals (representing two species) from the Gerridae (Water striders) collected at the same site, we identified at least five negative-sense RNA viruses whose TPM values are well above 100, and where the viral RNA collectively made up more than 50% of the host total RNA (rRNA excluded). Determining why arthropods are able to carry such a large viral diversity and at such frequencies clearly merits further investigation.</p><p>The viruses discovered here also exhibited a huge variation in level of abundance. It is possible that this variation is in part due to the stage or severity of infection in individual viruses and may be significantly influenced by the process of pooling, since most of our libraries contain an uneven mixture of different host species or even genera. In addition, it is possible that some low abundance viruses may in fact be derived from other eukaryotic organisms present in the host sampled, such as undigested food or prey, gut micro flora, and parasites. Nevertheless, since the majority of the low abundance viruses appear in the same groups as the highly abundant ones in our phylogenetic analyses, these viruses are most likely associated with arthropods.</p><p>Viral infections in vertebrates and plants can be divided into two main categories: (i) arthropod-dependent infections, in which there is spill-over to non-arthropods but where continued virus transmission still requires arthropods, and (ii) arthropod-independent infections, in which the virus has shifted its host range to circulate among vertebrates exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The first category of infections is often associated with major vector-borne diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2012</xref>). Given the biodiversity of arthropod viruses documented here, it seems likely that arthropod-independent viruses were ultimately derived from arthropod-dependent infections, with subsequent adaptation to vertebrate-only transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.022</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Transmission of negative-sense RNA viruses in arthropods and non-arthropods.</title><p>Three types of transmission cycle are shown: (i) those between arthropods and plants are shaded green; (ii) those between arthropods and vertebrates are shaded yellow; and (iii) those that are vertebrate-only are shaded red.

The identification of this diverse virus family provides a new perspective on the evolutionary origins of segmented and unsegmented viruses. In particular, the chuviruses occupy a phylogenetic position that is in some sense ‘intermediate’ between the segmented and unsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses and display genomic features of both. Indeed, our phylogenetic analysis reveals that genome segmentation has evolved multiple times within the diversity of chuviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), such that this trait appears to be more flexible than previously anticipated. In addition, the majority of the chuviruses possess circular genomes. To date, the only known circular RNA virus is (hepatitis) deltavirus, although this potentially originated from the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>) and requires hepatitis B virus for successful replication. As such, the chuviruses may represent the first report of autonomously replicating circular RNA viruses, which opens up an important line of future research.</p><p>Our results also provide insights into the evolution of genome segmentation. Within the bunya-arena-like viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3C, 4</xref>), the three-segment structure is the most common, with the viral polymerase, nucleoprotein, and surface glycoproteins present on different segments. Notably, our phylogenetic analysis seemingly revealed independent occurrences of both increasing (Tenuivirus and Emaravirus) and decreasing (Arenavirus) segment numbers from the three-segment form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Independent changes of genome segmentation numbers are also observed in the mononegavirales-like viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and, more frequently, in the chuviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consequently, the number of genome segments appears to be a relatively flexible trait at a broad evolutionary scale, although the functional relevance of these changes remains unclear. While the segmented viruses (bunya-arenaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and ophioviruses) appear to be distinct from the largely unsegmented mononegavirales-like viruses in our phylogenetic analysis, this may be an artifact of under-sampling, especially given that only a tiny fraction of eukaryotes have been sampled to date. With a wider sample of eukaryotic viruses it will be possible to more accurately map changes in segment number onto phylogenetic trees and in so doing come to a more complete understanding of the patterns and determinants of the evolution of genome segmentation.</p><p>In sum, our results highlight the remarkable diversity of arthropod viruses. Because arthropods interact with a wide range of organisms including vertebrate animals and plants, they can be seen as the direct or indirect source of many clinically or economically important viruses. The viral genetic and phenotypic diversity documented in arthropods here therefore provides a new perspective on fundamental questions of virus origins, diversity, host range, genome evolution, and disease emergence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Between 2011 and 2013 we collected 70 species of arthropods from various locations in China (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Briefly, following DNase I digestion, total RNA was subjected to an rRNA removal step using Ribo-Zero Magnetic Gold Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI). The remaining RNA was then fragmented, reverse-transcribed, ends repaired, dA-tailed, adaptor ligated, purified, and quantified with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. Pair-end (90 bp or 100 bp) sequencing of the RNA library was performed on the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San diego, CA). All library preparation and sequencing steps were performed by BGI Tech (Shenzhen, China). The resulting sequencing reads were quality trimmed and assembled de novo using the Trinity program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>). All sequence reads generated in this study were uploaded onto NCBI Sequence Read Achieve (SRA) database under the BioProject accession SRP051790.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Discovery of target virus sequences</title><p>The assembled contigs were translated and compared (using Blastx) to reference protein sequences of all negative-sense RNA viruses. Sequences yielding e-values larger than 1e<sup>−5</sup> were retained and compared to the entire nr database to exclude non-viral sequences. The resulting viral sequences were merged by identifying unassembled overlaps between neighboring contigs or within a scaffold using the SeqMan program implemented in the Lasergene software package v7.1 (DNAstar, Madison, WI). To prevent missing highly divergent viruses, the newly found viral sequences were included in the reference protein sequences for a second round of Blastx.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sequence confirmation and repairing by Sanger methods</title><p>For each potential viral sequence, we first used nested RT-PCR to examine which unit contained the target sequence, utilizing primers designed based on the deep-sequencing results. In the case of segmented viruses this information was also used to determine whether and which of the segments recovered from the pool belonged to the same virus. We next designed overlapping primers to verify the sequence obtained from the deep sequencing and assembly processes. Based on the verified sequences, we determined the sequencing depth and coverage by mapping reads to target sequences using bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). All virus genome sequences generated in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers KM817593–KM817764‏.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of relative transcript abundances</title><p>Before quantification, we first removed the rRNA reads from the data sets to prevent any bias due to the unequal efficiency of rRNA removal steps during library preparation. To achieve this, we blasted the Trinity assembly results against the SILVER rRNA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Quast et al., 2013</xref>) and then used the resulting rRNA contigs as a template for mapping using BOWTIE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). The remaining reads from each library were then mapped on to the assembled transcripts and analyzed with RSEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2010</xref>), using the run_RSEM_align_n_estimate.pl scripts implemented in the Trinity program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>). The relative abundance of each transcript is presented as transcripts per million (TPM) which corrects for the total number of reads as well as for transcript length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Genome walking</title><p>Some of the sequences obtained were substantially shorter than expected. To obtain longer sequences, we used a Genome walking kit (TaKaRa, Japan). Briefly, three gene-specific primers close to the end of the known sequence were designed. RNA from positive samples was used as input for reverse transcription primed by random primer N6. TAIL-PCR (thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was used as a template for PCR with specific primers and the manufacturer-supplied degenerate primers. After three rounds of amplification, the products were analyzed on 1.0% agarose gels, and single fragments were recovered from the gels and purified using an agarose gel DNA extraction kit (TaKaRa). The purified products were then ligated into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa) which contains the gene for ampicillin resistance. The vector was transformed into DH5α cells, which were spread on agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. A total of 10 clones were randomly selected and sequenced using M13 primers on ABI 3730 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Determination of genome/segment termini</title><p>The extreme 5′ sequences were recovered by performing a 5′-Full RACE kit with TAP (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, two gene-specific primers close to the end of the known sequence were designed. The 5′ end of RNA was ligated to the 5′RACE adaptor (without 5′ end dephosphorylating and decapping) and then reverse-transcribed using random 9 mers. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for nested PCR with 5′ RACE primers provided by the kit and gene-specific reverse primers. The PCR products were separated on an agarose gel, cloned into pMD19-T cloning vector, and subsequently sequenced.</p><p>The extreme 3′ sequences were recovered by performing a 3′-full RACE Core Set with PrimeScript RTase (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Because the RNA template lacks a polyadenylated tail, a Poly(A) Tailing Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to add this to the RNAs prior to first-strand 3′-cDNA synthesis. 20 μl of the Poly(A)-tailing reaction mixture was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and was incubated at 37°C for 1 hr before reverse transcription using PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase. The cDNA was then amplified by nested PCR using the 3′ RACE primers provided by the kit and gene-specific reverse primers. The PCR products were separated on agarose gels, cloned into pMD19-T cloning vector, and subsequently sequenced. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome fragment were also determined by RNA circularization. RT-PCR amplification was performed across the ligated termini and the resulting PCR products were subsequently cloned and sequenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p>Potential viral proteins identified from this study were aligned with their corresponding homologs of reference negative-sense RNA viruses using MAFFT version 7 and employing the E-INS-i algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>). The sequence alignment was limited to conserved domains, with ambiguously aligned regions removed using TrimAl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>). The final alignment lengths were 224 amino acids (aa), 412aa, 727aa, and 364aa for data sets of overall, bunya-arena-like, mononega-like, and orthomyxo-like data sets, respectively. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the maximum likelihood method (ML) implemented in PhyML version 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guindon and Gascuel, 2003</xref>), with the WAG + Γ amino acid substitution model and a Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) topology searching algorithm. Phylogenetic trees were also inferred using a Bayesian method implemented in MrBayes version 3.2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003</xref>), with the same substitution model as used in ML tree inference. In the MrBayes analyses, we used two simultaneous runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, and the runs were terminated upon convergence (standard deviation of the split frequencies &lt;0.01). The phylogeny was subsequently summarized from both runs with an initial 10% of trees discarded as burn-in.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Prediction of protein domains and functions</title><p>For each of the putative viral protein sequences, we used TMHMM v2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</ext-link>) to predict the transmembrane domains, SignalP v4.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>) to determine signal sequences, and NetNGlyc v1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/</ext-link>) to identify N-linked glycosylation sites. For some of the highly divergent viruses belonging to the Mononegavirales and the Chuviridae, a protein was regarded as a potential glycoprotein if it contained (i) a N-terminal signal domain, (ii) a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and (iii) glycosylation sites in cytoplasmic domains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Identification and characterization of endogenous viruses</title><p>Endogenous copies of the exogenous negative-sense RNA viruses newly described here were detected using the tBlastn algorithm against arthropod genomes available in the Reference Genomic Sequences Database (refseq_genomic) and Whole Genome Shotgun Database (WGS) in GenBank, and using viral amino acid sequences as queries. The threshold for match was set to 1e<sup>−05</sup> for the e-value and 50 amino acids for matched length. The query process was reversed for each potential endogenous virus to determine their corresponding phylogenetic group. Orthologous insertion events were determined by examining flanking gene sequences. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses were carried out as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Characterization of bi-segmented viruses in the Chuviridae</title><p>Within the Chuviridae, Wuhan Louse Fly Virus 6 and 7, Wenzhou Crab Virus 2, Lishi Spider Virus 1, and Wuchang Cockroach Virus 3 possessed bi-segmented genomes.</p><p>Both segments were discovered using Blastx against pools of predicted proteins from unsegmented chuvirus or mononegavirales sequences. To determine that these sequences were indeed from separate segments, we performed all combinations of head-to-tail RT-PCR which allowed us to ascertain whether the sequence fragments came from a single genome. Furthermore, checking sequencing depth can help to eliminate the possibility of separate contigs being generated due to inadequate sequencing coverage. To prove that a pair of segments belonged to the same virus, we checked: (i) sequencing depth for both segments, (ii) the presence of conserved regulatory sequences at non-coding regions of the genome, (iii) whether there is match for PCR-positive units, and (iv) the phylogenetic positions of the different viral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Characterization of a circular genome form within the Chuviridae</title><p>The circular genome organization within the Chuviridae was identified after we found that their genome sequences were ‘over assembled’ (i.e., generating contigs that contained more than one genome connected head-to-tail). This circular genomic form was also observed in both segments of the segmented chuviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, RT-PCR and sequencing over the entire genome did not reveal any break-points. As a control, the same protocol failed to connect the genome termini within the Mononegavirales, suggesting the circular genomic form is unique to the chuviruses. To further validate that these genomes are circular, we mapped the high-throughput sequencing reads to these assembled genomes. The coverage and depth were adequate throughout the genome with the exception of one location upstream to the 3′ end of the ORF encoding RdRp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This genomic location had only 0–20 X coverage depending on the virus, although all RT-PCRs were successful across this location. Interestingly, sequencing of the cloned PCR products revealed extensive sequence variation (i.e., insertions and deletions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which is the likely cause of the low sequence coverage in this location. Collectively, these data provide strong evidence for circular genomes in the chuviruses, although this does not exclude the potential presence of linear genomic forms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 81290343, 81273014), the 12th Five-Year Major National Science and Technology Projects of China (2014ZX10004001-005).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Chris Ponting (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Stephen Goff, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper reports the recovery of sequences of a large number of new RNA viral genomes extracted from arthropods from China. These new sequences have then been placed in a phylogenetic tree of the virus family and reveal a hugely expanded branch of the negative-sense RNA virus tree. There is interesting discussion about the evolution of segmented and nonsegmented viral genomes, a current topic of great interest in virology.</p><p>These data provide a significant amount of new food for thought about virus diversity, virus evolution, and host range for this large and important group of viruses. We found the paper well-written, informative, and highly accessible to virologists and especially to nonvirologists. The text is terse and to-the-point. There are also surprises: there is a new family, the so-called <italic>Chuviridae</italic>. The circular RNA genomes are quite remarkable and require some new twists in RNA genome replication. This should spark considerable new exploration of RNA polymerase functions.</p><p>Concerns to address in a resubmission:</p><p>The manuscript primarily requires some textual revisions to 'tone down' some of its more general claims and to elaborate on some of the methodological details.</p><p>1) The most substantive concern regarding the data is 'where is the rest of it?'. The methods described would also identify positive sense RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses: given this, why is the focus limited to negative sense viruses? Do the other data tell a substantially different/additional/separable story? If they do not (i.e. there is another manuscript coming with substantially the same story for + ssRNA viruses) then we do not think it appropriate to split the dataset.</p><p>2) We would encourage some expanded discussion of the implications of the evolution of segmented and nonsegmented viral genomes.</p><p>3) We would encourage discussion of the possibility that these viruses were not infecting the presumed host, but were instead infecting any or all of shared gut contents such as animal prey or food plants, gut microflora (yeasts?) or parasites (notably nematodes and/or mites, single-celled eukaryotic parasites).</p><p>4) In the Introduction: To say arthropod viruses are 'characterised by' persistent infection, vertical transmission and genomic integration is an extreme overstatement, and is potentially misleading. These things happen, but surely there no evidence that they are even that common, let alone 'characteristic'? It might be arguable for 'persistent infection', but surely the other two really only pertain to a minority? Also, these things seem to be ascribed to all viruses, rather than the–ssRNA that are the focus of the manuscript.</p><p>5) In the Results, the authors state that “a key result of this study is that the majority of the diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses now appears to be contained within viruses that utilize arthropods as hosts or vectors”: this over claims the case. This large-scale systematic metagenomic survey (relative to the small-scale ad hoc analyses that represent the majority of the previously described–ssRNA viruses) certainly identifies an exciting diversity; but who's to say that a similar survey of marine molluscs (or basal metazoan?) wouldn't change the perspective again? The only strong claim that can be made here is that viruses are undersampled. This is revisited in the first paragraph of the Discussion section, where the authors acknowledge the problem, but we think it needs to be toned down.</p><p>6) We don't really 'buy' the argument in the second paragraph of the Discussion section that 'RNAi enables benign and persistent infections'. Since vertebrates are the only deep eukaryotic lineage (probably) lacking the antiviral RNAi response, this amounts to claiming that vertebrates are unique is not easily developing persistent benign viral infections (what about plants and fungi?). Is this really the case? What evidence is there to support this?</p><p>7) It seems a missed opportunity to not discuss timescales. We appreciate this is hard, but given the large diversity of new viruses here (and the ease with which some other RNA viruses form endogenous copies/EVEs) it seems a shame not to search genomic DNA datasets to identify shared ancient insertions that could be used to date some of the splits.</p><p>8) In the Results, where two different hosts are identified for a 'single' virus, we need to know the (synonymous site and amino acid) divergence between the two different viral lineages. The timescale over which such transmission occurs is vital—they could be sharing an infection pool, or they might not have had a common ancestor for thousands of years.</p><p>9) The experimental approach is quite straightforward, but comprehensive and well conducted, and the results are impressive. But it is unclear what efforts have been taken by the authors to ensure that the viruses were indeed from arthropods and not internal or external contaminants. This point should at least be discussed.</p><p>10) The results are presented in a rather cursory manner, and we would like to see a lot more detail, such as fully labeled trees being available in supplementary information.</p><p>11) While we appreciate that the RdRp is highly conserved and unlikely to provide strong statistical supports, there are unequivocal statements about phylogenetic relationships that may not have any support. Sequencing of other more variable genes and a more considered analysis would help to resolve this. As it is, it seems that only 171 sequences were generated from this study (sixth paragraph of the Materials and methods section), which is baffling, and it is not clear whether the deep sequencing assemblies are going to be made available anywhere (please provide details).</p><p>12) Ideally, we would like to see some attempt made at dating these new viruses but we understand that this could be very challenging.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05378.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The most substantive concern regarding the data is 'where is the rest of it?'.

Do the other data tell a substantially different/additional/separable story? If they do not (i.e. there is another manuscript coming with substantially the same story for + ssRNA viruses) then we do not think it appropriate to split the dataset</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that we did indeed discover a number of other RNA viruses (positive-sense, double-stranded) in the arthropods examined here. However, the newly discovered diversity in other virus groups, although novel, is not as comprehensive and all-encompassing as that of the negative-sense RNA viruses described here, and tells a rather different story. In particular, the positive- and double-stranded RNA viruses (which we are still characterizing) tend to fall within the diversity of known families, rather than filling phylogenetic ‘gaps’ as is the case with the negative-sense RNA viruses. In addition, the role played by arthropods in such families as the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and the <italic>Picornavirales</italic> is somewhat different (and more complex) to what we present here (for example, see our recent paper on the evolutionary and genomic complexity of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>: Qin et al., PNAS, 111, 6744-6749, 2014). We therefore feel that it is difficult to present a single, coherent picture for all these RNA viruses, and that some families of positive-sense viruses will likely merit individual publications. Hence, because the negative-sense RNA viruses are a distinct phylogenetic group, we feel that it is simplest to present a stand-alone paper on these viruses, rather than greatly complicating it with the inclusion of other viral groups.</p><p><italic>2) We would encourage some expanded discussion of the implications of the evolution of segmented and nonsegmented viral genomes</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the implications of virus segmentation could be discussed more thoroughly and we have now added some additional text on this matter. Because we would like to avoid unnecessary speculation, and it seems premature to make strong claims in the absence of a wider sampling of eukaryotic viruses, we have focused this extra text on the future work that needs to be done. The expanded discussion can be found in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“Independent changes of genome segmentation numbers are also observed in the mononegavirales-like viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and, more frequently, in the chuviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consequently, the number of genome segments appears to be a relatively flexible trait at a broad evolutionary scale, although the functional relevance of these changes remains unclear. While the segmented viruses (bunya-arenaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and ophioviruses) appear to be distinct from the largely unsegmented mononegavirales-like viruses in our phylogenetic analysis, this may be an artifact of under-sampling, especially given that only a tiny fraction of eukaryotes have been sampled to date. With a wider sample of eukaryotic viruses it will be possible to more accurately map changes in segment number onto phylogenetic trees and in so doing come to a more complete understanding of the patterns and determinants of the evolution of genome segmentation.”</p><p><italic>3) We would encourage discussion of the possibility that these viruses were not infecting the presumed host, but were instead infecting any or all of shared gut contents such as animal prey or food plants, gut microflora (yeasts?) or parasites (notably nematodes and/or mites, single-celled eukaryotic parasites)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers make a very good point, and we agree that the potential source of these viruses should be examined and discussed in more detail. Although it is impossible to achieve a clear picture of the true source for every virus in a metagenomic sequencing project such as this, we found that by measuring the relative abundance of viral transcripts we could at least distinguish those viruses that are clearly infecting the host organism we have sampled (i.e. those with high abundance) from those with possible other origins (which we predict to be of low abundance). Furthermore, the possibility that food/microflora/parasites are the source of the viruses is further reduced if the less abundant viruses appear closely related to the abundant viruses in phylogenetic trees. Collectively, we believe that this approach provides an effective working solution to the source of the viruses observed here. The description of RNA transcript quantification can be found in the Methods section in the seventh paragraph:</p><p>“Quantification of relative transcript abundances. Before quantification, we first removed the rRNA reads from the data sets to prevent any bias due to the unequal efficiency of rRNA removal steps during library preparation. To achieve this, we blasted the Trinity assembly results against the SILVER rRNA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Quast et al., 2013</xref>), and then used the resulting rRNA contigs as a template for mapping using BOWTIE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). The remaining reads from each library were then mapped on to the assembled transcripts and analyzed with RSEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2010</xref>), using the run_RSEM_align_n_estimate.pl scripts implemented in the Trinity program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>). The relative abundance of each transcript is presented as transcripts per million (TPM) which corrects for the total number of reads as well as for transcript length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2010</xref>).”</p><p>The new results include an additional figure and an extra “Abundance” column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3 tbl4">Tables 2–4</xref>. The revised text can be found in the second paragraph of the Results section and reads:</p><p>“Next, we measured the abundance of these sequences as the number transcripts per million (TPM) within each library after the removal of rRNA reads. The abundance of viral transcripts calculated in this manner exhibited substantial variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3 tbl4">Tables 2–4</xref>): while the least abundant L segment (Shayang Spider Virus 3) contributed to less than 0.001% to the total non-ribosomal RNA content, the most abundant (Sanxia Water Strider Virus 1) was at a frequency of 21.2%, and up to 43.9% if we include the matching M and S segments of the virus. The remaining viral RdRp sequences fell within a range (10-1000 TPM) that matched the abundance level of highly expressed host mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).”</p><p>Finally, in the Discussion section of the manuscript, we examined the potential causes of this variation of abundance level, including the possibility that they did not infect the presumed host. The revised text can be found in the third paragraph and reads as follows:</p><p>“The viruses discovered here also exhibited a huge variation in level of abundance. It is possible that this variation is in part due to the stage or severity of infection in individual viruses, and may be significantly influenced by the process of pooling, since most of our libraries contain an uneven mixture of different host species or even genera. In addition, it is possible that some low abundance viruses may in fact be derived from other eukaryotic organisms present in the host sampled, such as undigested food or prey, gut micro flora, and parasites. Nevertheless, since the majority of the low abundance viruses appear in the same groups as the highly abundant ones in our phylogenetic analyses, these viruses are most likely associated with arthropods.”</p><p><italic>4) In the Introduction: To say arthropod viruses are 'characterised by' persistent infection, vertical transmission and genomic integration is an extreme overstatement, and is potentially misleading. These things happen, but surely there no evidence that they are even that common, let alone 'characteristic'? It might be arguable for 'persistent infection', but surely the other two really only pertain to a minority? Also, these things seem to be ascribed to all viruses, rather than the–ssRNA that are the focus of the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this was an overstatement and the relevant text has therefore been deleted.</p><p><italic>5) In the Results, the authors state that “a key result of this study is that the majority of the diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses now appears to be contained within viruses that utilize arthropods as hosts or vectors”: this over claims the case.

This is revisited in the first paragraph of the Discussion section, where the authors acknowledge the problem, but we think it needs to be toned down</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by our wording, which we agree was too strong. The intended point was simply that currently known virus diversity (which is largely from vertebrates and plants) is mainly nested within the viral diversity newly discovered in arthropods. The relevant context has therefore been changed in the fourth paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>“A key result of this study is that the much of the genetic diversity of negative-sense RNA viruses in vertebrates and plants now appears to be contained within viruses that utilize arthropods as hosts or vectors.”</p><p>And also in the first paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“Our study suggests that arthropods are major reservoir hosts for many, if not all, of the negative-sense RNA viruses in vertebrates and plants, and hence have likely played a major role in their evolution.”</p><p><italic>6) We don't really 'buy' the argument in the second paragraph of the Discussion section that 'RNAi enables benign and persistent infections'. Since vertebrates are the only deep eukaryotic lineage (probably) lacking the antiviral RNAi response, this amounts to claiming that vertebrates are unique is not easily developing persistent benign viral infections (what about plants and fungi?). Is this really the case? What evidence is there to support this</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers make a fair point. Accordingly, the relevant text has been deleted, and replaced by the following text in the second paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“Furthermore, arthropods are involved in almost all ecological guilds and actively interact with other eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, such that it is possible that they serve as both sources and sinks for viruses present in the environment. In addition, not only were diverse viruses present, but they were often highly abundant. For example, in the pool containing twelve individuals (representing two species) from the <italic>Gerridae</italic> (Water striders) collected at the same site, we identified at least five negative-sense RNA viruses whose TPM values are well above 100, and where the viral RNA collectively made up more than 50% of the host total RNA (rRNA excluded). Determining why arthropods are able to carry such a large viral diversity and at such frequencies clearly merits further investigation.”</p><p><italic>7) It seems a missed opportunity to not discuss timescales. We appreciate this is hard, but given the large diversity of new viruses here (and the ease with which some other RNA viruses form endogenous copies/EVEs) it seems a shame not to search genomic DNA datasets to identify shared ancient insertions that could be used to date some of the splits</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewers correctly state, inferring the time-scale of this evolutionary history is very difficult (although it is clearly ancient) and something we considered closely (because it is obviously very interesting). We did find a large number of potential EVEs using tBlastx (please see the new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> in the paper). Interestingly, most of these EVE sequences have disrupted reading frames and many are found within transposon elements, suggesting that the transposons have been central to their integration. Nevertheless, and critically for the context of molecular clock dating, the EVEs we discovered do not share homologous integration sites in the host genome as revealed by an analysis of flanking sequences (i.e. they are likely not orthologous and orthology greatly aids dating). In addition, many are in short contig/scaffolds such that it is difficult to trace their locations. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of those EVEs shared among different host species revealed extremely complex tree topologies which do not reflect the host phylogeny; these are indicative of independent integration events that again prohibit effective molecular clock dating (please find an example tree in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In sum, after a careful analysis of the EVE data, we could not find any clear examples that could provide a reliable time-scale of viral evolution. In addition, the general incongruence between the (exogenous) virus and host phylogenies precluded any reliable molecular clock dating analysis. We would therefore prefer not to include any such analysis as it will clearly only add error (i.e. we cannot safely say that these dating estimates will be accurate). These points are now made in the revised version of the paper. In addition, we have added some text outlining the discovery and characterization of the novel endogenous viruses. The description of the methods can be found in the thirteenth paragraph of the Materials and methods section and reads:</p><p>“Identification and characterization of endogenous viruses. Endogenous copies of the exogenous negative-sense RNA viruses newly described here were detected using the tBlastn algorithm against arthropod genomes available in the Reference Genomic Sequences Database (refseq_genomic) and Whole Genome Shotgun Database (WGS) in GenBank, and using viral amino acid sequences as queries. The threshold for match was set to 1e-05 for the e-value and 50 amino acids for matched length. The query process was reversed for each potential endogenous virus to determine their corresponding phylogenetic group. Orthologous insertion events were determined by examining flanking gene sequences. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses were carried out as described above.”</p><p>These results are described in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>. The related text can be found in the last paragraph of the Results section and reads:</p><p>“Novel Endogenous Virus Elements (EVEs). As well as novel exogenous RNA viruses, our metagenomic analysis also revealed a large number of potential EVEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010</xref>) in more than 40 arthropod species: these resembled complete or partial genes of the major proteins—the nucleoprotein, glycoprotein and RdRp—but without fully intact genomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). As expected given their endogenous status, most of these sequences have disrupted reading frames and many are found within transposon elements, suggesting that transposons have been central to their integration. Interestingly, in some cases, such as the putative glycoprotein gene of chuviruses, the homologous EVEs from within a family (<italic>Culicidae</italic>) or even an order (<italic>Hymenoptera</italic>) form monophyletic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). However, they are unlikely to be orthologous because they do not share homologous integration sites in the host genome as determined by an analysis of flanking sequences, which in turn limited the applicability of molecular-clock based dating techniques. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of those EVEs shared among different host species revealed extremely complex tree topologies which do not exhibit simple matches to the host phylogeny at both the species and genera levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B,C</xref>). In sum, these results suggest that EVEs are relative commonplace in arthropod genomes and have been often generated by multiple and independent integration events.”</p><p><italic>8) In the Results, where two different hosts are identified for a 'single' virus, we need to know the (synonymous site and amino acid) divergence between the two different viral lineages. The timescale over which such transmission occurs is vital—they could be sharing an infection pool, or they might not have had a common ancestor for thousands of years</italic>.</p><p>The genetic diversity of these viruses is very limited across different hosts and the viral phylogenies do not reflect those of their hosts. As a consequence, it seems reasonable to conclude that they are likely from the same infection pool. We have included a new figure illustrating the relationship between these viruses in the context of multiple hosts, and the revised text can be found in the fourth paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>“Interestingly, host species in the same niche had similar viral contents that were generally incongruent with the host phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Such a pattern is indicative of frequent cross-species and occasional cross-genus virus transmission in the context of ecological and geographic proximity.”</p><p><italic>9) The experimental approach is quite straightforward, but comprehensive and well conducted, and the results are impressive. But it is unclear what efforts have been taken by the authors to ensure that the viruses were indeed from arthropods and not internal or external contaminants. This point should at least be discussed</italic>.</p><p>Please refer to our response to Major Comment #3.</p><p><italic>10) The results are presented in a rather cursory manner, and we would like to see a lot more detail, such as fully labeled trees being available in supplementary information</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the over-simplification of the Results; we were trying to be as succinct as possible. Detailed phylogenic trees have now been included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>11) While we appreciate that the RdRp is highly conserved and unlikely to provide strong statistical supports, there are unequivocal statements about phylogenetic relationships that may not have any support. Sequencing of other more variable genes and a more considered analysis would help to resolve this. As it is, it seems that only 171 sequences were generated from this study (sixth paragraph of the Materials and methods section), which is baffling, and it is not clear whether the deep sequencing assemblies are going to be made available anywhere (please provide details)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the RdRp phylogeny may lack resolution if: (i) the sequences are too conserved (i.e. below species level), and (ii) the sequence are too divergent such that they do not share conserved domains. However, in our case, the replicase (RdRp) domains were well conserved across the negative-sense RNA viruses such that a reliable topology could be inferred (and very similar phylogenies were obtained using both ML and Bayesian methods). In contrast, the other major viral genes (glycoproteins and nucleoprotein) are far more divergent and lack conserved domains across genera (some are not even homologous), and therefore they are not helpful in a phylogenetic analysis aimed at resolving ancient relationships. As the result, the only viable way to infer the deep phylogenetic relationships among negative-sense viruses is with the RdRp which, of course, is why there is a rich literature on the use of this gene but not any others. We therefore strongly believe that our phylogenetic analysis of RdRp is the only scientifically rigorous way to proceed.</p><p>To clarify, the 171 sequences we deposited in the GenBank are confirmed complete or near complete genomes of all the negative-sense RNA viruses found in this study. We agree with the reviewers that raw data should be made available and, consequently, all the reads generated in this study have now been uploaded to NCBI Sequence Read Achieve. The corresponding description is added in the fourth paragraph of the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“All sequence reads generated in this study were uploaded onto NCBI Sequence Read Achieve (SRA) database under the BioProject accession SRP051790.”</p><p><italic>12) Ideally, we would like to see some attempt made at dating these new viruses but we understand that this could be very challenging</italic>.</p><p>Please refer to our response to Major Comment #7. Sadly, we believe that dating is too difficult to perform on these data and will just add error.</p></body></sub-article></article>
