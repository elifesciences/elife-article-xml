In mammals, a master clock residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is reset by the light–dark cycle, while timed food intake is a potent synchronizer of peripheral clocks such as the liver. Alterations in food intake rhythms can uncouple peripheral clocks from the SCN, resulting in internal desynchrony, which promotes obesity and metabolic disorders. Pancreas-derived hormones such as insulin and glucagon have been implicated in signaling mealtime to peripheral clocks. In this study, we identify a novel, more direct pathway of food-driven liver clock resetting involving oxyntomodulin (OXM). In mice, food intake stimulates OXM secretion from the gut, which resets liver transcription rhythms via induction of the core clock genes <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>. Inhibition of OXM signaling blocks food-mediated resetting of hepatocyte clocks. These data reveal a direct link between gastric filling with food and circadian rhythm phasing in metabolic tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06253.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06253.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06253.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other animals have adapted their behavior and their biology to the daily cycle of light and dark. Groups of genes are reliably switched on or off at different times of the day, and act as internal, or ‘circadian’, clocks that help these organisms to stay on a 24-hour cycle. External signals also synchronize the body's internal clocks. For example, sunlight helps synchronize the master clock in the brain, while mealtimes and other cues help other organs keep time.</p><p>These internal clocks are often disrupted in people who work overnight or on rotating shifts. It is believed that when these individuals wake up or go to sleep at odd times it confuses their circadian clocks, which can be harmful to their health. People who work these unusual hours are at an increased risk of developing cancer, heart disease, obesity, and other disorders that involve problems with metabolism.</p><p>Eating at odd hours may also throw off the circadian clocks in the digestive system. This may explain why metabolic problems have been linked to working odd hours. Landgraf, Tsang et al. hypothesized that if the hormones produced after eating are released when a person would normally be sleeping, this may desynchronize the circadian clock in organs like the liver. Screening mice and tissue samples from mice for hormones that perturb circadian rhythms showed that a hormone called oxyntomodulin, which is released from the gut after eating, activated important circadian clock genes in mouse livers. The increases in clock gene activation were comparable to those seen in the brain in response to exposure to light.</p><p>Landgraf, Tsang et al. revealed that the clock-resetting effects of oxyntomodulin were the greatest when animals were exposed to it by eating, or by injections of the hormone, at times when the animals would normally be fasting. The experiments also showed that blocking oxyntomodulin prevented eating at unusual times from interfering with the liver's circadian clocks. The findings may suggest a way to help protect people who work overnight from the harmful health effects linked to perturbed circadian clocks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06253.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06253.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>food resetting</kwd><kwd>clock genes</kwd><kwd>Per</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lichtenberg Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oster</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR-SFB134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oster</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs (Chaires de recherche du Canada)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drucker</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>93749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drucker</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chair of Incretin Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drucker</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The gut-released peptide oxyntomodulin mediates the alignment of liver clock gene and metabolic transcript rhythms with the timing of food intake by postprandial induction of hepatic <italic>Per</italic> gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extended night or rotating shift work is associated with an elevated risk for developing cancer, cardiovascular disease, immune deficiency, mood disorders, and metabolic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosenberg and Doghramji, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herichova, 2013</xref>). One major factor believed to contribute to this adverse health impact of shift work is a disruption of endogenous circadian clocks by mistimed resetting stimuli, so called <italic>Zeitgebers</italic>, as a consequence of altered sleep/wake schedules. Most organisms have evolved internal timekeepers to anticipate the environmental changes brought about by the Earth's rotation around its axis. In mammals, these so called circadian clocks are based on ubiquitously expressed cellular interlocking transcriptional–translational feedback loops (TTLs) of clock genes/proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albrecht, 2012</xref>). In the core TTL, the transcriptional activators circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1; ARNTL) regulate the expression of two <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1/2</italic>) and three <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1-3</italic>) genes. Towards the end of the day, PER and CRY proteins translocate into the nucleus where they inhibit their own abundance via inhibition of CLOCK/BMAL1. Further accessory loops serve to stabilize this 24-hr feedback rhythm and integrate the clock with cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>). The clock machinery regulates physiology via orchestration of tissue-specific rhythmic expression of clock output genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The external light–dark cycle is the most prominent <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> of the central circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golombek and Rosenstein, 2010</xref>). The SCN receives light information from the retina and synchronizes peripheral clocks throughout the body via neuronal and hormonal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>). While the SCN itself is largely non-responsive to non-photic timing signals such as food intake, meal timing is an important <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> for clocks in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stokkan et al., 2001</xref>). If food access is restricted to the normal rest phase of an organism, that is, the night for humans or daytime for nocturnal rodents, peripheral clocks become uncoupled from the SCN and adapt to the timing of food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>). Shift workers often eat at times when their digestive timing system is poorly prepared for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lowden et al., 2010</xref>). Animal studies suggest that food intake during the normal rest phase promotes obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hatori et al., 2012</xref>) and peripheral circadian uncoupling has been suggested to contribute to the development of metabolic disorders in night shift workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antunes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barclay et al., 2012</xref>). Various other factors can regulate clock gene expression in peripheral tissues, including glucocorticoids and changes in body temperature or autonomic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanisms of food-dependent peripheral clock resetting, however, remain poorly understood. Metabolic hormones such as insulin, ghrelin, and glucagon (GCG) have been shown to affect circadian rhythms associated with food restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeSauter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tahara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). While ghrelin appears to act primarily on the brain, insulin and GCG levels are mainly regulated via blood glucose. However, it was shown that carbohydrate intake alone has only a minor phase resetting capacity, while complex foods show much stronger effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirao et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that other factors must be involved. Besides the pancreas, other organs—notably including the gastrointestinal tract itself—show acute hormonal responses to fasting or feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stanley et al., 2005</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that postprandial, gut-derived signals may be implicated in food-driven resetting of peripheral clocks. In a screen using rhythmic liver slice cultures, we identified oxyntomodulin (OXM) as a potent resetting signal of liver circadian clocks. OXM is an anorexigenic incretin hormone produced in the gut by prohormone convertase 1/3-driven cleavage of the precursor preproglucagon (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drucker, 2005</xref>). It modulates energy and glucose metabolism by acting on various tissues, including brain, liver, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldissera et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gros et al., 1993</xref>). Since OXM secretion is dependent on food intake, we hypothesized that OXM may directly link food intake to hepatic transcriptional activity by resetting of the liver clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OXM resets the circadian clock in organotypic liver slice cultures</title><p>We screened a commercially available metabolic peptide library (Obesity Peptide Library, Phoenix Europe GmbH; DE) for factors capable of resetting luciferase activity rhythms in organotypic liver slice cultures from <italic>Per2::LUC</italic> circadian reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, out of 200 peptides applied during the descending phase (∼180°, corresponding to the early morning) of the luciferase activity rhythm, only a few produced marked phase shifts, including three proglucagon-derived peptide (PGDP) hormones: exendin-4, OXM, and GCG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Exendin-4 has been isolated from the salivary gland of the <italic>Gila</italic> monster, with no analogue in rodents or humans. To compare the effectiveness of mammalian PGDPs in liver clock resetting, we treated slices with increasing doses of OXM, GCG, and the three other commercially available PGDPs, glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GLP-1, GLP-2, and GRPP (0.5–450 nM) had no significant resetting effects on PER2::LUC phase compared to PBS-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). GCG resulted in phase delays of up to 3 hr, but only at relatively high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, OXM reset PER2::LUC rhythms in liver slices at much lower doses, resulting in phase delays of up to 8 hr at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To act as a true <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> signal one would expect differential OXM effects depending on treatment time, that is, a circadian <italic>gating</italic> effect. We tested this by applying OXM at different phases of the PER2::LUC rhythm. To validate the setup, slices were treated at different PER2::LUC phases with 100 μM of the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone (DEX), which was previously shown to reset hepatocyte clocks in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balsalobre et al., 2000</xref>). In a phase-dependent manner DEX treatment reset PER2::LUC activity rhythms in slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Very similar to what had been observed after DEX treatment in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balsalobre et al., 2000</xref>), application in the first quarter of the PER2::LUC activity rhythm (0–90°) resulted in phase delays, while later treatments produced phase advances (100–180°) or had no marked effect (around 270°). Likewise, OXM effects were phase dependent. Delays were predominantly observed at 90–210° of the PER2::LUC cycle with a maximum around 180°, while only modest phase shifts were seen at 270–360° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Though GCG also showed potential in resetting liver clock rhythms, OXM emerged as the most potent liver clock synchronizer from our screen. Moreover, contrary to GCG, OXM secretion is directly induced by food consumption in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Quellec et al., 1992</xref>), making it an attractive candidate for linking meal timing and clock function. Therefore, we focused on OXM for further analyses.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06253.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oxyntomodulin (OXM) phase- and dose-dependently resets circadian clocks in liver slices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic sequence of the proglucagon-derived peptides (GRPP—glicentin-related pancreatic peptide; GLIC—glicentin; OXM—oxyntomodulin; GCG—glucagon; IP-1—intervening peptide-1; GLP-1—glucagon-like peptide-1; IP-2—intervening peptide-2; GLP-2—glucagon-like peptide-2).

In consequence, eating during the normal rest phase leads to a state of internal circadian desynchrony which has been suggested to underlie metabolic deregulation under shiftwork conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vollmers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salgado-Delgado et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barclay et al., 2012</xref>). Different mechanisms of food-related circadian synchronization have been proposed, including blood glucose-responsive peptide hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tahara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). However, food entrainment does not exclusively depend on glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirao et al., 2009</xref>), and the molecular mechanisms underlying food entrainment of peripheral tissues remain poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we identified the incretin peptide OXM as a potential direct link between food intake in the gut and resetting of hepatic clock and metabolic gene transcription.</p><p>Using an organotypic slice culture system, we found that OXM—and, as was shown recently, GCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2015</xref>)—treatment can reset PER2::LUC circadian reporter activity rhythm in a dose- and phase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Consistently, peripheral OXM injections in mice reset clock gene rhythms, as well as genes involved in hepatic carbohydrate regulation, thus impinging on hepatic energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4, 5</xref>). In contrast, no significant effect of OXM treatment was observed at the level of the SCN pacemaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In mice, food intake during day (i.e., the normal rest time) uncouples the liver clock from that in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamia et al., 2008</xref>), leading to a state of internal circadian desynchrony that is associated with elevated body weight and other metabolic impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hatori et al., 2012</xref>). In the liver, around 10% of the transcriptome is under circadian regulation including many genes involved in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic ablation of the liver clock abolishes the circadian rhythms of several glucose regulatory genes and results in a perturbed diurnal profile of blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamia et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments suggest that OXM signaling involves activation of GCGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is puzzling given that OXM displays a much greater capacity for clock gene induction in liver slices than GCG itself, despite having a lower binding affinity for GCGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeSauter et al., 2009</xref>). While we cannot conclusively answer this question at the moment, there are two scenarios that might explain our observations. First, GCGR may not be the only receptor involved in OXM-mediated clock resetting. While our data suggest that GLP1R does not play a role in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2, 3</xref>), an additional OXM receptor has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldissera et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), the activation of which may interact with GCGR downstream signaling. Second, an additional signal may be involved that acts synergistically with OXM to activate hepatic <italic>Per</italic> transcription. One such candidate could be insulin, which is similarly elevated after food intake and has previously been suggested to affect liver clock rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamajuku et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). In response to food intake OXM levels go up, while GCG plasma concentrations are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that postprandial GCGR activation does not depend on GCG itself. Interestingly, GCG/GCGR signaling has recently been implicated in the regulation of hepatic <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in response to prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Sun et al. show that fasting-induced GCG signaling activates <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription via CREB/CRTC2 during the night. As we did not observe any acute effects of OXM treatment on <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), these data suggest that GCGR signaling may have different clock targets depending on the time of activation. GCGR activation is known to induce protein kinase A-mediated nuclear translocation and DNA-binding of phosphorylated CREB on target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalle et al., 2004</xref>). In line with this, we show OXM-induced binding of CREB to <italic>Per1</italic> promoter <italic>CRE</italic> motifs and induction of <italic>Per</italic> clock gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2–4</xref>). Similar phase-dependencies were observed for <italic>Per</italic> induction as were seen for clock shifting (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3 fig4">Figures 1, 3, 4</xref>). For various tissues—including the SCN—it has been shown that resetting of the circadian clock involves acute up-regulation of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunlap, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004</xref>). <italic>Per</italic> induction was observed after DEX treatment or serum shock in fibroblast and hepatoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balsalobre et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2000</xref>). Light pulses given during the dark phase induce CREB activation and <italic>Per</italic> expression in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan and Silver, 2002</xref>). In line with this, we showed <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> induction after OXM treatment. Of note, <italic>Per</italic> induction in liver slices was weaker than in vivo, suggesting that additional mechanisms may amplify OXM effects in intact animals. Along the same line, OXM-mediated <italic>Per</italic> induction in vivo appeared to be slightly faster than in slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>). Importantly, peripheral treatment with OXM also altered the diurnal expression rhythms of genes involved in regulating liver carbohydrate metabolism which may underline the metabolic effects of daytime feeding in rodents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similar to the OXM effects on clock gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>), refeeding acutely induces hepatic <italic>Per1/2</italic> expression, which has been proposed as an integral part of the food-driven clock-resetting mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oike et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tahara et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, we demonstrated that food intake after overnight fasting stimulated OXM secretion and led to hepatic up-regulation of <italic>Per</italic> expression, which was blocked by OXM neutralization in the circulation. Accordingly, liver slice cultures from re-fed <italic>Per2::LUC</italic> reporter mice showed food-dependent phase delays and these effects were attenuated by OXM neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). OXM neutralization does not completely inhibit the effects of refeeding on <italic>Per</italic> induction and liver clock resetting. This might be due to incomplete neutralization of OXM or the contribution of other food-induced factors as discussed above. Of note, while our data do not provide evidence for a direct involvement of GLP-1(R), it has been suggested that postprandial GLP-1 signaling may indirectly affect liver clock phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panjwani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate an involvement of OXM signaling in food-driven resetting of the liver circadian clock. Similar to what was previously reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mayo et al., 2003</xref>), we detected elevated OLI levels in fed as compared to starved mice and in response to acute food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The diurnal variability of OLI under ad libitum feeding conditions was moderate, but fasting resulted in an approximate 20% reduction of diurnal OLI secretion. Together this indicates that small meals as consumed during the inactive phase affect OXM secretion, but that substantial food intake is necessary to acutely increase OXM secretion to an extent sufficient to affect the liver clock. Of note, interpretation of plasma OXM blood levels is difficult as many OXM assays exhibit some degree of cross-reactivity with GCG and the closely related glicentin. Glicentin differs from OXM only by a 32-amino acid N-terminal extension (IP-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and is released from the gut after food intake at approximately similar levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blache et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang-Christensen et al., 2001</xref>), thus we cannot exclude the possibility that glicentin may exhibit actions that overlap with those described for OXM.</p><p>In summary, we show that food intake induces OLI blood levels and hepatic clock resetting in mice. OXM treatment mimics food-mediated clock resetting in slices and in vivo in a time of day-dependent manner. Food is a major regulator of hepatic transcriptome rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vollmers et al., 2009</xref>). A role for metabolic hormones, for example, insulin, GCG, or glucocorticoids, in the regulation of peripheral clocks has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balsalobre et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tahara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms of food-related synchronization of peripheral clocks and their uncoupling from the SCN under time-restricted food intake rhythms are still poorly understood. Our data suggest that OXM—most likely in concert with other gut- and pancreas-derived hunger- or satiety-signaling peptides—is involved in the detrimental effects of mistimed food intake on metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albrecht, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hatori et al., 2012</xref>). While interfering with insulin signaling may be clinically problematic because of its potential deleterious effects on glycemia, chronotherapeutic targeting of peripheral incretin signaling may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy against metabolic disorders arising from circadian strain as observed in shift workers or during jetlag.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal strains</title><p>All animal experiments were ethically assessed and licensed by the Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety of the State of Lower Saxony and in accordance with the German Law of Animal Welfare (license nos.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Louis Ptacek, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The findings in this paper strongly point to a physiological role of OXM in the regulation of the liver circadian clock that arises following the ingestion of food. This study complements earlier work by other groups that examine how corticosterone or body temperature can synchronize clocks in peripheral tissues. OXM has not been implicated in this process and this study demonstrates a new role for this neuropeptide. Moreover, the findings also point to unusual receptor signaling mechanisms as underpinning the actions of OXM in the liver.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p>1) How do the doses of OXM used in this study compare to what is known regarding the physiological concentrations of OXM?</p><p>2) Mice generally eat most during the lights-off phase, but will occasionally spontaneously eat small meals and water during the lights-on phase. Does this mean then that the release of a critical liver resetting concentration of OXM is only achieved when substantially more food is consumed during the day than is typical?</p><p>3) Are the effects of OXM on Per2 in the liver always indicative of induction? There seems to be some variation from one experiment to another or possible alternative interpretations.</p><p>4) A statement in the Methods on how the results were statistically analysed would be helpful, e.g. what statistics software package was used, significance levels used etc. Also, why not report F-values and Deg. of Freedom in the figure captions?</p><p>5) What is known about the cycling of OXM transcript in the gut? Does this vary circadianly in the absence of food intake?</p><p>6) It would be informative to include representative examples of bioluminescence rhythms from the liver slices, showing the phase shift effect of OXM. This would make it clearer to a reader not familiar with such experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06253.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) How do the doses of OXM used in this study compare to what is known regarding the physiological concentrations of OXM?</italic></p><p>We have added a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) in which we measure blood OLI levels after i.v. and i.p. injection as used in this paper. When one compares these to the refeeding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), it becomes clear that the OXM concentrations after injection are around 2-3 fold higher than after re-feeding.

Overall OLI levels are 20% higher in fed animals (p &lt; 0.001 for feeding condition in a 2-way ANOVA), and the difference is strongest during the lights-off phase. This suggests that even small meals as consumed during the light phase can affect OLI, but the overall variation is too high for this effect to reach significance at any single time point during the lights-on phase. We discuss this in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) Are the effects of OXM on Per2 in the liver always indicative of induction?

Since <italic>Gcg</italic> also gives rise to other peptides besides OXM, we believe that the mRNA data are not very informative for our story and, thus, only mention these data briefly in the main text (in the subsection headed “Food intake-mediated OXM induction and liver clock resetting”)<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06253.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Circadian mRNA expression of <italic>Gcg</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic> in the gut of fasted mice.
