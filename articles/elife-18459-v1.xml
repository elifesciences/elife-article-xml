Multiple autophagy (<italic>ATG</italic>) genes are involved in the initial formation of a crescent-shaped double-membrane vesicle called the phagophore or isolation membrane (IM), which elongates and engulfs cytosolic cargo, forming the autophagosome (AP). APs then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes (AL), where degradation of cargo takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizushima, 2007</xref>).</p><p>As interest in this pathway and its pathophysiological roles has increased, it has become clear that measurement of autophagic vesicle levels at steady state, without monitoring the overall pathway flux, can lead to controversial results. Autophagy is commonly monitored by enumerating APs under steady-state conditions, also referred to as the AP pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loos et al., 2014</xref>), using a GFP-tagged Atg8 marker. During AP formation, Atg8 is cleaved, conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine, and inserted into the vesicle membrane, thus serving as a marker for IMs and APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>). However, GFP-Atg8 only reports on the size of the IM and AP pools, not the rate by which IMs and APs are formed, or converted to ALs. For example, an increase in the number of GFP-Atg8 punctae could result from increased formation of APs or blockade of the downstream steps. A tandem-tagged mCherry-GFP-Atg8 reporter, which monitors both IMs/APs (yellow [green/red] punctae) and ALs (red punctae due to GFP fluorescence quenching in the acidic autolysosome environment) can help distinguish between these possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). We acknowledge that APs can also fuse with acidic endosomes and give rise to amphisomes, which are similarly highlighted as red punctae, and which ultimately fuse with lysosomes to form ALs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon and Seglen, 1988</xref>). Specifically, when used in combination with chemical inhibitors of autophagy, such as Bafilomycin A (BafA), tandem-tagged reporters can assess autophagic activity in so called autophagic flux assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>). Although tandem-tagged Atg8 markers have been used extensively to monitor autophagy in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>), as well as in adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauvezin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>), this reporter has not previously been used in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and no comprehensive spatial or temporal analyses of autophagic activity have been reported in any animal thus far.</p><p>Autophagy plays important roles in numerous cellular processes and has been linked to normal physiological aging as well as the development of age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levine and Kroemer, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, accumulating evidence in long-lived species demonstrates that autophagy genes are required for extended longevity. In particular, autophagy is essential for lifespan extension by inhibition of the nutrient sensor mTOR in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gelino and Hansen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lapierre et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, autophagy genes are also required for the long lifespan induced by other conserved longevity paradigms, such as reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling, germline ablation, and reduced mitochondrial respiration, and all these longevity mutants have increased transcript levels of several autophagy genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lapierre et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, neuronal overexpression of <italic>Atg1</italic> or <italic>Atg8</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simonsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ulgherait et al., 2014</xref>) or ubiquitous overexpression of <italic>ATG5</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pyo et al., 2013</xref>) is sufficient to extend lifespan. Consistent with these findings, all long-lived <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants examined to date display elevated numbers of GFP::Atg8-positive punctae in their hypodermis during larval development and/or in their intestine during early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen, 2016</xref>). Long-lived <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> overexpressing Atg1 in neurons also have more GFP::Atg8-positive punctae in neurons and in the intestine than do control animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ulgherait et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed, but not proven, that autophagic activity is elevated in long-lived animals and that this increase is critical for lifespan extension.</p><p>Considerable evidence suggests that autophagic activity changes with age, but it is unclear whether increases or decreases in autophagy are causally related to age-associated impairment of cellular function and organismal health. Aging rats have been shown to have reduced lysosomal proteolysis in liver lysates, and reduced autophagic activity in the liver as assessed by electron microscopy and flux assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Roso et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donati et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, aging is accompanied by a decrease in several autophagy gene transcripts in both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demontis and Perrimon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling and Salvaterra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simonsen et al., 2008</xref>) and in rodent tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cuervo and Dice, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vittorini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaushik et al., 2012</xref>), as well as with a decrease in lysosomal protease activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sarkis et al., 1988</xref>). In contrast, a recent study proposed that autophagic activity is increased in multiple tissues of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with age, as measured by a fluorescently labeled Atg8 reporter protein containing a lysosomal hydrolase-cleavable linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapin et al., 2015</xref>). However, this steady-state assay did not conclusively evaluate autophagic activity, and the precise step in the autophagic process marked by the reporter was not identified. Taken together, these observations demonstrate a need for additional assays to evaluate and quantify tissue- and age-specific changes in autophagic activity.</p><p>To better understand how aging affects autophagy in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we employed a GFP-tagged and a novel tandem-tagged (mCherry/GFP) form of LGG-1 (a <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Atg8) to investigate the spatial and temporal autophagy landscape in wild-type (WT) and long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants and germline-less <italic>glp-1</italic> animals. To estimate IM/AP (hereafter referred to as AP) and AL pool sizes, we quantified these LGG-1/Atg8 reporters in the intestine, body-wall muscle, pharynx, and nerve-ring neurons between Day 1 and Day 10 of adulthood. We also performed flux assays (i.e. carried out analyses in BafA-injected animals) to assess autophagic activity in each tissue. Our data indicate that WT animals displayed an age-dependent increase in AP and AL numbers in all tissues, which flux assays suggest reflects a decrease in autophagic activity over time. In contrast, <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants showed unique age- and tissue-specific differences consistent with select tissues displaying elevated, and in one case possibly reduced autophagic activity compared with WT animals. Moreover, tissue-specific inhibition of autophagy in the intestine significantly reduced the long lifespan of <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants but not of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, suggesting that autophagy in the intestine of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants may be dispensable for lifespan extension. Our study represents the first efforts to comprehensively analyze autophagic activity in a spatiotemporal manner of a live organism and provides evidence for an age-dependent decline in autophagic activity, and for a complex spatiotemporal regulation of autophagy in long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatiotemporal analysis of the GFP::LGG-1 reporter in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>To perform an in-depth analysis of autophagy in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used previously published GFP::LGG-1 reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meléndez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelino et al., 2016</xref>) to assess the isolation membrane (IM) and autophagosome (AP) pool size (for simplicity referred to as AP pool size, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in multiple somatic tissues of adult WT animals during aging, including the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), body-wall muscle (hereafter referred to as muscle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), pharynx (the foregut of the animal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as well as nerve-ring neurons (hereafter referred to as neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Specifically, we used confocal microscopy and counted the number of GFP::LGG-1 positive punctae in each of these tissues from the first day of adulthood (i.e. when animals become reproductively active) until Day 10 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>), at which time GFP::LGG-1-positive punctae could still be identified in these major tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’–E’</xref>). Notably, all tissues examined showed an increase in GFP::LGG-1-positive punctae over time with the muscle showing the largest (~9-fold) increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>). We confirmed that the GFP::LGG-1-positive punctae likely represented APs and not GFP::LGG-1 aggregates, since WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing a mutant form of GFP-tagged LGG-1/Atg8 protein (G116A) that is expected to be defective in lipidation and autophagosome-membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>) showed no punctae formation in the intestine or muscle, and only a small increase in the pharynx over this 10-day time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, see figure legend for comment on neurons, which have yet to be evaluated in detail). Taken together, these experiments show that the GFP::LGG-1 reporter can be used to monitor autophagic events in multiple somatic tissues well into old age (i.e. at least until Day 10), and indicate that the AP pool size generally increases over time without forming lipidation-independent aggregates in WT animals. However, these observations are insufficient to evaluate whether the observed increase in GFP::LGG-1-positive punctae represents an induction in the formation, or a block in the turnover of APs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18459.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The autophagosome pool size increases with age in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of GFP::LGG-1 fluorescence states in the autophagy pathway.

The rate of AP formation (<italic>dAP/dt</italic>) and AL formation (<italic>dAL/dt</italic>) at steady state is equal to 0 allowing for derivation of equations (1) – (3) for AP pool size ([AP]) and AL pool size ([AL]).

We used the steady-state equations derived in (<bold>B</bold>). Since AP and AL pool sizes were quantified using the same tissues from animals of the same genotype and age, [IM] and α are equivalent for equations (1) and (3). Thus, the ratio [AP]:[AL] is inversely related to the ratio of the rate constants γ:β, suggesting that γ &lt; β (equation (5)). (<bold>D</bold>) Relative β and γ rates following Bafilomycin A (BafA) treatment (β<sub>BafA</sub> and γ<sub>BafA</sub>) compared with control treatment (β<sub>control</sub> and γ<sub>control</sub>) can be calculated using equations (1) – (3) derived from steady-state conditions in (<bold>B</bold>). [IM] and α are assumed to be constant in control and BafA-treated animals since AP and AL pool sizes were quantified using animals of the same genotype and age. β<sub>BafA</sub> and γ<sub>BafA</sub> are inversely related to the change in AP or AL number following BafA treatment (equation 6). Thus, a hypothetical threefold increase in APs and twofold increase in ALs suggests a corresponding threefold decrease in β<sub>BafA</sub> and twofold decrease in γ<sub>BafA</sub>, demonstrating that BafA inhibits both the AP to AL step and the AL to degradation step, as indicated in the diagram. (<bold>E</bold>) Hypothetical calculation of rate constants. In WT animals, we arbitrarily set the rate of autophagic flux (i.e. [IM]α) to 12). In <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, we envisioned three scenarios: (1) no change in flux, where [IM]α = 12, similar to WT, (2) a hypothetical twofold increase in flux where [IM]α = 24, and (3) a twofold decrease in flux where [IM]α = 6. We then used our observed AP and AL data from WT animals and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants expressing the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter (red numbers) to show that different rate constants β and γ (blue numbers) can be calculated for each scenario using the flux equation in (<bold>B</bold>). Thus, it is necessary to quantify the individual rates (i.e. [IM]α, [AP]β, or [AL]γ) or the rate of overall autophagic degradation to determine autophagic flux.

Of note, ~15% of mCherry-positive puncta co-localized with neither GFP nor LysoTracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). These mCherry-only punctae may reflect inefficient labeling of Lysotracker in the intestine (which was highly variable between animals and experiments, data not shown), or they could represent mCherry aggregates rather than autophagic vesicles; however, we did not observe free mCherry on Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

RNAi-mediated inhibition was achieved by feeding <italic>mCherry::gfp::lgg-1</italic> transgenic animals with bacteria expressing dsRNA for <italic>rab-7</italic>, a small GTPase required for AP–lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>]). WT <italic>mcherry::gfp::lgg-1</italic> transgenic animals subjected to <italic>rab-7</italic> RNAi from hatching (whole-life RNAi) contained increased numbers of APs and reduced ALs in their intestines, as would be expected when autophagy is active and AP–lysosome fusion is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). We also pharmacologically inhibited autophagy by injecting WT <italic>mcherry::gfp::lgg-1</italic> transgenic animals with Bafilomycin A (BafA), which blocks vacuolar type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases thus inhibiting lysosomal acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klionsky et al., 2008</xref>]). We confirmed this by showing that BafA abrogates LysoTracker staining in the intestine of Day 1 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Consistent with a block in autophagy, we observed an increase in APs and a reduction in ALs in hypodermal seam cells of Day 1 transgenic WT animals injected with BafA compared with those injected with DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Lastly, we examined animals with a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>cst-1</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of mammalian STK4; such mutants experience a block in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilkinson et al., 2015</xref>). While the number of APs in hypodermal seam cells of untreated mCherry::GFP::LGG-1-expressing <italic>cst-1(tm1900) </italic> mutants was higher than that of WT transgenic animals, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilkinson et al., 2015</xref>), we observed no change in AP or AL pool sizes following BafA treatment of these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), consistent with the pre-existing genetic block in autophagy.

Somewhat differently, the number of ALs in these tissues increased early in adulthood and then remained relatively constant until Day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). In contrast, while neurons overall showed an increased number of APs when assessed with either the GFP::LGG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), or the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), the number of ALs decreased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Together, data with both fluorescent-tagged LGG-1 reporters indicate that the steady-state AP pool size increased with age in all the examined tissues of WT <italic>C. elegans</italic>, albeit with different trajectories, overall increasing confidence that APs are reliably monitored with the new tandem LGG-1 reporter. Likewise, the AL pool size appeared first to increase but then stagnate in the intestine, muscle, and pharynx of WT animals, whereas the number of ALs instead decreased over time in neurons.</p><p>An increase in APs and ALs could be due to an induction or a block in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we injected BafA into WT transgenic animals during adulthood and quantified APs and ALs in each tissue two hours later, when steady-state conditions were reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Since BafA inhibits lysosomal acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klionsky et al., 2008</xref>), no change in AP and AL numbers following BafA treatment would be indicative of a block in autophagy, whereas BafA-induced changes in either AP or AL number, or both, would indicate active autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, complete inhibition of lysosomal acidification by BafA would reduce AL numbers (mCherry-only punctae) while increasing AP numbers (mCherry/GFP punctae) since the GFP signal would no longer be quenched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2Ai,B</xref>). However, BafA may also prevent the later step of cargo degradation by incompletely inhibiting acidification of the lysosome resulting in reduced efficiency of lysosomal enzymes, which could lead to a concomitant increase in AL numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2Aii,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ni et al., 2011</xref>]). We found that BafA treatment increased AP numbers in all tissues and at all ages of <italic>mCherry::gfp::lgg-1</italic> transgenic animals compared with controls, but the increases were generally dampened in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Similar observations were made in BafA-injected <italic>gfp::lgg-1</italic> transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–H</xref>; analyzed at Day 1 and Day 7). This dampening of the response was not due to BafA being less effective at older age, since BafA equally quenched Lysotracker in the intestine of Day 1 and Day 10 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>, and data not shown). Interestingly, AL numbers were increased by BafA in the intestine and pharynx at all ages and in the muscle of young animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), whereas the effect on neurons varied with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Collectively, the observed changes in AP and AL pool sizes following BafA treatment suggest that autophagy is active in all tissues of WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> throughout life, similar to conclusions from a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapin et al., 2015</xref>). However, the observation that older animals generally showed reduced responses to BafA is consistent with an overall reduction in autophagic activity in all tissues with age. Although we cannot at this point explain the variable age-related effects of BafA on AL pool size in neurons, we note that the BafA response in both AP and AL compartments at Day 10 was larger in neurons than in other tissues, suggesting that autophagic capacity in neurons may decline less with age. This possibility remains to be directly tested.</p><p>Taken together, our analysis is consistent with the GFP::LGG-1 and mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporters similarly monitoring APs, that the AP and AL pool sizes generally increase with age, and that autophagy is active in all tissues throughout adulthood in WT <italic>C. elegans</italic>, consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapin et al., 2015</xref>).

In contrast, AL numbers were generally lower in <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> mutants than in WT animals and remained relatively constant over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this tissue, the BafA treatment, for unknown reasons, had variable effects on the two different reporter strains. Whereas <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> animals expressing GFP::LGG-1 showed induction of APs at both Day 1 and Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F’</xref>), BafA had no significant effect on APs at any time point in <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> mutants expressing mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Thus, while additional experiments are needed to conclusively evaluate autophagy activity in the muscle of younger <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants, our observations indicate that autophagy may be active in this tissue of older <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>In the pharynx, <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> and WT animal’s AP numbers were generally similar throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,G’</xref>), whereas the number of ALs increased somewhat with age but was consistently lower than in WT animals after Day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Thus, while the AL compartment needs to be fully investigated in older animals, it is possible that autophagy may remain active in the pharynx of <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants throughout life. However, similar to the intestine, it is not possible to evaluate the relative autophagic activity in <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants to WT animals based on this dataset.</p><p>In neurons, APs were more abundant in <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> mutants than in WT animals at Day 1, but were similar in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D,H'</xref>).

Of note, BafA treatment of young <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> animals expressing either of the two LGG-1 reporters altered both AP and AL pool sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3H’</xref>), caused no significant effect on AP or AL number on Day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3H’</xref>), but resulted in a significant increase in AP and ALs at Day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that autophagic activity may be increased in the neurons of young <italic>glp-1</italic> animals compared to age-matched WT animals, whereas the autophagic activity may become more comparable to that in WT animals by mid-life.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18459.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Germline-less <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants display a different autophagic activity profile than <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Quantification of autophagosomes (AP) and autolysosomes (AL) in adult Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> animals expressing <italic>mCherry::gfp::lgg-1</italic> and injected with DMSO (control, dark blue lines) or Bafliomycin A (BafA, light blue lines).

Our analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> using multiple Atg8 reporters and autophagy flux assays is the first effort to comprehensively estimate autophagic activity in a living animal during aging. We found that (i) aging of wild-type (WT) animals is accompanied by increased numbers of autophagic vesicles in all tissues examined that likely reflects a reduction in autophagy activity; (ii) long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin/IGF-1 mutants and germline-less <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants differentially regulate autophagy spatially and temporally compared to WT animals, and (iii) <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants, but not <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, require autophagy genes in the intestine for lifespan extension, further emphasizing important differences in autophagy regulation in individual tissues between these conserved longevity paradigms.</p><p>For this study, we used previously published GFP::LGG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meléndez et al., 2003</xref>) and new mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporters (which were expressed from endogenous or neuronal promoters) to quantify autophagic events in four major somatic tissues, that is, intestine, muscle, pharynx, and neurons during <italic>C. elegans</italic> adulthood. As an important control to help verify that GFP::LGG-1-positive punctae observed in WT, <italic>daf-2,</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> animals likely represented APs and not unspecific aggregates, we also used a lipidation-deficient GFP::LGG-1(G116A) reporter expressed from the endogenous promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>). Similar point-mutated Atg8 proteins are assumed unable to attach to the autophagosomal membrane since they cannot be post-translationally modified to bind phosphatidylethanolamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kabeya et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with this, GFP::LGG-1(G116A) appeared diffusely localized in essentially all the settings we investigated here, that is, in the intestine, muscle, and pharynx, with the notable exception of hypodermal seam cells in <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants in which GFP::LGG-1(G116A) expression led to punctae formation, similar to <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants expressing GFP::LGG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lapierre et al., 2011</xref>). GFP::LGG-1 punctae in hypodermal seam cells of <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants may therefore have been incorrectly interpreted as APs. While GFP::LGG-1(G116A) punctate structures in <italic>C. elegans</italic> remains to be investigated in detail, they may be similar in nature to the intracellular protein aggregates or inclusion bodies observed in mammalian Atg5 knockout cells expressing GFP-tagged Atg8/LC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuma et al., 2007</xref>). Since Atg8 proteins are capable of oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nymann-Andersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baisamy et al., 2009</xref>), GFP::LGG-1(G116A) punctate structures may alternatively still represent APs with mutant LGG-1(G116A) protein. However, methods to concretely determine whether GFP::LGG-1(G116A) punctae represent aggregates or APs (with WT and mutant LGG-1 protein) are not currently available in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Collectively, these observations emphasize the use of analyzing a LGG-1(G116A) reporter in any given condition in which a fluorescent LGG-1 reporter is utilized to help assess autophagic vesicles, while the data from these reporters should be interpreted with caution. To this end, we note that a comprehensive analysis of such a reporter in neurons needs to be carried out since the GFP::LGG-1(G116A) reporter we used here limited us to only evaluate hypodermal seam cells, intestine, muscle, and pharynx in detail.</p><p>We used the GFP::LGG-1 and mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporters in combination with Bafilomycin (BafA) flux assays to quantify AP and AL numbers and estimate autophagic activity. These reporters equivalently monitored changes in the AP compartment in all tissues and at all ages, collectively increasing confidence that the AP compartment was accurately visualized with these reporters. Moreover, the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter rescued an embryonically lethal <italic>lgg-1/Atg8</italic> mutant, indicating that the full-length protein is functional. We sought to use this new reporter to monitor the AL compartment for the first time in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> after validating it in multiple ways Specifically, we found that co-staining with Lysotracker highlighted the majority of red-only punctae in the intestine of young WT animals, as expected for acidic autolysosomes. In addition, we observed that inhibition of autophagy by either BafA, which inhibits lysosomal acidification, RNAi of <italic>rab-7,</italic> a gene required for AP-lysosome fusion, or genetic inhibition of autophagy by mutation of the Hippo kinase <italic>cst-1</italic>, all modulated AP and AL numbers in young WT and long-lived mutants as expected. While these observations collectively support the use of mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 to reliably monitor the AP and AL compartments, we were unable to account for ~15% red-only punctae in the intestine of Day 1 WT animals expressing mCherry::GFP::LGG-1. A similar low percentage of red-only punctae was observed in the intestine of Day 1 <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>). These punctae could represent aggregates, or, alternatively, inefficient Lysotracker staining (as noted in results), however, at present we cannot distinguish between these possibilities and this estimate does not significantly offset any of our conclusions. While this estimate is very low, and has, to our knowledge, not previously been estimated for a tandem-tagged Atg8 reporter in any model system including mammalian cell culture, we emphasize that additional experiments are needed to fully verify the AL compartment in other <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues and at later time points. To this end, it will be important to evaluate a lipidation-deficient mCherry::GFP::LGG-1(G116A) mutant. Moreover, it would be of interest to estimate autophagic activity via the Atg8 paralog LGG-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our BafA flux assays indicated that although autophagy is active in the intestine, muscle, pharynx, and neurons of aging WT <italic>C. elegans,</italic> autophagic activity appeared to decrease with age.

Our observations are also consistent with the findings of a recent study of tissue-specific autophagy in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which showed that autophagy is active in all major somatic tissues during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapin et al., 2015</xref>). In that study, <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing a lysosomal-cleavable dual-fluorescent LGG-1 protein showed an age-associated increase in mono-fluorescent LGG-1 protein levels, which the authors interpreted as an increase in autophagic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapin et al., 2015</xref>). However, the accumulation of this mono-fluorescent protein would also be consistent with an age-dependent decline in autophagic activity if degradation is inhibited, perhaps through reduced lysosomal pH or enzymatic activity, as has been observed in aging yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>). How lysosomal pH and activity might change in individual <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues during aging is an important question for the future and will be especially interesting to investigate in neurons, which appeared to behave differently to other major tissues with respect to autophagic activity. The apparent decline in autophagic activity observed here could have several explanations, including an age-associated failure to clear the autophagic machinery (as evidenced by the increases in AP and AL pool sizes) or to degrade otherwise detrimental cargo. Additional assays are required to confirm these interpretations, including biochemical approaches to directly address how autophagy might fail with age in the different tissues of <italic>C. elegans</italic>; such efforts may be facilitated by novel tissue-isolation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>). It will also be interesting to investigate how an age-dependent decline of autophagy in specific tissues might contribute to loss of organ-specific functions during aging.</p><p>Our analysis suggested that autophagic activity might be increased in certain tissues of long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants compared with WT animals, as we and others have previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lapierre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meléndez et al., 2003</xref>). However, our results indicate that these two longevity mutants differentially regulate autophagy in a tissue-specific manner during aging since <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants showed distinct age-related changes in AP and AL pool sizes, as well as in autophagic flux. Of particular note, we found that autophagy appeared to be blocked in the pharynx of Day 1 adult <italic>daf-2</italic> animals. This is an interesting scenario as it would constitute the first example of a possible autophagy block in a long-lived animal; however, we caution that steady-state conditions for the BafA treatment could vary between genetic background, tissue, as well as age. Irrespectively, it remains to be determined how <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants may differentially regulate autophagy, and to this point, it is interesting to note that although both mutants require the transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB for longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants upregulate more predicted HLH-30 target genes with roles in autophagy than <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>). While the endpoint of our analysis was on Day 10 of adulthood, it will also be of interest to estimate autophagic activity in physiologically old long-lived mutants, including in their late state of decrepitude likely caused by bacterial colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Podshivalova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We observed that intestine-specific inhibition of autophagy genes significantly shortened the lifespan of <italic>glp-1</italic> animals, but not <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, suggesting that the apparent increase in intestinal autophagic activity in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants may not be required for their long lifespan. Since systemic inhibition of autophagy reduces the lifespan of both mutants (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen, 2016</xref>, and this study), autophagy in other tissues, such as muscle, may be more important for longevity in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. These results further highlight important differences in autophagy regulation between <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants and suggest that autophagy in different organs may have distinct biological roles; a possibility that is further emphasized by the observed differential requirement for autophagy in lifespan determination in the intestine of <italic>daf-2</italic> versus <italic>glp-1</italic> animals. To this end, it will be interesting to determine whether autophagy is regulated in a tissue-specific manner in other long-lived <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants, or in other long-lived species.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated overall autophagic activity by quantifying steady-state levels of APs and ALs in combination with autophagic flux assays. However, autophagy is a multistep process and further insight can be gained into its regulation by taking into account that each step occurs at a distinct rate. Below, we reassess our dataset with this in mind. If we assume that autophagy can be represented by three steps: isolation membrane (IM) to AP, AP to AL, and degradation of ALs, the rates of each step under steady-state conditions can be defined as the concentration of IMs, APs, and ALs multiplied by the rate constants α, β, and γ, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loos et al., 2014</xref>]). Changes in the steady-state levels of APs and ALs can therefore provide information about the relative contribution of the change in each step to the overall autophagic flux. For example, in WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> under steady-state conditions, ALs were consistently more abundant than APs in all tissues examined, as has been observed in some mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>), and in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauvezin et al., 2014</xref>). Assuming α is constant, this observation suggests that β is greater than γ (i.e. the degradation step is slower than the AP to AL step), implying that turnover of ALs may be rate limiting in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). We can similarly approximate how BafA treatment affects each step and rate constant since the ratio of [AP] in control-treated animals to [AP] in BafA-treated animals (and similarly for [AL]) is inversely correlated to the change in β (or γ). For example, an increase in both [AP] and [AL] following BafA treatment implies that BafA reduces both β and γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B,D</xref>). In fact, we observed that each tissue in WT, <italic>daf-2</italic>, and <italic>glp-1</italic> animals responded to BafA in a different manner according to the genetic background and age of the animal, suggesting that tissue-, age-, and genotype-specific differences may exist in the autophagy-rate constants. The above analysis also clearly indicates that, while quantification of autophagic vesicles at steady state provides valuable information about autophagic activity, it at times is not sufficient to accurately determine the relative difference in autophagic activity between WT, <italic>daf-2,</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> animals, or between the tissues examined. Moreover, a hypothetical modeling of our data shows that steady-state numbers of APs and ALs can be interpreted as increased, decreased, or unchanged autophagic flux when the rate constants differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>), again cautioning that steady-state measurements of AP or AL pool sizes may not reflect the overall autophagic flux. Therefore, additional methods that directly measure the rate of at least one step in autophagy or the overall rate of autophagic degradation will be crucial to accurately measure autophagic flux and fully understand its role in longevity.</p><p>In conclusion, our autophagic flux analysis using LGG-1/Atg8 reporters indicated an age-dependent decline in autophagy in several major tissues of <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and that the reduction occurs at a step after AP formation. In contrast, long-lived animals show differential regulation of autophagy in distinct tissues. Further experiments are needed to confirm these observations by directly measuring autophagic activity. Understanding the tissue- and age-specific regulation of autophagy in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is likely to shed light on the role of autophagy in aging and age-related diseases in mammals, including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> and bacterial strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained and cultured under standard conditions at 20°C on the standard <italic>E. coli</italic> strain OP50 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> for strain list).

This work was funded by NIH/NIA grants AG038664 and AG039756 to MH, who is also supported by a Julie Martin Mid-Career Award in Aging Research from The Ellison Medical Foundation/AFAR.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>JTC, Designed and performed all experiments, except the GFP::LGG-1(G116A) analysis, analyzed the data, created new strains, and wrote the manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>CK, Designed and performed the GFP::LGG-1(G116A) analysis, and analyzed the data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>ABH, Made and injected the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 construct</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>LMA, Performed a repeat of the lifespan assays involving knockdown of <italic>daf-16</italic>/Foxo, and analyzed the data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>MH, Designed all experiments and wrote the manuscript</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18459.018</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>(A–B) Lifespan analysis of <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> animals subjected to whole-body or tissue-specific RNAi of autophagy genes during adulthood.</title><p>Lifespan analysis of <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> and <italic>glp-1(e2141); sid-1(qt9)</italic> (<bold>A</bold>), and <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> and <italic>daf-2(e1370); sid-1(qt9)</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) animals carrying tissue-specific arrays to re-establish RNAi by expression of <italic>sid-1</italic> transgene from intestinal-specific (<italic>vha-6</italic>) or muscle-specific (<italic>myo-3</italic>) promoters. WT and <italic>daf-2</italic> animals were incubated at 20°C and fed from Day 1 of adulthood with bacteria containing empty vector (control) or expressing dsRNA encoding autophagy genes <italic>atg-18/Wipi</italic>,<italic> lgg-1/Atg8</italic> or <italic>daf-16/Foxo. glp-1(e2141)</italic> animals were raised at 25°C and moved to 20°C at Day 1 of adulthood for the rest of their lifespan. Individual experiments are numbered (Exp#). We note that <italic>lgg-1</italic> RNAi did not significantly shorten the lifespan of <italic>glp-1(e2141); sid-1(qt9); vha-6p::sid-1</italic> transgenic animals, but this treatment had relatively weak effects in <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> single mutants analyzed in parallel experiments. Moreover, the <italic>glp-1; sid-1; vha-6p::sid-1</italic> strain was, for unexplainable reasons, short-lived in experiment number 5. Whole-body, muscle-specific, and intestinal-specific inhibition of autophagy genes generally had no effect or slightly decreased the lifespan of wild-type N2 animals (JTC and MH, unpublished results). Data show the average lifespan (avg. LS), the number of events (# animals/Total; number of dead animals/total number of animals analyzed, the percentage lifespan extension (% change) of animals subjected to gene-specific vs control RNAi, and the p value for this comparison. p values were calculated using the Mantel–Cox log-rank test. *data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated autophagic flux in multiple tissues during the aging process using the tandem-tagged Atg8/LGG-1 reporter. They found that autophagic activity declines with age in all major tissues. They also showed that long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutant animals exhibit unique age- and tissue-specific differences in autophagic activity. Compared with wild type animals, <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants display elevated autophagic activity, while <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants show reduced autophagic activity in the hypodermal seam cells. Using tissue-specific RNAi, the authors demonstrated that intestinal autophagy is essential for lifespan extension only in <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants. Overall, the work is interesting. The reviewers found that additional work is required to strengthen the manuscript to meet the standards for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study relies heavily on the tandem nCherry-gfp-lgg-1 reporter to monitor autophagic flux. It has been shown that overexpressed Atg8/LC3 reporters not only form aggregates but can also label non-autophagic structures (such as the Golgi) in yeast and mammalian cells. Further validation of the tandem reporter using Atg gene mutant backgrounds would be necessary in the different tissues.</p><p>A) LGG-1/ATG8 must be lipidated in order for it to form punctate structures. The transgenic reporter could be crossed into various autophagy gene mutants that abolish LGG-1 lipidation, including <italic>atg-4.1; atg-4.2, atg-16.1; atg-16.2, atg-3, atg7</italic>, and then the formation of puncta can be examined. If mCherry-gfp-lgg-1 puncta are absent in those mutants, it indicates that the puncta represent autophagic structures. The expression of this tandem reporter could also be examined in mutants of the Atg1 kinase complex, in which LGG-1 displays a unique distribution pattern at embryonic stages.</p><p>B) Endogenous LGG-1, detected by anti-LGG-1, could be used to demonstrate the change in autophagy activity in aged animals.</p><p>2) The authors show that autophagy in hypodermal seam cells is induced in daf-2 mutants but blocked in germline-less <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants. However, the numbers of APs and ALs are pretty low in this tissue in wild type and mutant animals with or without Bafilomycin treatment. Other assays such as degradation of the well-characterized autophagy substrate SQST-1 in partial loss-of-function autophagy mutants need be performed to demonstrate the differential autophagy activity in <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>3) Bafilomycin treatment was used to block lysosome degradation in this study. However, Bafilomycin was administered by injection, which may result in variation among animals. Genetic mutants with impaired lysosomal function, including <italic>cup-5</italic> and <italic>laat-1</italic>, could be used to follow the number of APs and ALs in aged animals or long-lived mutants.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spatiotemporal regulation of autophagy during <italic>C. elegans</italic> aging&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Other assays are needed to demonstrate that mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 puncta are autophagic structures but not protein aggregates. Anti-LGG-1 antibody could be used to detect endogenous LGG-1 (not in animals carrying the transgene) pattern in larvae. SQST-1 could also be stained to see whether it is colocalized with mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 puncta (three color staining).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed many of my concerns. But they need clarify/address the following remaining concerns:</p><p>1) <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> is not a null allele. Genetic nulls for two conjugation systems are lethal. Thus, alternative explanation for the formation of LGG-1 puncta in <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> larvae need be discussed.</p><p>2) The authors performed immunostaining against endogenous LGG-1 in animals carrying the mCherry::gfp::lgg-1 transgene. The antibody for sure will recognize MCHERRY::GFP::LGG-1 expressed from the transgene. Such experiments should be carried out in animals without carrying the transgene.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors test the punctate distribution of their new mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter in various Atg loss-of-function backgrounds to validate its use for the analysis of autophagic activity. As expected, they show that the number of mCherry-positive, GFP-negative dots (autolysosomes) decreases in these situations. However, surprisingly, the number of structures positive for both mCherry and GFP increases upon loss of Atg genes such as Atg3 that is required for LGG-1 lipidation and membrane association. The authors consider these dots as autophagosomes, and argue that their data agree with the findings of a recent Science paper by the Mizushima lab. However, this is not true: the abnormal autophagosome-like structures forming in ATG conjugation gene knockout mammalian cells are negative for LC3 (the homolog of LGG-1), as LC3 does not associate with autophagic structures in the absence of its lipidation. See Figure 4H in Tsuboyama et al., 2016. It is firmly established that Atg8/LGG-1/LC3 lipidation is required for its membrane association in all tested models including yeast, worms and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, not only in mammals. I thus think that an unknown and variable proportion of the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 dots observed in the various genetic backgrounds represent aggregates of the reporter protein (probably most of it is aggregates in Atg3 mutants), which undermines the validity of the whole study. This is especially true as the data are not verified with a robust independent test, such as endogenous LGG-1 puncta formation – it is insufficient to show that the overexpressed reporter is positive for anti-LGG-1! The main message of autophagy guidelines papers is to always rely on multiple independent tests when evaluating autophagy, so the revised manuscript still does not meet this fundamental requirement. The authors even cite Klionsky et al. 2016 Autophagy (in which the senior author is a co-author) representing a consensus recommendation of 2467 researchers in the field, and Dr. Hansen should also follow these guidelines. Taken together, the manuscript is solely based on a reporter that I do not think is reliable, so I am strongly against the publication of this preliminary work in any journal.</p><p>(Reviewer #2 corrected his original criticism after he read comments from the other reviewers.

It has been shown that overexpressed Atg8/LC3 reporters not only form aggregates but can also label non-autophagic structures (such as the Golgi) in yeast and mammalian cells. Further validation of the tandem reporter using Atg gene mutant backgrounds would be necessary in the different tissues.</italic> </p><p><italic>A) LGG-1/ATG8 must be lipidated in order for it to form punctate structures. The transgenic reporter could be crossed into various autophagy gene mutants that abolish LGG-1 lipidation, including atg-4.1; atg-4.2, atg-16.1; atg-16.2, atg-3, atg7, and then the formation of puncta can be examined. If mCherry-gfp-lgg-1 puncta are absent in those mutants, it indicates that the puncta represent autophagic structures. The expression of this tandem reporter could also be examined in mutants of the Atg1 kinase complex, in which LGG-1 displays a unique distribution pattern at embryonic stages.</italic> </p><p>To further validate our new mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter, we have expressed and examined it in <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> and <italic>atg-18(gk378)</italic> mutants (we note that we also attempted to introduce the reporter in <italic>atg-4.1(bp411)</italic> and <italic>unc-51(e369)</italic> mutants, yet we were unable to optimize protocols and finalize these crosses in time for resubmission). In embryos, the <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> mutant has been reported to lack puncta as detected by using an antibody to label endogenous LGG-1 (Tian et al., 2010). Interestingly, we observed more autophagosomes (AP) and less autolysosomes (AL) in both <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> and in <italic>atg-18(gk378)</italic> mutants compared to wild-type (WT) transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A-C</xref>). We also found that <italic>atg-18(gk378)</italic> mutants expressing GFP::LGG-1had increased number of GFP-positive punctae (i.e., APs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1D</xref> <bold>–</bold> unpublished results, C. Kumsta and M. Hansen). Similarly, we saw APs increase and ALs decrease in WT transgenic animals expressing mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 that were fed bacteria expressing dsRNA for two generations to inhibit <italic>unc-51/atg-1</italic> and <italic>atg-13</italic> (both part of the ATG1 kinase complex) in addition to <italic>bec-1</italic> and <italic>atg-9</italic> (Class II PI3K Complex – required for vesicle nucleation) and <italic>atg-7</italic> and <italic>atg-18</italic> (required for vesicle elongation to form a puncta) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>). Our data are consistent with recent work from Dr. Noburo Mizushima’s lab, which has examined Atg8 conjugation mutants affecting the closure (fission) step such as Atg5, Atg4b, and Atg3. Specifically, they observe that these mutants can form autophagosome-like structures that are labeled with the syntaxin protein Stx17 and can fuse with lysosomes but take ~10x longer to convert to an autolysosome compared to WT (Tsuboyama et al., Science, 2016). This may explain why we observed an increased numbers of APs and decreased ALs in <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> and <italic>atg-18(gk378)</italic> mutants expressing the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter. While we do not know the reason for the observed difference between embryonic and adult LGG-1 puncta numbers in <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> mutants, we speculate that it may relate to redundancy in adult functions of this gene.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18459.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><italic>atg-3</italic> and <italic>atg-18</italic> mutants have more APs and less ALs compared to wild type.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hypodermal seam cells in wild-type (WT), <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> and <italic>atg-18(gk378)</italic> transgenic animals expressing <italic>mCherry::gfp::lgg-1,</italic> imaged using confocal microscopy at Day 1 of adulthood.

We recently developed a new LGG-1 antibody that we have so far only used for Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have now optimized the use of this antibody for immunofluorescence in dissected intestines of adult animals. Using our protocol/antibody, we have determined that GFP and mCherry both co-localize with anti-LGG-1, confirming that the tagged version is labeling LGG-1 positive puncta, at least in the intestine (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). We have discussed these new data, where we say:</p><p>“Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of the intestine of mCherry::GFP::LGG-1-expressing animals showed that both GFP- and mCherry-positive punctae co-localized with structures stained by an LGG-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>).”</p><p>We also describe these data in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref> where we say:</p><p>“(D-E) Immunofluorescence to detect endogenous LGG-1 (green) and GFP (D; red) or mCherry (E; red) in dissected intestines of wild-type (WT) animals.

Since we have yet to develop the protocol to reliably count punctae from imaged intestine, we prefer to not include these data in the revised manuscript.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18459.023</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>mCherry and GFP co-localize with endogenous LGG-1 in transgenic animals expressing mCherry::gfp::lgg-1.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Immunofluorescence to detect endogenous LGG-1 (green, rabbit anti-LGG-1 antibody made by Abgent) and GFP (A; red, mouse anti-GFP from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mCherry (B; red, mouse anti-mCherry from Clonetech) in dissected intestines of wild-type (WT, top, data also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>) or <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> animals (bottom).

However, the numbers of APs and ALs are pretty low in this tissue in wild type and mutant animals with or without Bafilomycin treatment. Other assays such as degradation of the well-characterized autophagy substrate SQST-1 in partial loss-of-function autophagy mutants need be performed to demonstrate the differential autophagy activity in daf-2 and glp-1 mutants.</italic> </p><p>It is indeed interesting, but perhaps not surprising that hypodermal seam cells have “lower” number of APs and ALs in both WT and mutant animals with or without BafA treatment compared to other tissues since their cell size is much smaller than the regions quantified in other tissues. That said, we agree with the reviewer that examination of SQST-1 punctae in WT animals versus <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants would be informative. To address this point, we used a novel <italic>sqst-1p::sqst-1::gfp</italic> reporter (the expression profile of these animals were equivalent to a previously published <italic>sqst-1p::sqst-1::gfp</italic> strain from Hong Zhang’s lab, data not shown), which we crossed to <italic>glp-1(e2141)</italic> and <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants. When we analyzed Day 1 animals in their head region where the expression of this reporter is most prominent in adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4A-D</xref>), we found that <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants had similar numbers of SQST-1 punctae to WT animals, whereas <italic>daf-2</italic> animals had fewer punctae compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4E-F</xref>). BafA treatments potently increased punctae in <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, consistent with enhanced autophagic activity between the two pharyngeal bulbs in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4C-F</xref>). Similarly, BafA treatment also increased punctae in <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants compared to WT. However, this region likely consists mostly of neurons, and any hypodermal seam cells are difficult to see and distinguish from the ventral/dorsal nerve cord in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4A-D</xref>). Thus, we would like to refrain from making any conclusions in regards to the hypodermal seam cells with this novel SQST-1 reporter, and although we tried, we have not been successful in making a useful reporter expressing SQST-1 from hypodermal promoters for this resubmission.</p><p>Instead, we have expanded our analysis of seam cells by analyzing <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants in which we inhibited autophagy by <italic>rab-7</italic> or control (empty vector) RNAi from hatching.

However, Bafilomycin was administered by injection, which may result in variation among animals.</italic> </p><p>We are aware that such variability could exist in the Bafilomycin A (BafA) injection assay (which we developed to minimize the time to reach steady-state conditions (2 hrs)). However, we argue that such variability does not significantly affect our interpretations for multiple reasons. First, we injected Texas Red Dextran (5000 Daltons, i.e., significantly larger than BafA) into a large number of worms (~100) to determine reproducibility of injection. In the head region, where we quantified punctae in all assays, we saw a highly reproducible Texas Red Dextran signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 5</xref>). Second, we note that the standard error of the mean is similar in DMSO and in BafA-treated animals in each of our many performed experiments (as well as in published work, see Wilkinson et al., Molecular Cell, 2015), suggesting that any variability in the number of punctae is likely due to variability per animal rather than variable injection of BafA. We have made a comment to this experimental point in the Methods, where we say:</p><p>“Injection of BafA could result in variability of LGG-1 punctae counts, however, injection of a Texas Red Dextran (5,000 Daltons, i.e., significantly larger than BafA) into ~100 worms showed highly reproducible Texas Red signal in the head region where LGG-1 punctae were quantified (data not shown), and the standard error of the mean is similar in DMSO- and in BafA-treated animals in all experiments performed (as well as in published work see (Wilkinson et al., 2015)).

To further increase confidence in this reporter, we have analyzed a lipidation-deficient GFP::LGG-1(G116A) reporter (Manil-Segalen et al., Developmental Cell, 2014).

Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of using a GFP::LGG-1(G116A) reporter to help assess whether GFP::LGG-1 punctae are likely to represent APs in any given context.

Irrespective of these lines of evidence, we acknowledge that we cannot fully account for 15% red-only punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). These punctae could represent aggregates, or, alternatively, inefficient Lysotracker staining (as noted in the original and current manuscript). While we at present cannot distinguish between these possibilities, this estimate does not significantly offset any of our conclusions, and we observe similar% red-only punctae between genotypes (new Figure 2—figure supplement 5D).</p><p>To fully recognize this limitation and that our validation of the tandem-reporter was primarily done in the intestine of young WT animals, we have revisited our conclusions so they are based on consistent results between the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 and GFP::LGG-1 reporters, or with clear note of limitations if a possible conclusion is suggested from AL counts only. Lastly, we have expanded the Discussion to carefully discuss the limitations of the reagents used in our study, including the need to fully evaluate neurons with an LGG-1(G116A) reporter (as the existing reporter did not allow accurate identification of neurons, see figure legend to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our conclusions remain unchanged overall, except for <italic>glp-1</italic> hypodermal seam cells (as noted above), and the muscle analysis of young <italic>glp-1</italic> animals, in which the flux analysis of the GFP::LGG-1 and mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporters, for unknown reasons, gave variable results in this one case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 8F’). While these two cases represented novel examples of a potential autophagy block in a long-lived animal, we note that our data set still reports on an example of a block of autophagy in a long-lived mutant, namely in the pharynx of young <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. To reflect this change, we no longer explicitly highlight potential autophagy blocks in the abstract, but discuss appropriately in the main text.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that our revised manuscript, despite its noted limitations, represents a significant advance of our ability to measure autophagy in a multi-cellular organism, as well as our understanding of the role of autophagy during aging, and it provides an important new tool for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> field to be further validated in the future.</p><p><italic>Anti-LGG-1 antibody could be used to detect endogenous LGG-1 (not in animals carrying the transgene) pattern in larvae.</italic> </p><p>We would like to clarify that we carried out LGG-1 antibody staining in transgenic animals since it was important to verify that mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 positive punctae were positive for both fluorophores as well as LGG-1, i.e., to argue that full-length protein was present in these punctae. We have made this point clearer in the resubmitted manuscript by moving the comment to page 8 as an introductory comment. That said, we recognize that staining for endogenous LGG-1 in the intestine (the only tissue we are capable of performing immunohistochemistry in adult animals at this point) would be useful to confirm differences observed with the fluorescent LGG-1 reporters of WT and long-lived mutants (while noting that this approach cannot differentiate the AP and AL compartments, as a mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter is expected to do, nor would it allow to conclude if a positive structure is an aggregate or a <italic>bona fide</italic> autophagic vesicle). During the resubmission period, we therefore set out to antibody stain non-transgenic N2 WT and long-lived mutants. For these efforts, we had to use a new batch of the LGG-1 antibody that we previously obtained from Abgent, but this reagent unexpectedly resulted in Western blots of much reduced quality (data not shown), and we have been unable to carry out additional immunohistochemistry experiments.</p><p>That said, we note that we indeed stained N2 WT animals in our LGG-1 immunostainings for the original submission, and observed LGG-1-positive punctae in these animals, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 7</xref>).<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18459.027</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Antibody staining in N2 (Wild Type) animals.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Day 1 WT animals stained with rabbit anti-LGG-1 (green middle) and either mouse anti-mCherry (<bold>A</bold>), or mouse anti-GFP (<bold>B</bold>) (which here functioned as negative controls).

While an interesting experiment, it may, however, not be fully conclusive for the following reason. We have done co-localization assays of an unpublished TOMATO::LGG-1 strain from our lab and SQST-1::GFP (HZ589). While we observed frequent co-localization, we detected multiple examples of punctae positive for SQST-1 but not LGG-1, and vice versa (CK and MH, unpublished results). This is to be expected, since LGG-1 could be recruiting different adaptors, and SQST-1 may not always be targeted for autophagic degradation. Moreover, a co-localization event would not conclusively argue for autophagy as aggregated LGG-1 could potentially bind to SQST-1 even though it may not yet have been destined for autophagic degradation.</p><p>In conclusion, believe that the best experiment to do would be to co-stain with another membrane marker (i.e., Atg5 before closure, or Syntaxin-17 after closure of the autophagic vesicle), yet such reagents are, to our knowledge, unfortunately not currently available in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> field.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The authors have addressed many of my concerns.

Since <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> (and the other conditions we tested) are hypomorphic, we reasoned that AP-like structures could still be formed but were delayed, similar to recent work from Dr. Mizushima’s lab (Tsuboyama et al., Science, 2016). However, as noted above, we have now created and analyzed <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> mutants expressing the GFP::LGG-1(G116A) lipidation mutant and find many punctate structures in these animals (new Figure 4—figure supplement 9H, and data not shown). We observed similar results when analyzing the <italic>atg-18(gk368)</italic> mutants (new Figure 4—figure supplement 9I, and data not shown). These observations instead argue for possible aggregation events in these mutants, similar to mammalian Atg5 knockout cells which accumulate GFP::Atg8/LC3 in punctate structures shown to be inclusion bodies (Kuma et al., Autophagy, 2007). As noted above, we have now included the hypodermal seam cell counts of these animals as new data in the manuscript,</p><p><italic>2) The authors performed immunostaining against endogenous LGG-1 in animals carrying the mCherry::gfp::lgg-1 transgene. The antibody for sure will recognize MCHERRY::GFP::LGG-1 expressed from the transgene. Such experiments should be carried out in animals without carrying the transgene.</italic> </p><p>Please see response to editor above.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>In their revised manuscript, the authors test the punctate distribution of their new mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter in various Atg loss-of-function backgrounds to validate its use for the analysis of autophagic activity. As expected, they show that the number of mCherry-positive, GFP-negative dots (autolysosomes) decreases in these situations. However, surprisingly, the number of structures positive for both mCherry and GFP increases upon loss of Atg genes such as Atg3 that is required for LGG-1 lipidation and membrane association. The authors consider these dots as autophagosomes, and argue that their data agree with the findings of a recent Science paper by the Mizushima lab. However, this is not true: the abnormal autophagosome-like structures forming in ATG conjugation gene knockout mammalian cells are negative for LC3 (the homolog of LGG-1), as LC3 does not associate with autophagic structures in the absence of its lipidation. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> in Tsuboyama et al., 2016. It is firmly established that Atg8/LGG-1/LC3 lipidation is required for its membrane association in all tested models including yeast, worms and Drosophila, not only in mammals. I thus think that an unknown and variable proportion of the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 dots observed in the various genetic backgrounds represent aggregates of the reporter protein (probably most of it is aggregates in Atg3 mutants), which undermines the validity of the whole study.</italic> </p><p>As stated in the response to editor above, we recognize the limitations of the new tandem-LGG-1 reporter, and have reorganized the manuscript to better emphasize the GFP::LGG-1 data set. Moreover, we have clearly discussed the need for further investigation of the mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter, including validation of this reporter at older age, as well as analyses of G116A mutant versions expressed from endogenous and neuronal promoters (see Discussion of revised manuscript).</p><p>As also stated above, we show that no or few GFP punctae are formed over time in the major tissues of WT, <italic>daf-2,</italic> or <italic>glp-1</italic> animals expressing GFP:LGG-1(G116A) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), arguing that GFP::LGG-1 punctae represent autophagosomes (APs) and not aggregates. Unexpectedly, we observed GFP::LGG-1(G116A) punctae in hypodermal seam cells of <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, now Figure 4—figure supplement 9), indicating that GFP::LGG-1 may aggregate in this cell type. Likewise, we observed GFP::LGG-1(G116A) punctae in <italic>atg-3(bp412)</italic> and <italic>atg-18(gk378)</italic> autophagy mutants (new Figure 4—figure supplement 9, and data not shown), similar to observations in mammalian Atg5 knockout cells overexpressing GFP::Atg8/LC3 (Kuma et al., Autophagy, 2007). Collectively, these findings further validate the GFP::LGG-1 reporter and increase confidence in the GFP::LGG-1 data set, but also emphasize the use of a GFP::LGG-1(G116A) reporter to help assess whether GFP::LGG-1 punctae could represent APs in any given context.</p><p>While a similar mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 lipidation mutant will be important to create and analyze going forward, we note that our data set is overall very consistent between the GFP::LGG-1 reporter and the AP counts with the new mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 reporter. Regarding the latter, we agree that additional analysis of the red compartment is necessary, in particular since we cannot fully account for 15% red-only punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2<bold>I</bold></xref>), as also stated above. To this end, we have now also estimated this percentage in <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> animals (new Figure 2—figure supplement 5D), which show similar or smaller% red-only punctae in the intestine of Day 1 adults increasing confidence in our comparisons of the red channel/AL compartment between genotypes.</p><p><italic>This is especially true as the data are not verified with a robust independent test, such as endogenous LGG-1 puncta formation – it is insufficient to show that the overexpressed reporter is positive for anti-LGG-1!</italic> </p><p>As noted in the response to the editor above, we initially carried out LGG-1 antibody staining in transgenic animals since it was important to verify that mCherry::GFP::LGG-1 positive punctae were positive for both mCherry, GFP and LGG-1, i.e., to argue that these punctae contained full-length protein.</p><p><italic>The main message of autophagy guidelines papers is to always rely on multiple independent tests when evaluating autophagy, so the revised manuscript still does not meet this fundamental requirement. The authors even cite Klionsky et al. 2016 Autophagy (in which the senior author is a co-author) representing a consensus recommendation of 2467 researchers in the field, and Dr. Hansen should also follow these guidelines. Taken together, the manuscript is solely based on a reporter that I do not think is reliable, so I am strongly against the publication of this preliminary work in any journal.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer about the importance of using multiple approaches where at all possible to support claims regarding autophagy. For this study, we developed a new tandem-tagged mCherry::GFP:LGG-1 reporter, similar to Atg8 reagents widely used in mammalian cells, that, to our knowledge, have not previously been validated to the extent that we have validated it here in any system (see response to editor above). For this resubmission, we have reorganized our revised manuscript to better emphasize data obtained with the GFP::LGG-1 reporter (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and we further validated our GFP::LGG-1 data set by analyzing a GFP::LGG-1(G116A) lipidation mutant in all relevant settings (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 9D-E, H-I, and data not shown), thus substantially increasing confidence in the GFP::LGG-1 data set. Thus, we have extensively validated the main reagents we used to carry out a comprehensive and unparalleled spatiotemporal analysis of autophagy in a multi-cellularorganism. As clearly noted in the manuscript, we agree that these observations should be confirmed by additional approaches, including by biochemical methodologies (which we are currently developing, but which represent long-term efforts). Indeed, such confirmatory efforts would require extensive assay development and optimization since no alternative assays are currently available to make comprehensive tissue- or whole organism autophagic activity assessments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (besides the reporters recently developed in Dana Miller’s lab (Chapin et al., Aging, 2015); however, these, too, would require further validation, see Discussion for limitations of this reporter).</p><p>Still, we attempted to develop an additional assay in the resubmission period to further support our claims about age-related changes in autophagy in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Specifically, we tried to implement a ‘free GFP cleavage’ assay using BafA soaking in adult animals followed by Western blotting, similar to previous protocols in mammalian cells (Klionsky et al., Autophagy, 2016). However, our results were unfortunately quite variable between repeats (Y. Yang and MH, unpublished results) and the assay needs further optimization, including finding the minimal saturating BafA concentrations for WT and long-lived mutants (Ni et al., Autophagy, 2016).</p><p>Overall, we conclude that we have done everything reasonably possible to validate the reagents we used in this study, and we would at this point prefer to share them and our comprehensive autophagy analysis during <italic>C. elegans</italic> aging with the research community, while clearly listing the limitations of our study.</p><p><italic>(Reviewer #2 corrected his original criticism after he read comments from the other reviewers. Reviewer #2 thought atg-3(bp412) is a genetic null, which led him to conclude that mCherry-GFP-LGG-1 puncta were protein aggregates. Actually, atg-3(bp412) is a hypomorphic allele. Genetic nulls for the two conjugation systems in C. elegans cause lethality and cannot be tested for this purpose.</italic> </p><p><italic>This study contains several very interesting points, especially tissue-specific requirement for the longevity conferred by loss of function of glp-1 and daf-2.
