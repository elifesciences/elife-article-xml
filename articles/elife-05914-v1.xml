In this study, we show that mice overexpressing galectin-8, a secreted mammalian lectin of the galectins family, exhibit accelerated osteoclasts activity and bone turnover, which culminates in reduced bone mass, similar to cases of postmenopausal osteoporosis and cancerous osteolysis. This phenotype can be attributed to a direct action of galectin-8 on primary cultures of osteoblasts that secrete the osteoclastogenic factor RANKL upon binding of galectin-8. This results in enhanced differentiation into osteoclasts of the bone marrow cells co-cultured with galectin-8-treated osteoblasts. Secretion of RANKL by galectin-8-treated osteoblasts can be attributed to binding of galectin-8 to receptor complexes that positively (uPAR and MRC2) and negatively (LRP1) regulate galectin-8 function. Our findings identify galectins as new players in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling, and highlight a potential regulation of bone mass by animal lectins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05914.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05914.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05914.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The forces applied to the body during daily activities cause bones to be constantly remodeled, which is essential for keeping them healthy. In most adult organisms, new bone is created at the same rate at which old bone is destroyed. This means that overall bone mass remains the same. But, in diseases such as osteoporosis or bone cancer, bone is destroyed more rapidly than at which new bone is made. This leads to brittle bones that are more likely to fracture. Understanding how to increase the rate of bone renewal might therefore help scientists develop new treatments for bone diseases.</p><p>Bone is created by cells called osteoblasts and destroyed by other cells called osteoclasts. Both of these types of cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. The activity of these cells is controlled by a number of factors, including the matrix of proteins that holds bone together. A group of proteins called galectins are known to act as a bridge between some of the matrix proteins and molecules on the surface of the cells.</p><p>Vinik et al. took osteoblasts from a mouse skull, grew them in the laboratory, and then exposed them to a galectin protein called galectin-8. This made the osteoblasts release a protein called RANKL, which is known to boost osteoclast activity. When osteoblasts that had been exposed to galectin-8 were grown alongside bone marrow stem cells, more of the stem cells developed into the bone-destroying osteoclasts.</p><p>Mice that were genetically engineered to produce more galectin-8 than normal mice develop brittle bones, despite also creating new bone at a higher rate than do normal mice. This is because osteoclast activity increases at a greater rate, resulting in an overall loss of bone in these animals. This is similar to what occurs in some individuals with osteoporosis. These experiments therefore suggest that galectin-8 plays an important role in bone remodeling and that it may be a potential target for drugs that treat diseases that weaken bones.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05914.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05914.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>animal lectin</kwd><kwd>osteoclastogenesis</kwd><kwd>bone mass</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Women Health</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zick</surname><given-names>Yehiel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001658</institution-id><institution>Minerva Foundation (Minerva Stiftung)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>711425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zick</surname><given-names>Yehiel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation (ISF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>776/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zick</surname><given-names>Yehiel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The secreted sugar-binding protein galectin-8 causes osteoblasts to secrete factors that promote the differentiation of bone marrow cells into osteoclasts; targeting this protein could therefore potentially help treat diseases associated with excessive bone loss.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone is a dynamic tissue that constantly undergoes remodeling by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eriksen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakahama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raggatt and Partridge, 2010</xref>). In a rapidly growing and mature mammals, bone remodeling is positive or balanced, respectively, allowing for bone mass accrual and later for its maintenance. Negatively balanced bone remodeling is a hallmark of pathologies such as osteoporosis and cancerous osteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kozlow and Guise, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novack and Teitelbaum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sturge et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Skeletal tissues are composed largely of extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibrillar ECM proteins, predominately type I collagen in bone and type II collagen in cartilage, provide structural integrity and account for mechanical strength. The ECM of bone also contains matricellular proteins that primarily serve as biological modulators. Matricellular proteins interact with cell-surface receptors, such as integrins, the structural matrix, and soluble extracellular factors including growth factors and proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bornstein and Sage, 2002</xref>). Through these multiple interactions, matricellular proteins modulate cell function and regulate the availability and activity of proteins sequestered in the matrix. Therefore, matricellular proteins contribute to skeletal development, homeostasis, and fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alford and Hankenson, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Galectins are a family of glycan-binding proteins secreted by a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boscher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Lella et al., 2011</xref>). As such, they can act as biological cross-linkers for ECM proteins and cell-surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elola et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, certain galectins were reported to function as matricellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Troncoso et al., 2014</xref>). The minimal structures recognized by these lectins are Î²-galactosides displayed on the cell surface as part of more complex glycoconjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Lella et al., 2011</xref>). The prototype galectins (galectin-1, -2, -5, -7, -10, -11, -13, -14, and -15) exist as monomers or homodimers of one carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The tandem-repeat-type galectins (galectin-4, -6, -8, -9, and -12) harbor two distinct CRDs joined by a peptide linker. The chimera-type galectin-3 consists of a CRD connected to a polypeptide that can pentamerize upon binding to glycan ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rabinovich and Vidal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thiemann and Baum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ledeen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Being secreted proteins, as well as proteins having intracellular roles, galectins affect a wide range of biological functions including regulation of cell adhesion, migration, cell growth, apoptosis, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rabinovich and Vidal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thiemann and Baum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thurston et al., 2012</xref>). Still, regulation of bone physiology by galectins has been addressed only to a limited extent. Galectin-9 has been shown to induce osteoblast differentiation initiated by coupling of CD44 to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanikawa et al., 2010</xref>), whereas GC-1 and GC-8, the chicken orthologs of galectin-1 and galectin-8, respectively, were shown to mediate the formation and patterning of pre-cartilage mesenchymal condensations in the developing limb of chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhat et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To study the possible role of galectins as regulators of bone physiology, we focused upon galectin-8 (gal-8), initially cloned in our laboratory, which is a tandem-repeat-type galectin having two sugar-binding domains joined by a linker peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadari et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levy et al., 2006</xref>). Upon secretion, galectin-8 is equipotent to fibronectin in promoting cell adhesion by ligation and clustering of a selective subset of cell-surface integrins and ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hadari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eshkar Sebban et al., 2007</xref>). Complex formation between galectin-8 and integrins triggers integrin-mediated signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2003</xref>) that affect cell growth, receptor trafficking, and metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boura-Halfon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbel-Goren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reticker-Flynn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that galectin-8 regulates bone mass by inducing the secretion of the osteoclastogenic factor, receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanada et al., 2010</xref>), from isolated osteoblasts in a cell autonomous manner. As a result, co-culture of galectin-8-treated osteoblasts with bone marrow cells increases their differentiation into active osteoclasts. These effects involve the binding of galectin-8 to the osteoblasts' urokinase plasminogen-activated receptor (uPAR); mannose receptor C, type 2 (MRC2); and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and seem to be of physiological relevance because galectin-8 transgenic animals exhibit increased expression of RANKL, increased osteoclastogenic activity, and enhanced bone turnover that culminates in reduced bone mass. These data identify galectin-8 as a potential drug target for the prevention of diseases associated with excessive bone loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of galectin-8 on cultured osteoblasts</title><p>To study the effects of galectin-8 on osteoblasts in culture, osteoblasts derived from calvaria of newborn CD1 mice were incubated with 50 nM galectin-8. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, such treatment increased by sixfold the expression of RANKL in these cells by 4 hr and resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in secretion of soluble RANKL into the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) by 24 hr. Extended incubation with galectin-8, up to 6 days maintained the high levels of expression of RANKL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Galectin-8 also had a moderate (30%) inhibitory effect on the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a neutralizing decoy receptor of RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eriksen, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a result, there was an overall 10-fold decrease in the ratio of OPG/RANKL transcription in galectin-8-treated osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We could therefore conclude that galectin-8 increases the RANKL/OPG ratio in osteoblasts in a cell autonomous manner. We have previously shown that galectin-8 is secreted and localizes to the extracellular surface of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hadari et al., 2000</xref>). To determine whether galectin-8, secreted from osteoblasts, exerts similar effects, the expression of this lectin in osteoblasts was silenced using siRNA. As a result, a reduction of 87% in the expression levels of galectin-8 was accompanied by a significant reduction of 33% in the expression levels of RANKL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We could therefore conclude that galectin-8 derived from osteoblasts can mediate RANKL expression, along with other stimuli that induce RANKL.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05914.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of galectin-8 on RANKL and OPG expression in osteoblasts.</title><p>Osteoblasts derived from calvaria of newborn mice were treated with 50 nM of galectin-8 for 4 hr (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>D</bold>); 24 hr (<bold>B</bold>); or for the indicated times (<bold>C</bold>).

This surface-bound galectin-8 could be partially displaced by thiodigalactoside (TDG), which blocks lectinâcarbohydrate interactions, but not by sucrose, suggesting that surface binding of secreted galectin-8 is mediated, at least in part, through proteinâcarbohydrate interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effects of galectin-8 on RANKL expression in osteoblasts vs osteocytes</title><p>Recent studies have implicated matrix-embedded osteocytes, rather than osteoblasts, in the control of osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>).

For this purpose, bone marrow cells were co-cultured with osteoblasts derived from calvaria of newborn mice. We could demonstrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) that galectin-8, added to this co-culture, was equipotent to the osteoclastogenic factor PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suda et al., 2004</xref>) in the induction of a â¼15-fold increase in osteoclast differentiation, as evident by the appearance of multinucleated TRAP<sup>+</sup> cells. The effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> and galectin-8 were additive to a certain extent, suggesting that they might act by somewhat different mechanisms. Very few differentiated osteoclasts appeared in untreated co-cultures. Furthermore, galectin-8 had no direct differentiation effect on osteoclasts, as addition of this lectin to naive bone marrow cells in the absence of osteoblasts did not result in osteoclasts differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To verify that RANKL indeed mediates the effects of galectin-8 on osteoclasts differentiation, its expression was silenced using siRNAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, RANKL-siRNAs reduced its transcription in osteoblasts by 50%, and this was accompanied by a similar 50% reduction in the ability of galectin-8 to induce osteoclastogenesis in co-culture experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Given that RANKL is both necessary and sufficient for osteoclast differentiation, provided that permissive concentrations of MCSF are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eghbali-Fatourechi et al., 2003</xref>), and given that galectin-8 does not affect the expression of MCSF, our findings strongly suggest that RANKL mediates the potentiating effects of galectin-8 on bone resorption.</p><p>Galectins are secreted by atypical secretory pathway from different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boscher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Lella et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, a number of cell types could serve as a source for the secreted galectin-8 that induces RANKL expression by osteoblasts. We have shown that silencing of galectin-8 expression in osteoblasts partially inhibits the expression of RANKL, suggesting that galectin-8, secreted from these cells, could act in an autocrine fashion to induce RANKL expression. However, we could also show that galectin-8 is present on the surface of bone marrow cells, turning these cells into additional potential source for galectin-8 that affects osteoblasts. Further studies will be required to resolve this complex issue.</p><p>At the molecular level, galectin-8 binds at the cell surface of osteoblasts to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grey et al., 2004</xref>) and the mannose receptor C, type 2 (MRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engelholm et al., 2009</xref>) that negatively and positively regulate galectin-8 function, respectively. LRP1 and MRC2 are part of a multi-protein complex that includes uPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrendt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). Indeed, we could demonstrate that uPAR co-precipitates with galectin-8 and that partial silencing the expression of uPAR attenuates the ability of galectin-8 to promote RANKL transcription; findings that conform with the observation that uPAR-deficient mice have increased bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furlan et al., 2007</xref>). uPAR localizes to integrin-containing adhesion complexes, and co-immunoprecipitates with integrins and integrin-associated signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family kinases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). In particular, it modulates the affinity of Î²<sub>1</sub>, Î²<sub>2</sub>, and Î²<sub>3</sub> integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wei et al., 1996</xref>) for their corresponding matrix ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>), and does it, in part, through binding to vitronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith and Marshall, 2010</xref>). Integrins, including Î±<sub>1</sub>, Î±M, Î±<sub>3</sub>Î²<sub>1</sub>, and Î±<sub>6</sub>Î²<sub>1</sub>, as well as ECM proteins, also serve as binding partners to galectin-8 that functions as a matricellular protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hadari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">CÃ¡rcamo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Troncoso et al., 2014</xref>). Complex formation between galectin-8 and integrins triggers integrin-mediated signaling cascades such as Tyr phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, and a robust and sustained activation of the ERK and PI3K pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2003</xref>). Hence, interaction of galectin-8 with a complex of the uPAR/LRP1/MRC2 that binds integrins could be the mechanism underlying RANKL transcription in osteoblasts treated with this lectin. This model is further supported by the fact that integrins promote RANKL transcription through the activation of FAK in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakayamada et al., 2003</xref>). Phosphorylated FAK activates several transduction molecules including Src and Grb2, which activate the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwartz and Ginsberg, 2002</xref>). Indeed, activation of the ERK pathway in osteoblasts is obligatory for the action of galectin-8 as an inducer of osteoclastogenesis, implicating this signaling pathway as being the major pathway activated downstream of galectin-8. In contrast, the PI3K pathway appears not to play a role in the induction of RANKL in response to galectin-8, while having a partial role in mediating osteoclastogenesis. These findings place the PI3K pathway as acting downstream or independent of RANKL transcription in mediating the effects of galectin-8 on osteoclastogenesis.</p><p>The mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of LRP1 on RANKL transcription in response to galectin-8 is presently unknown. LRP1, which also directly interacts with uPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonias et al., 2011</xref>), could, for example, facilitate the endocytosis of uPAR, which was the first cell-signaling receptor identified as a member of the LRP1-regulated plasma membrane proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaultier et al., 2006</xref>). Because LRP1 down-regulates cell-surface uPAR by facilitating its endocytosis, uPAR-initiated cell signaling may be inhibited by LRP1. Although galectin-8 can potentially bind to receptors that both negatively (LRP1) and positively (MRC2 and uPAR) regulate RANKL expression, the net effect is still an increase in RANKL expression and reduction in bone mass, which could be attributed, for example, to different expression levels of these receptors in osteoblasts. Alternatively, the duration of the signals emitted by these receptors could differ.</p><p>Osteoblastic cells are considered as the major cell type that expresses RANKL to support osteoclastogenesis; however, recent findings suggest that osteocytes are the main regulators of bone homeostasis through RANKL expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings reveal that galectin-8 affects RANKL expression in osteoblasts-enriched fractions of calvariae as well as in osteocyte-enriched fraction. These findings support the hypothesis that galectin-8 acts both on osteoblasts and osteocytes, at least in culture, and still, we cannot rule out the possibility that it induces RANKL expression in vivo selectively in osteocytes.</p><p>The increased expression of RANKL in gal-8 transgenic animals enhances their osteoclasts differentiation and results in a reduction in their BMD and bone volume fraction (BVF), thus supporting the notion galectin-8 could induce a physiological bone loss. Of interest, dynamic histomorphometry revealed active bone remodeling, associated with increased rate of bone formation in gal-8 Tg mice. The increase in bone turnover could be attributed to the enhanced osteoclastogenic activity induced by galectin-8 that subsequently promotes osteoblasts differentiation and increased BFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and McDonald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonucci and Ballanti, 2014</xref>). Still, the net effect is bone loss due to the overall greater activity of the osteoclasts. In this respect, our model of Tg mice resembles in certain aspects the changes in bone turnover that take place during postmenopausal osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raisz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and McDonald, 2011</xref>). It is well established that both bone resorption and BFRs are increased during postmenopausal osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raisz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng and McDonald, 2011</xref>); however, the extent of increased bone resorption exceeds that of augmented bone formation, which causes an imbalance in favor of bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arlot et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebeling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanizawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raisz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eriksen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A number of rodent models for postmenopausal osteoporosis exist (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erlebacher and Derynck, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bucay et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizuno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rinotas et al., 2014</xref>). One is a model of Tg mice that overexpress human RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rinotas et al., 2014</xref>). These mice develop bone loss and increased bone turnover rate, which is similar to the phenotype of gal-8 Tg mice, supporting the notion that galectin-8 mainly acts through increased expression of RANKL in vivo.</p><p>In summary, our findings implicate an animal lectin as a novel regulator of osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling. The unique aspect of these observations stems from the fact that galectin-8, like other secreted animal lectins, binds cell-surface glycoconjugates that enable it to engage in binding to a number of receptors that express the proper repertoire of sugars on their surface. This offers a novel mean for spatially controlled regulation of bone remodeling through high-density information coding that involves lectinâsugar interactions. Our findings place animal lectins, with galectin-8 as their representative, as novel osteoclastogenic agents and regulators of bone remodeling. The phenotype of gal-8 Tg mice, showing enhanced bone turnover and reduced bone mass, supports the conclusion that galectin-8 induces RANKL expression in an in vivo setting. The results reveal a potential link between galectins, LRP1, MRC2, and uPAR in mediating this process of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, insights from this study might inform efforts to develop novel drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with bone loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Commercially available reagents were purchased from the following resources: trypsin-Ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), penicillin, and <sc>l</sc>-glutamine were purchased from Biological Industries (Beit Haemek, Israel).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, one of whom, Toshio Kukita, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers and the editors concurred that your work represents a novel demonstration of the effects of galectin-8 on osteoclastogenesis, with the finding that galectin-8 exhibits both positive (MRC-2 and uPAR) and negative (LRP1) regulation. The reported effects could be significant for further advancing our understanding of bone metabolism.</p><p>Major concerns raised and suggestions for revision:</p><p>1) The authors should explicitly address the observation that, while galectin-8 binds to receptors that both negatively and positively regulate osteoclastogenesis, the net effect in galectin-8 transgenic mouse is the loss of bone mass.</p><p>2) Galectins are present in the cytosol, nucleus and the extracellular space, and they can bind to many cell types. For galectins present in the extracellular space, it is not clear whether they function as suggested by using recombinant protein added to single cell types. It is thus critical to demonstrate the function of endogenous galectins.</p><p>3) A key question for understanding the results of this work is whether galectin-8 is expressed in the bone marrow and whether it is secreted and thus present on the cell surfaces. The authors should determine whether galectin-8 could be eluted by treatment with lactose (and not control saccharides).</p><p>4) If the answer to question #3 is negative, the question is whether the described effects of galectin-8 can in fact occur naturally. If so, the authors need to demonstrate the function of endogenous galectin-8 by using relevant cells with galectin-8 expression knocked down or using cells from galectin-8 knockout mice. The use of transgenic mice overexpressing galectin-8 might be problematic, as it represents an artificial situation with the amounts of galectin-8 released into the environment that might not be reached in wild-type mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05914.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors should explicitly address the observation that, while galectin-8 binds to receptors that both negatively and positively regulate osteoclastogenesis, the net effect in galectin-8 transgenic mouse is the loss of bone mass</italic>.</p><p>Although galectin-8 can bind to receptors that either negatively (LRP1) or positively (MRC2 and uPAR) regulate RANKL expression, the net effect is still an increase in RANKL expression and reduction in bone mass. This could be attributed, for example, to different expression levels of these receptors in osteoblasts. Alternatively, the duration of the signals emitted by these receptors could differ. We have addressed this point in the Discussion (âAlthough galectin-8 can potentially bind to receptors [â¦] the signals emitted by these receptors could differâ).</p><p><italic>2) Galectins are present in the cytosol, nucleus and the extracellular space, and they can bind to many cell types. For galectins present in the extracellular space, it is not clear whether they function as suggested by using recombinant protein added to single cell types. It is thus critical to demonstrate the function of endogenous galectins</italic>.</p><p>Galectins are secreted by atypical secretory pathway from different cell types. Therefore, a number of cell types could serve as a source for the secreted galectin-8 that induces RANKL expression by osteoblasts. In experiments aimed to address this question we have now shown that silencing of galectin-8 expression in osteoblasts partially inhibits the expression of RANKL, suggesting that galectin-8, secreted from these cells, could act in an autocrine fashion to induce RANKL expression, along with other stimuli that promote expression of RANKL (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we could show that galectin-8 is present on the surface of bone marrow cells, turning these cells as well into a potential source for secreted galectin-8 that affects osteoblasts (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings are also addressed in the Discussion (âGalectins are secreted by atypical secretory pathway [â¦] will be required to resolve this complex issueâ).</p><p><italic>3) A key question for understanding the results of this work is whether galectin-8 is expressed in the bone marrow and whether it is secreted and thus present on the cell surfaces. The authors should determine whether galectin-8 could be eluted by treatment with lactose (and not control saccharides)</italic>.</p><p>This point was addressed using FACS analysis, with the results added as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>. We found that galectin-8 is indeed expressed on the surface of bone marrow cells, and can be partially displaced from their surface by TDG, but not by sucrose. We further addressed this point in the first paragraphs of the Results and Discussion sections. This issue was also addressed in the previous paragraph.</p><p><italic>4) If the answer to question #3 is negative, the question is whether the described effects of galectin-8 can in fact occur naturally. If so, the authors need to demonstrate the function of endogenous galectin-8 by using relevant cells with galectin-8 expression knocked down or using cells from galectin-8 knockout mice. The use of transgenic mice overexpressing galectin-8 might be problematic, as it represents an artificial situation with the amounts of galectin-8 released into the environment that might not be reached in wild-type mice</italic>.</p><p>The answer to question #3 was positive, nonetheless, we added the results of experiments done with cells where the expression of galectin-8 was silenced by siRNAs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) as mentioned above (question #2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
