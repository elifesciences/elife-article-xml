The eight known ASAR lncRNAs remain closely associated with their parent chromosomes. Analysis of RNA-protein interaction data (from ENCODE) revealed numerous RBPs with significant interactions with multiple ASAR lncRNAs, with several hnRNPs as abundant interactors. An ~7 kb domain within the <italic>ASAR6-141</italic> lncRNA shows a striking density of RBP interaction sites. Genetic deletion and ectopic integration assays indicate that this ~7 kb RNA binding protein domain contains functional sequences for controlling replication timing of entire chromosomes in cis. shRNA-mediated depletion of 10 different RNA binding proteins, including HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, or HNRNPUL1, results in dissociation of ASAR lncRNAs from their chromosome territories, and disrupts the synchronous replication that occurs on all autosome pairs, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale. Our results further demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and we propose that ASARs function as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of hnRNP complexes that help maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Replication</kwd><kwd>RNA binding</kwd><kwd>chromosome</kwd><kwd>long non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>ASAR</kwd><kwd>XIST</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thayer</surname><given-names>Mathew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM130703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thayer</surname><given-names>Mathew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular genetic analyses of ASARs reveals regulation of large-scale mammalian chromosome structure and function that includes long non-coding RNAs and nuclear RNA binding proteins as essential regulators of chromosome dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vast majority of mammalian DNA replicates in homologous regions of chromosome pairs in a highly synchronous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dileep and Gilbert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivera-Mulia et al., 2018</xref>). However, genetic disruption of non-protein coding ASAR (‘<italic>AS</italic>ynchronous replication and <italic>A</italic>utosomal <italic>R</italic>NA’) loci causes a delay in replication timing on individual human chromosomes in cis, resulting in highly asynchronous replication between pairs of autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heskett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoffregen et al., 2011</xref>). There are eight genetically validated ASARs that are located on human chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 9, and 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heskett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoffregen et al., 2011</xref>). All of the known ASAR lncRNAs share several distinctive characteristics, including: (1) contiguously transcribed regions of &gt;180 kb, (2) epigenetically regulated allelic expression imbalance (AEI; including mono-allelic expression); (3) variable epigenetic replication timing (VERT; including asynchronous replication timing); (4) high density of LINE1 (L1) sequences (&gt;30%); and (5) retention of the RNA within their parent chromosome territory. Recently, we used these notable characteristics to identify 68 ASAR candidates on every human autosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heskett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In addition to genetic disruption assays, ectopic integration of ASAR transgenes into mouse chromosomes has been used as a second functional assay to help define the critical sequences within ASAR lncRNAs that control chromosome-wide replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>). For example, <italic>ASAR6</italic> lncRNA expressed from transgenes, ranging in size from an ~180 kb BAC transgene to PCR products (as small as ~3 kb) containing the critical sequences, remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>). These same transgenes cause delayed replication timing (DRT) and delayed mitotic condensation (DMC) of entire chromosomes in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ASAR6</italic> lncRNA was found to control chromosome-wide replication timing using oligonucleotide-mediated RNA degradation of <italic>ASAR6</italic> lncRNA that was expressed from a BAC transgene integrated into mouse chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that ASARs represent ubiquitous, essential, <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that control mammalian chromosome replication timing via expression of chromosome associated RNAs. In this report, we identify RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are critical for ASAR lncRNA localization and function.</p><p>Chromosome-associated long non-coding RNAs are known to be important for numerous aspects of chromosome dynamics in diverse eukaryotes from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faber and Vo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nozawa and Gilbert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creamer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Menon and Meller, 2015</xref>). The mammalian nucleus is rich in heterogenous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), which represents &gt;95% of the total RNA Polymerase II output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nozawa and Gilbert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">St Laurent et al., 2012</xref>). The vast majority of hnRNA is poorly defined, has been referred to as the ‘Dark Matter’ of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">St Laurent et al., 2012</xref>), and includes spliced and unspliced intronic sequences, circular RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kristensen et al., 2019</xref>), very long intergenic non-coding RNAs (vlincRNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">St Laurent et al., 2016</xref>), as well as poorly defined RNAs that include chromatin associated RNAs (caRNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nozawa et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>rep</italic>eat-rich RNAs (repRNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank and Rippe, 2020</xref>) that can be detected by C0T-1 DNA (which is comprised primarily of LINE and SINE repetitive sequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creamer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolpa et al., 2022</xref>). Some of these nuclear RNAs comprise abundant species, yet lack clearly defined functions, while others are thought to be the by-products of other nuclear processes and have been collectively called ‘RNA debris’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nozawa and Gilbert, 2019</xref>). The relationship between ASAR lncRNAs and these other chromosome-associated RNAs remains poorly defined.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that long nascent transcripts that are detected by C0T-1 DNA play a dynamic structural role that promotes the open architecture of active chromosome territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creamer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). The RNA species detected by C0T-1 DNA are predominantly L1 sequences, and these L1 RNAs remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). A link between C0T-1 RNA and ASAR lncRNAs is suggested by the observation that ASAR lncRNAs contain a high L1 content and remain associated with their parent chromosome territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heskett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoffregen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, deletion and ectopic integration assays demonstrated that the critical sequences for controlling chromosome-wide replication timing within <italic>ASAR6</italic> and <italic>ASAR15</italic> map to the antisense strand of L1 sequences located within the <italic>ASAR6</italic> and <italic>ASAR15</italic> lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>). In this report we found that human C0T-1 DNA can detect the chromosome territory localization of <italic>ASAR6</italic> lncRNA that is expressed from a BAC transgene integrated into a mouse chromosome, indicating that at least some of the RNA species detected by C0T-1 DNA represents ASAR lncRNA.</p><p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) represent a large family of abundant RBPs that contribute to multiple aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. Many of the proteins that are in hnRNP complexes share general features, but differ in domain composition and functional properties (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geuens et al., 2016</xref>). The functions of hnRNPs vary according to their subcellular localization. Most of the hnRNPs possess conventional nuclear localization signals and are predominantly present in the nucleus during steady state, where they function in various RNA metabolic processes including transcription, splicing, nuclear export, and 3’ end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geuens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domanski et al., 2022</xref>), and more recently have been implicated in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Connolly et al., 2022</xref>). A direct connection between chromosome territory associated C0T-1 RNA and hnRNPs was established by the observation that siRNA mediated depletion, or forced expression of dominant interfering mutants, of <italic>HNRNPU</italic> results in dissociation of C0T-1 RNA from chromosome territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creamer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolpa et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, recent studies have proposed that abundant nuclear proteins such as HNRNPU nonspecifically interact with ‘RNA debris’ that creates a dynamic nuclear mesh that regulates interphase chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nozawa and Gilbert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nozawa et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we used publicly available enhanced Cross Link Immuno-Precipitation (eCLIP) data from ENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2020</xref>) to identify RBPs, including HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, and HNRNPUL1, that interact with the known ASAR lncRNAs. We also found that an ~7 kb region within the ~185 kb <italic>ASAR6-141</italic> lncRNA has a surprisingly high density of interacting RBPs, and that genetic deletion of this ~7 kb ‘RBP domain’ from the endogenous <italic>ASAR6-141</italic> locus results in a delayed replication timing phenotype that is comparable to deletion of the entire ~185 kb <italic>ASAR6-141</italic> transcribed region located on human chromosome 6. In addition, ectopic integration of transgenes, expressing the ~7 kb RBP domain, into autosomes or into the inactive X chromosome results in retention of the RNA within the chromosome territory of the integrated chromosomes, and results in DRT/DMC, and chromosome structure instability in cis. Taken together, these results indicate that the ~7 kb RBP domain represents a critical region within <italic>ASAR6-141</italic> that controls replication timing of human chromosome 6.</p><p>Because ASARs were identified as <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements that control chromosome-wide replication timing, we tested if ASAR associated RBPs also control replication timing. We found that shRNA mediated depletion of 9 different ASAR-associated RBPs (HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HLTF, KHSRP, or UCHL5) dramatically altered the normally synchronous replication timing program of all autosome pairs, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale. These results demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and suggests that ASAR lncRNAs serve as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of multiple hnRNP/RBP complexes that function to maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All of the eight genetically validated ASARs are subject to AEI and express lncRNAs that remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heskett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoffregen et al., 2011</xref>).

In addition, the HTD114 cells contain a centromeric polymorphism on chromosome 6, which allows for an unambiguous distinction between the two chromosome 6 homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoffregen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For simplicity, we refer to the chromosome 6 with the larger centromere as CHR6A and to the chromosome 6 with the smaller centromere as CHR6B. From our previous studies we knew that the chromosome 6 with the smaller centromere is linked to the expressed allele of <italic>ASAR6-141</italic> <sup>5</sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> shows the replication timing analysis on a mitotic cell where the ~7 kb RBPD was deleted from the expressed allele (CHR6B).

Quantification of the BrdU incorporation in CHR6B and CHR6A in multiple cells indicated that deletion of the ~7 kb RBPD from the expressed allele resulted in a significant delay in replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is in contrast to cells prior to deletion, or in cells containing a deletion of the ~7 kb RBPD from the silent allele (CHR6A), where the BrdU incorporation is comparable between CHR6A and CHR6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, an asynchronous replication pattern was also present in cells with homozygous deletions of the 7 kb RBPD, with CHR6B representing the later replicating allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

In this report, we used publicly available RNA-protein interaction data from ENCODE to identify RBPs that interact with multiple ASAR lncRNAs. One unanticipated observation that came from this analysis was that an ~7 kb domain within the ~185 kb <italic>ASAR6-141</italic> lncRNA contained virtually all of the significant peaks of RBP interactions in two different cell lines. Using genetic deletion and ectopic integration assays we found that this ~7 kb RBPD contains functional sequences for controlling replication timing of entire chromosomes in cis. We also found that shRNA-mediated depletion of 9 different ASAR-associated RBPs results in loss of the chromosome territory association of multiple ASAR RNAs. In addition, we found that depletion of HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HLTF, KHSRP, or UCHL5 alters the normally synchronous replication timing that occurs between pairs of homologous chromosomes resulting in the DRT/DMC phenotype, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that C0T-1 RNA plays a dynamic structural role that promotes the open architecture of active chromosome territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creamer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). C0T-1 RNA is predominantly L1 sequences, and these L1 RNAs remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). Additional studies have proposed that repRNA is an important regulator of the dynamic organization of genomic loci into membrane-less subcompartments with distinct nuclear functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank and Rippe, 2020</xref>). Other studies have proposed that HNRNPU nonspecifically interacts with ‘RNA debris’ to create a dynamic nuclear mesh that regulates interphase chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nozawa and Gilbert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nozawa et al., 2017</xref>). One important distinction that can be made between ASAR RNAs and these other hnRNAs (i.e. C0T-1 RNA, repRNA, caRNA, and ‘RNA debris’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nozawa and Gilbert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creamer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nozawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank and Rippe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolpa et al., 2022</xref>) is that ASARs have been defined genetically, and these other RNAs have not. Thus, we have used both loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays to define the roles that ASARs play in chromosome dynamics, which includes control of chromosome-wide replication timing and mitotic chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heskett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoffregen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donley et al., 2013</xref>). We also found that C0T-1 DNA, when used as an RNA FISH probe, can detect <italic>ASAR6</italic> RNA that is expressed and localized to an individual chromosome territory, indicating that at least some of the RNA FISH signal detected by C0T-1 DNA represents ASAR RNA. Given our recent discovery of ASAR RNAs expressed from every autosome, and encoded by ~3% of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>), we propose that ASAR RNAs represent functional ‘chromosome associated RNA’ species that control chromosome dynamics within mammalian nuclei. Whether or not there are nuclear functions of other chromosome associated hnRNAs that are independent of ASARs will require genetic and/or functional validation.</p><p>Here we identified several hnRNPs (HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, and HNRNPUL1) as important interaction partners for the chromosome territory localization of multiple ASAR RNAs. In addition, we found that the SWI/SNF related transcription factor HLTF, which was recently shown to regulate replication fork reversal, prevent alternative mechanisms of stress-resistant DNA replication, and mediates cellular resistance to replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2020</xref>,) is required for the chromosome territory localization of multiple ASAR RNAs and for the synchronous replication of every autosome pair. Furthermore, we found that the KH domain (HNRNP<underline>K H</underline>omology domain) containing protein KHSRP, and the ubiquitin hydrolase UCHL5 also contribute to the chromosome territory localization of ASAR RNAs. We found that depletion of HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HLTF, KHSRP, or UCHL5 proteins resulted in a dramatic genome-wide disruption of the normally synchronous replication timing program on all autosome pairs. Taken together our results indicate that the association of ASAR RNAs with multiple hnRNPs in combination with other nuclear RBPs is an essential step in the regulation of the synchronous replication timing program on mammalian chromosomes.</p><p>While these studies have demonstrated a role for multiple RBPs in genome-wide chromosome replication timing, one limitation of these studies is that we only tested 14 out of the ~100 RBPs shown by eCLIP to associate with multiple ASAR RNAs. It is likely that additional insights into the network of RBP/ASAR interactions could be gained by extending our replication timing analyses to knockdowns of additional RBPs. Another limitation of these studies is that all of the RBPs implicated in control of replication timing are known to play various roles in other essential nucleic acid metabolic pathways, including transcription, splicing, mRNA export, and RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geuens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domanski et al., 2022</xref>.) It is possible that knocking down these RBPs has an indirect effect on replication related to these other functions of the RBPs, rather than a direct effect on ASAR function. However, the RBP knockdowns that disrupt genome-wide synchronous replication also disrupt chromosome association of multiple ASAR RNAs. Our previous work demonstrated that the ability of an ectopically integrated <italic>ASAR6</italic> transgene to cause delayed replication timing of a mouse chromosome required the ASAR6 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt et al., 2018</xref>.) Hence, we expect that displacement of ASAR RNA from chromosome territories upon RBP knockdown is a primary cause of the genome-wide replication timing asynchrony, regardless of whether the displacement of ASAR RNA from the chromosome is a direct or indirect effect of RBP knockdown. A final limitation of these studies is that the precise mechanism by which ASARs and RBPs interact to control replication timing remains unknown. One intriguing possibility that is consistent with our data is that the ASAR RNAs serve as scaffolds for the assembly of extensive RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes that form a chromosome-tethered liquid-liquid phase that facilitates the recruitment of the requisite chromatin modifiers and DNA replication machinery. In support of this notion, HNRNPA1 and HNRNPC are components of the 40 S hnRNP particle, which forms a nuclear biomolecular condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domanski et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, HNRNPU and HNRNPUL1 interact with each of the 40 S hnRNP particle subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Britton et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting the possibility of extensive protein-protein interactions. ASAR RNAs normally remain associated exclusively with the chromosome territory from which they are transcribed, and ASAR RNAs on different chromosomes remain separate. RBP knockdowns that disrupt synchronous replication timing also release ASAR RNAs from their chromosome territories, allowing colocalization of ASAR RNAs from different chromosomes (i.e. <italic>ASAR6</italic> and <italic>ASAR1-187</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O–Q</xref>), often in nuclear and/or cytoplasmic foci reminiscent of the mixing of liquid-liquid phases. Additional support for this model is the observation that Xist RNA participates in the assembly of a nuclear heteromeric condensate essential for gene silencing on the inactive X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pandya-Jones et al., 2020</xref>). It is worth noting that ectopic integration of Xist transgenes has been a useful assay for characterization of Xist functions, including the ability to delay replication timing and induce gene silencing on autosomes (reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Minks and Brown, 2009</xref>). Thus, our observation that the ~7 kb RBPD RNA induces DRT/DMC on the inactive X chromosome, and associates with the <italic>Xist</italic> RNA cloud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), suggests that the ~7 kb RBPD RNA interferes with Xist RNA function within the heteromeric condensate. One intriguing observation, which is largely ignored by the X inactivation field, is that deletion of the Xist gene on either the active or inactive X chromosomes results in delayed replication timing of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diaz-Perez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diaz-Perez et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, loss of function mutations of either ASARs or <italic>Xist</italic> result in a similar chromosome-wide delayed replication timing phenotype. These parallels between ASAR and <italic>Xist</italic> mutation phenotypes suggest a shared mechanism for controlling replication timing in cis.</p><p>The formation of liquid-liquid phases via ASAR RNA-RBP interactions is speculative at this point and remains to be tested directly. A full understanding of the mechanisms by which ASARs control chromosome replication timing will require an extensive biochemical and biophysical characterization of the ASAR RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes and how they interact with the DNA replication machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Chromosomal DNA on the slides was denatured at 75 °C for 3 minutes in 70% formamide/2XSSC, followed by dehydration in an ice-cold ethanol series and allowed to air dry. BAC and Fosmid DNAs were labeled using nick translation (Vysis, Abbott Laboratories) with Spectrum Orange-dUTP, Spectrum Aqua-dUTP or Spectrum Green-dUTP (Vysis). Final probe concentrations varied from 40 to 60 ng/µl. Centromeric probe cocktails (Vysis) and/or whole chromosome paint probes (Metasystems) plus BAC or Fosmid DNAs were denatured at 75 °C for 10 minutes and prehybridized at 37 °C for 10 minutes. Probes were applied to denatured slides and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

Mitotic chromosome spreads were prepared and DNA FISH was performed as described above. The incorporated BrdU was then detected using a FITC-labeled anti-BrdU antibody (Roche). Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold antifade plus DAPI (Invitrogen), and viewed under UV fluorescence. All images were captured with an Olympus BX Fluorescent Microscope using a 100 X objective, automatic filter-wheel and Cytovision workstation. Individual chromosomes were identified with either chromosome-specific paints, centromeric probes, BACs or by inverted DAPI staining. Utilizing the Cytovision workstation, each chromosome was isolated from the metaphase spread and a line drawn along the middle of the entire length of the chromosome. The Cytovision software was used to calculate the pixel area and intensity along each chromosome for each fluorochrome occupied by the DAPI and BrdU (FITC) signals. The total amount of fluorescent signal in each chromosome was calculated by multiplying the average pixel intensity by the area occupied by those pixels. The BrdU incorporation into human chromosomes containing CRISPR/Cas9 modifications was calculated by dividing the total incorporation into the chromosome with the deleted chromosome divided by the BrdU incorporation into the non-deleted chromosome within the same cell. Boxplots were generated from data collected from 8 to 12 cells per clone or treatment group.

To explore the mechanism of function of ASAR transcripts, they leveraged the ENCODE RNA binding protein eCLIP datasets to show that a 7kb region of ASAR6-141 is bound by multiple hnRNP proteins. Deletion of this 7kb region resulted in delayed chromosome 6 replication. Furthermore, ectopic integration of the ASAR6-141 7kb region into autosomes or the inactive X-chromosome also resulted in delayed chromosome replication.

ASARs are (very) long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that control allelic expression imbalance (e.g.: mono-allelic expression) and replication timing of their resident chromosomes. These relatively novel &quot;genes&quot; have recently been identified on all human autosomes and are of broad significance given their critical importance for basic chromosomal functions and stability. However, the mechanism(s) of ASAR function remain unclear. ASARs exhibit some functional relatedness to Xist RNA, including persistent association of the expressed RNA with its resident chromosome, and similarities in the composition of RNA sequences associated with ASARs, in particular Line1 RNAs. Recent findings that certain hnRNPs control the chromosome territory retention of Cot1-bearing RNAs (which includes Line1) led the authors to test hypothesis that hnRNPs might regulate ASARs.</p><p>Specific new findings in this paper:</p><p>-Analysis of eCLIP (RNA-protein interaction) ENCODE data shows numerous interactions of the ASAR6-141 RNA with RBPs, including hnRNPs (e.g.: HNRNPU) that have been implicated in the retention of RNAs within local chromosome territories.</p><p>-most of these interactions can be mapped to a 7kb region of the 185kb ASAR6-141 RNA</p><p>-deletion of this 7kb region is sufficient to induce the DMC/DRT phenotype associated with deletion of the entire ASAR region</p><p>-ectopic integration into mouse autosomes of the 7kb region is sufficient to cause DMC/DRT of the targeted autosome, and a similar effect upon ectopic integration into inactive X. This raises the question about integration into the active X, which was not mentioned. Is integration into the active X observed? Is it possible that integration might alter Xist expression confounding this interpretation?</p><p>-Knockdown of RBPs that bind the 7kb region causes dissociation of ASAR6-141 RNA from its chromosome territory, and, remarkably, dissociation of Xist RNA from inactive X, and mis-colocalization of the ASAR6-141 and Xist RNAs.

Similar conclusions are restated in lines 138-140. Based on the data presented, it is evident that ASARs localization on chromatin is dependent on hnRNPs. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that ASARs cause the assembly of hnRNP complexes or that these hnRNP complexes are directly responsible for the regulation of chromosome replication. Please revise your claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text as follows: “Our results further demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and we propose that ASARs function as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of hnRNP complexes that help maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the analysis in Figure 1C- F, it is unclear why XIST is used as a comparison to ASAR6-141. A more meaningful control would be to show that hnRNPs preferentially bind ASAR6-141 relative to all expressed transcripts. Also, some panels are missing the y-axis label.</p></disp-quote><p>We have genetically validated 8 different ASAR genes for their role in controlling chromosome-wide replication timing. The only other gene known to control chromosome-wide replication timing is XIST, which also encodes a chromosome-associated lncRNA. Our analysis of publicly available eCLIP data (and previous literature on XIST-binding proteins) showed substantial overlap between RBPs that associate with ASARs and XIST. Hence, we anticipated that at least some RBP knockdowns would affect both lncRNAs, despite their contrasting functions. In addition, we routinely use XIST RNA as a positive control in RNA FISH assays, as the XIST RNA FISH protocol represents a robust and well validated chromosomal RNA FISH procedure.</p><p>y-axis labels have been added to Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2K&amp;L, it would be beneficial to quantify and normalize the BrdU incorporation, as ectopic integration of the sense 7kb region appears to result in overall higher BrdU incorporation in all chromosomes, not just chromosome 5.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two main aspects of the BrdU incorporation assay that we use: (1) The BrdU incorporation banding pattern on each chromosome is unique to that chromosome, and the banding pattern is also representative of the time during S phase when the BrdU incorporation occurred, i.e. we detect a different banding pattern if BrdU is incorporated in early S phase versus late S phase. (2) The amount of BrdU incorporation can be used to measure the synchrony between chromosome homologs, but only within the same cell. Thus, we generate a ratio of BrdU incorporation in chromosome homologs in individual cells, then compare the ratio of incorporation into each chromosome pair in multiple cells (see Figure 2B-E). The overall BrdU incorporation into the chromosomes of different cells is quite variable; however, the banding pattern and ratio of BrdU incorporation in chromosome homologs in individual cells is comparable, unless we have disrupted or ectopically integrated an ASAR. Given the variability in overall BrdU incorporation detected between different cells in the population this is not a useful readout for measuring synchronous versus asynchronous replication between chromosome homologs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) hnRNP protein can regulate multiple aspects of RNA processing other than chromatin retention. Hence, it would be beneficial to rule out an alternative hypothesis as to what the hnRNP knockdowns do to ASAR6-131? For example, assessing changes in RNA levels or splicing upon knockdown of hnRNPs using qPCR?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that direct roles for any of the hnRNP/RBPs that are critical for ASAR RNA localization and replication timing have not been established. However, our findings combined with the observation that cells depleted of HNRNPU show reduced origin licensing in G1, and show reduced origin activation frequency during S phase (PMID: 34888666), supports a role for HNRNPU, either directly or indirectly, in DNA replication. Furthermore, we also found that depletion of the DNA replication fork remodeler HLTF or the deubiquitinase UCHL5 also results in mis-localization of ASAR RNAs, and results in asynchronous replication of every autosome pair, indicating that ASAR RNA mis-localization and asynchronous replication are not simply a phenotype associated with hnRNP depletions. A full mechanistic understanding of the role that ASAR RNAs play in combination with this relatively large and diverse set of hnRNP/RBPs will require a better understanding of the direct roles that each protein, and any higher order complexes that contain these proteins, play in regulating DNA synthesis, splicing, transcription, chromatin structure and/or ASAR RNA localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Both the disruption and ectopic expression of the 7kb region result in delayed chromosome replication. Would one not expect there to be opposing effects on replication timing? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>One puzzling set of observations is that loss of function mutations and gain of function mutations of ASAR genes result in a similar delayed replication timing and delayed mitotic condensation phenotype. We have detected delayed replication timing in human cells following genetic knockouts (loss of function) of eight different ASAR genes located on 5 different autosomes. We have also detected delayed replication timing on mouse chromosomes expressing transgenes (gain of function) from three different ASAR genes (ASAR6, ASAR6-141, and ASAR15). The ASAR transgenes ranged in size from an ~180kb BAC, to an ~3kb PCR product. One possible explanation for these observations is that ectopic integration of ASAR transgenes function in a dominant negative manner by interfering with the endogenous “ASARs” on the integrated chromosomes. Consistent with this possibility is that we recently identified ASAR candidate genes on every human autosome (PMC9588035). Our favored model is that expression of ASAR transgenes integrated into mouse chromosomes disrupts the function of endogenous ASARs by &quot;out-competing&quot; them for shared RBPs. We also point out that a similar ectopic integration assay, using <italic>Xist</italic> transgenes, has been an informative assay for characterization of <italic>Xist</italic> functions, including the ability to delay replication timing and induce gene silencing on autosomes (reviewed in PMID:19898525). One intriguing observation (yet largely ignored by the X inactivation field) is that deletion of the Xist gene on either the active or inactive X chromosomes in somatic cells results in delayed replication timing of the X chromosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1667074/">PMC1667074</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1456779/">PMC1456779</ext-link>). Thus, both loss of function and gain of function mutations of Xist result in a similar delayed replication timing phenotype. Given these parallels between Xist and ASAR gene mutation phenotypes we were curious to test the consequences of ASAR gain of function on the inactive X chromosome. In this manuscript, we integrated the ~7kb ASAR6-141 transgene into the inactive X chromosome, and detected a delayed replication timing phenotype on the integrated X chromosome. We also detected an association between Xist and ASAR RNAs using RNA FISH in interphase cells (Figure 4A and 4B), which supports the observations that ASAR RNAs and XIST RNA are bound by a partially overlapping set of hnRNP/RBPs (Figure 1D-F), and is consistent with the model that ASAR transgenes disrupt function by competition for shared RBPs. Dissecting the roles that the hnRNP/RBPs that interact with both ASAR and XIST RNAs will undoubtably give important insights into both XIST and ASAR function, and how these poorly understood chromosomal phenotypes are generated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor recommendations</p><p>(1) In Figure 1G, it would be informative to show where the LINE-1 element within ASAR6-141 is located to get a sense of what hnRNP proteins bind to it.</p></disp-quote><p>There are numerous LINE-1 elements within the ASAR6-141 gene. The ~7kb RBPD does not contain LINE-1 sequences. Therefore, we did not detect significant hnRNP/RBP eCLIP peaks within LINE-1 sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The rationale for ectopic integration of the 7kb region into the inactive X-chromosome is unclear. Is there something unique about the replication of the inactive X or were you interested in seeing whether the 7kb region could escape X-inactivation?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the parallels between Xist and ASAR gene mutation phenotypes, i.e. loss of function and gain of function result in delayed replication timing (see above), we were curious to test the consequences of ASAR gene gain of function on the inactive X chromosome. One possibility was reversal of X inactivation and a shift to earlier replication timing. However, we detected delayed replication timing on the inactive X, and an enhanced XIST RNA FISH signal that overlapped with the ASAR RNA. This speaks to the comment of Reviewer 2 questioning: &quot;Is it possible that integration might alter Xist expression confounding this interpretation? &quot;. The enhanced XIST RNA FISH signal suggests that the delayed replication of the inactive X is not due to reduced expression of XIST RNA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
