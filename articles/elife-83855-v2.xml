Here, we used single-nucleus sequencing, anatomical reconstructions, and electrophysiology to characterize murine OCNs during postnatal development, in mature animals, and after sound exposure. We identified markers for known medial (MOC) and lateral (LOC) OCN subtypes, and show that they express distinct cohorts of physiologically relevant genes that change over development. In addition, we discovered a neuropeptide-enriched LOC subtype that produces Neuropeptide Y along with other neurotransmitters. Throughout the cochlea, both LOC subtypes extend arborizations over wide frequency domains. Moreover, LOC neuropeptide expression is strongly upregulated days after acoustic trauma, potentially providing a sustained protective signal to the cochlea. OCNs are therefore poised to have diffuse, dynamic effects on early auditory processing over timescales ranging from milliseconds to days.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just as our pupils dilate or shrink depending on the amount of light available to our eyes, our ears adjust their sensitivity based on the sound environment we encounter. Evidence suggests that a group of cells known as olivocochlear neurons (OCNs for short) may be involved in this process. These cells are located in the brainstem but project into the cochlea, the inner ear structure that converts sound waves into the electrical impulses relayed to the brain. OCNs may mediate how sounds are detected and encoded &quot;at the source.&quot;</p><p>Historically, OCNs have been divided into two groups (medial or lateral OCNs) based on different morphologies and roles in hearing. For instance, medial OCNs are thought to protect our ears against loud sounds by sending molecular signals to the inner ear cells that amplify certain auditory signals. However, it remains difficult to disentangle the precise function of the different types of OCNs, in part because scientists still lack markers that would allow them to distinguish between medial and lateral cells simply based on genetic activity.</p><p>Frank et al. aimed to eliminate this bottleneck by identifying which genes were switched on and to what degree in individual mouse medial and lateral OCNs; this was done throughout development and after exposure to loud noises. The experiments uncovered a range of genetic markers for medial and lateral OCNs, showing that these cells switch on different sets of genes relevant to their role over development. This gene expression data also revealed that two distinct groups of lateral OCNs exist, one of which is characterised by the production of large amounts of neuropeptides, a type of chemical messenger that can modulate neural circuit activity.</p><p>Further work in both developing and adult mice showed that this production is shaped by the activity of the cells, with the neuropeptide levels increasing when the animals are exposed to damaging levels of noise. This change lasts for several days, suggesting that such an experience can have long-lasting effects on how the brain provides feedback to the ear.</p><p>Overall, the results by Frank et al. will help to better identify and characterize the different types of OCNs and the role that they have in hearing. By uncovering the chemical messengers that mediate the response to loud noises, this research may contribute to a better understanding of how to prevent or reduce hearing loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>efferent</kwd><kwd>hearing</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC015974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC009223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-DC000091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisz</surname><given-names>Catherine JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011643</institution-id><institution>Blavatnik Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Blavatnik Sensory Disorders Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-DC019009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitko</surname><given-names>Austen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sitko</surname><given-names>Austen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000042</institution-id><institution>Amgen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Summer Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuk</surname><given-names>Mary Caroline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-nucleus sequencing, anatomy, and physiology reveal heterogeneity among olivocochlear neurons (a group of cells that provide feedback to the inner ear), identify a neuropeptide-enriched subtype, and show that neuropeptide expression changes during postnatal development and after sound exposure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All sensory systems are modulated by feedback circuits that dynamically tune sensory information in response to both external experience and internal state.

OCNs express a variety of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eybalin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kitcher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sewell, 2011</xref>) and can even change their neurotransmitter profiles in response to intense sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Niu and Canlon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), making it difficult to identify and catalog cell types. Developmentally and evolutionarily, OCNs are closely related to the facial branchial motor neurons (FMNs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank and Goodrich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fritzsch and Elliott, 2017</xref>). Both populations derive from common motor neuron progenitors and share expression of motor neuron markers such as Islet-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank and Goodrich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fritzsch and Elliott, 2017</xref>), although OCNs are not considered motor neurons. Expression of the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA3 seems to be crucial for specifying an OCN fate, but little else is known about how OCNs and FMNs diverge, or how OCN subtypes differentiate from one another and acquire their specialized attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karis et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, identifying markers that can distinguish OCN subtypes from one another and from neighboring FMNs is critical for understanding the anatomical and molecular logic of OCN connectivity.</p><p>OCNs fall into two major groups: medial olivocochlear neurons (MOCs), which sit in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB), and lateral olivocochlear neurons (LOCs), which are intermingled with afferent principal neurons in the lateral superior olive (LSO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both MOCs and LOCs extend peripheral axons that spiral along the length of the cochlea, often spanning large frequency domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). MOCs terminate mainly on outer hair cells (OHCs), a group of mechanosensory cells that influence cochlear responses to auditory stimuli through rapid, sound-induced cell-body movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">van der Heijden and Vavakou, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashmore, 2019</xref>). It is widely accepted that MOCs affect cochlear gain through inhibitory, cholinergic synapses that reduce OHC motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mountain, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Siegel and Kim, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanchet et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dallos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchs and Lauer, 2019</xref>), much as visual efferent pathways control gain by altering pupil diameter. As well as protecting cochlear circuitry from the impact of acoustic trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Reiter and Liberman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Taranda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Maison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuente, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rajan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tong et al., 2013</xref>), MOCs are thought to contribute to the detection of signals in noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guinan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kawase et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Winslow and Sachs, 1987</xref>) and to tune sensory responses based on states of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Terreros et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Oatman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Oatman, 1971</xref>). Consistent with this range of effects on the perception of sound, electrophysiological characterization suggests that MOCs are controlled both by inputs from the cochlear nucleus and by descending inputs from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Romero and Trussell, 2022</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we know little about the LOCs, as they are difficult to access for recording, stimulation, or surgical ablation. Anatomically, LOCs terminate on the peripheral processes of Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), primary sensory neurons that carry perceptual auditory information from mechanosensory inner hair cells (IHCs) into the brain. Functionally, the nature of communication between LOCs and SGNs remains opaque: although LOCs express acetylcholine, a variety of other signaling molecules have also been reported in these cells, including GABA, CGRP, dopamine, enkephalin, dynorphin, and urocortin (Ucn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eybalin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kitcher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sewell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Safieddine and Eybalin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Safieddine et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Takeda et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1987</xref>). However, definitive evidence for many of these transmitters is lacking. Moreover, indirect activation of the auditory efferent system can elicit both excitatory and inhibitory effects on SGNs, hinting at the possibility of multiple LOC subtypes that can direct distinct effects on their downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groff and Liberman, 2003</xref>). No specific role in hearing has been definitively linked to LOCs, although they have been implicated in sound localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darrow et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Larsen and Liberman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irving et al., 2011</xref>) and appear to protect the ear from noise damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuente, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darrow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kujawa and Liberman, 1997</xref>). The mechanisms underlying this protective effect remain unclear. One promising model holds that dopamine—and potentially other neurotransmitters—released from LOCs inhibits SGN firing, thereby dampening excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ruel et al., 2001</xref>). However, this model has yet to be tested directly, and other, as yet unidentified, pathways may contribute a protective role as well.</p><p>Here, we took a multi-pronged approach to investigate key molecular, anatomical, and physiological features of the auditory efferent system. We found many novel transcriptional features of MOCs and LOCs in both developing and mature OCNs, including cell-type specific markers, genes that could confer distinct physiological properties, and developmental gene-expression changes that highlight pathways involved in OCN maturation. In addition, we found that LOCs cluster into two molecularly and anatomically distinct subtypes based on expression of neuropeptides. However, regardless of the amount of neuropeptide Y in their pre-synaptic puncta, LOCs elaborate axon arborizations that vary extensively and terminate on multiple SGN subtypes. Further, LOCs change their neuropeptide expression profiles upon the onset of hearing and after acoustic trauma, indicating that variability in peptide expression may serve as a way to modulate sensory circuits based on prior experience.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To assess transcriptional variability within OCNs, we sequenced cell nuclei from individual cholinergic neurons, which were labeled using <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> to drive expression of a nuclear-localized GFP (<italic>Rosa26<sup>Sun1-GFP</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mo et al., 2015</xref>). We enriched for OCNs and the closely related FMNs by dissecting a region of the ventral brainstem that includes the SOC as well as facial and trigeminal motor neurons. We then used fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) to isolate dissociated GFP+ cholinergic nuclei and employed the 10x Genomics platform to encapsulate nuclei and generate barcoded single-nucleus libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To examine the maturation of these cell types and identify markers that are expressed consistently across postnatal development, nuclei were collected at two pre-hearing timepoints, postnatal day (P)1 (n=13 animals) and P5 (n=16 animals), the latter of which is an important time of synapse refinement in auditory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank and Goodrich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yu and Goodrich, 2014</xref>). We also collected nuclei at P26–P28 (n=32 animals), when auditory circuitry is grossly mature. After filtering out low-quality cells and infrequently expressed genes (see Materials and methods), our dataset includes 45,828 nuclei: 16,753 cells from P1 animals; 15,542 from P5 animals; and 13,533 cells from P26–P28 animals. Unsupervised, graph-based clustering analysis identified 56 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These clusters primarily consist of neurons, as indicated by the expression of neuronal markers like <italic>Snap25</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Populations of oligodendrocyte precursors, <italic>Mog</italic>-positive oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and astrocytes were also identified based on expression of well-established markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zhang, 2001</xref>). Each neuronal cluster includes cells from all three timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Non-neuronal cells primarily originate from the adult dataset, consistent with prior reports showing an increase in myelination of auditory brainstem neurons and elevated expression of oligodendrocyte markers over the first few postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Long et al., 2018</xref>). Although cell types vary somewhat in the number of genes and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) detected, the structure of the data is not driven by these technical variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Cell types were also similar in the fraction of genes mapping to the mitochondrial genome, suggesting that clusters are not affected by differences in cell health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ilicic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Luecken and Theis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

This finding validates our OCN and FMN clusters and establishes a new OCN-specific marker.</p><p>Despite their early shared origins, FMNs and OCNs express unique combinations of genes encoding transcription factors, adhesion molecules, and other receptors needed for proper neuronal migration, targeting, and synaptic specificity. These differences are particularly prominent at P1 and P5, while OCN axons are still growing to their final targets in the inner ear and before many developmentally salient molecules become downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>).

Consistent with their integration into fundamentally different circuitry, OCNs and FMNs also differ in the expression of molecules relevant to mature function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F, I</xref>). In particular, OCNs express <italic>Gad2</italic>, a gene involved in GABA synthesis, whereas FMNs express the serotonin receptor gene <italic>Htr2c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>).</p><p>Although OCNs share several properties that broadly distinguish them from FMNs, OCNs are themselves heterogeneous, with LOCs and MOCs playing distinct roles in auditory circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guinan, 2018</xref>).

Labeled MOCs show a slight preference for innervating the third row of OHCs, with 21.4% of Syp puncta in row 1, 31.6% in row 2, and 47% in row 3. Additionally, 45% of the reconstructed MOC axons (18/40) have Syp puncta in the inner spiral bundle (ISB), localized among SGN peripheral fibers, either <italic>en passant</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A”</xref>) or, less frequently, at terminal endings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This observation confirms previous reports that a subset of MOC terminal axons innervate SGN processes, although the number of putative pre-synaptic sites within a given MOC axon are somewhat lower than what was identified in EM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robertson and Gummer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hua et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that our approach is reliable and, if anything, may undercount pre-synaptic sites.</p><p>Because the tamoxifen induction approach labeled multiple OCNs in a given animal, we could not reliably associate individual terminal axons to a particular labeled soma in the brainstem. Instead, our analyses consider each terminal axon independently. However, in one animal, a single MOC soma was labeled in the brainstem. We were therefore able to confidently associate multiple terminal axons in the corresponding cochlea to the same MOC cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–E”</xref>). Six terminal fibers stemming from this single MOC innervated discrete patches along a~27 kHz swath of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). Within this one MOC, some (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–A”</xref>), but not all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>), of its terminal fibers contained Syp puncta in the ISB. This suggests that there is not a discrete morphological class of MOCs that makes branches that consistently contact both SGN peripheral fibers and OHCs. Likewise, when considering the entire dataset, there were no significant differences in the frequency of innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) or number of branch points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) between terminal MOC axons that did and did not contain Syp puncta in the ISB.

Cochlear wholemounts from <italic>Ret<sup>CreER</sup>; Igs7<sup>GFP</sup></italic> animals were immunolabeled for GFP to visualize overall OCN axon morphology, NPY to assess peptidergic identity, Syp to identify putative pre-synaptic sites, and CALB2 to label IHCs and identify Type I SGN subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). As with the MOC analysis, we were unable to assign projections to specific LOC neurons, and therefore considered each projection independently. Most of the GFP-labeled LOC axons were located in the middle or base of the cochlea, with axons entering the ISB at frequencies ranging from 18 to 69 kHz. This analysis therefore covers much of the ethologically relevant frequency range in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). NPY distribution was punctate and heterogeneous not just between axons, but also within individual axons, raising the possibility that individual LOC fibers may vary in the signaling molecules released at specific synaptic sites. To assess each LOC axon’s potential to release NPY, we used the surface of the axon to mask the Syp and NPY channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>) and created reconstructions of Syp puncta labeled as either NPY+ or NPY- (open and closed arrowheads, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). We also identified whether each Syp puncta was in contact with CALB2 immunofluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>) to ascertain if either LOC subtype forms selective relationships with Type I SGN subtypes.</p><p>Consistent with the known distribution of Type I SGN subtype peripheral processes along the base of the IHC and the corresponding gradient of CALB2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), putative synaptic puncta on CALB2+ targets are predominantly positioned on the pillar side of IHCs, and those that do not contact CALB2+ targets are positioned on the modiolar side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). Because CALB2 also labels IHCs, it is possible that some Syp puncta contacting CALB2 signal could be LOC contacts onto IHCs. Efferent contacts on mature IHCs have been reported in cat and rat cochleae, although at least in rodents this phenomenon appears to be associated with pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liberman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liberman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zachary and Fuchs, 2015</xref>). However, since most of the LOC Syp puncta in our dataset are positioned below the IHCs, most On-CALB2 Syp puncta are contacting Ia or Ib SGN peripheral processes. Conversely, we can conclude that most Off-CALB2 Syp puncta contact Ic SGN peripheral processes, although a few branches extend away from the SGN peripheral processes and may terminate near supporting cells. While intriguing, interactions with non-SGN targets were too rare for further quantification or analysis.</p><p>Our analysis revealed a high degree of variability in LOC axon morphology and connectivity, with no evidence for stereotyped classes. LOC axons turn towards the base, apex, or are bifurcated (indicated by colored arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–O</xref>), and can extend either short, simple branches with few Syp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and M–O</xref>) or long, complex tangles of branches that form dense forests of Syp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, K, and L</xref>). Syp puncta were not evenly distributed—some LOC axons can extend upwards of 1 kHz with no Syp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Prior studies of LOC subtypes in rats and guinea pigs suggested bifurcating axons cover longer stretches of the cochlea than axons turning in a single direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Warr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1987</xref>). However, we did not identify any relationship between LOC turn direction and any of the morphological attributes we examined, including the percent of NPY+ Syp puncta, cumulative axon length, tonotopic span, stem frequency, total number of Syp puncta, or the selectivity for CALB2+ SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J–N</xref>). Turn direction therefore appears to be a poor predictor for morphological attributes of LOC axons.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that no morphological features of the axon—such as its length or branchiness—correlated with its NPY status. Far from falling into distinct categories, the majority of reconstructed LOC axons had both NPY+ and NPY- Syp puncta that were present both on and off CALB2+ targets (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, K, and L</xref>). Indeed, individual LOC axons can weave from the pillar to modiolar side and extend branches that make pre-synaptic contacts on SGN peripheral processes on both sides of the IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). In some cases, the Syp puncta along an individual branch preferentially innervate one type of target (e.g. all puncta on CALB2+ targets on the right branch, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). However, On- and Off-CALB2 Syp puncta were also observed intermingled along the length of an axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>, left branch). We did identify some axons that had only On-CALB2+ or Off-Calb2+ Syp puncta, but they also showed no relationship with turn direction or the number of NPY+ Syp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M–O</xref>). These terminal axons, although relatively short in length, also varied in the percent of Syp puncta that were NPY+. This was also true of the LOC axon population as a whole, which showed no strong correlation between the percent of NPY+ Syp puncta in an individual LOC and any metric we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P–U</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1O–Q</xref>), including the frequency where the LOC axon enters the ISB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>), its tonotopic span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R</xref>), number of branch points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5S</xref>), total number of Syp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T</xref>), selectivity for CALB2+ targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5U</xref>), branch depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1O</xref>), fiber density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1P</xref>), or density of Syp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Q</xref>). Although some of these measures are weakly correlated with the fraction of NPY+ Syp puncta, NPY identity does not appear to be predictive of LOC morphology or innervation patterns, illustrated most vividly by examining axons with either 0% NPY or 100% NPY+ Syp puncta. On the contrary, even individual LOC axons are poised to have heterogeneous and widespread effects in the cochlea.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Physiological heterogeneity does not correlate with variability in peptide expression</title><p>Given the lack of obvious differences in their innervation patterns, we next asked whether LOC subtypes differ physiologically.

The number of spikes evoked at different depolarizing injection steps between 10 and 60 pA was plotted for each cell to generate input-output curves that indicate the increase in cell activity with increased depolarization.

To examine whether this flexibility is preserved into adulthood, we exposed 7-week-old C57BL/6J mice to 110 dB 8–16 kHz octave-band noise for 2 hours, a stimulus previously shown to induce TH expression in mouse LOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) and induce permanent threshold shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liberman and Kujawa, 2017</xref>). As expected, the fraction of ChAT+ LOCs expressing TH was elevated 9 days after sound exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>; n=4 exposed and 4 unexposed animals of either sex). In addition, we observed an even larger increase in the fraction of LOCs expressing Ucn or NPY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and D–G</xref>). Because all LOCs already express CGRP, there was no increase in the fraction of CGRP+ LOCs, although the levels of CGRP increased qualitatively throughout the LSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, H, I</xref>). Across all neuropeptides, the slope of peptide expression remained unaltered after sound exposure, with higher levels largely constrained to the medial wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, TH levels increased throughout the LSO, suggesting that the mechanisms driving LOCs to express TH may be different from those that govern neuropeptide expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>).

The wide conservation of this circuitry across evolutionary time suggests that OCNs play a crucial functional role. Here, we examined the transcriptional, physiological, and anatomical properties of mammalian OCNs to clarify longstanding questions about their identities and attributes. In doing so, we identified a new, peptide-enriched LOC subtype and found that peptide expression is modulated by hearing, both developmentally and upon acoustic overexposure in adults. Induced peptide expression persists for over a week after noise exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), presenting a mechanism by which LOCs can modulate downstream targets on the timescale of days. Collectively, our findings suggest that a diverse population of OCNs influences the initial detection of sound in a wide-ranging manner that occurs across timescales and changes in response to auditory experience.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>LOC neurons are molecularly, morphologically, and physiologically diverse</title><p>Although the entire olivocochlear efferent system is comprised of only a few hundred neurons in mice, we find that these neurons are remarkably heterogeneous, with molecularly distinct cell types that can adopt different states depending on experience. Using single-nucleus sequencing, we identified two transcriptionally distinct subtypes of adult LOCs, which we term LOC1 and LOC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The most prominent difference between LOC1s and LOC2s is the expression of genes encoding neuropeptides, including <italic>Calca</italic>, <italic>Calcb</italic>, <italic>Npy</italic>, and <italic>Ucn</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Given that LOCs can alter their neurotransmitter expression based on sound exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Niu and Canlon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), it is possible that the transcriptional differences we identified here represent only variations in cell state. However, several lines of evidence support the idea that these clusters represent genuine LOC subtypes. First, LOC1s and LOC2s vary in expression of genes that encode transcription factors and cell-adhesion molecules, attributes that are typically associated with cell types rather than cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paul et al., 2017</xref>). Second, peptide-high LOC2s are anatomically segregated from LOC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O, P</xref>). Moreover, the medial bias in neuropeptide expression is already present by at least P5/P6, prior to the onset of hearing, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to a stimulus that might preferentially activate medial LOCs, like ultrasonic vocalizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F</xref>). Finally, although we also show that peptide expression in LOCs can be altered by sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), NPY-expressing cells are biased to the medial LSO across perturbations, whereas cells in the far lateral LSO never express Ucn or NPY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although LOC2s have never been specifically described in the literature, Ucn and CGRP are also enriched in the medial LSO of mature gerbils and rats, respectively, indicating that LOC1/2 differences may be conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vetter et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Historically, classification of LOC neurons in rodents has relied on the anatomical distinction between intrinsic neurons in the body of the LSO and a smaller cohort of shell neurons immediately outside the LSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vetter and Mugnaini, 1992</xref>). Intrinsic and shell neurons have been thought to differ in both their morphology and neurotransmitter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Warr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darrow et al., 2006b</xref>). At the molecular level, we did not find a population that clearly corresponds to LOC shell neurons, but we cannot rule out that they were too rare to be identified or were excluded from sequencing data because they lack a history of ChAT expression. Nevertheless, although we cannot be certain whether any individual LOC axons in our 3D reconstructions arise from shell or intrinsic neurons, we found that bifurcating axons—a putative marker of shell neuron identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Warr et al., 1997</xref>)—did not differ from non-bifurcating axons in any anatomical metric we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J–N</xref>), indicating that the distinction between shell and intrinsic LOCs does not explain the diversity of LOC morphology present in mice.</p><p>The distinction between LOC1s and LOC2s is also insufficient to explain LOC heterogeneity: we found no meaningful correlations between the fraction of NPY+ pre-synaptic puncta in LOC axons and any morphological attributes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) or between Calca-GFP intensity and any physiological characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although we are confident that our analysis included both NPY+ and NPY- LOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we were unable to match reconstructed axons to their cell bodies because our sparse labeling approach captured multiple LOCs per animal. As such, it is possible that the fraction of NPY+ puncta per axon does not reliably correspond to LOC identity based on somatic peptide expression in the LSO. However, even comparison of axons with 0 vs 100% NPY+ puncta revealed no correlations with any morphological property we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q–U</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1O–Q</xref>).

It is striking that the molecular differences that define LOC2s—as confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, immunostaining, and genetic labeling—do not correlate with any of the physiological or peripheral morphological characteristics that we measured. One possibility is that our sequencing approach was insufficient to identify all sources of transcriptomic variability that contribute to this diversity. However, these data are consistent with a growing number of studies that find strong correlation between functional, anatomical, and transcriptional properties of major cell types—such as the differences between MOCs and LOCs—and weaker correlation between transcriptional subtypes—such as the differences between LOC1s and LOC2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zeng, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Developmental origins of olivocochlear neurons</title><p>Diversification of OCNs begins early, in keeping with the fact that MOCs and LOCs migrate to distinct anatomical locations embryonically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank and Goodrich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruce et al., 1997</xref>).

The stable, cell-type-specific markers we identified will therefore enable new lines of research into OCN development and function. In addition to cell-type markers like <italic>Col4a4</italic> and <italic>Zfp804a</italic>, we also identified dozens of genes that change during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>), some of which mirror developmental shifts previously reported in other auditory cell types. For example, both MOCs and LOCs downregulate several GABA receptor subunits while increasing expression of the glycine receptor subunit <italic>Glra1</italic>, indicating a transition from receiving GABAergic to glycinergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Korada and Schwartz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kotak et al., 1998</xref>). More work is needed to determine how these and other suggestive gene expression differences ultimately impact neuronal development and function, starting with confirmation at the protein level.</p><p>As with diversification of broader OCN subtypes, LOC1/LOC2 specification may also happen relatively early in development, as LOC2s can be recognized as early as P5 by enriched expression of NPY and CGRP in the medial LSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). We find that peptide expression in LOCs changes during postnatal development in a manner that depends on auditory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), raising the possibility of experience-dependent developmental events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, developing LOC2s differ from other sensory neurons whose specification relies on activity: some neurons in visual cortex cannot be classified at birth because they express mixed subtype markers, solidifying into mature subtypes only after eye opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, LOC2 markers such as NPY are localized medially both before and after the onset of hearing. Instead, certain attributes of LOCs—namely peptide expression—are malleable based on sensory experience.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional consequences of dynamic neuropeptide expression</title><p>LOCs have been reported to express a variety of transmitters, peptides, and modulators, but definitive evidence for many has been lacking. Our data argue against a major role for LOC transmission of opioid peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Safieddine and Eybalin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Vega et al., 2022</xref>), which were detected by neither RNA-seq nor FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). On the other hand, our data identify a new transmitter in the LOC repertoire, NPY. The function of these various signaling molecules remains an open question.</p><p>Throughout the cochlea, LOC arborizations span large frequency domains and contact multiple SGN subtypes, hinting that their role may be broadly modulatory, perhaps serving to tune sensitivity of SGNs based on behavioral demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guinan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Romero and Trussell, 2022</xref>). Indeed, there is evidence that cues about arousal play this type of role in the vestibular efferent system of fish, possibly to increase the sensitivity of vestibular afferent neurons prior to a rapid movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Highstein and Baker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mathews et al., 2017</xref>). In keeping with this interpretation, LOCs, but not MOCs, express <italic>Hcrtr2,</italic> which encodes an orexin receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>), suggesting that LOCs may be poised to transmit information about general arousal state to the cochlea. Release of slow-acting, neuromodulatory peptides may be another way that LOCs can alter the general sensitivity of SGNs.</p><p>As well as adjusting cochlear function in response to descending cues such as arousal or attention, LOCs may work together with MOCs to protect cochlear circuits from acoustic trauma and other environmental insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuente, 2015</xref>). Previous work found that the duration and intensity of sound exposure affect the number of LOCs that induce TH expression, with more intense stimuli inducing greater TH expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). We found that not only TH, but also NPY, Ucn, and CGRP are induced after exposure to an intense stimulus (110 dB for 2 hours) that is known to cause noise-induced damage in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liberman and Kujawa, 2017</xref>). It is possible that altered neurotransmitter emission ameliorates the damaging effects of sound exposure. Consistent with this model, recordings from SGNs show that dopamine can reduce SGN firing rates, potentially as a way of reducing excitotoxicity evoked by loud sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ruel et al., 2001</xref>). Neuropeptides may play a similar role to dampen SGN activity. For example, transcripts of the inhibitory, G-coupled NPY receptor <italic>Npy1r</italic> were detected in low levels in Type Ic SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>). Complicating this hypothesis, most studies on the effects of CGRP in the inner ear of mammals or lateral line of amphibians have found that CGRP plays an excitatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey and Sewell, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sewell and Starr, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey and Sewell, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Maison et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Prell et al., 2021</xref>). Infusions of CGRP into the guinea pig cochlea increase the amplitude of compound action potentials (CAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Prell et al., 2021</xref>)—a measure of bulk SGN activity—whereas CGRP knock-out mice exhibit decreased auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Maison et al., 2003b</xref>), reinforcing the idea that CGRP enhances SGN firing.</p><p>However, SGNs may not be the only target of the various neuropeptides released by LOCs. It has previously been proposed that components of the CRF stress-response pathway, like Ucn, interact with supporting cells in the organ of Corti to mitigate environmental damage, analogous to the way that this signaling pathway promotes the viability of skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graham and Vetter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Slominski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basappa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graham et al., 2011</xref>). In support of this idea, the Ucn receptor <italic>Crhr1</italic> is expressed in cochlear supporting cells, suggesting that they may be an alternate target of LOC signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graham and Vetter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, we occasionally observe Syp+ puncta on LOC axon branches that extend away from SGN processes into the area where support cells are located. Immune cells are another possible target of LOC peptide release, as NPY and CGRP are both immune-modulatory molecules that could alter inflammatory responses after acoustic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). The upregulation of Ucn, NPY, and CGRP may therefore serve as a central cue to stress-response and immune pathways in the ear following injury, similar to the finding that upregulation of TAF4 from mechanosensory neurons promotes recovery from UV damage in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoeffel et al., 2021</xref>). Likewise, the olivocochlear system may serve to both protect cochlear circuits and heighten responses to salient stimuli. Collectively, the molecular, morphological, and physiological diversity described here will inform future efforts to assign functions to LOCs generally and to LOC1s and to LOC2s specifically.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>We used the following mouse strains: <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> (Ai14; Jax strain 007914) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>Igs7<sup>GFP</sup></italic> (Ai140D; Jax strain 030220) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>); <italic>Rosa26<sup>Sun1-GFP</sup></italic> (Jax strain 021039) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mo et al., 2015</xref>); <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (Jax strain 006410 and 028861) and <italic>Chat<sup>CreΔNeo</sup></italic> (Jax strain 031661) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>) <italic>Calca-GFP (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong et al., 2003</xref>); <italic>Npy<sup>FlpO</sup></italic> (Jax strain 030211) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>); <italic>Ret<sup>CreER</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Luo et al., 2009</xref>); <italic>Npy-GFP</italic> (Jax strain 006417) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">van den Pol et al., 2009</xref>); <italic>Tmc1<sup>KO</sup></italic> and <italic>Tmc2<sup>KO</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>); and <italic>Rosa26<sup>FLTG</sup></italic> (Jax strain 026932) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Plummer et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic>, <italic>Igs7<sup>GFP</sup></italic>, <italic>Chat<sup>CreΔNeo</sup>, Npy<sup>FlpO</sup></italic>, <italic>Npy-GFP</italic>, <italic>Rosa26<sup>FLTG</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tmc1/2<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Rosa26<sup>Sun1-GFP</sup></italic> used for single-cell sequencing experiments were maintained on a mixed background of C57BL/6;129S6. <italic>Calca-GFP</italic> and <italic>Ret<sup>CreER</sup></italic> were on an unknown mixed background of at least 50% CD1.

In total, collections included the following: P1, 8 males and 5 females; P5, 7 males and 9 females; P26–P28, 20 males and 12 females. For developmental datasets, we collected all animals in each of two independent litters at each timepoint. For adult datasets, we collected all animals from each of four independent litters to accommodate lower yields from the heavily myelinated adult brainstem. All animals were on a mixed background of C57BL/6J;129S6. First, we dissected tissue from the ventral brainstem. In adults, we collected roughly the ventral half of the brainstem, in a fragment of the hindbrain that included the entire SOC as well as the FMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In P1 and P5 animals, we used a brain matrix (Zivic Instruments BSMNS001-1) to align the brains, then removed a segment of approximately 2 mm along the rostral-caudal axis, beginning at the front of the brainstem and extending caudally to include the FMNs. When it was possible to do so without damaging the tissue, we also removed the dorsal portion of the brain.</p><p>Tissue was dissected into an ice-cold buffer solution containing 0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 M Tricine-KOH, 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX, Cayman Chemical 14964), 50 µM APV (Tocris 0106), and 20 µM DNQX (Sigma D0540).

Initially, each individual library from independent 10x lanes was processed separately to remove low-quality cells and genes that were detected infrequently. Each library was filtered to remove genes that were not detected in at least 3 cells and cells that contained fewer than 500 unique genes. Each library was further filtered to discard any cell in which more than 1% of detected genes mapped to mitochondrial DNA. Because we sequenced individual nuclei rather than single cells, the presence of notable amounts of mitochondrial genes likely indicates contamination of RNA from outside the nucleus or other issues with sample quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ilicic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Luecken and Theis, 2019</xref>).

We therefore established different filtering criteria for the developmental and adult data: we kept developmental cells that had more than 1,000 detected UMI and more than 750 genes and adult cells that expressed more than 750 UMI and more than 500 genes. In addition, we excluded some potential multiplets by removing all cells for which the nUMI or nGenes detected was more than two standard deviations away from the mean. We chose a standard deviation-based cutoff rather than a specific upper limit for nUMI or nGenes because the distribution of detected genes and UMI differed between datasets based on variability in sequencing depth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Normalization and batch correction</title><p>After filtering low-quality cells, all libraries generated from parallel collections were merged prior to normalization (that is, all libraries that were collected simultaneously but distributed over multiple lanes of the 10x microfluidics chip).

Tissue was then rinsed two to three times with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, then two times with PBS before mounting with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) on slides with a 0.5 mm spacer between the slide and coverslip. Cochlear wholemounts were imaged on a Leica SP8 or Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image analysis</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Cochlea</title><p>Low-magnification images were acquired of all turns for each cochlea and imported into Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) with the Bio Formats plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Linkert et al., 2010</xref>). The measure_line plugin was used to map the cochlear length to cochlear frequency (Key Resource Table). High-magnification z-stack images were acquired using either a 40× objective on a Leica SP8 confocal or a 40× or 63× oil-immersion objective on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal. In a subset of cases in which the labeled OCN axon was very thin, the z-stack image was acquired using Airyscan 2 imaging and processing on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Reconstruction of sparsely labeled OCN axons in the cochlea</title><p>Z-stack images of sparsely labeled OCN axons in <italic>Ret<sup>CreER</sup>; Igs7<sup>GFP</sup></italic> cochlea were imported into Imaris (Bitplane AG, v. 9.8–9.9.0) for reconstructions of sparsely labeled OCN axons. To capture the full range of OCN morphologies, as well as any possible sex-specific differences, 4–5 animals of each sex were collected for this analysis. All traceable OCN fibers from these nine <italic>Ret<sup>CreER</sup>; Igs7<sup>GFP</sup></italic> animals were reconstructed and used for morphological analysis. The filament function was used to semi-automatically reconstruct individual axons based on the GFP fluorescence signal. MOC axons were traced starting in the OSL and LOC axon reconstructions began at the habenula in order to measure total filament length in the ISB consistently across axons. The surface function was used to create surfaces of OCN axons (from the GFP fluorescence) and CALB2+ SGN fibers and IHCs. The surface of the OCN axons (based on the GFP fluorescence signal) was used to mask the Syp and NPY fluorescence channels. From those masked channels, the surface function was again used to create Syp and NPY surfaces. The Syp and NPY puncta surfaces were created from a surface grain size of 0.115 µm and those larger than ~1.6 µm were divided. All surfaces were manually reviewed and adjusted as needed; for example, for the masked Syp and NPY channels, any puncta that was cut off by the masking surface was reviewed and excluded if it was not fully colocalized with the GFP channel. Syp surfaces were then filtered based on colocalization with NPY (i.e., proximity ≤0) to identify NPY+ and NPY- Syp puncta. These surfaces were subsequently filtered by proximity to the CALB2 surface to identify On- and Off-CALB2 Syp puncta. Filament and surface statistics were exported and analyzed in Excel, R, and GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Manual quantification of somatic OCN peptide expression</title><p>For initial quantification of NPY and Ucn co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), confocal images were scored by hand for overlapping expression of neuropeptides. Visible signal was attributed to a Ucn- or NPY-expressing LOC if it had a morphology consistent with LOC neurons and was located within the anatomical bounds of the LSO. Cells were categorized as co-expressing Ucn and NPY if signal from both channels overlapped completely in all three dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Automated quantification of somatic peptide expression</title><p>To extract quantitative differences in protein expression throughout the LSO, we established a semi-automated segmentation and quantification pipeline. After imaging, 1–3 LOC sections per hemisphere were selected that included LOCs in both the medial and lateral extremes of the LSO. Individual images were excluded if cells could not be confidently segmented due to poor staining quality or optical aberrations. For CGRP and NPY quantification in mature Tmc knock-out animals, the final dataset consisted of the following: 24 images of 12 LSOs from 6 control animals; 18 images of 10 LSOs from 5 double-knockout animals. The Ucn and TH quantification of mature Tmc knockout animals included the following: 15 images of 7 LSOs from 4 control animals; 17 images of 9 LSOs from 5 double-knockout animals. Quantification of CGRP and NPY expression in P7/P8 Tmc knockout animals was derived from 19 images of 11 LSOs from 6 control animals and 15 images of 10 LSOs from 5 double-knockout animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Quantification of Ucn and TH intensity after sound exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) was derived from 16 images of 8 LSOs from 4 unexposed animals and 15 images from 8 LSOs of 4 sound-exposed animals. Quantification of CGRP and NPY intensity was extracted from 15 images of 8 LSOs from 4 animals for both exposed and unexposed conditions. All quantification experiments included 4–6 animals per genotype or condition. All experiments and conditions included pooled animals from both sexes. In all cases, analysis was conducted with experimenter blind to genotype or noise-exposure status.</p><p>Images were pre-processed for segmentation by enhancing local contrast using a Gaussian filter-based local normalization algorithm as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) (see Key Resources Table). Resulting images were automatically segmented using CellPose v. 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). Resulting soma masks were manually curated downstream of automated segmentation to meet the following criteria: (<bold>a</bold>) objects were located within the anatomical boundaries of the LSO; (<bold>b</bold>) objects were labeled by either CGRP or ChAT; (<bold>c</bold>) objects were cell shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Neuropil masks were then obtained by dilating the soma masks by 20 pixels and subtracting 5-pixel-dilated soma masks. Soma and neuropil masks were then applied to unprocessed images to extract mean pixel fluorescence intensity. Finally, mean neuropil pixel intensity was subtracted from the mean intensity of the affiliated soma to account for variability in local background fluorescence.</p><p>Both the medial-lateral orientation and length of each LSO were annotated manually by drawing a line through the LSO in each image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The length of each LSO was normalized to 1 based on this line in order to facilitate comparisons of relative LOC position within the LSO across samples. To compute the fraction of cells expressing each protein, a threshold for each protein was selected using raw fluorescence intensities that consistently yielded cell count fractions consistent with manual counts. To calculate the slope of protein expression across each LSO, minimum intensity values of all cells were restricted to 0 (that is, any negative intensity values were set to 0). Next, cells in each LSO were normalized by dividing the fluorescence intensity of each cell by the intensity of the brightest cell in that LSO. A linear regression model based on the relationship between cell position and normalized fluorescence intensity was calculated in R. The slope of this regression line was then extracted from each LSO. Slopes of protein expression and the fraction of cells expressing each protein between groups were imported to GraphPad prism and assessed for statistical significance with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test between groups.

The slices were viewed using a Nikon FN-1 microscope with DIC optics and a Nikon NIR Apo 40 X/ 0.80 N/A water-immersion objective. The images were collected as Mono 8-bit.nd2 files with a QICLICK, MONO 12BIT, non-cooled camera (Nikon) or Mono 16-bit.nd2 files with a CoolSNAP DYNO camera (photometrics) and viewed using NIS-Elements (Nikon). LOC neurons were identified for recordings by their position in the medial arm of the LSO and visibility using green epifluorescence (488 nm emission filter, Lumencor Sola lamp). DIC and fluorescent images were obtained from each neuron prior to recordings. The recordings were performed using a MultiClamp 700B and DigiData 1440 A controlled by Clampex 10.6 software (Molecular Devices) or a HEKA EPC 10 USB Double Patch Clamp Amplifier controlled by Patchmaster Next Software (HEKA Electronik), sampled at 50 kHz and filtered on-line at 10 kHz.

Series resistances were corrected more than 60%. The cells were voltage-clamped at –66 mV (liquid junction potential corrected) unless stated otherwise. I-clamp values were corrected for a liquid junction potential of –6 mV. Chemicals were obtained from Fisher Scientific or Millipore Sigma.</p><p>Prior to breaking into the cell, a low-magnification image of each LSO was taken using 488 nm filters under epifluorescent illumination. High magnification images of each cell were used to obtain maximum-intensity information of GFP signal, upon which a post-hoc correction was applied for both the number of light flashes that the slice had been exposed to for multiple recordings in the same slice, and for the depth of the cell in the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Electrophysiology: Statistical analysis</title><p>Voltage- and current-clamp recordings were analyzed in Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices) or MATLAB 2020a (Mathworks). The intensity of each cell was obtained from an image taken immediately prior to performing patch-clamp recordings. The Auto Detect Area tool of NIS-Elements AR (version 4.50) was used to define a region of interest (ROI) around each cell. Detection tolerance was adjusted as necessary and on rare occasions the ROI had to be hand drawn using the Polygon tool. The maximum intensity within the ROI was obtained using the ‘MaxIntensity’ measurement feature, which is the maximal of pixel intensity values derived from the intensity histogram. Multiple cells were recorded from each brain slice, and cells were filled with red fluorescent tracer to prevent multiple recordings from the same cell. To compensate for bleaching due to repeated exposure to the fluorescent lamp, in separate experiments cells were imaged multiple times to replicate recording and illumination conditions. A correction factor based on the formula of the line fit to the decrement in intensity over successive illuminations was then applied to individual neurons based on the number of times that each slice was illuminated. Similarly, the intensity was compensated for the depth of the cell in the slice, which was measured during each recording using the calibrated micromanipulators used for placing the patch-pipette (Sutter Instruments). Corrected intensity values ranged from 32.24 to 111.8. Action potential threshold was manually measured at the clear beginning of the rising phase of the voltage response. Input-output curves were calculated from the linear portion of the curve prior to a plateau in the number of evoked action potentials.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Origin v2021 (Origin Laboratories). A correlation between patch-clamp recording derived measures of cell function and cell intensity were tested with a single linear regression fit to the data using the ‘Fit linear’ function in Origin. A relationship was considered significant if the linear fit had a p-value &lt;0.05. For grouped data, the intensity differences of cells in each group were tested with a one-Way ANOVA. For data presentation, voltage and current-clamp traces were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Catherine Emily Carr as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zhiyong Liu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please modify your title, along the lines of perhaps along the lines of &quot; Single cell transcriptomic profiling reveals xxxxx&quot;</p><p>2) Follow the reviewer's suggestions to improve clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Frank et al. in this study thoroughly characterized the molecular, physiological, and morphological properties of the brainstem olivocochlear neurons (OCNs). First, by using the ChATCre+; Rosa26-Sun1-GFP/+ and 10x single cell RNA-Seq platform, they identified two Gata3+ cell clusters that are defined as OCNs: one is Ucn+ LOC, and the other is Atp1a3+ MOC. By further comparing the gene profiles between OCNs and the lineage-related FMNs, several previously unknown OCN markers such as Cadps2 are revealed. Furthermore, they also noticed that OCNs have high internal heterogeneity and they further found LOC and MOC-enriched genes, including but not limited to Col4a4 and Zfp804a, respectively. More importantly, two LOC subtypes, LOC-1 and LOC-2, are identified, and especially the LOC-2 sub-cluster cells, which are located in the medial wing of the LSO, can enrich many neuropeptide genes, CGRP, Calcb, NPY, Ucn and so on. The NPY expression in LOC-2 is further validated by the well-designed genetic fate mapping approach, which is convincing. Finally, the author showed that the neuropeptide expression patterns did not significantly change between wild-type and Tmc1/2 knockout mice at the pre-hearing ages, but either the neuropeptide expression levels or distribution patterns did change manifestly after hearing onset. Besides, they also showed that noise exposure can alter the neuropeptide patterns.</p><p>In general, the paper is clearly written and the data are well presented. The logic is straightforward, and in most cases, the data are compelling to support the conclusions. I only have 2 main comments below:</p><p>1) In my point of view, it should be a resource paper rather than a research article because the current version did not connect any specific marker pattern with the biological properties. For example, the Npy identity does not appear to be predictive of LOC morphology. It remains unknown whether the neuropeptide changes are just a final outcome or really an important cellular event. Convincing evidence is lacking to address this question.</p><p>2) The author claimed that opioid (such as Pdyn and Penk) expression is not detected. I feel the authors tend to say it is a surprising observation. In my mind, it needs more caution, and it is better to confirm this negative observation by fate mapping analysis with Pdyn-cre (it is available). Fate mapping analysis is more solid to make a negative conclusion especially when we do not know the exact gene expression patterns. The samples should be analyzed at adult ages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I strongly support publication in <italic>eLife</italic> given the indicated revisions.</p><p>I would like to congratulate the authors on this great study! Below please find some suggestions that might be helpful to further improve this manuscript.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>&quot;through unclear mechanisms&quot; is inappropriate here given the amount of work and evidence on candidate mechanisms. This needs to be changed/weakened.</p><p>&quot;we discovered a neuropeptide-enriched LOC subtype&quot; given that LOCs have generally been thought to use neuropeptides and the analysis, as is, focuses on RNAseq I found this statement very strong (too strong), if not backed by immunohistochemistry in the cochlea.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>There are some issues with references, which I tried to help with below. In general, according to DORA it would be preferred to cite original publications rather than reviews. However, there are cases that are well served by reviews: such as outer hair cell function.</p><p>Yet, the review of van der Heijden and Vavakou actually questions the cycle-by-cycle amplification by outer hair cells (OHCs) based on their OCT recordings (Vavakou et al., 2021). Perhaps cite a review of Dallos or others on electromotility and reference van der Heijden and Vavakou in the kind of (but see..) manner. Moreover, Glowatzki and Fuchs 2001 is on inner hair cells rather than OHCs. Also, the choice of the two Oatman papers might not be so helpful. Finally, the phrase &quot;the detection of signals in noise26-28 and attention29-32.&quot; might be reconsidered (e.g. &quot;effects of attention&quot;?).</p><p>&quot;No specific role in hearing has been definitively linked to LOCs, although they appear 78 to protect the ear from noise damage through unknown mechanisms34,35.&quot; While the shortage of functional data certainly applies, this statement and the references are falling quite short. I think you should tone down and consider citing Ruel et al., 2004 as well as Darrow et al., 2006.</p><p>Results:</p><p>&quot;we adopted a single-nucleus sequencing strategy&quot; While the approach will be clear to most of us it might still help clarify that this means cell nuclei rather than brainstem nuclei.</p><p>&quot;Cell types were also similar in the fraction of mitochondrial genes detected,&quot; maybe I am missing something, but since there is mitochondrial DNA and nuclear sequencing was applied this should probably specify &quot;nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes&quot; or the like. Moreover, the link between similarity in n-mt genes and homogeneous cell health might not be so obvious without a reference.</p><p>&quot;OCNs but not in other motor neuron&quot; this and later reads like you say OCNs are motor neurons: perhaps clarify in the intro that OCNs and &quot;motor neurons&quot; have common progenitors?</p><p>&quot;Na,K-ATPase Atp1a3, which is selectively expressed in MOCs in mature rats45&quot;.</p><p>As shown by McLean et al., 2009 and other studies, in the cochlea, ATP1a3 is primarily expressed in type I SGNs, so this statement needs to be reconsidered.</p><p>&quot;CADPS2 is linked to exocytosis of dense-core vesicles47-49&quot;,</p><p>I suggest mentioning the synonymous name CAPS-2, which is more frequently used in synaptic neuroscience, and to put its function into the context of vesicle priming (e.g. &quot; a member of the Munc13 and CAPS family of priming proteins&quot;) potentially also quoting relevant neuronal work such as Jockusch et al., 2007, Vogl et al., 2015, Nestvogel et al., 2020.</p><p>Figure 1L and M: I found it difficult to detect any green signal in the respective left panels (also applies to other FISH analyses).</p><p>&quot;Consistent with their integration into fundamentally different circuitry, OCNs and FMNs also differ in the expression of molecules relevant to mature function (Figures S2F, I). In particular, only OCNs express Gad2, a gene involved in GABA synthesis, whereas only FMNs express the serotonin receptor gene Htr2c (Figure S2I).&quot; This is only one of the instances where the question of what predictive power RNA analysis has for protein expression is relevant. There is nothing wrong with the statement in principle, but is seems overtly simple to conclude this.</p><p>Figure 2, legend: &quot;gene Zfp804a is expressed in MOCs (G) but is absent from most LOCs (F).&quot;</p><p>&quot;Both MOCs and LOCs have the ability to respond to numerous neurotransmitters, including 172 GABA (K), Glycine (L), acetylcholine (M), and glutamate (O).&quot; another instance where care should be taken not to overinterpret the data.</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>It would be helpful to quantitatively see correlations between CGRP, NPY, and Ucn expression levels.</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>Please provide more explanation for how the masking of synaptophysin immunofluorescence was done.</p><p>&quot;Strikingly, some (shown in Figure 4A-A&quot;), but not all (Figure S5F-I), of these terminal fibers contained Syp puncta in the ISB.&quot; What precisely did you find striking here?</p><p>Please introduce CALB2 (calretinin), and also introduce the possibility of LOC-IHC contacts (e.g. Liberman et al., 1990, Lauer et al., 2012), which could confound the on-CALB2 analysis.</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>It looks like the majority of fibers that were analyzed have a considerable amount of NPY-positive terminals. However, the LOC2 cluster size seems to be smaller compared to LOC1, both from RNA sequencing data and qualitative immunolabeling. Is it possible that it has to do with Ret expression in different LOC subtypes? Please comment on how you reconcile these findings.</p><p>The section in Figure 5P is quite dense and a bit cryptic. I generally appreciate the effort to quantify potential relationships as done here but then again worry about how conclusive this is.</p><p>Legend to Figure 5: &quot;High CALB2 fibers correspond to low threshold Type Ia SGNs; low CALB2 fibers correspond to high threshold Type Ic SGNs.&quot; To my knowledge, the correspondence of the molecular profiles and functional properties has yet to be tested.

First, by using the ChATCre+; Rosa26-Sun1-GFP/+ and 10x single cell RNA-Seq platform, they identified two Gata3+ cell clusters that are defined as OCNs: one is Ucn+ LOC, and the other is Atp1a3+ MOC. By further comparing the gene profiles between OCNs and the lineage-related FMNs, several previously unknown OCN markers such as Cadps2 are revealed. Furthermore, they also noticed that OCNs have high internal heterogeneity and they further found LOC and MOC-enriched genes, including but not limited to Col4a4 and Zfp804a, respectively. More importantly, two LOC subtypes, LOC-1 and LOC-2, are identified, and especially the LOC-2 sub-cluster cells, which are located in the medial wing of the LSO, can enrich many neuropeptide genes, CGRP, Calcb, NPY, Ucn and so on. The NPY expression in LOC-2 is further validated by the well-designed genetic fate mapping approach, which is convincing. Finally, the author showed that the neuropeptide expression patterns did not significantly change between wild-type and Tmc1/2 knockout mice at the pre-hearing ages, but either the neuropeptide expression levels or distribution patterns did change manifestly after hearing onset. Besides, they also showed that noise exposure can alter the neuropeptide patterns.</p><p>In general, the paper is clearly written and the data are well presented. The logic is straightforward, and in most cases, the data are compelling to support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the kind comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I only have 2 main comments below:</p><p>1) In my point of view, it should be a resource paper rather than a research article because the current version did not connect any specific marker pattern with the biological properties. For example, the Npy identity does not appear to be predictive of LOC morphology. It remains unknown whether the neuropeptide changes are just a final outcome or really an important cellular event. Convincing evidence is lacking to address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the significance of NPY expression remains to be determined. However, the research finding of note is the discovery of a population of LOCs marked by NPY – these NPY-positive LOCs are molecularly distinct and anatomically segregated, but they do not exhibit stereotyped morphologies or patterns of connectivity. We provide multiple types of evidence supporting this conclusion, including single nucleus RNA-seq data, immunohistochemistry, genetic fate mapping, and 3D reconstructions of individual axonal arbors in the cochlea. Moreover, a growing body of literature suggests that cellular subtype identity is rarely predictive of cellular morphology, as described in the Discussion (see e.g. Kim, …, Anderson 2019; Peng, …, Zeng 2021; general lack of correlation between transcriptional subtypes and morphological characteristics reviewed in Zeng 2022, <italic>Cell</italic>). Thus, we feel that the lack of correlation between NPY expression and cellular morphology is a biologically relevant observation that is best shared in the form of a research article. To make this point more clearly, we expanded the discussion of LOC heterogeneity (pg. 11, lines 504-514).</p><p>With respect to the role of NPY itself, we feel that the data do indeed provide compelling evidence that NPY (and other peptides) are induced by acoustic trauma, a finding that impacts how we think about LOC function more broadly, as presented in the Discussion (p. 20-21, “Functional consequences of dynamic neuropeptide expression”). Our work on neuropeptide induction is consistent with work in other peripheral systems, including neurons innervating the skin (Hoeffel, …, Ugolini 2021) and gut (Yang, …, Chiu 2022; see Discussion). Given the consistency of these phenotypes, the effect size (~4-5x increase in Ucn- or NPY-expressing LOCs, p&lt;0.001), and agreement with the available literature in other sensory systems, it is reasonable to conclude that peptide induction in olivocochlear neurons is a genuine phenomenon that could play a similar role to that seen elsewhere in the body. Investigating the impact of this peptide induction is an important goal for the future, but is beyond the scope of the current study. This point has been added to the Discussion (pg. 13, lines 589-591).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The author claimed that opioid (such as Pdyn and Penk) expression is not detected. I feel the authors tend to say it is a surprising observation. In my mind, it needs more caution, and it is better to confirm this negative observation by fate mapping analysis with Pdyn-cre (it is available). Fate mapping analysis is more solid to make a negative conclusion especially when we do not know the exact gene expression patterns. The samples should be analyzed at adult ages.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that a negative result detecting <italic>Pdyn</italic> and <italic>Penk</italic> transcription is not conclusive evidence that LOC neurons never use these peptides. Although we include images of <italic>Pdyn</italic>- and <italic>Penk</italic>-expressing positive control cells, we did not definitively image the entire LOC across sections, so we cannot rule out the possibility that we may have missed expression in a subset of LOCs. We have adjusted our language in the text accordingly (pg. 5, lines 201-202). We agree that fate mapping using <italic>Pdyn-Cre</italic> could be interesting, but these experiments would not address the central question of whether LOC neurons signal with opioid peptides in adult animals, as there are several circuits where neurons have a history of neurotransmitter expression that is not retained in adults, including cells in the auditory system (reviewed in Spitzer 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I strongly support publication in eLife given the indicated revisions.</p><p>I would like to congratulate the authors on this great study!

This needs to be changed/weakened.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed the phrase accordingly (pg. 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;we discovered a neuropeptide-enriched LOC subtype&quot; given that LOCs have generally been thought to use neuropeptides and the analysis, as is, focuses on RNAseq I found this statement very strong (too strong), if not backed by immunohistochemistry in the cochlea.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s caution in drawing strong conclusions about the discovery of an LOC subtype. Examining expression of proteins other than NPY (Figure 5 and its supplement) or CGRP (e.g. Wu et al. 2017) in the cochlea would be an interesting and worthwhile set of experiments that could inform our understanding of how peptide release might influence cochlear function. However, we feel that our current approach is better suited to support the claim we make here, namely that neuropeptide-enriched LOCs exist. We focused on the cell bodies of LOCs in the brainstem as that is the only location in which we can reliably distinguish individual cells, given the extensive branching of their axons in the ear. The brainstem is therefore a more reliable place to look for variability in peptide expression between individual LOC neurons than the cochlea. In addition, we based our conclusion that there is a neuropeptide-enriched LOC subtype not only on RNAseq (Figure 3), but also on quantitative immunohistochemistry (Figure 3, 7, 7—figure supplement 1, and 8), <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (Figure 3), fate mapping (Figure 3), and expression of promoter-based fluorescent reporter lines for NPY and CGRP (Figure 3, 6). All of these methods yield consistent results, indicating that bias in peptide expression arises in a stereotyped manner at the level of promoters, transcripts, and protein. Finally, although LOCs have indeed long been thought to signal through peptides, earlier work has not thoroughly examined the possibility of distinct cohorts of LOCs with varying peptide expression. Nonetheless, prior work in other species does recapitulate our finding of a medial bias in peptide expression across the LSO at the level of protein expression (Kaiser et al. 2011, Vetter et al. 1991). Thus, although additional immunohistochemistry in the cochlea would certainly be of interest, those results would not affect our central conclusion of variability in peptide expression across individual LOCs. We have added a sentence to the Discussion to better explain the evidence for a neuropeptide-enriched LOC subtype (pg. 11, lines 504-514).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>There are some issues with references, which I tried to help with below.

Perhaps cite a review of Dallos or others on electromotility and reference van der Heijden and Vavakou in the kind of (but see..) manner. Moreover, Glowatzki and Fuchs 2001 is on inner hair cells rather than OHCs. Also, the choice of the two Oatman papers might not be so helpful. Finally, the phrase &quot;the detection of signals in noise26-28 and attention29-32.&quot; might be reconsidered (e.g. &quot;effects of attention&quot;?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your careful attention to detail in checking these references! We have added an additional review on outer hair cell electromotility (pg. 2, line 53) and replaced the Glowatzki and Fuchs 2001 reference with papers discussing the OHC-MOC synapse (Blanchet et al. 1996 and Dallos et al. 1997; pg. 2, line 54). We also revised the phrasing in line 56-57.

I think you should tone down and consider citing Ruel et al., 2004 as well as Darrow et al., 2006.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have rephrased this sentence and added references to Ruel et al. 2001 and Wu et al. 2020 (concerning the role of dopamine in tuning SGN excitability) and Darrow et al. 2006, Larsen and Liberman 2010, and Irving et al. 2011 (concerning the possibility of OCNs in sound localization circuitry). We also added a reference to an additional review article (Fuente et al. 2015) describing possible mechanisms mediating LOC protection from acoustic trauma for readers interested in exploring the topic beyond the scope of this paper (pg. 2, lines 69-74). Changes to the references are highlighted in yellow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>&quot;we adopted a single-nucleus sequencing strategy&quot; While the approach will be clear to most of us it might still help clarify that this means cell nuclei rather than brainstem nuclei.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the text for clarity (pg. 2, lines 87-88).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Cell types were also similar in the fraction of mitochondrial genes detected,&quot; maybe I am missing something, but since there is mitochondrial DNA and nuclear sequencing was applied this should probably specify &quot;nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes&quot; or the like.

The fraction of mitochondrial genes detected is a standard metric to assess the quality of single-cell or single-nucleus sequencing data. This analysis specifically includes genes mapping to the mitochondrial genome, not nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. As described in the Methods, the presence of genes mapping to the mitochondrial genome likely indicates contaminants from outside the nucleus or other issues with sample quality. We have revised this phrasing for clarity and added appropriate references in both the Results and the Methods (pg. 3, line 108-109; pg. 15, lines 675-679).

We were referring specifically to preferential ATP1a3 expression in OCN cell bodies, so additional expression in SGNs or other cell types does not affect its utility as a distinguishing marker between MOCs and LOCs.

We have tried our best to choose colors that are visible in the overlay. However, given the size of the puncta, there are limits to how much we can do to make the green points visible. For this reason, we also show an inverted image of the single-channel data with the mRNA puncta labeled in black. We feel that this is the best way to represent the data. We have also made slight adjustments to the overlay images shown in Figures 1L, 2C, and 2G to make the overlapping signals easier to see. There is no green signal visible in Figure 1M because the <italic>Cadps2</italic> transcript is not expressed in the facial nucleus, which is more clearly seen in the single-channel panel on the right of 1M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Consistent with their integration into fundamentally different circuitry, OCNs and FMNs also differ in the expression of molecules relevant to mature function (Figures S2F, I). In particular, only OCNs express Gad2, a gene involved in GABA synthesis, whereas only FMNs express the serotonin receptor gene Htr2c (Figure S2I).&quot; This is only one of the instances where the question of what predictive power RNA analysis has for protein expression is relevant.

However, given the limitations of single-cell sequencing data (and in particular the v2 10x kit we used for collecting the adult nuclei in this study), we do not think these results are reliable enough to include here. Specifically, droplet-based single-cell sequencing approaches are known to have issues with dropouts and false zero counts due to stochasticity in transcript detection, an effect that is more pronounced for kits with older chemistries, such as the 10x v2 kit (see e.g. Hicks, …, Irazarry 2017). Thus, although Ucn and NPY expression in adult LOCs is tightly correlated with an adjusted <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> of 0.91 for cells in which both Ucn and NPY were detected, this analysis only includes 5 cells. Droplet-based sequencing platforms (like 10x) are also limited in their ability to detect the dynamic range of transcript expression, especially for lowly expressed transcripts, like peptides (e.g. Wang, … Zhang 2021), making correlation analyses based on transcript expression levels even more unreliable. We therefore used an orthogonal method to qualitatively examine co-expression of peptides at the protein and promoter levels, as shown in Figure 3N, O and Supplementary File 1. Because commercially available antibodies for both NPY and Ucn are raised in rabbit, we were unable to quantitatively compare NPY and Ucn protein expression in the same cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4</p><p>Please provide more explanation for how the masking of synaptophysin immunofluorescence was done.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional details have been added to the Methods (pg. 18, lines 804-808).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Strikingly, some (shown in Figure 4A-A&quot;), but not all (Figure S5F-I), of these terminal fibers contained Syp puncta in the ISB.&quot; What precisely did you find striking here?</p></disp-quote><p>What stood out to us is that there do not appear to be two types of MOCs – those that form putative synapses with Type I SGN peripheral fibers and those that do not. Instead, individual MOC axons can extend some terminal branches that form synaptophysin puncta in the ISB while other terminal branches from the same axon bypass the ISB and exclusively terminate on OHCs. We edited the text to better communicate what is interesting about this observation (pg. 6, lines 250-252).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please introduce CALB2 (calretinin), and also introduce the possibility of LOC-IHC contacts (e.g. Liberman et al., 1990, Lauer et al., 2012), which could confound the on-CALB2 analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Although CALB2 is a reliable way to distinguish Ia vs Ib/c SGN subtypes (Shrestha…Goodrich, 2018), we agree that its expression in IHCs can be problematic. To make this point more clearly, we have re-written the text about why CALB2 was used and to acknowledge that we cannot rule out the possibility of LOC-IHC contacts. If such contacts exist, though, they are likely to be a minority, as most Syp puncta were well away from the IHCs. In the revised text, CALB2 is still introduced as a marker for both SGNs and IHCs when we describe the overall approach on pg. 5 (lines 224-227) and p. 6 (lines 262-268), and then we expanded the discussion of possible caveats on pg. 7, lines 293-301.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5</p><p>It looks like the majority of fibers that were analyzed have a considerable amount of NPY-positive terminals. However, the LOC2 cluster size seems to be smaller compared to LOC1, both from RNA sequencing data and qualitative immunolabeling. Is it possible that it has to do with Ret expression in different LOC subtypes? Please comment on how you reconcile these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting and important point. Indeed, LOC axons with high NPY content are likely over-represented in our morphological analyses. It is possible that our tamoxifen dosing scheme may have enriched for LOC neurons with medium-to-high NPY load in their axons. In adult animals, <italic>Ret</italic> expression does not appear to be higher in LOC2s than LOC1s. (<italic>Ret</italic> was detected in 24% of LOC1s and 20% of LOC2s, with an average normalized expression of 2.1 and 1.9 in <italic>Ret</italic>+ LOC1s and LOC2s, respectively. Note that the low percentage of cells with <italic>Ret</italic> detected likely reflects limitations of droplet-based single-cell sequencing methods, and does not imply that only ~20% of mature LOCs are producing <italic>Ret</italic> transcripts). When we give high doses of tamoxifen to mature (~P20–P28) <italic>Ret<sup>CreER</sup>;Igs7<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice, MOCs and LOCs are labeled extensively throughout the base-to-apex extent of the cochlea. However, we found that we were better able to reliably titrate sparse labeling in the <italic>Ret<sup>CreER</sup></italic> line with embryonic tamoxifen doses than with postnatal or adult administration. It is possible that administering tamoxifen during late embryogenesis captured a developmentally distinct subpopulation of LOCs. Because many components of the auditory system develop from high-to-low frequencies, our embryonic injections could have captured an LOC population biased to the medial LSO, which would preferentially target NPY-high LOCs.</p><p>However, we feel confident in our experimental approach given the variety of LOC axonal morphologies we found as well as the large number of LOC axons with low or no NPY load. Our goal was to determine whether fibers with high NPY expression exhibited stereotyped morphologies in the cochlea, and the range of morphologies we identified indicates that they do not. Similarly, we found that axons with 0% NPY/Syp+ puncta do not exhibit any stereotyped properties, reinforcing our conclusion that peptide expression does not dictate axonal morphology. We have added a summary of our reasoning as well as potential caveats to the text (pg. 11, lines 504-514).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section in Figure 5P is quite dense and a bit cryptic. I generally appreciate the effort to quantify potential relationships as done here but then again worry about how conclusive this is.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this section contains a lot of information that can be hard to digest. The point we are trying to make is that peripheral axon morphological features do not correlate with peptidergic content, which requires walking through a wide variety of parameters. We have rewritten this entire section to make the main point clear – namely, that LOCs are a diverse population of neurons containing two molecularly distinct subtypes, but whose innervation patterns in the cochlea suggest that they are poised to provide widespread and broad feedback to the cochlea. These changes are throughout the section entitled “NPY-positive LOC axons exhibit highly variable patterns of connectivity”, starting on p. 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Legend to Figure 5: &quot;High CALB2 fibers correspond to low threshold Type Ia SGNs; low CALB2 fibers correspond to high threshold Type Ic SGNs.&quot; To my knowledge, the correspondence of the molecular profiles and functional properties has yet to be tested.

Although correlative, this is a reasonable readout of modiolar-pillar position that adequately serves the purpose of our analysis (i.e., to determine if there are clear biases in the localization of peptidergic or non-peptidergic LOC Syp puncta). The stereotypy of CALB2 expression gradients among the SGN peripheral processes along the modiolar-pillar axis of the base of the IHC have been shown previously by multiple groups (e.g. Shrestha…Goodrich, 2018; Sun…Mueller, 2018) and, as illustrated in the orthogonal view in Figure 5E, we found the alignment between modiolar/pillar position and On and Off CALB2 to be quite reliable. While we agree it would be better to directly assess position, it would be a considerable amount of additional work to code the modiolar/pillar position of each Syp puncta in Imaris. Given the lack of qualitative evidence that there are ever any CALB2-on Syp+ puncta on the modiolar side, we feel it would not substantially add meaningful insight to our conclusions about the lack of an anatomical bias in the position of NPY+ Syp+ puncta.
