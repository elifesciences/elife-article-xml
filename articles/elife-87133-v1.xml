As costs have decreased, NGS has increasingly been applied to generate multiple layers of molecular data from the same samples, covering genomics, transcriptomics, and methylomics. Integrating these types of multi-omics data in a combined analysis is now becoming a common issue with no obvious solution, often handled on an ad hoc basis, with multi-omics data arriving in a tabular format and analyzed using computationally intensive statistical methods. These methods particularly ignore the spatial orientation of the genome and often apply stringent p-value corrections that likely result in the loss of true positive associations. Here, we present GENIUS (GEnome traNsformatIon and spatial representation of mUltiomicS data), a framework for integrating multi-omics data using deep learning models developed for advanced image analysis. The GENIUS framework is able to transform multi-omics data into images with genes displayed as spatially connected pixels and successfully extract relevant information with respect to the desired output. We demonstrate the utility of GENIUS by applying the framework to multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Our results are focused on predicting the development of metastatic cancer from primary tumors, and demonstrate how through model inference, we are able to extract the genes which are driving the model prediction and are likely associated with metastatic disease progression. We anticipate our framework to be a starting point and strong proof of concept for multi-omics data transformation and analysis without the need for statistical correction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>deep learning</kwd><kwd>multi-omics</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>integrated gradients</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>bladder cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R272-2017-4040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birkbak</surname><given-names>Nicolai J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002739</institution-id><institution>Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AUFF-E-2018-7-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birkbak</surname><given-names>Nicolai J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF21OC0071483</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birkbak</surname><given-names>Nicolai J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GENIUS provides a deep learning framework for multi-omics integration that transforms data into spatial images, using integrated gradients to reveal novel and critical cancer gene association.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recent advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized research and has been applied extensively to investigate complex biological questions. As the cost of sequencing continues to drop, it has become increasingly common to apply NGS technology to investigate complementary aspects of the biological processes on the same samples, particularly through analysis of DNA to resolve genomic architecture and single-nucleotide variants, RNA to investigate gene expression, and methylation to explore gene regulation and chromatin structure. Such multi-omics data provides opportunities to perform integrated analysis, which investigates multiple layers of biological data together. Over the years, this has resulted in the generation of an incredible amount of very rich data derived from the genome itself, either directly or indirectly. The genome is spatially organized, with genes positioned on chromosomes sequentially and accessed by biological processes in blocks based on chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franke et al., 2016</xref>). However, genome-derived NGS data is usually stored in and analyzed from a tabular format, where the naturally occurring spatial connectivity is lost. Furthermore, while genomic data is rich, the feature space is generally much larger than the number of samples. As the number of features to evaluate in statistical tests increases, the risk of chance associations increases as well. To correct for such multiple hypothesis testing, drastic adjustments of p-values are often applied which ultimately leads to the rejection of all but the most significant results, likely eliminating a large number of weaker but true associations. While this is a significant issue when analyzing a single type of data, the problem is exacerbated with performing multi-omics analysis where different types of data are combined, often in an ad hoc manner tailored to specific use cases. Importantly, a common theme in multi-omics analytical approaches is that observations are processed individually, thereby discarding potential spatial information that may originate from the organization of genes on individual chromosomes.</p><p>Using artificial intelligence methods may help overcome this problem. Over the past decade, the development of artificial intelligence methods, particularly within deep learning architectures, has thoroughly revolutionized several technical fields, such as computer vision, voice recognition, advertising, and finance. Within the medical field, the roll-out of AI-based technologies has been slower, hampered in part by considerable regulatory hurdles that have proven difficult for machine-learning applications where the systems may accurately classify patients or samples by some parameter, but the logical reason behind this is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wiens et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, AI systems have proven successful in a multitude of medical studies, and in recent years some AI-powered tools have started to move past testing to deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamens et al., 2020</xref>). A major benefit of deep neural networks is that they can capture nonlinear patterns in the data without necessitating correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, the use of convolutional layers within the networks has shown to improve performance by decreasing the impact of noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2022</xref>). However, the problem with complex deep learning models is not the analysis itself but their interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudin, 2019</xref>). Simpler models tend to have high interpretability; however, they are unable to capture complex nonlinear connections in data. This often leads to the utilization of ‘black box’ models at the cost of interpretability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elmarakeby et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolfe et al., 2021</xref>). ‘Black box’ models are popular in the artificial intelligence industry, especially in computer vision applications, where immense progress is being made in technologies such as self-driving cars and computer interpretation of images. However, in many of those applications, the interpretability of models is not as important as in medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petch et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In medicine, the interpretability of models is crucial since there is a need for discovering new biomarkers as well as identifying underlying biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Picard et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to advancements in artificial intelligence and NGS, a vast amount of research has been conducted to interpret highly complex machine-learning models; frameworks such as DeepLIFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shrikumar et al., 2017</xref>), Integrated Gradients (IG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ancona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sundararajan et al., 2017</xref>), and DeepExplain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shrikumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Samek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 2015</xref>) were developed in recent years with the purpose of debugging complicated machine-learning models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Despraz et al., 2017</xref>). These frameworks enable the usage of deep learning models for integrated multi-omics analysis through their ability to evaluate input attribution in models that are traditionally considered a ‘black box’. In multi-omics analysis, this means that it is possible to combine the entirety of the data from multiple data sources into a high-dimensional data structure and process it with deep learning models without losing interpretability. As output, an attribution score can be produced for every input, which may be interpreted as the relative importance of the feature in the model and used for further analysis.</p><p>Here, we present a framework for multi-omics analysis based on a convolutional deep learning network to find hidden, nonlinear patterns in spatially connected feature-rich multi-layered data. The spatial connection of the data is made by transforming the data into a multi-channel image in such a way that spatial connections between genes are captured and analyzed using convolutional layers. Using spatial connections between the data showed superior performance when compared to non-spatially data transformations. Furthermore, the trained model is combined with IG, which allows us to evaluate the relative contribution of individual features and thus decipher the underlying biology that drives the classification provided by the deep learning models. IG is a non-parametric approach that evaluates the trained model relative to input data and output label, resulting in attribution scores for each input with respect to the output label. In other words, IG represent the integral of gradients with respect to inputs along the path from a given baseline. By using IG, we provide an alternative solution to the problem posed by performing multiple independent statistical tests. Here, instead of performing multiple tests, a single analysis is performed by transforming multi-omics data into genome images, training a model, and inspecting it with IG. IG will output an attribution score for every gene included in the genome image. These can be ranked in order to retrieve a subset of the most associated genes relative to the output variable. We named the framework GENIUS (GEnome traNsformatIon and spatial representation of mUltiomicS data), and the methodology may be split into two parts, classification and interpretation. First, the key feature of GENIUS is that for classification, multi-omics data is transformed into multi-channel images where each gene is presented as a pixel in an image that covers the whole genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We then incorporate multiple types of omics data, such as mutation, expression, methylation, and copy number data, into the image as distinct layers. These layers are then used as input into the deep learning model for training against a binary or continuous outcome variable. Next, for interpretation, an attribution score is assigned to each feature using IG, allowing the user to extract information about which feature or features may drive a specific prediction based on deep learning analysis of input from multiple-omics data sources. In this work, we describe the development of the GENIUS framework and demonstrate its utility in predicting the development of metastatic cancer, patient age, chromosomal instability, cancer type, and as proof of concept, loss of TP53.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study overview.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The study utilized 2332 tumor samples representing six cancer types (bladder, uterine, stomach, ovarian, kidney, and colon) and transformed multi-omics data into images based on chromosome interaction networks.

Users may train their own or publicly sourced multi-omics data against a specified endpoint tailored to the user’s choice. The GENIUS framework thus overcomes the issue of multiple hypothesis testing and may provide new insights into the biology behind classification by deep learning models. The GENIUS framework is made available as a GitHub repository and may be used without restrictions to develop stratification models and inform about genome biology using multi-omics input.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GENIUS model architecture and hyperparameters</title><p>We designed a four-part convolutional neural network with the purpose of extracting the features from multi-dimensional data while minimizing the impact of noise in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The network was implemented using the PyTorch framework. The structure of the network is similar to an autoencoder architecture; however, the reconstruction of the genome image is not penalized. The motivation behind the implemented network structure is to use an encoder in order to learn how to compact genomic information into a small vector, L, forcing the network to extract relevant information from up to five data sources. The next module reconstructs the image from vector L, learns which features are important, reorganizes them optimally, and removes noise. The final module of the network uses a series of convolutions and max-pooling layers in order to extract information from the reconstructed image and, finally, predicts the outcome variable using a fully connected dense network.</p><p>The first part of the network is called the encoder, as its purpose is to encode the entire image to a vector of size 128, representing the latent representation of the input data, ‘L’. Next, the original image is reconstructed from L into its original size using a decoder module in the network. In this step, since we are not using the reconstruction loss, the network reconstructs the image of a genome which is optimal for information extraction. This is followed by the extractor module containing convolution and max-pooling layers aiming to extract relevant information from the reconstructed image. The final part of the network flattens the learned features obtained from previous layers, concatenates them with the L vector, and forwards it to a fully connected dense feed-forward network where the final prediction is made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LeNail, 2019</xref>). During training, the last module of this model was adopted to predict qualitative as well as quantitative types of data.</p><p>All models were trained with Adagrad optimizer with the following hyperparameters: starting learning rate = 9.9e−05 (including learning rate scheduler and early stopping), learning rate decay and weight decay = 1e−6, batch size = 256, except for memory-intensive chromosome images where the batch size of 240 was used. Adding chromosome interaction information to the data transformation showed improvement during training; next question was whether we should penalize the reconstruction of genome image during the training process. After multiple training scenarios and hyperparameter exploration, we concluded that by forcing the network to reconstruct genome images in the process of learning, we are limiting network performance. Instead, we used the appropriate loss function for prediction and allowed the network to reconstruct genome images that are optimal for making predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evaluating input image design</title><p>To evaluate the performance of GENIUS with an image-based transformation of input omics data, we tested four different image layouts of the genome. For each layout, we created a set of images where each sample is represented by one multi-channel image and each channel represented a specific type of omics data (gene expression, methylation, mutation, deletion, and amplification) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Each data type was encoded for each gene as a continuous value, where each gene was defined by a single pixel in each layer. We then tested the performance of the deep neural network on four different image layouts. First, we assembled the genome as a square image, measuring 198x198 pixels in total. Here, all genes were placed on the image sequentially according to their chromosomal locations, and individual chromosomes were organized by how close they were oriented in 3D space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sarnataro et al., 2017</xref>). Second, we tested an image organized by 24 × 3760 pixels, with 3760 pixels representing the most gene-rich chromosome, and each chromosome placed below the other on the image following the same order as in 198 × 198 images. Chromosomes containing fewer than 3760 genes had black pixels added to the end to create a rectangular image. Third, we tested a random 2D location, with each gene placed as a random pixel in a 198 × 198 pixel square image. Lastly, we tested an image of a single vector with all genes placed in a randomly ordered sequence.

Binary classifications and the multi-class classification used softmax as the output layer and the cross entropy loss function.

IG is an attribution method that assigns an ‘attribution score’ to each feature of the input data based on predictions the model makes. The attribution score is calculated based on the gradient associated with each feature of each image channel with respect to the output of the model. This information indicates to the neural network the extent of weight decrease or increases needed for certain features during the backpropagation process. Next, the created attribution images are used to extract information for each image channel and for every pixel. Since the pixels represent individual genes, this information can be reformatted and filtered to show the most important genes from every data source included in the analysis. All attribution scores were scaled using a min–max scaler for every cancer type to address biological differences between cancer types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Code availability</title><p>All code is available on the public GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mxs3203/GENIUS">https://github.com/mxs3203/GENIUS</ext-link>; copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sokač, 2023</xref>), where the framework is easily available for analysis of private or public data.

To evaluate the relevance of the spatial orientation of the genes relative to model performance, we tested four different image layouts (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): (1) Square image (198 × 198 pixels), each gene represented by one pixel ordered by chromosome position. Chromosomes are ordered by interaction coefficient based on Hi-C sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). (2) Square image (198 × 198 pixels), each gene is represented by one pixel located on the image in random order; thus, the 2D location carries no information. (3) Chromosome image (24 × 3760 pixels), each gene represented by one pixel ordered by chromosome position. Chromosomes are ordered by interaction coefficient based on Hi-C sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). (4) A flat, one-dimensional vector containing all features from the five data sources in random order. To evaluate the image layout, we used each type of layout to train against six biological states: (1) metastatic disease (stage IV vs. I–III), (2) cancer type, (3) burden of copy number alterations (defined by the wGII), (4) patient age, (5) TP53 status (where the TP53 pixel was set to ‘0’ for all samples), and (6) randomized tissue type (negative control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>). Every model output variable was trained until we observed no change in loss function or until validation loss values started increasing, indicating overfitting, which we handled by implementing early stopping.</p><p>While predicting metastatic disease, we observed that the Square Image data transformation outperformed all other data transformations, reaching a validation AUC of 0.87. The chromosome image and shuffled squared image performed similarly with AUC of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the flat vector of features scored validation AUC around 0.84; however, the loss function started increasing as training epochs increased, indicating that the model was overfitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the second scenario, we tested multi-class prediction using six cancer types in our dataset. Square Image outperformed other image layouts, reaching an <italic>F</italic>1 score of 0.81. Chromosome Image followed with an <italic>F</italic>1 score of 0.74, and the flat vector of features performed similarly to the random square image, reaching <italic>F</italic>1 scores of 0.66 and 0.71, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to address the framework’s capabilities for predicting numeric output variables, we used wGII and patient age. Predicting wGII showed that the flat vector of features reached the least favorable Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score of 0.22, where chromosome image, shuffled square image, and square image reached similar RMSE scores of 0.16, 0.15, and 0.14, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that data layout does not play a major role when predicting wGII as the number of events in the genome would be predictive regardless of location. The age prediction model using square image data transformation outperformed other data transformations and obtained a validation RMSE of 0.19. The shuffled image performed the worst, reaching an RMSE of 0.49, while the chromosome-organized image and flat vector of features scored similar RMSE values of 0.38 and 0.31, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, the flat vector was inconsistent during training, but it did outperform the chromosome image. In the fifth scenario, we predicted the TP53 mutation status but removed the TP53 mutation itself from the data. Square Image performed the best, reaching a validation AUC of 0.83, whereas no major difference could be observed between a flat vector of features and Chromosome Image, reaching a validation AUC of 0.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The L vector is considered the latent representation of the genome data because it extracts and captures the most relevant data with respect to the output variable. This implies that an optimally trained model would show a perfect latent representation of the genome when overlaid with the output variable. Furthermore, this vector was later appended into a feed-forward network when making the final prediction. This way, the model had access to extracted information before and after image reconstruction. In order to visually inspect patterns captured by the model, we extracted the latent representations of each genome and performed the UMAP of the data to project it into two dimensions. We observed that all training scenarios successfully utilized genome images to make predictions that clustered into distinct groups, with the exception of Age. As expected, randomized cancer type, which served as negative control, also performed poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

This analysis included primary tumors from six cancer types, a total of 2307 tumors, with 53% progressing to metastatic disease BLCA (277 metastatic/133 not-metastatic), OV (535 metastatic/47 not-metastatic), COAD (196 metastatic/254 not-metastatic), STAD (230 metastatic/189 not-metastatic), KIRC (208 metastatic/326 not-metastatic), and UCEC (117 metastatic/394 not-metastatic). The omics data types included somatic mutations, gene expression, methylation, copy number gain, and copy number loss. Using holdout type cross-validation, where we split the data into training (75%) and validation (25%), we observed a generally high performance of GENIUS, with a validation AUC of 0.83 for predicting metastatic disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The GENIUS framework allows us to explore the attribution of individual data layers to the final prediction. Across the cohort, gene expression and methylation data were generally the most informative data layers when it comes to classifying metastatic disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To identify the individual genes driving the prediction, we pulled the 100 genes with the highest methylation attribution according to the GENIUS classification. We observed that many methylated regions overlapped between the six cancer types. These regions included methylation on specific regions of chromosomes 1, 6, 11, 17, and 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, OV showed a unique methylation pattern spanning most of chromosome 7, while KIRC, COAD, and BLCA displayed regions of overlapping methylation on chromosome 22. We also noticed that mutation data often had a single mutation with a large attribution score while expression and methylation showed multiple genes with high attribution scores. To determine the genes that overall across the multi-omics data analysis contributed the most to the GENIUS classification of metastatic disease, we normalized gene attribution by cancer type and compared the top 50 genes for each cancer type (total of 152 genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Unsurprisingly, we observed that TP53 mutations held the highest attribution score, followed by mutations to VHL. Both of these genes are well-established drivers of cancer and were previously reported as enriched in metastatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pandey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen et al., 2022</xref>), likely representing a more aggressive disease. However, of the 152 top genes, we noted only 11 genes previously reported as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in the COSMIC cancer gene census (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, indicated with a star), leaving 141/152 as potentially novel cancer genes. The highest scoring gene not previously associated with cancer was SLC3A1, the expression of which was found to be strongly associated with metastatic disease in clear cell renal cancer. SLC3A1 gene is a protein-coding gene associated with the transportation of amino acids in the renal tubule and intestinal tract, and aberrations in this gene have been associated with cystinuria, a metabolic disorder of the kidneys, bladder, and ureter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Woodard et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we identified PLVAP, often involved in MAPK cascades as well as in cellular regulatory pathways and the tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway. In BLCA, one of our most significant findings was increased expression of KRT17, a gene associated with a cytoskeletal signaling pathway, glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network, and MHC class II receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2021</xref>). KRT17 has previously been reported as a potential cancer gene, but with an uncertain role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Across cancer types, TOP3A was found to be commonly methylated in BLCA, COAD, STAD, and UCEC. TOP3A is associated with homology-directed repair and methylation may lead to increased chromosomal instability, a hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>).

For this analysis, we considered only the methylation and gene-expression-associated genes from the TCGA analysis.

We then combined the methylation and gene-expression-based attribution scores and took the top 10 genes: RBMX, COL7A1, KRT17, JUP, WIPI2, TOP3A, EIF3B, WTAP, POTEI, and MRRF. Next, we implemented 10 multivariate Cox proportional hazard models (one for each gene), including available clinical parameters such as tumor stage, gender, neoantigen burden and baseline performance status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This showed that in multivariate analysis, 7/10 genes had a significant association with outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

In 1000 runs, not one returned at least 7 significant genes (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The median percentage of significant genes for each run is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. Next, we performed two independent analyses, comparing the expression values of the top 10 genes between either (1) tumors defined as stage IV versus stages I and III, and (2) patients that responded to immunotherapy (CR and PR) versus patients that did not respond to immunotherapy (stable disease [SD] and progressive disease [PD]). Following correction for multiple hypothesis testing, we observed that TOP3A showed significantly increased expression in stage IV tumors, while JUP and KRT17 were significantly increased in stage I–III tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, brown dots). When comparing gene expression to response to immunotherapy, TOP3A, RBMX, and WIPI2 were significantly more expressed in complete response (CR)/partial response (PR) while KRT17 and COL7A1 were significantly more expressed in SD/PD. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of TOP3A in stage IV tumors, suggesting a role in metastatic disease, yet we also observed that the same gene was more expressed in tumors that responded to immunotherapy. This suggests that TOP3A is associated with the development of metastatic disease, but its expression may result in the development of a bladder cancer phenotype that is more sensitive to checkpoint immunotherapy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Validation on late-stage immunotherapy-treated bladder cancer (Mariathasan).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Forest plot showing top 10 expressed/methylated genes in multivariate cox proportional hazard model.

We again investigated the top 10 methylated or expressed genes found in the TCGA analysis of BLCA, using the gene expression data from UROMOL. First, we performed Cox proportional hazard analysis with progression-free survival (PFS) using the top 10 genes found by the GENIUS framework, again creating 10 individual models containing the selected genes and available clinical factors such as age, tumor stage, and sex. This showed that in multivariate analysis, 5/10 genes had a significant association with outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The results were compared with cox proportional hazard models utilizing random sets of 10 genes, repeated 1000 times.

The model architecture was evaluated in six different training scenarios, with a focus on validating the prediction of metastatic cancer. In this process, we also evaluated four different image layouts, concluding that of these, projecting the genome into a 198 × 198 square image with genes organized based on chromosome interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sarnataro et al., 2017</xref>) performed the best. While that spatial organization improved the prediction, we recognize that there may exist a more optimal representation of multi-omics data which should be explored further in future work. Potential methods for organizing gene orientation in a multi-channel image could consider integrating topologically associating domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beagan and Phillips-Cremins, 2020</xref>) along with the spatial information from Hi-C. With the current implementation of GENIUS, gene layout can be set manually by the user to explore this issue further. For GENIUS, we have also included an auto-encoder in the network to recreate the input information without reconstruction loss. In this manner, the model itself can reconstruct the image of a genome in a format that is optimal for the prediction it is trying to make. The model also produces a latent representation of multi-omics data in a shape of a vector of a size 128 (L), which is later concatenated in a model when making final predictions. In order to investigate training effectiveness, we performed a UMAP clustering analysis of the L vector, where we compared the 2D representation of L with the variables of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is clear from this analysis that the L vector itself holds information that may be particularly relevant for multi-class prediction, but further analysis is needed to decipher what information is encoded in the L vector.</p><p>The main purpose behind the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging the power of deep learning techniques optimized for image analysis to interpret genome-derived multi-omics data. A key element of this approach includes the transformation of genomic data into images with genes arranged as pixels organized by chromosomal location. Beyond the readout from multi-omics data, this approach provides spatial information to the deep learning framework, which significantly improves the performance of the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the utility of spatial information and to provide a ready-to-use framework that incorporates spatial information and deep learning for the analysis of genome-derived multi-omics data. Furthermore, within the GENIUS framework, we facilitate the interpretation of the trained model in order to explore the biology behind the prediction without the need for data preprocessing and multiple hypothesis correction. This was achieved by combining a deep learning network with IG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sundararajan et al., 2017</xref>), allowing us to infer the attribution score for the input, resulting in non-parametric, ready-to-analyze output.</p><p>For every cancer type included in the dataset, we listed the top 10 genes driving metastatic disease and investigated in detail genes associated with BLCA metastasis and aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For this, we used two independent cohorts, one representing late-stage and metastatic cancer, and one representing early-stage cancer. In both cohorts, we tested if methylation and expression of genes found by the GENIUS framework were associated with survival at higher rates than when compared to randomly picked genes. In the late-stage BLCA cohort, seven out of 10 genes were significantly associated with overall survival, while in the early-stage BLCA cohort, we found that five out of 10 were significantly associated with PFS. That the results in the early-stage bladder cancer cohort (UROMOL) are less significant may relate to the model being trained to predict metastatic cancer. It is likely that the drivers of malignancy are different in early relative to late-stage disease, thus the top 10 genes found by GENIUS might not be prognostic in early-stage setting. In this regard, it is also worth noting that two of the top 10 genes (RBMX and KRT17) were associated with poor outcome in late-stage disease, while they were associated with improved outcome in early-stage disease. Interestingly, in the late-stage bladder cancer cohort, we observed that high expression of TOP3A associated with stage IV disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, we also observed that high expression associated with improved response to immunotherapy. It is known that TOP3A has an important role in homology-directed repair and loss may be associated with chromosomal instability, which has shown a positive association with immunotherapy response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhoum and Cantley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sokač et al., 2022</xref>), potentially offering a likely explanation for this finding. Similarly, we observed that KRT17 was enriched in stages I–III, suggesting it may be associated with a less aggressive disease type. However, in the immunotherapy-treated cohort, KRT17 is associated with poor response to immunotherapy. In previous studies, KRT17 has been reported as associated with the development of metastatic disease, MHC type II receptor activity and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2021</xref>). This indicates that the KRT17 gene plays an important role as tumor suppressor gene in early-stage cancer, and that loss may further promote the development of aggressive, metastatic disease. While further research in this field is required to properly assess the utility of the reported genes, this work provides a framework that unlocks powerful machine-learning for more direct analysis of multi-omics data.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of BLCA genes in two validation cohorts.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Gene</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Early stage</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Late stage (immunotherapy)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">TOP3A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HR &gt; 0 (PFS), high grade, high EORTC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HR = 0 (OS), enriched in stage IV, enriched in CR/PR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalyses the transient breaking and rejoining of a single strand of DNA, involved in regulation of recombination and homology-directed repair.

Interestingly they find that the spatial representation of genes on chromosomes and the order of chromosomes based on 3D contacts leads to best performance. This supports that both 1D proximity and 3D proximity could be important for predicting different phenotypes. I appreciate that the code is made available as a github repository. The authors use their method to investigate different cancers and identify novel genes potentially involved in these cancers. Overall, I found this study important for the field.</p><p>In the original submission there were several major points with this manuscript could be grouped in three parts:</p><p>1. While the authors have provided validation for their model, it is not always clear that best approaches have been used. This has now been addressed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>2. Potential improvement to the method</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>It is very encouraging the use of HiC data, but the authors used a very coarse approach to integrate it (by computing the chromosome order based on interaction score). We know that genes that are located far away on the same chromosome can interact more in 3D space than genes that are relatively close in 1D space. Did the authors consider this aspect? Why not group genes based on them being located in the same TAD? In the revised version of the manuscript, the authors discussed this possibility but did not do any new additional analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Authors claim that &quot;given that methylation negatively correlates with gene expression, these were considered together&quot;. This is clearly not always the case.

The GENIUS GitHub repository provides a collection of analysis scripts and not a finished software solution (e.g. command line tool or other user interface) (the presented scripts do not even suffice for a software prototype). In detail, the README on their GitHub repository is largely incomplete and reads analogous to an incomplete and poorly documented analysis script and is far from serving as a manual for a generic software solution (this claim was made in the manuscript).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight, and we have now invested considerable resources into making the documentation more detailed and accurate. We have created a new GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mxs3203/GENIUS">https://github.com/mxs3203/GENIUS</ext-link>) that contains a small set of example data and all the necessary scripts to run GENIUS. The README file guides the user through each step of the GENIUS framework but it also contains a bash script that runs all the steps at once. When a user would like to use it on their own data, they need to replace the input data with their data but in the same format as the example input data. This is now fully documented in the README file. All scripts have arguments that can be used to point to custom data. The entire pipeline using example data can be run using run_<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genius.sh">genius.sh</ext-link> script. This script will produce CSV files and PNG files inside the ExtractWithIG folder containing attribution scores for every cancer type tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should invest substantially into adding more details on how data can be retrieved (with example code) from the cited databases and how such data should then be curated alongside the input genome to generically create the &quot;genomic image&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Data for analysis can be sourced from multiple locations, what we have used in our examples and for development was based on data from the TCGA. It can be retrieved from the official TCGA data hub or through Xena Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://xenabrowser.net/">https://xenabrowser.net/</ext-link>). However, the data formats are generic, and similar data types (mutation, expression, methylation, copy number) can be obtained from multiple sources. We have added example data to demonstrate the layout, and we have a script included that creates the layout from standard mutation, expression, methylation and copy number data formats. We have substantially improved the annotations, including detailed descriptions of the data layout along with examples, and we have, as part of our validation, had an independent person test run the scripts using TCGA example data we provided on the new GitHub page.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, when looking at the source code, parameter configurations for training and running various modules of GENIUS were hard-coded into the source code and users would have to manually change them in the source code rather than as command line flags in the software call. Furthermore, file paths to the local machine of the author are hard-coded in the source code, suggesting that images are sourced from a local folder and won't work when other users wish to replicate the analysis with other data. I would strongly recommend building a comprehensive command line tool where parameter and threshold configurations can be generically altered by the user via command line flags.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, we have changed the code and removed all hard-coded paths. All paths are now relative to the script using them. Furthermore, we made the config file more visible and easier to use. The example run can be found on the new github repository we linked in the previous comment.</p><p>We also inserted the following text in the manuscript</p><p>The GitHub repository contains example data and instructions on how to use the GENIUS framework.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A comprehensive manual would need to be provided to ensure that users can easily run GENIUS with other types of input data (since this is the claim of the manuscript). Overall, due to the lack of documentation and hard-coded local-machine folder paths it was impossible to computationally reproduce this study or run GENIUS in general.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, we have completely reworked the code base, and extensively annotated the code. We have also made highly detailed step-by-step instructions that should enable any user to run GENIUS on their own or public data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In the Introduction the authors write: &quot;To correct for such multiple hypothesis testing, drastic adjustments of p-values are often applied which ultimately leads to the rejection of all but the most significant results, likely eliminating a large number of weaker but true associations.&quot;. While this is surely true for any method attempting to separate noise from signal, their argument fails to substantiate how their data transformation will solve this issue. Data transformation and projection onto an image for deep-learning processing will only shift the noise-to-signal evaluation process to the postprocessing steps and won't &quot;magically&quot; solve it during training.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The data transformation does not solve the problem of multiple hypothesis testing but it facilitates the use of computer vision algorithms and frameworks on rich multi-omics data. Importantly, transforming the data into genome images, training the model, and inspecting it with integrated gradients can be interpreted as running a single test on all of the data.</p><p>Analyzing multiomics data using classical statistical methods typically means that we perform extensive filtering of the data, removing genes with poor expression/methylation/mutation scores, and then e.g. perform logistic regression against a desired outcome, or alternatively, perform multiple statistical tests comparing each genomic feature independently against a desired outcome. Either way, information is lost during initial filtering and we must correct the analysis for each statistical test performed. While this increases confidence in whichever observation remains significant, it also undoubtedly means that we discard true positives. Additionally, classical statistical methods such as those mentioned here do not assume a spatial connection between data points, thus any relevant information relating to spatial organization is lost.</p><p>Instead, we propose the use of the GENIUS framework for multiomics analysis. The GENIUS framework is based on deep neural nets and relies on Convolutions and their ability to extract interactions between the data points. This particularly considers spatial information, which is not possible using classical statistical methods such as logistic regression where the most similar approach to this would include creating many models with many interactions.</p><p>Furthermore, integrated gradients is a non-parametric approach that simply evaluates the trained model relative to input data and output label, resulting in attribution for each input with respect to the output label. In other words, integrated gradients represent the integral of gradients with respect to inputs along the path from a given baseline to input. The integral is described in Author response image 1:</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87133-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>More about integrated gradients can be read on the Captum webpage(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://captum.ai/docs/introduction">https://captum.ai/docs/introduction</ext-link>) or in original paper <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365</ext-link>.</p><p>Since we transformed the data into a data structure (genome image) that assumes a spatial connection between genes, trained the model using convolutional neural networks and analyzed the model using integrated gradients, we can treat the results without any parametric assumption. As a particular novelty, we can sort the list based on attribution score and take top N genes as our candidate biomarkers for the variable of interest and proceed with downstream analysis or potentially functional validation in an in vitro setting. In this manner, the reviewer is correct that the signal-to-noise evaluation is shifted to the post-processing steps. However, the benefit of the GENIUS framework is particularly that it enables integration of multiple data sources without any filtering, and with constructing a novel data structure that facilitates investigation of spatial dependency between data points, thus potentially revealing novel genes or biomarkers that were previously removed through filtering steps. However, further downstream validation of these hits remains critical.</p><p>We added the following paragraph to make this more clear</p><p>&quot;Integrated Gradients is a non-parametric approach that evaluates the trained model relative to input data and output label, resulting in attribution scores for each input with respect to the output label. In other words, Integrated Gradients represent the integral of gradients with respect to inputs along the path from a given baseline. By using Integrated Gradients, we provide an alternative solution to the problem posed by performing multiple independent statistical tests. Here, instead of performing multiple tests, a single analysis is performed by transforming multiomics data into genome images, training a model, and inspecting it with Integrated Gradients. Integrated Gradients will output an attribution score for every gene included in the genome image and those can be ranked in order to retrieve a subset of the most associated genes relative to the output variable.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, multiple-testing correction is usually done based on one particular data source (e.g.expression data), while their approach claims to integrate five very different genomic data sources with different levels and structures of technical noise. How are these applications comparable and how is the training procedure able to account for these different structures of technical noise? Please provide sufficient evidence for making this claim (especially in the postprocessing steps after classification).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that there will be different technical noise for each data source. However, each data source is already processed by standardized pipelines used for interpreting sequence-level data into gene expression, mutations, copy number alterations and methylation levels. Thus, sequence-level technical noise is not evaluated as part of the GENIUS analysis. Nevertheless, the reviewer is correct that sample-level technical noise, such as low tumor purity or poor quality sequencing, undoubtedly can affect the GENIUS predictions, as is true for all types of sequence analysis. As part of GENIUS, an initial data preprocessing step (which is performed automatically as part of the image generation), is that each data source is normalized within that source and linearly scaled in range zero to one (min-max scaling). This normalization step means that the impact of different events within and between data sources are comparable since the largest/smallest value from one data source will be comparable to the largest/smallest value from another data source.</p><p>Additionally, deep neural networks, particularly convolutional networks, have been shown to be very robust to different levels of technical noise (Jang, McCormack, and Tong 2021; Du et al. 2022). In the manuscript we show the attribution scores for different cancer types in figure 3B of the paper. Here, the top genes include established cancer genes such as P53, VHL, PTEN, APC and PIK3CA, indicating that the attribution scores based on GENIUS analysis is a valid tool to identify potential genes of interest. Furthermore, when focusing the analysis on predicting metastatic bladder cancer, we were able to show that of the top 10 genes with the highest attribution scores, 7 showed significant association with poor outcome in an independent validation cohort of mostly metastatic patients (shown in figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I didn't find any computational benchmark of GENIUS.

The mathematical definitions of deep neural networks are extensive and not commonly included in research publications utilizing deep learning.

In the recent light of criticism when using the first two dimensions of UMAP projections with omics data, what is the evidence in support of the author's claim that model accuracy can be quantified with such a 2D UMAP projection?

The UMAP was done on L, the latent vector, which by assumption should capture the most important information from the “genome image”. In order to confirm this, we plotted the first two dimensions of UMAP transformation and colored the points by the output variable. If the model was capturing noise, there should not be any patterns on the plot (randomized cancer-type panel). Since, in most cases, we do see an association between the first two UMAP dimensions and the output variable, we were confident that the model was not modeling (extracting) noise.</p><p>To clarify this, we changed the sentence in the manuscript so it is more clear that this is not an estimation of accuracy but only an initial inspection of the models:</p><p>The UMAP projected latent representations into two dimensions which could then be visualized.

Did I understand correctly that all negative controls performed poorly? How can the authors make any claims if the controls fail?

Randomized cancer type was used as a negative control since we expect that model would not be able to make sense of the data if predicting randomized cancer type. As expected, the model failed to predict the randomized cancer types. This can be seen in Figure 2C, where UMAP representations (based on the latent representation of the data, the vector L) are made for each output variable. Not seeing any patterns in UMAP shows that, as expected, the model does not know how to extract useful information from “genome image” when predicting randomized cancer type (as when randomly shuffling the labels there is no genomic information to decipher). Similar patterns were observed for Age, indicating that patient age cannot be determined from the multi-omics data. Conversely, when GENIUS was trained against wGII, TP53, metastatic status, and cancer type, we observed that samples clustered according to the output label.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Birkbak and colleagues use a novel approach to transform multi-omics datasets in images and apply Deep Learning methods for image analysis. Interestingly they find that the spatial representation of genes on chromosomes and the order of chromosomes based on 3D contacts leads to best performance. This supports that both 1D proximity and 3D proximity could be important for predicting different phenotypes. I appreciate that the code is made available as a github repository. The authors use their method to investigate different cancers and identify novel genes potentially involved in these cancers. Overall, I found this study important for the field.</p><p>The major points of this manuscript could be grouped in three parts:</p><p>1. While the authors have provided validation for their model, it is not always clear that best approaches have been used.</p><p>a) In the methods there is no mention of a validation dataset. I would like to see the authors training on a cancer from one cohort and predict on the same cancer from a different cohort. This will convince the reader that their model can generalise. They do something along those lines for the bladder cancer, but no performance is reported. At the very least they should withhold a percentage of the data for validation. Maybe train on 100 and validate on the remaining 300 samples. They might have already done something along these lines, but it was not clear from the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologize for not being sufficiently clear in the manuscript. We did indeed validate the performance within the TCGA cohort, using holdout cross validation. Here, we trained the network on 75% of the cohort samples (N = 3825), and tested on the remaining 25% (N = 1276).</p><p>To make this more clear, we have rewritten section “GENIUS classification identifies tumors likely to become metastatic” as such:</p><p>&quot;The omics data types included somatic mutations, gene expression, methylation, copy number gain and copy number loss. Using holdout type cross-validation, where we split the data into training (75%) and validation (25%), we observed a generally high performance of GENIUS, with a validation AUC of 0.83 for predicting metastatic disease (Figure 2B).&quot;</p><p>We also added the following sentence in the legend of Figure 2:</p><p>&quot;The x-axis represents epochs and y-axis represents AUC score of fixed 25% data we used for accuracy assessment within TCGA cohort.&quot;</p><p>The accuracy of GENIUS could not be validated on the other two bladder cohorts since they do not contain all the data for the creation of five-dimensional genome images. However, we were able to investigate if the genes with the highest attribution scores towards metastatic bladder cancer obtained based on the TCGA samples also showed a significant association with poor outcome in the two independent bladder cancer cohorts. Here, we observed that of the top 10 genes with the highest attribution scores, 5 were associated with poor outcome in the early stage bladder cancer cohort, and 7 were associated with poor outcome in the late stage/metastatic bladder cancer cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It was not clear how they used &quot;randomised cancer types as the negative control&quot;. Why not use normal tissue data or matched controls?</p></disp-quote><p>In the study, we built six models, one for each variable of interest. One of them was cancer type which performed quite well. In order to assess the model on randomized data, we randomized the labels of cancer type and tried predicting that. This served as “negative control” since we expected the model to perform poorly in this scenario. To make this more clear in the manuscript, we have expanded the description in the main text. We have also added the description of this to each supplementary plot to clarify this further.</p><p>While normal tissue and matched controls would have been an optimal solution, unfortunately, such data is not available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) If Figure 2B, the authors claim they have used cross validation.

As described above, we used holdout cross-validation to train and evaluate the model. We clarified this in the text:</p><p>&quot;Using holdout type cross-validation, where we split the data into training (80%) and validation(20%), we observed a generally high performance of GENIUS, with a mean validation AUC of0.83 (Figure 2B)&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Potential improvement to the method</p><p>a) It is very encouraging the use of HiC data, but the authors used a very coarse approach to integrate it (by computing the chromosome order based on interaction score). We know that genes that are located far away on the same chromosome can interact more in 3D space than genes that are relatively close in 1D space. Did the authors consider this aspect? Why not group genes based on them being located in the same TAD?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we will start looking into how to use TAD information to create another genome representation. In this study, we tried several genome transformations, which proved to be superior compared to a flat vector of features (no transformation). We are aware that squared genome transformation might not be optimal, so we designed the network that reconstructs the genome image during the training. This way, the genome image is optimized for the output variable of choice by the network itself. However, we note that the order of the genes themselves, while currently based on HiC, can be changed by the user. The order is determined by a simple input file which can be changed by the user with the argument “all_genes_included”. Thus, different orderings can be tested within the overall square layout. This is now detailed in the instructions on the new GitHub page.</p><p>The convolutional neural network uses a kernel size of 3x3, which captures the patterns of genes positioned close to each other but also genes that are far away from each other (potentially on another chromosome). Once convolutions extract patterns from the image, the captured features are used in a feed-forward neural network that makes a final prediction using all extracted features/patterns regardless of their location in the genome image.</p><p>We also inserted the following sentence in discussion:</p><p>&quot;Given that spatial organization improved the prediction, we recognize that there may exist a more optimal representation of multi-omics data which should be explored further in future work. Potential methods for organizing gene orientation in a 2D image could consider integrating topologically associating domains[39] along with the spatial information from HiC. This is already possible to explore with the current implementation of GENIUS, where gene layout can be set manually by the user.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Authors claim that &quot;given that methylation negatively correlates with gene expression, these were considered together&quot;. This is clearly not always the case. See for example <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02728-5">https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02728-5</ext-link>. What would happen if they were not considered together?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We agree with the reviewer that methylation does not always result in lower expression, although methylation levels in most cases should correlate negatively to RNA expression, but with a gene-specific factor. Indeed, there are tools developed that infer RNA expression based on methylation, making use of gene-specific correction factors. E.g. Mattesen et al (Mattesen, Andersen, and Bramsen 2021).</p><p>However, upon reflection we agree with the reviewer that we cannot assume for all genes that methylation equals low expression. Therefore, we have performed an analysis where we compared the methylation level to gene expression levels for all tested genes within bladder cancer. We computed Pearson’s correlation of 16,456 genes that have both methylation and expression scores. Of these, 8528 showed a negative correlation. After p-value correction, this resulted in 4774 genes where methylation was significantly negatively associated with expression. For these genes we performed the subsequent analysis in bladder cancer, where methylation and expression were considered together. This updated analysis has been included in supplementary figure 10, and the results section has been amended to reflect this. Overall, this analysis resulted in 4 of 10 genes being replaced in the downstream analysis. However, we note that the final results did not materially change, nor did the conclusions.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Correlation between gene-level methylation and gene expression in TCGA BLCA cohort.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87133-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Figure 3B shows the attribution scores scaled within the cancer type, where Figure 3A shows raw attribution scores for each data source included. The reason for this is that methylation and expression have in general, smaller attribution scores but more events where a single mutation often is characterized with large attribution scores and the rest of them with very small attribution.
