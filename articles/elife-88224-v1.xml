The kinase domain of unphosphorylated WNK1 (uWNK1) is an asymmetric dimer possessing water molecules conserved in multiple uWNK1 crystal structures. Conserved waters are present in two networks, referred to here as conserved water networks 1 and 2 (CWN1 and CWN2). Here, we show that PEG400 applied to crystals of dimeric uWNK1 induces de-dimerization. Both the WNK1 the water networks and the chloride-binding site are disrupted by PEG400. CWN1 is surrounded by a cluster of pan-WNK-conserved charged residues. Here, we mutagenized these charges in WNK3, a highly active WNK isoform kinase domain, and WNK1, the isoform best studied crystallographically. Mutation of E314 in the Activation Loop of WNK3 (WNK3/E314Q and WNK3/E314A, and the homologous WNK1/E388A) enhanced the rate of autophosphorylation, and reduced chloride sensitivity. Other WNK3 mutants reduced the rate of autophosphorylation activity coupled with greater chloride sensitivity than wild-type. The water and chloride regulation thus appear linked. The lower activity of some mutants may reflect effects on catalysis. Crystallography showed that activating mutants introduced conformational changes in similar parts of the structure to those induced by PEG400. WNK activating mutations and crystallography support a role for CWN1 in WNK inhibition consistent with water functioning as an allosteric ligand.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>water</kwd><kwd>osmosensor</kwd><kwd>WNK1</kwd><kwd>WNK3</kwd><kwd>chloride ion</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000983</institution-id><institution>Mary Kay Ash Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Liliana R Teixeira</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teixeira</surname><given-names>Liliana R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK110358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akella</surname><given-names>Radha</given-names></name><name><surname>Humphreys</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Haixia</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldsmith</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I1128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldsmith</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-2100-20220331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teixeira</surname><given-names>Liliana R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP190421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akella</surname><given-names>Radha</given-names></name><name><surname>Humphreys</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Haixia</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldsmith</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Endowment from Patti Bell Brown</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldsmith</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>WNKs sense osmotic pressure by binding specific water molecules to the inactive dimeric configuration of WNK1 and WNK3, integrating signals with chloride inhibition as demonstrated by mutagenesis and structure.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><underline>W</underline>ith <underline>N</underline>o <underline>L</underline>ysine (WNK) kinases are soluble intracelluar serine–threonine kinases noted for their unique active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xu et al., 2000</xref>) and their association with familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>). WNKs are the chloride-inhibited protein kinases long anticipated to control the activity of cation chloride cotransporters in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lytle and Forbush, 1992</xref>). Previous data have implicated WNKs as homeostatic regulators of the intracellular milieu with respect to ions and osmotic pressure (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Goldsmith and Rodan, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Richardson and Alessi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shekarabi et al., 2017</xref>). WNKs are activated by osmotic stress in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xu et al., 2000</xref>) and are inhibited by chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Piala et al., 2014</xref>). How chloride binds and inhibits the WNK1 kinase domain is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Piala et al., 2014</xref>), but how osmotic stress affects WNKs is only partially understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Osmotic pressure is a demand on solvent. Osmolytes are thought to mimic osmotic pressure by affecting waters of hydration on proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colombo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Leitner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">LiCata and Allewell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Parsegian et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Timasheff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). WNKs have unique conserved conformation-specific cavities and corresponding water networks. WNKs de-dimerize and activate in osmolytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2021</xref>). A similar de-dimerization and activation occurs under hydrostatic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Humphreys et al., 2023</xref>) suggesting the phenomena are related. Here we use crystallography to directly observe the effects of osmolytes on uWNK1 molecular structure, including de-dimerization and secondary structure changes. Mutagenesis of residues that line the largest water cavity, primarily using WNK3, probe the importance of the water network to WNK activity, regulation, and structure.</p><p>Previous crystallographic data have shown that the kinase domain of unphosphorylated WNK1 (WNK1/SA) adopts an asymmetric dimer configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Min et al., 2004</xref>). Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) shows that the unphosphorylated kinase domain of WNK3 (uWNK3) adopts a similar configuration. Phosphorylated kinase domains of WNK1 and WNK3 (pWNK1 and pWNK3, ‘p’ for phosphorylated) are monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akella et al., 2020</xref>) (PDB files 5W7T and 5O26). Chloride ion is a pan-WNK inhibitor that binds uWNK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Piala et al., 2014</xref>). Osmolytes induced de-dimerization as observed by static light scattering (SLS) and SAXS in both uWNK1 and uWNK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2021</xref>). A model for WNK regulation, then, is the presence of a dimer–monomer equilibrium: the dimer is inactive and binds inhibitory ligands; the monomer is autophosphorylation-competent. We described previously that the inactive dimer uWNK1 has more bound water than the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2021</xref>). This is counter-intuitive, since the dimer should have a smaller surface area than the monomer. Instead, networks of water molecules present in cavities within the folded protein were independently observed in two uWNK1 structures (PDB files 6CN9 and 5DRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>]). The largest water network is conserved water network 1 (CWN1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Comparison of the water structure in the inactive dimer versus the PEG400-induced conformation suggests that water functions as an inhibitor, binding and stabilizing an inactive WNK configuration. Furthermore, the osmolyte PEG400 favors a structure with less bound water.</p><p>Mutagenic analysis was performed on pan-WNK-conserved residues surrounding the water network CWN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we analyzed the effect of mutations in CWN1-binding residues on WNK activity and regulation, anticipating that activating mutations will be found. Given the location of CWN1 in the active site, it is also anticipated that many mutants will negatively affect catalysis or substrate binding and be inhibitory. The mutagenic study was carried out primarily on WNK3, the kinase domain most active and most sensitive to osmotic pressure among WNK kinase domains tested. Although many mutants were inhibitory, activating mutations, WNK3/E314A and WNK3/E314Q were identified. The corresponding mutations were introduced in WNK1, exhibiting similar activation. WNK3/E314A crystallized and the conformational changes are described.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conserved water networks in WNKs</title><p>Available structures of unphosphorylated WNK kinase domains possess networks of bound water molecules.

The structure observed in glycerol-soaked crystals was very similar to the previously determined uWNK1/SA structure 6CN9 (r.m.s.d. 0.19 Å), including a few glycerol molecules. No PEG400 was observed in uWNK1/SA/PEG400. Remarkably, PEG400 induced a space group change from P1 to P2<sub>1</sub>. Together with the space group change, uWNK1/SA in PEG400 monomerizes. To understand the conformational change, the WNK1/SA/PEG400 structure was indexed in P1 and origin selected to place the 6CN9 dimer in the asymmetric unit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

WNK kinase domains exhibit multiple conformers. Inactive forms of both WNK1 (crystallography) and WNK3 (SAXS data) form asymmetric dimers. Prior data showed that chloride ion binds and promotes the inactive dimer, whereas osmolytes, in vitro surrogates for osmotic pressure, de-dimerize WNK kinase domains. Prior crystallographic data implicate a highly unique water-binding site, the AL-CL Cluster, in the inactive WNK1 dimer, as compared with typical protein kinases. Data presented here show that PEG400 applied to crystals of WNK1 rearranged and eliminated the AL-CL Cluster and the associated network of water molecules, CWN1. PEG400 also eliminated the chloride-binding site and all the waters in CWN2. Apparently, the water networks can be allosteric ligands that promote the inactive structure of WNKs.</p><p>We probed the potential role of the water cluster CWN1 as an allosteric ligand by mutating residues in the AL-CL Cluster. Changes in autophosphorylation activity and chloride sensitivity were observed. Some AL-CL Cluster mutants, studied primarily in WNK3, were more monomeric than wild-type. Among the mutants assayed, WNK3/E314A,Q and WNK1/E388A exhibited enhanced activity. The enhanced activity of these mutants supports the hypothesis that the dimer is inhibitory and that CWN1 promotes the dimer. Crystallography of WNK3/E314A shows that it exhibits conformational differences at the same loci as observed by PEG400 applied to crystals of WNK1.</p><p>Several mutants were less active than wild-type. The mechanisms for the reduced activity are unclear. However, since the AL-CL Cluster and CWN1 are in the enzyme active site, reduced activity may be due to effects on substrate binding or catalysis.</p><p>Not all of the data presented here are easily interpreted in the framework of our inactive dimer-active monomer model. First, the activity and chloride sensitivity appear coupled in the AL-CL Cluster mutants. Mutants were either more active and less chloride sensitive, or less active and more chloride sensitive. The less chloride-sensitive mutants can be understood as arising from destabilization of the chloride-binding helix and the dimer. We have no interpretation so far for the enhanced chloride sensitivity of the low activity mutants. Second, ADP Glo assays, compatible with the crowding agent PEG400, showed a PEG-induced activation of substrate phosphorylation, consistent with our model. Among the active mutants, though, no single mutant abolished PEG sensitivity.</p><p>It has been posited recently that intracellular water potential is very tightly regulated in the face of osmotic and thermal stresses, and that water itself is the likely entity sensed to elicit responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). The present structural data support the idea that water is directly sensed in WNKs.

Prior work by the authors has shown that these enzymes are activated by PEG400 or ethylene glycol and inhibited by chloride ion, and that activation is associated with a conformational transition from dimer to monomer. In X-ray structures of the WNK1/SA inactive dimer, a water-mediated hydrogen bond network was observed between the catalytic loop (CL) and the activation loop (AL), named CWN1. This led to the proposal that bound water may be part of the osmosensing mechanism.</p><p>The current study carries this work further, by applying PEG400 to Xtals of dimeric WNK1/SA. This results in a change in kinase conformation and space group, along with 4-9 fewer waters in CWN1 and the complete disappearance of another water cluster (CWN2) located at the dimer interface. Six conserved residues lining the CWN1 pocket in WNK3 are mutated to determine effects on activity and inhibition by chloride ion (measured by AL autophosphorylation) and monomer-dimer interconversion (light scattering).</p><p>The results show that two mutants (E314Q/A in WNK3) at a site central to the water cluster result in increased kinase activity (autophosphorylation), and increased SLS, interpreted as aggregation. Three sites (D279A, Y346F, M301A) inhibit kinase activity with varying effects on oligomerization - Y346A and M301A retain monomer-dimer ratios similar to WT while D279N promotes aggregation.

It is proposed that dimeric WNK is inactive and bound to some conserved water molecules, and that monomerization/activation involves departure of these waters. New data here include a crystal structure of monomeric WNK1 which shows missing waters compared to the dimeric structure, in support of the hypothesis. Mutant proteins of a different isozyme (WNK3) designed to disrupt water coordination were produced, and activity and quaternary structure were measured.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors have largely addressed my concerns by making sure collection of mutants analyzed for autophosphorylation in Figure 6 are consistent with the measurement of osmotic sensitivity in Figure 7.

Perhaps PEG400 eliminates CWN1/2 waters by inducing conformational changes so that water loss is an effect not a cause of activation. To address this it would be helpful to comment on whether new electron densities appeared in the X-ray structure of WNK1/SA/PEG400 that might reflect PEG400 interactions with chains A or B.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-evaluated the WNK1/SA/PEG400 electron density looking for non-protein densities larger than water. No new densities were found. However, we do observe a PEG400-destabilizing effect using differential scanning fluorimetry, and have included this data into Figure 2. We conclude that the effects on the water structure and destabilization are due to demands on solvent.</p><p>We have included in the second paragraph of the introduction references to primary literature that advance similar arguments to explain osmolyte induced effects on activity.</p><p>Specifically, Colombo MF, Rau DC, Parsegian VA (1992) Protein solvation in allosteric regulation: a water effect on hemoglobin. <italic>Science</italic> 256: 655-659 and LiCata VJ, Allewell NM (1997) Functionally linked hydration changes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> aspartate transcarbamylase and its catalytic subunit. <italic>Biochemistry</italic> 36: 10161—10167.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be helpful to discuss any experiments that might have been done in previous work to examine the direct binding of glycerol and other osmolytes to WNKs.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe PEG400 in WNK1/SA/PEG400 despite effects on the space group and subunit packing. On the other hand, glycerol was observed in WNK1/SA, which was cryoprotected in glycerol (PDB file 6CN9). We have highlighted these differences in the second section of the results. A thorough analysis on the effects of various osmolytes on WNK structure, stability, and activity is a potential future direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study would benefit from a deeper discussion about how to reconcile the different effects of mutations. For example, wouldn't most or all of the mutations be expected to disrupt the water network, and relieve the proposed autoinhibition? This seemed especially true for some of the residues, like Y420(Y346), D353(D279), and K310(K236), which based on Fig 3 appeared to interact with waters that were removed by PEG400.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been updated with new data and better discussion of this point. Given the inconsistencies on the effects of mutation in static light scattering (SLS), we addressed the possibility that the reducing agent was not constant across experiments. In a repeated study, including reducing agent (1 mM TCEP), we obtained results on mutant mass more similar to wild-type than in the original experiment. An exception was that two of the mutants were much more monomeric than wild-type. It follows that the network CWN1 stabilizes the inactive dimer. The reduced activity of some of the mutants probably reflects the position of CWN1 and the AL-CL Cluster in the active site, such that mutants can affect substrate binding or catalysis. This is now better discussed both in the data and discussion sections.</p><p>Mutants have a tendency to have complex effects on activity and structure. It was satisfying to find any activating mutants. We point out that we have been careful to present all of our data including mutants that are not easily explained by our models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, perhaps the waters in CWN2 are more important for maintaining the autoinhibited structure. This possibility would be useful to discuss, and perhaps comment on what may be known about the energetic contributions of bound water towards stabilizing dimers.</p></disp-quote><p>This research focused on the most salient unique feature of WNK1- CWN1. We also identified CWN2. Mutational analysis of CWN2 can’t be done without disrupting the dimer interface, greatly complicating data interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be useful to comment on why aggregation of E319Q/A (E314) shouldn't inhibit kinase activity instead of activating it.</p></disp-quote><p>On recollection of the SLS data in the presence of reducing agent, we saw reduced aggregation. WNK3/D279N and WNK3/E314Q were more monomeric, especially at the higher protein concentration used. WNK3/E314Q is one of the more active mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The X-ray work was done entirely with WNK1 while the mutational work was done entirely with WNK3. Therefore, a simple explanation for the disconnect between structure and mutations might be that WNK1 and WNK3 differ enough that predictions from the structure of one are not applicable to mutations of the other. It would be helpful to describe past work comparing the structure and regulation of WNK1 and WNK3 that support the assumption of their interchangeability.</p></disp-quote><p>We have responded directly to this concern. We introduced our most interesting amino acid replacement WNK3/E314A into WNK1, making WNK1/E388A. Similar trends in chloride inhibition and mutational activation were observed in WNK1 as in WNK3. This supports the assumption of interchangeability of WNK1 and WNK3 we invoked for practical reasons. As expected, the overall activity of WNK1 is lower than WNK3. Overall, the lower activity limited data collection. However, the lower activity did allow us to fit the chloride inhibition data to a kinetic model for WNK1. Panels on WNK1 activity, mutation, and chloride inhibition were added to Figure 5 and to Supplemental data (Table S6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The most interesting result presented here is that P1 crystals of WNK1 convert to P21 in the presence of PEG400 and still diffract (rather than being destroyed as the crystal contacts change, as one would expect). All of the assays for activity and osmolyte sensing are carried out well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have emphasized this point in the Results section with the word “remarkably”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The rationale for using WNK3 for the mutagenesis study is that it is more sensitive to osmotic pressure than WNK1. I think that WNK1 would have been a better platform because of the direct correlation to the structural work leading to the hypothesis being tested. All of the crystallographic work is WNK1; it is not logical to jump to WNK3 without other practical considerations.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is addressed in the last comment to Reviewer 1. We added autophosphorylation assay data on our most interesting mutant (WNK3/E314A) in WNK1 (WNK1/E388A). Conversely, we have crystallographic data on uWNK3 (on uWNK3/E314A collected to 3.3Å). These new data justify the assumption of interchangeability of results obtained for uWNK1 and uWNK3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Osmolyte sensing was tested by measuring ATP consumption as a function of PEG400 (Figure 6). Data for the subset of mutants analyzed by this assay showed increasing activity. It is not clear why the same collection of mutant proteins analyzed in the experiments of Figure 5 was not also measured for osmolyte sensing in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now more complete, having been now collected for all of the WNK3 mutants (now Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last set of data presented uses light scattering to test whether the WNK3 mutant proteins exhibit quaternary structural changes consistent with the monomer/dimer hypothesis. If they did, one would expect a higher degree of monomer for those that are activated by mutation, and a lower amount of monomer (like wt) for those that are not. Instead, one of the mutant proteins that showed the most chloride inhibition (Y346F) had a quaternary structure similar to the wt protein, and others have similar monomer/dimer mixtures but distinct chloride inhibition profiles (K307A and M301A). I don't see how the light scattering data contribute to this story other than to refute the hypothesis by showing a lack of correlation between quaternary structure, water binding, and activity. This is another reason why the disconnect between WNK1 and WNK3 could be a problem. All of the detailed structural work with WNK1 must be assumed with WNK3; perhaps the light scattering data are contradicting this assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, on recollection of the SLS data in the presence of reducing agent, we saw reduced aggregation and more consistency with our model. Thus, we now feel it is a useful contribution to the manuscript. The table in Supplemental data has been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Fig 3D in the PDF manuscript seemed distorted - waters were cut off. Also Fig 2D would benefit from showing the whole molecule, instead of cutting off the top and bottom of the kinase domain.</p><p>We suspect this is a data transfer problem, since we don’t see these truncations.</p></disp-quote><p>Both Figure 2 and 3 have been changed, addressing these concerns and adding new differential scanning fluorimetry data as discussed in reply to Reviewer 1.

Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 211-213 - these two sentences do not seem to logically go together: &quot;Two hyper-active mutants were discovered, WNK3/E314A, and WNK3/E314Q. These mutants are straightforward to interpret based on our model: the mutated residues support and stabilize inactive dimeric WNK.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>An extensive rewrite has been conducted to address the difference in activity between the higher activity mutants versus less active mutants, now discussed in two paragraphs, and two Figures, Figure 5 and 6.
