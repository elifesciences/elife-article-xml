ganglia. Because of their great diversity in terms of molecular signature, terminal endings morphology, and electrophysiological properties, mirroring the complexity of tactile experience, LTMRs are a model of choice to study the molecular cues differentially controlling neuronal diversification. While the transcriptional codes that define different LTMR subtypes have been extensively studied, the molecular players that participate in their late maturation and in particular in the striking diversity of their end-organ morphological specialization are largely unknown. Here we identified the TALE homeodomain transcription factor Meis2 as a key regulator of LTMRs target-field innervation in mice. <italic>Meis2</italic> is specifically expressed in cutaneous LTMRs, and its expression depends on target-derived signals. While LTMRs lacking <italic>Meis2</italic> survived and are normally specified, their end-organ innervations, electrophysiological properties, and transcriptome are differentially and markedly affected, resulting in impaired sensory-evoked behavioral responses. These data establish <italic>Meis2</italic> as a major transcriptional regulator controlling the orderly formation of sensory neurons innervating peripheral end organs required for light touch.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dorsal root ganglion</kwd><kwd>TALE homeodomain</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>Meis2</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining mouse genetic, behavioral, and electrophysiological approaches revealed that a transcription factor is required to shape touch neurons' distal projections in the skin while dispensable for their survival and specification.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tactile stimuli like brush, light pressure, or roughness engage highly specialized and diverse arrays of mechanoreceptors in both the hairy and glabrous skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delmas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Handler and Ginty, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lechner and Lewin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Somatosensory perception via these mechanoreceptors involves primary sensory neurons whose cell bodies reside within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and cranial sensory ganglia. These sensory neurons within the DRG can be broadly classified as nociceptors, mechanoreceptors, or proprioceptors, and each group is characterized by the expression of specific combination of genes and have distinctive physiological properties and projections within the spinal cord and periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marmigère and Ernfors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vermeiren et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cutaneous mechanoreceptors or low threshold mechanoreceptors (LMTRs) exhibit a variety of specialized terminal endings in the hairy and glabrous skin with strikingly unique morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delmas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Handler and Ginty, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lechner and Lewin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwaller et al., 2021</xref>). LTMRs projecting to the glabrous skin innervate Merkel cell complexes or Meissner corpuscles at the dermal–epidermal border. Those innervating Merkel cells in the glabrous or hairy skin have large thickly myelinated axons (Aβ-fibers) and are characterized as slowly adapting mechanoreceptors responding to skin movement and static displacement (also referred to as Aβ-SAIs). On the other hand, Meissner corpuscles are mechanoreceptors which are only sensitive to skin movement or vibration (rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors) and are referred to as Aβ-RAs. LTMRs innervating hair follicles in the hairy skin can form lanceolate endings or circumferential endings. Virtually all mechanoreceptors innervating hairs show rapidly adapting properties and respond only to hair movement, but not to static displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lechner and Lewin, 2013</xref>). LTMRs with large myelinated axons innervating hairy skin are characterized as Aβ-RAs, and a specialized population of slowly conducting myelinated fibers called D-hair mechanoreceptors (or Aδ-RAs) also form lanceolate endings on small hairs. D-hair mechanoreceptors are most sensitive to low-velocity stroking, have large receptive fields, and are directionally tuned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walcher et al., 2018</xref>). A small number of LTMRs in the hairy skin are not activated by hair movement but show properties of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewin and McMahon, 1991</xref>). These were originally characterized as so-called field receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewin and McMahon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burgess and Horch, 1973</xref>) and were recently shown to form circumferential endings around hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bai et al., 2015</xref>). LTMRs tuned to high-frequency vibration are called Aβ-RAII and innervate Pacinian corpuscles deep in the skin or on the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwaller et al., 2021</xref>). Ruffini endings that are thought to be innervated by stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors (Aβ-SAII) remain poorly characterized in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Handler and Ginty, 2021</xref>). Recent advances in combining single-cell transcriptomic and deep RNA sequencing with genetic tracing have tremendously extended the classical subtypes repertoire and clustered at least 20 different subtypes of LTM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cracking the transcriptional codes supporting sensory neuron identity and diversification has been the object of tremendous efforts in the last decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marmigère and Ernfors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, the functions of specification factors or terminal selectors, like Maf, Shox2, Runx3, Pea3, and ER81, have been functionally implicated in LTMR segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marmigère and Ernfors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas the specific function of adhesion molecules in shaping the assembly of touch circuitry is being unraveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meltzer et al., 2023</xref>), the transcriptional control of target cell innervation within the skin and of the establishment of specialized peripheral end-organ complexes is less understood. Meis2 is another TF expressed in LTMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Its mutation in humans causes severe neurodevelopmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gangfuß et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giliberti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shimojima et al., 2017</xref>), and somatic mutations of its DNA consensus binding site are associated with neurodevelopmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bae et al., 2022</xref>). It belongs to a highly conserved homeodomain family containing three members in mammals, Meis1, Meis2, and Meis3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geerts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Longobardi et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>Meis1</italic> is necessary for target-field innervation of sympathetic peripheral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouilloux et al., 2016</xref>). We thus wondered if Meis2 could also be a pertinent regulator of late primary sensory neuron differentiation.</p><p>Here, we show that Meis2 regulates the innervation of specialized cutaneous end organs important for LTMR function. We confirmed that <italic>Meis2</italic> expression is restricted to LTMR subclasses at late developmental stages compatible with functions in specification and/or target-field innervation. We generated mice carrying an inactive <italic>Meis2</italic> gene in postmitotic sensory neurons. While these animals are healthy and viable and do not exhibit any neuronal loss, they display tactile sensory defects in electrophysiological and behavioral assays. Consistent with these findings, we identified major morphological alterations in LTMR end-organ structures in <italic>Meis2</italic> null sensory neurons. Finally, transcriptomic analysis at late embryonic stages showed dysregulation of synapse and neuronal projection-related genes that underpin these functional and behavioral phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Meis2</italic> is expressed by cutaneous LTMRs</title><p>We analyzed <italic>Meis2</italic> expression using in situ hybridization (ISH) at various developmental stages in both mouse and chick lumbar DRG, combined with well-established molecular markers of sensory neuron subclasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

Here, we showed that <italic>Meis2</italic> is selectively expressed by subpopulations of early postmitotic cutaneous LTMR and proprioceptive neurons during the development of both mouse and chick, highlighting the conserved Meis2 expression across vertebrate species in those neurons. Our results on Meis2 expression are in agreement with previous combined scRNAseq analysis and genetic tracing reporting Meis2 in proprioceptive neurons, Aβ field-LTMR, Aβ-SA1-LTMR, and Aβ-RA-LTMR, but not in C-LTMR, Aδ-LTMR, peptidergic, and non-peptidergic nociceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). We unambiguously demonstrate that <italic>Meis2</italic> differentially regulates target-field innervation and function of postmitotic LTMR neurons. <italic>Meis2</italic> inactivation in postmitotic sensory neurons modified their embryonic transcriptomic profile and differentially impaired adult LTMR projections and functions without affecting their survival and molecular subtype identity.</p><p>The morphological and functional phenotypes we report following specific <italic>Meis2</italic> gene inactivation in postmitotic sensory neurons are consistent with its expression pattern, and ultimately, both defective morphological and electrophysiological responses result in specifically impaired behavioral responses to light touch mechanical stimuli. In these mutants, the decreased innervation of Merkel cells in the glabrous skin and the decreased sensitivity in SA-LTMR electrophysiological responses to mechanical stimuli are consistent with <italic>Meis2</italic> being expressed by Aβ-SA1-LTMR neurons. Interestingly, <italic>Meis2</italic> gene inactivation compromises Merkel cell innervation and electrophysiological responses in the glabrous skin but not in touch domes of the hairy skin where innervation appeared unchanged. This difference supports previous work suggesting that the primary afferents innervating Merkel cells in the glabrous and the hairy skin maybe different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olson et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas Merkel cells of the glabrous skin are exclusively contacted by large Ntrk3/Nefh-positive Aβ afferents, neonatal mouse touch domes receive innervation of two types of neuronal populations, a Ret/Ntrk1-positive one that depends on Ntrk1 for survival and innervation, and another Ntrk3/Nefh-positive that does not depend on Ntrk1 signaling during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niu et al., 2014</xref>). However, the functional significance of these different innervations is unknown. Denervation in rat also pointed to the differences between Merkel cells of the glabrous and the hairy skin. Following denervation, Merkel cells of the touch dome almost fully disappear, whereas in the footpad, Merkel cells developed normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mills et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Because touch domes innervation and Aδ fibers D-hair vibration responses were unaffected in <italic>Isl1<sup>+/Cre</sup>::Meis2<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup></italic> mice, we postulate that the innervation defects we observed in the hairy skin are supported by defects in lanceolate endings with RA-LTMR electrophysiological properties. However, the increased number of ‘tap’ units both in the hairy and glabrous skin is compatible with wider deficits also including Aβ-field LTMRs peripheral projections. Similarly, although the severely disorganized Meissner corpuscle architecture did not result in significant consequences on RAM fibers’ electrophysiological responses in the glabrous skin, it is possible that the large increase in the number of ‘tap units’ within Aβ fibers of the glabrous skin represents Meissner corpuscles whose normal electrophysiological responses are abolished. Indeed, the electrophysiology methods used here can only identify sensory afferents that have a mechanosensitive receptive field. Primary afferents that have an axon in the skin but no mechanosensitvity can only be identified with a so-called electrical search protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wetzel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>) which was not used here. It is therefore quite likely that many primary afferents that failed to form endings would not be recorded in these experiments, for example, SA-LTMRs and RA-LTMRs that fail to innervate end organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In agreement, challenging sensory responses in the glabrous skin with either Von Frey filament application or cotton swab stroking clearly showed a dramatic loss of mechanical sensitivity specifically within the range of gentle touch neurons. Recent work reported that the Von Frey test performed within low forces and challenging light touch sensation could distinguish Merkel cells from Meissner corpuscles dysfunctions. Mice depleted of Merkel cells performed normally on this test while mice mutated at the <italic>Ntrk2</italic> locus with Meissner corpuscle innervation deficits were less sensitive in response to filament within the 0.02–0.6 g range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neubarth et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, our result in the Von Frey test likely reflects aberrant functioning of the RAM LTMR-Meissner corpuscle complex. Finally, the unaltered D-hair fibers’ electrophysiological responses and the normal noxious responses in the hot plate setting are consistent with the absence of <italic>Meis2</italic> expression in Aδ-LTMR, peptidergic, and non-peptidergic neurons. Surprisingly, although <italic>Meis2</italic> is expressed in proprioceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shin et al., 2020</xref>), their function appeared not to be affected as seen by normal gait behavior in catwalk analysis. This is in agreement with studies in which HoxC8 inactivation, a classical Meis TF co-factor expressed by proprioceptive neurons from E11.5 to postnatal stages, affected neither proprioceptive neurons early molecular identity nor their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shin et al., 2020</xref>). From our data, we could not conclude whether SA-LTMR electrophysiological responses are differentially affected in the glabrous vs hairy skin of <italic>Meis2</italic> mutant as suggested by histological analysis. Similarly, the decreased sensitivity of <italic>Meis2</italic> mutant mice in the cotton swab assay and the morphological defects of Meissner corpuscles evidenced in histological analysis do not correlate with RA-LTMR electrophysiological responses for which a tendency to decreased responses was, however, measured. The latter might result from an insufficient number of fibers recording, whereas the first may be due to pooling SA-LTMR from both the hairy and glabrous skin.</p><p>Understanding the transcriptional programs controlling each step in the generation of a given fully differentiated and specified neuron is an extensive research field in developmental neurobiology. Basic studies in model organisms led to a functional classification of TFs. Proneural TFs such as <italic>Neurogenins</italic> control the expression of generic pan-neuronal genes and are able to reprogram nearly any cell types into immature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillemot and Hassan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baker and Brown, 2018</xref>). Terminal selectors are TFs mastering the initiation and maintenance of terminal identity programs through direct regulation of neuron type-specific effector genes critical for neuronal identity and function such as genes involved in neurotransmitters synthesis and transport, ion channels, receptors, synaptic connectivity, or neuropeptide content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hobert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>).

Its expression both in dividing neural progenitors, immature neurons, and discrete populations of mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jakovcevski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toresson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toresson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang and Parrilla, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frazer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bumsted-O’Brien et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen et al., 2007</xref>) argues for diverse functions ranging from regulation of neuroblasts cell-cycle exit, to cell-fate decision, neurogenesis, neuronal specification, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and maintenance of mature neurons. In DRG LTMRs, <italic>Meis2</italic> fulfills some but not all of the criteria defining terminal selector genes. Its inactivation in neural crest cells does not affect sensory neuron generation nor pan-neuronal features, clearly excluding it from a proneural TF function. Although <italic>Meis2</italic> expression is continuously maintained in defined sensory neuron subtypes starting from early postmitotic neurons throughout life, its expression is not restricted to a unique neuronal identity and its early or late inactivation in either sensory neuron progenitors or postmitotic neurons does not influence neuronal subtypes identity nor survival as seen by the normal numbers of Ntrk2, Ntrk3, or Ret-positive neurons. However, our transcriptomic analyses strongly support that in LTMRs, Meis2 regulates other types of terminal effector genes such as genes participating in neurotransmitter machinery specification and/or recognition, establishment, and maintenance of physical interactions between LTMRs and their peripheral targets. Surprisingly, our RNAseq analysis only revealed 10 DEGs that could be unambiguously attributed to Meis2 activity. All of these genes are expressed in adult LTMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that they exert specific functions in the maintenance of these sensory subclasses, and that their up- or downregulation might affect LTMRs maturation, but did not show any GO term enrichment. Separate GO analyses of our datasets, however, revealed alterations in pathways associated to synapse function and neuron projections. Therefore, from our results, we cannot exclude that dysregulation of those genes is secondary to the changed expression of one or more of the 10 above DEGs. Two GABA(A) receptor subunits (GABRA1 and GABRA4), the K-Cl cotransporter SLC12A5 associated to GABAergic neurotransmission, but also the glutamate receptor subunits GRID1 and GRIK3 are down- or upregulated in Meis2 mutants, questioning whether an imbalance gabaergic and glutamatergic transmission is responsible for Meis2 sensory phenotypes. Interestingly, Meis2 inactivation seems to interfere with the embryonic expression of many members of the protocadherin family, and the protocadherin γ cluster (Pcdhg) in particular has recently been highlighted as essential for building central and peripheral LTMRs innervation and synapses and establish proper peripheral target-field innervation and touch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meltzer et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, previous work on <italic>Islet1</italic> conditional deletion in DRG sensory neurons reports considerable changes in gene expression. Early homozygous <italic>Islet1</italic> deletion results in increased sensory neuron apoptosis and a loss of Ntrk1- and Ntrk2-positive neurons, whereas late deletion seems to only affect the nociceptive subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas the distal projection defects we report in <italic>Wnt<sup>Cre</sup>::Meis2<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup></italic> mutant can only be attributed to Meis2 inactivation, it is possible that among the DEGs we identified in <italic>Isl1<sup>Cre/+</sup>::Meis2<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup></italic>, some are epistatically regulated by the heterozygous <italic>Islet1</italic> deletion in addition to <italic>Meis2</italic> homozygous deletion.

HT-seq count (version 0.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) was used to aggregate read count per gene followed by differential gene expression analysis with Limma voom on Galaxy (version 3.50.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Law et al., 2014</xref>). Data are available under the following accession codes: GSE223788. Only genes that exhibited more than 100 reads in any of the samples were kept in the analysis. Genes with more than 1.2-fold differential expression and p-value&lt;0.05 were used for GO analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov">https://david.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>) using the list of expressed genes in our experiment as background.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mouse skin-nerve preparation and sensory afferent recordings</title><p>Cutaneous sensory fiber recordings were performed using the ex vivo skin-nerve preparation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwaller et al., 2021</xref>). Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation for 2–4 min followed by cervical dislocation. Three different preparations were performed in separate experiments using different paw regions: the saphenous nerve innervating the hairy hind paw skin; the tibial nerve innervating the glabrous hind paw skin; and the medial and ulnar nerves innervating the forepaw glabrous skin. In all preparations, the hairy skin of the limb was shaved and the skin and nerve were dissected free and transferred to the recording chamber, where muscle, bone, and tendon tissues were removed from the skin to improve recording quality. The recording chamber was perfused with a 32°C synthetic interstitial fluid: 123 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.7 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.0 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 9.5 mM sodium gluconate, 5.5 mM glucose, 7.5 mM sucrose, and 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4. The skin was pinned out and stretched, such that the outside of the skin could be stimulated using stimulator probes. The peripheral nerve was fed through an adjacent chamber in mineral oil, where fine filaments were teased from the nerve and placed on a silver-wire recording electrode.</p><p>The receptive fields of individual mechanoreceptors were identified by mechanically probing the surface of the skin with a blunt glass rod or blunt forceps. Analog output from a Neurolog amplifier was filtered and digitized using the Powerlab 4/30 system and Labchart 7.1 software (AD Instruments). Spike-histogram extension for Labchart 7.1 was used to sort spikes of individual units. Electrical stimuli (1 Hz, square pulses of 50–500 ms) were delivered to single-unit receptive fields to measure conduction velocity and enable classification as C-fibers (velocity &lt; 1.2  m s<sup>−1</sup>), Aδ-fibers (1.2–10  m s<sup>−1</sup>), or Aβ-fibers (&gt;10  m s<sup>−1</sup>). Mechanical stimulation of the receptive fields of neurons was performed using a piezo actuator (Physik Instrumente, Cat# P-841.60) and a double-ended Nanomotor (Kleindiek Nanotechnik, Cat# MM-NM3108) connected to a force measurement device (Kleindiek Nanotechnik, Cat# PL-FMS-LS). Calibrated force measurements were acquired simultaneously using the Powerlab system and Labchart software during the experiment.</p><p>As different fiber types have different stimulus-tuning properties, different mechanical stimuli protocols were used based on the unit type. Low-threshold Aβ-fibers (RAMs and SAMs) and Aδ-fiber D-hairs were stimulated with the piezo actuator with three vibration stimuli (5 Hz, 25 Hz, and 50 Hz, distortions introduced by the in-series force sensor precluded using frequencies &gt;50 Hz) with increasing amplitude over six steps (peak-to-peak amplitudes of ~6–65 mN; 20 cycles per step), and a dynamic stimulus sequence with four ramp-and-hold waveforms with varying probe deflection velocities (3 s duration; 0.075, 0.15, 0.45, and 1.5 mm s<sup>−1</sup>; average amplitude 100 mN). Aβ-fiber SAMs and RAMs were classified by the presence or absence of firing during the static phase of a ramp-and-hold stimulus, respectively, as previously described. Single units were additionally stimulated with a series of five static mechanical stimuli with ramp-and-hold waveforms of increasing amplitude (3 s duration; ranging from ~10 mN to 260 mN). Low-threshold SAMs, high-threshold Aδ-fibers, and C-fibers were also stimulated using the nanomotor with five ramp-and-hold stimuli with increasing amplitudes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Behavioral assays</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Von Frey paw withdrawal test</title><p>Mice were placed on an elevated wire mesh grid into PVC chambers. Before the test, mice were habituated to the device for 1 hr for two consecutive days. On the testing day, mice were placed in the chamber 1 hr before Von Frey filaments application. The test was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neubarth et al., 2020</xref>). During the test, withdrawal response following Von Frey filament application on the palm of the left hind paw was measured. Starting with the lowest force, each filament ranging from 0.008 g to 1.4 g was applied 10 times in a row with a break of 30 s following the fifth application. During each application, bend filament was maintained for 4–5 s. The number of paw withdrawals for each filament was counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Hot plate test</title><p>Before starting the test, mice were habituated to the experimentation room for at least 5 min. Mice were individually placed on the hot plate set up at 53°C and removed at the first signs of aversive behavior (paw licking or shaking). The time to this first stimulus was recorded. A 30 s cutoff was applied to avoid skin damage. After 5 min recovery in their home cage, the test was repeated three times for each mouse and averaged. Data are shown as the average of these three measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Sticky tape test</title><p>A 2 cm<sup>2</sup> of laboratory tape was placed on the upper-back skin of mice just before they were placed on an elevated wire mesh grid into PVC chambers. The number of tape-directed reactions was then counted during 5 min. Considered responses were body shaking like a ‘wet dog’, hindlimb scratching directed to the tape, trying to reach the tape with the snout and grooming of the neck with forepaws.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-4"><title>Dynamic touch test</title><p>Mice were placed in the same conditions as described above for the Von Frey paw withdrawal test. Sensitivity to dynamic touch was performed by stroking hind paws with a tapered cotton swab in a heel-to-toe direction.

Mice were allowed to voluntarily cross a 100-cm-long, 5-cm-wide walkway with a glass platform illuminated by green fluorescent light. An illuminated image is produced when a mouse paw touches the glass floor through dispersion of the green light, and footprints were captured by a high-speed camera placed under the glass floor. Data were analyzed using the CatWalk XT 10.1 software. For each mouse, several recordings were performed until at least three runs met the criteria defined by a minimum of three consecutive complete step cycles of all four paws without stopping or hesitation and within the range of 25–50 cm s<sup>–1</sup>. Data are reported as the average of at least three runs per mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-6"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Probes generated for ISH are available upon request to the corresponding author.

They start with a series of careful in situ hybridizations and immunohistochemical analyses to examine Meis2 transcript expression and protein distribution in mouse and chick DRGs of different embryonic stages. By this approach, they identify Meis2+ neurons as slowly- and rapidly adapting A-beta LTMRs, respectively. Retrograde tracing experiments in newborn mice confirmed that Meis2-expressing sensory neurons project to the skin, while unilateral limb bud ablations in chick embryos in ovo showed that these neurons require target-derived signals for survival. The authors further generated a conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse model in which Meis2 is selectively lost in Islet1-expressing, postmitotic neurons in the DRG (IsletCre/+::Meis2flox/flox, abbreviated below as cKO). WT and Islet1Cre/+ littermates served as controls. cKO mice did not exhibit any obvious alteration in volume or cellular composition of the DRGs but showed significantly reduced sensitivity to touch stimuli and various innervation defects to different end-organ targets. RNA-sequencing experiments of E18.5 DRGs taken from WT, Islet1Cre/+ and cKO mice reveals extensive gene expression differences between cKO cells and the two controls, including synaptic proteins and components of GABAergic- and glutamatergic transmission. Histological analysis and electrophysiological recordings shed light on the physiological defects resulting from the loss of Meis2. By immunohistochemical approaches, the authors describe distinct innervation defects in glabrous and hairy skin (reduced innervation of Merkel cells by SA1-LTMRs in glabrous but not hairy skin, reduced complexity of A-beta RA1-LTMs innervating Meissner's corpuscles in glabrous skin, reduced branching and innervation of A-betA RA1-LTMRs in hairy skin). Electrophysiological recordings from ex vivo skin nerve preparations found that several, but not all of these histological defects are matched by altered responses to external stimuli, indicating that compensation may play a considerable role in this system.

For a few years, the view on autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has shifted from a disorder that exclusively affects the brain to a condition that also includes the peripheral somatosensory system, even though our knowledge about the genes involved is incomplete. The study by Desiderio and colleagues is therefore not only scientifically interesting but may also have clinical relevance. The work is convincing, with appropriate and validated methodology in line with current state-of-the-art and the findings contribute both to understanding and potential application.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work examined transcription factor Meis2 in the development of mouse and chick DRG neurons, using a combination of techniques, such as the generation of a new conditional mutant strain of Meis2, behavioral assays, in situ hybridization, transcriptomic study, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiological (ex vivo skin-nerve preparation) recordings. The authors found that Meis2 was selectively expressed in A fiber LTMRs and that its disruption affects the A-LTMRs' end-organ innervation, transcriptome, electrophysiological properties, and light touch-sensation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. The authors utilized a well-designed mouse genetics strategy to generate a mouse model where the Meis2 is selectively ablated from pre- and post-mitotic mouse DRG neurons. They used a combination of readouts, such as in situ hybridization, immunhistochemistry, transcriptomic analysis, skin-nerve preparation, electrophysiological recordings, and behavioral assays to determine the role of Meis2 in mouse DRG afferents.</p><p>2. They observed a similar preferential expression of Meis2 in large-diameter DRG neurons during development in chicken, suggesting evolutionarily conserved functions of this transcription factor.</p><p>3. Conducted severe behavioral assays to probe the reduction of light-touch sensitivity in mouse glabrous and hairy skin. Their behavioral findings support the idea that the function of Meis2 is essential for the development and/or maturation of LTMRs.</p><p>4. RNAseq data provide potential molecular pathways through which Meis2 regulates embryonic target-field innervation.</p><p>5. Well-performed electrophysiological study using skin-nerve preparation and recordings from saphenous and tibial nerves to investigate physiological deficits of Meis2 mutant sensory afferents.</p><p>6. Nice whole-mount IHC of the hair skin, convincingly showing morphological deficits of Meis2 mutant SA- and RA- LTMRs.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well-written. The experimental design and data quality are good, and the conclusion from the experimental results is logical.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. Although the authors justify this study for the involvement of Meis2 in Autism and Autism associated disorders, no experiments really investigated Autism-like specific behavior in the Meis2 ablated mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in the first version of the manuscript, we use current understanding of ASD in mouse models and associated sensory defects to articulate our introduction and discussion. As noticed by reviewer 1, none of our experiments really investigated ASD. To avoid over-interpretation of the data, we have now removed sentences mentioning ASD and related references throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For mechanical force sensing-related behavioral assays, the authors performed VFH and dynamic cotton swabs for the glabrous skin, and sticky tape on the back (hairy skin) for the hairy skin. A few additional experiments involving glabrous skin plantar surfaces, such as stick tape or flow texture discrimination, would make the conclusion stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree on that performing more behavioral analysis investigating with more details the primary sensory defects as well as some ASD-related behavior would re-inforce our conclusions. Our behavioral analysis clearly showed a loss of sensitivity in response to mechanical stimuli within the light touch range but not for higher range mechanical or noxious thermal stimuli. While the experiments suggested by the reviewer are interesting and would strengthen our conclusions, they are far from trivial and require large cohorts. Given the current laboratory conditions as stated at the outset, these unfortunately are not within reach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors considered von Frey filaments (1 and 1.4 g) as noxious mechanical stimuli (Figure 1E and statement on lines 181-183), which is questionable. Alligator clips or pinpricks are more certain to activate mechanical nociceptors.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid misinterpretation of the higher Von Frey filament tests, we deleted the two following statement in page 7: “In the von Frey test, the thresholds for paw withdrawal were similar between all genotypes when using filaments exerting forces ranging from 1 to 1.4g, which likely reflects the activation of mechanical nociception suggesting that Meis2 gene inactivation did not affect nociceptor function.”. The sentence “… while sparing other somatosensory behaviors” was also deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There are disconnections and inconsistencies among findings from morphological characterization, physiological recordings, and behavior assays. For example, Meis2 mutant SA-LTMRs show a deficiency in Merkel cell innervation in the glabrous skin but not in hairy skin. With no clear justification, the authors pooled recordings of SA-LTMRs from both glabrous and hairy skin and found a significant increase in mean vibration threshold. Will the results be significantly different if the data are analyzed separately? In addition, whole-mount IHC of Meissner's corpuscles showed morphological changes, but electrophysiological recordings didn't find significant alternation of RAI LTMRs. What does the morphological change mean then? Since the authors found that Meis2 mice are less sensitive to a dynamic cotton swab, which is usually considered as an RA-LTMR mediated behavior, is the SAI-LTMR deficit here responsible for this behavior? Connections among results from different methods are not clear, and the inconsistency should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for the careful review of our data and fully agree with the weaknesses identified, weaknesses we were ourselves aware of at the time of submission. In particular on the lack of stronger connections between histological and electrophysiological data. Electrophysiological studies were conducted on a first cohort of mice where we mostly emphasize on WT and Meis2 mutant mice. The goal was to describe differences in electrophysiological properties of identified mechanoreceptors from these two genotypes. While substantial differences between WT and Islet1-Cre mice were not expected, only very few mice with this genotype were examined at that time to confirm this assumption. We fully agree with reviewer 1 that confirming differences in SA-LTMRs responses in the hairy and glabrous at electrophysiological levels would be interesting and worthwhile. It is assumed that the physiological properties of SA-LTMRs from glabrous and hairy skins are equivalent in both skin types. Indeed direct comparisons have been made between glabrous and hairy skin SA-LTMRs revealing that they have equivalent receptor properties (see Walcher et al J Physiol quoted in the manuscript). We had not recorded from a sufficient number of hairy and glabrous skin SA-LTMRs to make any meaningful comparison statistically. When we noticed the dramatic differences in the innervation patterns of Merkel cell complexes between glabrous and hairy skin, we immediately planned a second mice cohort, but as explained in the onset to the Public Review, this cohort was sacrificed due to the pandemic lockdown. However, the obtained dataset clearly shows that in Meis2 mutant mice many SA-LTMRs had similar vibration thresholds to those of wild types.</p><p>For Meissner corpuscle, histological analysis evidenced clear morphological differences that could of course be investigated at the level of the dual innervation previously reported by Neubarth et al. It is uncertain whether differences in their electrophysiological responses would be revealed by increasing the number of recorded fibers. For this reason, we clearly stated this limitation in the results section page 7 “There was a tendency for RA-LTMRs in Isl1Cre/+::Meis2LoxP/LoxP mutant mice to fire fewer action potentials to sinusoids and to the ramp phase of a series 2 second duration ramp and hold stimuli, but these differences were not statistically significant (Figure 5B). Nevertheless it is important to point out that an electrical search strategy revealed that many Aβ-fibers did not have mechanosensitive receptive fields. Thus by focusing on LTMRs with a mechanosensitive receptive field, we ignore the fact that fewer fibers are mechanosensitive. This is now more extensively discussed in the discussion section of the manuscript page 13:</p><p>“Indeed, the electrophysiology methods used here can only identify sensory afferents that have a mechanosensitive receptive field. Primary afferents that have an axon in the skin but no mechanosensitvity can only be identified with a so-called electrical search protocol (45, 46) which was not used here. It is therefore quite likely that many primary afferents that failed to form endings would not be recorded in these experiments e.g. SA-LTMRs and RA-LTMRs that fail to innervate end-organs (Fig.4-6).”</p><p>“From our data, we could not conclude whether SA-LTMR electrophysiological responses are differentially affected in the glabrous versus hairy skin of Meis2 mutant as suggested by histological analysis. Further electrophysiological analysis focused on SA-LTMR selectively innervating the glabrous or hairy skin would be necessary to answer this question. Similarly, the decreased sensitivity of Meis2 mutant mice in the cotton swab assay and the morphological defects of Meissner corpuscles evidenced in histological analysis do not correlate with RA-LTMR electrophysiological responses for which a tendency to decreased responses were however measured. The later might result from an insufficient number of fibers recording, whereas the first may be due of pooling SA-LTMR from both the hairy and glabrous skin.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Desiderio and colleagues investigated the role of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) homeodomain transcription factor Meis2 during maturation and target innervation of mechanoreceptors and their sensation to touch.

Retrograde tracing experiments in newborn mice confirmed that Meis2-expressing sensory neurons project to the skin, while unilateral limb bud ablations in chick embryos in Ovo showed that these neurons require target-derived signals for survival. The authors further generated a conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse model in which Meis2 is selectively lost in Islet1-expressing, postmitotic neurons in the DRG (IsletCre/+::Meis2flox/flox, abbreviated below as cKO). WT and Islet1Cre/+ littermates served as controls. cKO mice did not exhibit any obvious alteration in volume or cellular composition of the DRGs but showed significantly reduced sensitivity to touch stimuli and various innervation defects to different end-organ targets. RNA-sequencing experiments of E18.5 DRGs taken from WT, Islet1Cre/+, and cKO mice reveal extensive gene expression differences between cKO cells and the two controls, including synaptic proteins and components of the GABAergic signaling system. Gene expression also differed considerably between WT and heterozygous Islet1Cre/+ mice while several of the other parameters tested did not. These findings suggest that Islet1 heterozygosity affects gene expression in sensory neurons but not sensory neuron functionality. However, only some of the parameters tested were assessed for all three genotypes. Histological analysis and electrophysiological recordings shed light on the physiological defects resulting from the loss of Meis2. By immunohistochemical approaches, the authors describe distinct innervation defects in glabrous and hairy skin (reduced innervation of Merkel cells by SA1-LTMRs in glabrous but not hairy skin, reduced complexity of A-beta RA1-LTMs innervating Meissner's corpuscles in glabrous skin, reduced branching and innervation of A-betA RA1-LTMRs in hairy skin).

The authors describe a new mouse model for compromised touch sensation and identify a number of genes whose expression depends on Meis2 in mouse DRGs. Given that dysbalanced MEIS2 expression in humans has been linked to autism and that autism seems to involve an inappropriate response to light touch, the present study makes a novel and important link between this gene and ASD.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors make use of different experimental approaches to investigate the role of Meis2 in touch sensation, but the results obtained by these techniques could be connected better. For instance, the authors identify several genes involved in synapse formation, synaptic transmission, neuronal projections, or axon and dendrite maturation that are up- or downregulated upon targeted Meis2 deletion, but it is unresolved whether these chances can in any way explain the histological, electrophysiological, or behavioral deficits observed in cKO animals. The use of two different controls (WT and Islet1Cre/+) is unsatisfactory and it is not clear why some parameters were studied in all three genotypes (WT, Islet1Cre/+ and cKO) and others only in WT and cKO. In addition, Meis2 mutant mice apparently are less responsive to touch, whereas in humans, mutation or genomic deletion involving the MEIS2 gene locus is associated with ASD, a condition that, if anything, is associated with an elevated sensitivity to touch. It would be interesting to know how the authors reconcile these two findings. A minor weakness, the first manuscript suffers from some ambiguities and errors, but these can be easily corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of two different controls (WT and Islet1Cre/+) is unsatisfactory and it is not clear why some parameters were studied in all three genotypes (WT, Islet1Cre/+ and cKO) and others only in WT and cKO.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we identified a labelling mistake in figures 4D, 5A and 6A where the control shown are from Islet1+/Cre mice and not from WT as reported in the first version. We apologize for this mistake which has now been corrected. This typographical error does not in any way affect our conclusion, on the contrary, it shows that innervation defects are not the consequence of Islet1 heterozygosity.</p><p>The reviewer wonders why for some data both control genotypes are presented, and for some others only one is presented. It is quite possible that genes expression changes happen due to a synergistic effect of both heterozygous Meis2 deletion and heterozygous Islet1 deletion. However, we found no evidence that this led to defects in target-field innervation or to changes in the physiological properties of sensory neurons.</p><p>Whereas it could be fairly envisaged that some gene expression is modified due to a synergistic effect of both heterozygous Meis2 deletion and heterozygous deletion of Islet1, several lines of evidence support that the defects in target-field innervation and electrophysiological responses are exclusively due to Meis2 deletion.Previous work on Islet1 specific deletion in DRG sensory neurons opens the possibility that some of the phenotypes we report here are in part due to an effect of Islet1 heterozygous deletion or a synergistic effect to Meis2 homozygous deletion.</p><p>1. When Islet1 is conditionally deleted in mice using the Wnt1-Cre strain or at later stages using a tamoxifen inducible-Cre, homozygous pups die a few hours after birth. Early Islet1 deletion results in an increased apoptosis in the DRG, a massive loss of DRG sensory neurons and sensory defects associated to nociceptors mostly and some touch neurons while proprioceptive neurons are spared (Sun et al., 2008 now included in the revised version of the manuscript). There was a decrease in the number of Ntrk1+ and Ntrk2+ neurons whereas Ntrk3+ neurons number appeared normal. When Islet1 is inactivated later in development, the number of Ntrk1+ and Ntrk2+ neurons were normal and only the expression of nociceptor specific markers was decreased. Since neither the DRG volume, nor the number of Ntrk1+, Ntrk2+ and Ntrk3+ neurons are changed in Meis2 cKO using the Islet1-Cre strain, an early significant effect of Islet1 heterozygous deletion is very unlikely.</p><p>2. For distal innervation defects, it is clear from the Wnt1-Cre::Meis2 data (Figure 3E) that the distal innervation phenotype occurred while Meis2 is inactivated independently of Islet1 expression.</p><p>3. Finally, the lack of differences between WT and Islet+/Cre mice in behavioral assays and in electrophysiological characterization of RA-LTMR of the hairy skin (Figure 6C) and SA-LTMR (Figure 4B and C) argues for a lack of significant consequences of Islet1 heterozygous deletion on these parameters.</p><p>4. For bulk RNAseq studies, all datasets has been now re-analyzed following Reviewer 2 specific comments (see below). To avoid misinterpretation of the data, the results are now presented differently (see pages 8 and 9) and more critically discussed (see pages 14 and 15). In particular, we included and discuss references on Islet1 cKO mice.</p><p>We also agree with reviewer 2 that our RNAseq study only provides cues on potential genes expression that could impact distal innervation and electrophysiological responses. However, proving which of those genes are fully responsible for the morphological and electrophysiological defects would require extensive mouse genetic investigations such as restoring their normal expression level in a Meis2 mutant context, which is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>Finally, the reviewer questioned how we could reconcile the lower touch sensitivity in Meis2 mutant mice with the exacerbated touch sensitivity found in ASD patient and mouse models of ASD. As suggested by reviewer 1, our study did not really investigate ASD specifically. Therefore, to avoid over interpretation of the data and to follow Reviewer 1 recommendation, we have removed all references to ASD in the revised version of the manuscript. Indeed, to our knowledge, none of the case reports on Meis2 mutant patients investigated sensory function in general and light touch in particular, maybe because of the severe intellectual disability characterizing these patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In addition to the aforesaid suggestions in the section 2, there are some minor issues:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful reading and for identifying all these typos.

Nevertheless, there are still some open questions, ambiguities in the presentation, and minor errors that I would recommend addressing.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1. The authors performed RNA-seq analysis from E18.5 mouse total DEGs from three different genotypes, WT, Isle1Cre/+ and cKO. Although this approach identified several interesting Meis2-dependent candidate genes, the presentation of the results is confusing, and the publication would gain impact if the RNA-seq results were better connected to the histological, behavioral, and electrophysiological data. Specific concerns:</p><p>(1.1) The gene expression profiles of WT and Islet1Cre/+ samples are remarkably divergent. According to Yang Development 2006, Islet1-Cre was generated by knocking in Cre into the endogenous Islet1 locus and replacing the Isl1 ATG, hence resulting in a heterozygous null for Islet1. When purely technical derivations can be excluded, the RNAseq results presented here suggest that heterozygous loss of Islet1 causes considerable gene expression changes in the postnatal DRG. For analysis of the RNAseq results, the authors focus on genes that are differentially expressed between one experimental condition (Islet1Cre/+::Meis2flox/flox) and either one of two controls (WT or Islet1Cre/+). Hence, they pool the genes that are differently expressed between cKO and Islet1Cre/+ with the genes that are different between cKO and WT. This approach mixes gene expression differences that result from two different genetic alterations, heterozygosity of Islet1 and targeted deletion of Meis2, respectively. It seems much more logical to compare the results pairwise.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that heterozygous deletion of Islet1 causes a significant change in genes expression that seems to very little correlate with any of the phenotypes we investigated in the study. When Islet1 is conditionally deleted in mouse using the Wnt1-cre strain, pups die few hours after birth and display increased apoptosis in the DRG, massive loss of DRG sensory neurons and sensory defects associated to nociceptors mostly and some touch neurons while proprioceptive neurons are spared (Sun et al., 2008 now included in the revised version of the manuscript). There is a decrease numbers of Ntrk1+ and Ntrk2+ neurons whereas the numbers of Ntrk3+ neurons appear normal. Later Isl1 inactivation does not induces changes in number of neurons and does not change Ntrk1 and 2 expressions.As explained in the answer to public reviews, bulk RNAseq data have now been reanalyzed following the reviewer suggestions and presented accordingly in the related figures.</p><p>In the study bay Sun et al. they also reported DEGs following Islet1 homozygous deletion, but data on Islet1 heterozygous deletion are not included. However, out of the 60 most dysregulated genes identified in their study, only 6 were differentially expressed in our datasets. Importantly, DEGs in their studies where identified using microarray. In another study, the same group, showed that Brn3a (another transcription factor important for DRG neurons differentiation) and Islet1 exhibit negative epistasis on sensory genes expression (Dykes et al., 2011 now included in the revised version of the manuscript). Thus we cannot rule out that similar rules apply for Islet1 and Meis2. However, given the high diversity of DRG sensory neurons, interpreting our bulk RNAseq analysis in such direction might lead to misinterpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.2) Along the same line, gene expression changes in Islet1Cre/+ DRGs seem to have little functional consequences, at least in the cases where all three genotypes were analyzed (target dependency (Fig. 1E), behavior (Fig. 1F), innervation (Fig. 4F, 6C)). Why were some parameters measured in all three genotypes and others only for WT and cKO? The authors probably reason that parameters that do not differ between WT and cKO animals will likely also not differ between WT and Islet1Cre/+. But what about parameters that do differ? Considering that the innervation of Merkel cells (Fig. 4E) and Meissner corpuscles (Fig. 5A) differ profoundly between WT and cKO, it would be interesting to know what this innervation looks like in Islet1Cre/+ DRGs. NEFH staining together with CK8 or S100beta from existing tissue sections should easily answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the answer for public reviews, there was a mistake in the annotation of the control in figure 4 D and E, and in Fig. 5 that has now been corrected. Concerning target-dependency, those are experiments conducted in chick embryo, and therefore no associated genotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.3) Was a minimum cut-off for gene expression applied? The up-and downregulated genes in Fig. 3B list a number of pseudogenes and predicted genes. A quick (and incomplete) check for their expression in Fig2 Supple Table 1 shows that only a few reads were detected for most of them. With such low expression, even small changes will show up as significant differences.</p></disp-quote><p>In our first analysis, a cut-off of 10 reads was applied. As reviewer 2 mentioned, this cut-off included several pseudogenes and predicted genes with low expression for which small changes were significant. We now re-analyzed the dataset using a cut-off of 100 reads. This excluded most of the previous predicted genes and pseudogenes for the analysis and resulted in a much small number of DEGs for each dataset. As recommended by reviewer 2, we also now performed the David analysis separately. These results are now presented in Figure 3 and corresponding supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.4) Given that bulk RNAseq from whole embryonic DRGs was performed, it would be interesting to know what cell type(s) express the Meis2-dependent transcripts. To address this question, the authors resort to published scRNAseq data by Usoskin Nat Neurosci 2015. They correlate the expression of all 488 DEGs (different between cKO and either WT or Islet1Cre/+) with the expression of Meis2 in the sensory neuron subtypes that were classified in the Usoskin paper. From that they conclude that many Meis2-dependent genes were expressed in the same sensory neuron classes as Meis2 itself. This is not apparent from Fig. 3 Supplementary 2. Neither do the 488 DEGs seem to be in any way enriched in the MEIS2-expressing cell clusters NF2/3/4/5, nor is cluster PEP1 particularly high in Meis2 expression. Immunostaining for MEIS2 together with a few selected DEGs would be a better way to assess co-expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that the correlation between DEGs and the expression of Meis2 in the sensory neuron subtypes was far from striking. In our opinion, the new analysis shows now a more robust correlation. However, it has to be kept in mind that among DEGs not all are expected to be Meis2 direct target genes and therefore to be enriched in the same Meis2-expressing population. This also hold true for genes that could be de-repressed or induced following Meis2 inactivation. Finally, the scRNAseq by Usoskin et al was performed on adult sensory neurons whereas our bulk RNAseq was performed on E18.5 embryos. Thus, because gene expression in developing sensory neurons is well-known to be highly dynamic, it is not expected that the transcriptional signature of sensory neurons subclasses in E18.5 embryo perfectly matches the transcriptional signature of adult subclasses. Finally, we agree that immunostaining for Meis2 together with few selected DEGs would give a better answer on whether they co-localize or not, but our lack of experience with those antibodies together with the lack of financial support for the proposal precludes achieving this pertinent point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.5) The authors identify Gabra1 and Gabra4 as upregulated and Gabrr1 as downregulated genes in MEIS2 cKO animals. Does this reflect a change in GABA-receptor subunit composition in LMTRs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. First, in our new analysis, increasing the cut-off to 100 reads excluded Gabrr1 from the DEGs. Based on our results, we cannot conclude whereas Gabra1 and Gabra4 up-regulation reflects a change in GABA receptors composition. However, in the GO term associated to Gabaergic synapse, whereas Gabra1 and Gabra4 were up-regulated the ionotropic glutamate receptor Grid1 was downregulated, rather claiming for an imbalanced GABA/Glutamate transmission. Finally, the increased GABAR expression in the LTMRs might be expected to increase pre-synaptic inhibition on the LTMR synapses onto target neurons in the dorsal horn, thus decreasing synaptic transmission from these neurons into spinal circuits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors assessed SA-LTMR innervating Merkel cells in glabrous and hairy skin by IFC staining for neurofilament H and electrophysiological recordings. Due to the small sample size, they pooled recordings, reasoning that nerves that do not successfully innervate Merkel cells (i.e. cKO glabrous skin) do not evoke electrophysiological responses following a touch stimulus.</p><p>(2.1) It is undoubtedly true that non-innervating nerves will likely not show electrophysiological responses. However, by pooling the recordings of SA-LTMRs from glabrous and hairy skin, the data obtained from the 20% successful recordings of SA-LTMRs from glabrous cKO skin (according to Fig. 4E, upper panel) will be overrepresented and hence lead to a systematic bias. How many recordings were made from the glabrous and hairy skin of each genotype? In case the number of recordings from cKO/glabrous skin is the limiting factor, does the observed difference in vibration threshold hold true when only recordings from hairy skin are compared?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the text and in our answers to reviewer 1, data for hairy and glabrous SAMs where initially pooled as no differences between them were expected, and next planned electrophysiological experiments were compromised due to the Covid19 pandemic. We are sorry that at this point, we cannot provide additional experiments to clarify this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. From the IFC images shown in Fig. 6A, it is not clear how the authors quantified branch points and innervated hair follicles.</p></disp-quote><p>Branch points correspond to every time a nerve split in 2 or more nerves. Innervated follicles correspond to follicles that are entangled by circumferential and/or lanceolate Nefh+ endings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Figure 3 and corresponding supplementary figures have been redone in the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4.5) Fig. 3E would benefit from a more detailed description. One can easily appreciate that the neurofilament H staining in the cKO sample is different from that of the WT sample but what exactly can be seen here?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following sentence in the results section: “In WT newborn mice, numerous Nefh+ sensory fibers surround all dermal papillae of the hairy skin and footpad of the glabrous skin, whereas in Wnt1Cre::Meis2LoxP/LoxP littermates, very few Nefh+ sensory fibers are present and they poorly innervate the dermal papillae and footpads.“.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4.6) The figure legend to Fig. 4A is unclear. Does the graph show the sum of all recordings performed? From the text, one would guess that the bars correspond to the cKO samples, but this is not specified. Do the controls correspond to WT, Islet1Cre/+ or a mixture of both? In addition, the graph in the lower panel is labeled % Ab fibers, the figure legend reads % of tap units among Ab fibers.</p></disp-quote><p>The graphs show the number of tap units identified among all recorded Aβfibers.
