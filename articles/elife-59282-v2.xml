The cochlea detects sound, whereas the maculae and cristae detect linear accelerations and angular velocity of head movements, respectively. Each sensory organ consists of sensory hair cells (HCs), which are the mechano-transducers of sound and head movements, and each HC is surrounded by supporting cells. Erected on the apical surface of HCs is the stereociliary bundle/hair bundle, which is comprised of a stereociliary staircase that is tethered to the tallest rod of the bundle, the kinocilium. When the hair bundle is deflected toward the kinocilium, the mechano-transducer channels on the tips of the stereocilia open, which allow entry of positive ions and activation of the HC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shotwell et al., 1981</xref>). Thus, orientation of the hair bundle provides the directional sensitivity of its HC.</p><p>Each sensory organ of the inner ear exhibits a defined hair bundle orientation pattern among HCs. Unlike other sensory organs in which hair bundles are unidirectional, the macula of the utricle and saccule exhibit an opposite bundle orientation pattern. Each macula can be divided by a line of polarity reversal (LPR) into two regions, across which the hair bundles are arranged in opposite orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flock, 1964</xref>). Although proper alignment of the hair bundles in sensory organs requires the Wnt signaling pathway and the core planar cell polarity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dabdoub et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Montcouquiol et al., 2006</xref>), the LPR in the maculae is generated by the transcription factor Emx2. The restricted expression of Emx2 to one side of the LPR causes hair bundles within to reverse their orientation by 180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, green color; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holley et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Emx2</italic> knockout or gain-of-function utricles, the LPR is absent and all hair bundles are unidirectional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hair bundle orientation establishment in the developing mouse utricle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In E15.5 utricle, hair bundles are pointing toward each other (arrows) across the line of polarity reversal (LPR, red). The kinocilium is located asymmetrically at the lateral region of the apical hair cell (HC) surface. The mother centriole (MC) (yellow), which forms the basal body of the kinocilium, is located more centrally relatively to the daughter centriole (DC) (orange). Emx2-positive domain is in green.

Then, the kinocilium is relocated from the apical center of the HC to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After the kinocilium acquires its final position, the stereocilia staircase is gradually built next to the kinocilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Sipe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cotanche and Corwin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tilney et al., 1992</xref>). The role of the daughter centriole (DC), the inherent partner of the MC, during hair bundle establishment is not known but it is located slightly more peripheral and basal to the MC in mature HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sipe and Lu, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Emx2 has a conserved role in reversing hair bundle orientation in HCs of mice and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). However, the timing of Emx2 required to mediate hair bundle reversal is not clear. In other tissues such as the brain, olfactory epithelium and urogenital system, <italic>Emx2</italic> is suggested to function as a patterning gene since the lack of <italic>Emx2</italic> affects regional formation of these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miyamoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pellegrini et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, Emx2 could have a similar role in patterning the lateral utricle or specifying the fate of HCs, which indirectly leads to hair bundle reversal. However, Emx2 is known to require the LGN/Insc/Gαi complex in mediating hair bundle reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). The LGN/Insc/Gαi complex forms an asymmetrical crescent on the apical surface of cochlear HCs and this complex is important for guiding the kinocilium to its proper location for cochlear hair bundle establishment and for subsequent stereocilia staircase formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarchini et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, regardless of the mechanisms or timing, Emx2 executes hair bundle reversal by guiding centriole positioning.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the timing of Emx2 in hair bundle reversal. We first live-imaged GFP-labeled centrioles in nascent utricular HCs to track the process of hair bundle polarity acquisition. Then, we compared centriole migration trajectories between the Emx2-positive HCs in the lateral and Emx2-negative HCs in the medial utricle to determine whether there is a fundamental difference in their hair bundle polarity establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that there were no obvious differences between medial and lateral HCs in the centriole migration pattern, other than their opposite direction of trajectory. These results indicate that Emx2 has pre-patterned the HCs prior to centriole migration. However, ectopic <italic>Emx2</italic> in naive medial utricular HCs demonstrated that Emx2 can alter predetermined centriole trajectories within 12 hours (hr) and there is a critical time window for centrioles to respond to Emx2. Furthermore, our live-imaging results showed dynamic relationships between the MC and DC, suggesting that the DC may have an active role in guiding the MC. Disruption of microtubule experiments indicate that both centrioles are actively being translocated to its peripheral location via the microtubule network, and ninein, a centrosomal protein, may anchor microtubules to facilitate centriole migration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Live imaging of hair bundle establishment in medial and lateral hair cells (HCs) based on centriole movements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of E13.5 utricle.

Blocking Gαi with pertussis toxin disrupted the microtubule plus-end binding protein, EB1 and the kinocilium positioning. We tested this hypothesis in our live utricular culture and asked whether the DC behaves in a similar manner as MC. We treated utricular explants with nocodazole, which disrupts the microtubules by binding to free tubulin dimers and inhibits microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoebeke et al., 1976</xref>) and we analyzed nocodazole effects on all stages of centriole migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

However, we observed some HCs with peripherally located centrioles (late Phase II) that were unaffected by 1 hr of nocodazole treatments (n = 8 out of 30 HCs analyzed). It was not clear whether these HCs required longer than 1 hr of exposure to nocodazole in order to respond or they represented HCs that were more mature and thus insensitive to microtubule disruption. To distinguish these possibilities, we treated E13.5 and E14.5 utricle explants with nocodazole for 6 hr and followed centriole trajectories in HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We reasoned that if the non-responsive HCs at E13.5 represented more mature HCs, then this population of HCs should increase in older utricles at E14.5. We observed that 6 hr of nocodazole treatments at E13.5 resulted in rapid central migration of centrioles within an hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>#2, 8C 1.7–2 hr, 8G), similar to treatments for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and the centrioles stayed in the center with the DC in variable positions relative to the MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>#2-#4, 8C 2–7.7 hr). However, a majority of the HCs at E14.5 did not respond to nocodazole treatments in a similar manner. Only 20% of the HCs analyzed showed their centrioles moved away from the periphery within the first hr, compared to 60.3% of the HCs at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, p=0.000089, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata2">Figure 8—source data 2</xref>) and the relative positions between the two centrioles always maintained with the DC being more lateral than the MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>#2-#3, 8F 1.7–3.5 hr). By the end of the experiment, although the two centrioles seemed more centrally displaced, the apical surface of the HC was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>#3, 8F 7.7 hr).

Imaging results of centriole migration in utricular HCs are consistent with a previous model extrapolated from results of SEM that the kinocilium starts out in the center of a HC before reaching its peripheral destination for hair bundle establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dabdoub et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Sipe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denman-Johnson and Forge, 1999</xref>). Based on results in the chicken basilar papilla, it was proposed that the kinocilium undergoes fairly extensive migration along the periphery of the HC before reaching its final destination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cotanche and Corwin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tilney et al., 1992</xref>). However, more recent studies in the mouse cochlea suggest that the MC/kinocilium takes a more direct route from the center of the HC to its final destination in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dabdoub et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Sipe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denman-Johnson and Forge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, a similar time-lapse recording of embryonic cochlear explants of approximately 3 hr demonstrated a confined Brownian motion of centrioles in HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lepelletier et al., 2013</xref>). By calculating the mean square distance of centriole movements in the utricular HCs as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lepelletier et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that centrioles undergo Brownian motion in the utricular HCs but it is not clear whether centriole movements are as confined as in cochlear HCs. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with findings in the mouse that the MC/kinocilium and DC take a direct path to their destination in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Additionally, we found an intriguing centriole migration pattern for hair bundle establishment as discussed below.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary of centriole trajectory during hair bundle establishment in nascent utricular HCs.</title><p>In Emx2-negative Md HCs, Phase I is represented by MC located in the apical center of HCs with the DC dancing around the MC. Ninein is associated with the centrioles, which serves as the nucleation center for microtubules. In early Phase II, when DC migrates toward the peripheral side, the MC starts to follow the direction of the DC and the peripheral crescent LGN/Insc/Gαi complex starts to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>). The broad distribution of ninein surrounding both centrioles is likely to anchor the minus end of microtubules and facilitates centriole migration to the periphery. By the end of Phase II, both MC and DC are located in the periphery and ninein becomes restricted to the centrioles again. Then, centrioles are relocalized towards the cell center by the bare zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>). Cuticular plate starts to form at the beginning of Phase II based on β2-spectrin staining (not drawn). Centriole trajectory in both Phase I and early Phase II are reversible in the presence of Emx2 but responsiveness to Emx2 decreases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Emx2-positive Lat HCs (green) show similar but opposite trajectory pattern of centriolar migration. Nevertheless, LGN/Insc/Gαi may be dispensable for hair bundle establishment in Md HCs since blocking Gαi with pertussis toxin does not appear to affect bundle orientation (asterisk).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59282-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It has been proposed that the migration of kinocilium to its destinated location is achieved through an active force on centrioles via the microtubule network. This active force is suggested to be exerted through LGN/Insc/Gαi complex on microtubules by recruiting Lis1/dynein and/or shortening of microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Sipe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tarchini and Lu, 2019</xref>). Disruption of the microtubule network caused the centrioles to promptly return to their initial central location rather than to remain stationary at the periphery of HCs. These results supported this active force hypothesis regardless of the mechanism involved, whether it is generated by pulling or shortening of the microtubules or both. Furthermore, our nocodazole results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) as well as the anti-Gαi staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) indicate that the DC is likely to be under similar control of the LGN/Insc/Gαi complex as the MC. However, once the centrioles acquire their final position and cuticular plate starts to form, centriole positioning becomes less sensitive to microtubule disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p><p>The directed migration of the centrioles depends on oriented microtubule arrangement of the minus ends at the centrioles and the plus ends at the periphery. This arrangement raises the possibility that proper anchoring of microtubules within HCs is an important factor. Among the anchoring proteins, we focused on ninein, which has both microtubule nucleation and anchoring functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>). It functions as a microtubule nucleation by docking γ-tubulin to the centrosomes and it also anchors microtubules in non-centrosomal site. For example, in pillar cells (supporting cells) of the cochlea, ninein has a non-centrosomal location in adherens junctions, which serve as microtubule anchors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moss et al., 2007</xref>). Although ninein expression is dynamic and variable during the two phases of centriole migration, the broaden distribution of ninein when centrioles migrate towards periphery of the HC is clear and raises the possibility that ninein may function as microtubule anchors in addition to microtubule nucleation during this stage of centriole migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship between DC and MC migration</title><p>Many well described morphological and functional features distinguish between the MC and DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujita et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the function of DC maturing into an MC during the cell cycle, the function of the DC in differentiating cells is only beginning to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loukil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betleja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gottardo et al., 2015</xref>). Other than the DC being actively inhibited to form the cilium, recent results indicate that the proximity of the DC to the MC is also important for primary cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loukil et al., 2017</xref>). Here, in nascent HCs, we show that when the MC was located at the center during Phase I, the DC was observed to move sporadically around the relatively stationary MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). This phenomenon has been described in several vertebrate somatic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piel et al., 2000</xref>). In these cell lines, the MC, which is associated with a microtubule network is stationary, whereas the DC, although associated with the microtubule nucleation marker, γ-tubulin, is more mobile. The functional significance of the mobile DC, however, remains unclear except that this behavior is regulated by the cell cycle and attenuates as cells transition from G1 to S phase.</p><p>During Phase II of the centriole migration, the DC invariably moved ahead of the MC to reach the peripheral destination. This pattern of the DC preceding the MC in migration was observed repeatedly in HCs under all conditions investigated such as during normal centriole migration, recovery from nocodazole treatments, and ectopic <italic>Emx2</italic> activation, suggesting that the migration of the DC is related to the MC. Although little is known about the relationships between the DC and MC in HCs, an inner ear conditional knockout of <italic>Kif3a</italic>, which encodes an intraflagellar transport protein, shows misplaced location and relationship between the MC and DC in cochlear HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sipe and Lu, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Several scenarios could account for the observed behavior of the DC moving ahead of the MC in HCs. One possibility is that the two centrioles move independently of each other. Since the DC is similar to the MC in all parameters examined (association with the microtubule nucleation protein γ-tubulin and responses to microtubule disruption), each centriole can be independently transported by the microtubule-dynein system to their destinations in the peripheral cortex. The faster and higher mobility of the DC may simply be due to the MC being restricted by the attached cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). An alternative scenario is that the MC is being dragged to the periphery by the DC via the intercentrosomal linkers between MC and DC, which are made of rootletin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). The sporadic movements of the DC around the MC in Phase I could also be regulated by the intercentrosomal linkers. In other systems, the length of these linkers can change and disintegrate based on maturation of the centrioles during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bahmanyar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mardin et al., 2010</xref>). However, little is known about the regulation and possible functions of these linkers in post-mitotic cells including HCs. Based on our findings, we speculate that the DC has an active role in guiding the MC/kinocilium to its proper location in differentiating HCs, in addition to its known role in regulating ciliogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of Emx2 in reversing hair bundle orientation</title><p>In zebrafish lateral line, Emx2 regulates neuronal selectivity as well as hair bundle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). In the mouse utricle, onset of <italic>Emx2</italic> expression is well ahead of the emergence of HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Therefore, Emx2 may have a role in regional patterning and/or HC fate specification that indirectly lead to hair bundle reversal. This notion is supported by our live-imaging results demonstrating that HCs are already pre-patterned by Emx2 prior to centriole movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Nevertheless, our ectopic <italic>Emx2</italic> experiments using AAV indicate that tdTomato signal was detectable within 36 hr of AAV-Emx2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This time frame of sequential transcriptional and translational events to yield detectable tdTomato signal is comparable to other mammalian systems. Under the assumption that Emx2 is synthesized in a comparable time frame as tdTomato, hair bundle orientation reversal occurred relatively quickly within approximately 12 hr of detectable tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that while Emx2 may have other functions in the utricle, its bundle reversal effect is likely to be direct and does not require multiple cascades of transcriptional and translational events. Additionally, both the genetic and AAV viral approaches indicate that during these early phases of centriole migration in hair bundle establishment, the system is plastic and responsive to Emx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). However, the time-window of centrioles’ responsiveness to <italic>Emx2</italic> is limited in vivo as ectopic activation of <italic>Emx2</italic> after E15.5 only has a moderate effect on hair bundle reversal in naive HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together these in vivo results and the in vitro results here showing a lack of correlation between the level of Emx2 expression and change in hair bundle orientation of AAV-Emx2-tdT infected HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggest that there is a critical time-window when HCs are responsive to Emx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Our results suggest that ectopic Emx2 is able to alter the course of centriole trajectory during centriole migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) but perhaps as cuticular plate starts to form with the accumulation of β2-spectrin, centrioles are hindered from relocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, our results showed that the DC may have an active role in guiding the MC to its designated location in the HC periphery and a positive force is required to actively maintain this peripheral centriole positioning. These findings provided insights into the regulation of centriole dynamics during hair bundle establishment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CAG:GFP-Centrin2</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752934">21752934</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3793421">MGI:3793421</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Xiaowei Lu (University of Virginia)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Atoh1-Cre</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19609565">19609565</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3775845">MGI:3775845</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Bernd Fritzsch (University of Iowa)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Gfi1-Cre</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20533399">20533399</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:4430258">MGI:4430258</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Lin Gan (Augusta University)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Rosa26R<sup>Emx2</sup></td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28266911">28266911</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (AAV-Virus)</td><td valign="top">AAV2.7m8-CAG-Emx2-P2A-tdTomato</td><td valign="top">Vector Biolabs</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">4.0 × 10<sup>10</sup> GC in 100 µl culture medium</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (AAV-Virus)</td><td valign="top">AAV2.7m8-CAG-tdTomato</td><td valign="top">Vector Biolabs</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">4.0 × 10<sup>10</sup> GC in 100 µl culture medium</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">nocodazole</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">M1404</td><td valign="top">5 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">pertussis toxin</td><td valign="top">Millipore Sigma</td><td valign="top">516560–50 UG</td><td valign="top">8.4 nM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SiR-tubulin</td><td valign="top">Spirochrome</td><td valign="top">SC002</td><td valign="top">1 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti-βII spectrin</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">Cat# 612562, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_399853">AB_399853</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-Arl13b</td><td valign="top">Proteintech</td><td valign="top">Cat# 17711–1-AP, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2060867">AB_2060867</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti-acetylated tubulin</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# T7451, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_609894">AB_609894</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-ninein</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat# Ab231181</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-γ-tubulin</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# ab4447, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_304460">AB_304460</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-Emx2</td><td valign="top">Trans Genic</td><td valign="top">Cat# KO609</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:250)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-Gαi</td><td valign="top">Provided by B.

In some utricular images, GFP signals that overlapped with tdTomato signals in HCs were segmented and GFP signals without overlapping tdTomato signals were eliminated by using the ImageJ macro, Centrin-detector (provided by Dr. Sho Ota). The processed images were used for subsequent analyses. For tracking of centrioles and determination of the apical center of HCs, we performed spot and cell tracking algorithm using Imaris 9.5.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>, Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) and these tracking data were used to generate the 3D reconstructed videos.</p><p>Three-dimensional reconstruction of the HC shape, total centriole trajectory relative to the center of the HC as well as temporal trajectory of selected time-frames of the recordings were generated by tracking data using Imaris. HC shape was determined based on tdTomato expression. For most summaries of selected time frames where the ending positions of the centrioles were drawn as circles such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>#2, the HC contour of the last time frame was used. In selected time frames where the initial positions of the centrioles were shown as triangles such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>#1, the HC contour at the beginning of the recording was used. In cases where the cell center was undefinable due to absence of tdTomato signal as in progenitors and supporting cells, or in young Lat HCs and AAV-infected Md HCs before clear detectable tdTomato expression, DC positions were plotted relative to the MC, which was used as a proxy for the center of the cell and thus no cell shape was drawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>#1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>#1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>).</p><p>The entry of centriole movements into Phase II was determined retroactively when the DC is consistently moving toward the peripheral direction where hair bundles should be established. The x-y and z distance between centrioles were measured based on the coordinate of the tracking data. For the calculation of average x-y and z distances of centrioles in Lat HCs, only last 30 time-points before entering Phase II was used for computing the averages of Phase I Lat HCs, and earlier time-points possibly as progenitors were eliminated. The x-y migration speed was measured from the difference of coordinates of each centriole compared to the center of the HC per each 10 min time-frame, and the average speed of each centriole was calculated from all the time points after HC center could be determined based on tdTomato signals.</p><p>The tdTomato expression level of AAV-Emx2-tdTomato infected HCs was measured using ImageJ based on the relative fluorescent intensities of the tdTomato in HCs subtracted by signals from the surrounding background. To measure ninein fluorescence intensity associated with the centrioles, a line was drawn connecting the two centrioles and ninein signals associated with the centrioles (based on centrin-gfp signals) and in between the centrioles were measured along this line using ImageJ. For measuring the distribution of ninein during centriole migration, the ninein-positive region above threshold was outline and measured using Image J, and differences in ninein areas between Phases were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Direction of DC trajectories in HCs ectopically expressing <italic>Emx2</italic> using either <italic>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></italic> or <italic>Gfi<sup>cre</sup></italic> was analyzed by Chi-square test and for other statistics, students t-test was used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mireille Montcouquiol (Reviewer #2); Raj K Ladher (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study is the first live-imaging analysis of centriole dynamics in developing mouse utricular hair cells before and during hair bundle formation. The centrifugal migration of the basal body towards the hair cell periphery is thought to be the symmetry breaking event that determines hair bundle polarity and orientation. Two major findings are reported. First, the daughter centriole exhibits higher motility and migrates earlier than the basal body and may play an active role in kinocilium migration. Second, the transcription factor Emx2, which is necessary and sufficient to instruct lateral hair cell (LHC) polarity, can repolarize medial hair cells (MHCs) during the window of active centriole motility. The conclusions were supported by rigorous quantitative analysis, as well as pharmacological and genetic manipulations.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the manuscript represents an impressive technical advance in the live imaging of centriole migration during sensory hair cell development, and fits very nicely into the 'Research Advance' category. However, the reviewers would also like some further analysis of the mechanisms involved. The reviewers and editors appreciate that these are technically challenging experiments, but hope that many of the comments can be addressed by further analysis, quantification or re-plotting of existing data, together with some additional discussion. A few points may require additional experimental work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide further analysis of the processes that influence the plasticity period of PCP establishment (centriole motility post-Phase II, and the relationship between cuticular plate development and kinocilium migration (reviewer 1, points 1, 7, 12).</p><p>2) Strengthen support for the conclusion that daughter centriole movement precedes migration of the mother centriole during polarisation and repolarisation (reviewer 1 comments, 4, 5).</p><p>3) The data on Ninein localisation (Figure 6) should be strengthened, e.g. by showing a condition that altered ninein localisation during centriole migration (reviewer 1, point 8; reviewer 2, paragraph 5).</p><p>4) Provide additional discussion on the levels of Emx2 (reviewer 2, paragraph 6).</p><p>5) Address the queries relating to microtubule behaviour and dynamics, and the effects of nocodazole on hair bundle polarity (reviewer 1, points 9-11).</p><p>6) Consider and discuss the potential role of actin in centriole migration.</p><p>7) Address the request from reviewer 3 asking about supporting cell centriole behaviour, in order to distinguish any hair-cell-specific centriole behaviours from those that are generic. If data are available to address this point, please include these – if not, comment and discuss.</p><p>The full reviews are appended below for your information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>While this study describes intriguing hair cell centriole behaviors and further confirms Emx2's role in pre-patterning of LHC polarity, mechanistic insights into regulation of centriole motility/migration or how Emx2 instructs LHC polarity would require further experiments.</p><p>1) Since live imaging can be extended up to 41 hours, it would be informative to examine MHC centriole behaviors post-Phase II. Do centrioles become stationary once they reach the hair cell periphery? Or do they remain motile? How long is the &quot;plastic&quot; phase of centriole motility? This may be addressed by time-lapse more mature MHCs in E14.5 explants.</p><p>2) It was unclear whether the Z distances were included in calculating the inter-centriolar distances. Even though the Z resolution of the microscope was limited, it would still be informative to determine whether the motility of mother (MC) and daughter hair cell centrioles (DC) is largely planar (in the x-y dimension) or three dimensional. It seems plausible that the x-y distance changes while the 3D distance is maintained.</p><p>3) Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2. Quantifications of two MHCs and two LHCs showed that LHCs appeared to have a longer Phase I (20 hours) compared to MHCs (4-8 hours). Is this difference significant? Or could it be explained by the more mature state of MHCs at time &quot;0&quot; compared to LHCs? Or that LHCs were unhealthy at time &quot;0&quot; due to prolonged imaging? Would imaging LHCs in E14.5 explants be more comparable to MHCs at E13.5?</p><p>4) Subsection “Migration of DC precedes MC in medial utricular HCs during hair bundle establishment”. It was stated that DC directional migration precedes that of MC in Phase II. It would be important to show supporting data (e.g. plotting temporal changes in MC and DC positions in addition to showing their cumulative trajectories).</p><p>5) Subsection “Reversing hair bundle orientation by ectopic Emx2”. Likewise, it would be important to show data demonstrating that counter-migration of DC precedes reorientation of MC during MHC repolarization, by tracking DC and MC movement during repolarization over time. It would lend further support to the idea that DC actively participate in kinocilium migration.</p><p>6) Since it is not known how long Phase II lasts, it is uncertain that the peripheral location of the centrioles indicated &quot;that these cells were at the end of Phase II&quot;.</p><p>7) In fact, the AAV-Emx2 transduced MHCs provide an excellent opportunity to compare and contrast centriole behaviors between repolarized and non-repolarized MHCs. This would determine whether centriole behaviors around the time of Tomato expression could predict repolarization competence, and shed light on whether centriole motility underlies the repolarization &quot;plasticity&quot; window.</p><p>8) Figure 6C. Ninein staining around the centrioles at different phases of centriole migration should be quantified to demonstrate the &quot;broad&quot; vs. &quot;focused&quot; distribution pattern.</p><p>9) Figure 7 shows one example of destabilized centriole position upon Nocodazole treatment and centriole re-positioning following washout. Since treated MHCs were at different stages of polarization, it should be both feasible and informative to assess a number of treated cells and determine whether and how many (a) Phase I cells proceeded to Phase II, (b) Phase II cells reverted to Phase I (as shown in Figure 7C), and (c) post-Phase II cells with unaffected centriole position in the presence of Nocodazole. This would more convincingly demonstrate the role of microtubules in kinocilium migration.</p><p>10) Given that the role of kinocilium in utricular hair bundle polarity is debated, it would be important to interfere with microtubules and assess hair bundle polarity. Does prolonged treatment of utricle explants with either nocodazole or SiR-tubulin (which can stabilize microtubules) affect hair bundle polarity?</p><p>11) Related to above, studies of auditory hair cells by Ezan et al. suggest that microtubule cortical capture is critical for kinocilium migration. Thus it would be important to test whether blocking microtubule dynamic instability (without destroying microtubules per se) using low-dose nocodazole would disrupt Ninein localization, Phase I and Phase II centriole behaviors and utricle hair bundle polarity.</p><p>12) The relationship between cuticular plate formation and kinocilium migration was not addressed and warrants further analysis. Correlating anti-spectrin staining with centriole position in hair cells at early stages of polarization (e.g. Phase I, Phase II and post-Phase II equivalent) would inform how the developing cuticular plate might physically constrain centriole migration and impede repolarization competence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors record and analyze the dynamic behavior of the daughter and mother centrioles associated with the future single kinocilium at the surface of the hair cells of the vestibular epithelia, just before and at the onset of PCP establishment. The authors confirm a previous claim of a directed movement of the kinocilium/centrioles via microtubules and demonstrate that whether or not the hair cell is present in an Emx2-positive region of the epithelium, the overall dynamic of the centrioles is similar. Finally, they also show that there is a window of opportunity to re-route the centriole in an Emx2-dependant manner.</p><p>This is a nice and interesting study that expands our knowledge of how PCP is established early in these cells, and notably brings a dynamic and timing element to the mechanism. The results are convincing, and the conclusions not overstated, and I believe it would be of interest not only for scientists in the inner ear field but also for scientists in the PCP and the cilium communities. I must emphasize the technical difficulty of such a study, not only because of the number and complexity of the transgenic mice used but also because time-lapses experiments are not so common in this system due to its size and difficulty of access.</p><p>The authors mention an interesting study by the group of Michel Bornens (Piel et al., 2000) where Piel and colleagues evaluate the role of the cytoskeleton on centrioles movement. These authors notably show that the &quot;characteristic motions of the daughter centriole persist in the absence of microtubules (Mts), or actin, but are arrested when both Mts and actin filaments are disrupted.&quot; Tona and Wu use transient nocodazole treatment to disrupt MT and as a result observed a return of the centrioles to the center of the hair cell and an increase in DC movement. But is actin also participating in the peripheral movement of the centrioles and/or its maintenance at the periphery? The authors seem to suggest that it is only MT dependant.</p><p>In that same paper, the authors measured the area covered by the centriole as a measure of the persistent motion exhibited by a centriole (Figure 5C of that paper). Would it be possible, with the data already at hand, to extract an area covered by the centriole, with respect to HC surface? Or at the very least to highlight a bit better the typical trajectory of a MC and a DC? The trajectories as illustrated in Figure 1D in yellow and orange are difficult to follow. Though the corresponding videos are quite clear, it would be nice to have a schematic with an expended HC surface and different colors to better follow.</p><p>I am not entirely convinced by the conclusions from Figure 6. It is a really informative piece of data but despite a number of cells recorded displaying what seems to be a similar profile of expression of ninein, the staining is spread out and uneven. I would point to Figure 6C Phase II (early), the ninein staining, though covering both centrioles, seems stronger/enriched at the level of the MC. Is it always true? Same observation for image Phase II (late). Is there a way to illustrate this with a heat map or some sort of quantification?</p><p>The authors speculate on temporal sensitivity of the hair cells in response to Emx2 in different contexts: the transgenic knockout mice, the overexpression mice, and the AAV. They discuss this in the subsection “The role of Emx2 in reversing hair bundle orientation”, always in terms of timing. I am wondering if the levels of Emx2 could not participate in the overall mechanism. It is well known for example that core PCP signaling needs to be finely controlled, as too much or too little of core PCP protein will affect the polarity of the tissue. Could the authors speculate, based on what is known about Emx2 in other species and/or tissues, regarding this aspect? I agree that the 3 days delay between the detection of Emx2 in the future sensory epithelium and the detection of hair cells could reflect other roles of Emx2, but could it also be necessary for some accumulation? From a quick survey of the literature, it seems a concentration-dependent mechanism has been suggested for Emx2 in cortical progenitors.</p><p>Regarding the discussion on &quot;pulling&quot; versus &quot;shortening&quot; of the MT (subsection “Hair bundle establishment in HCs”), I do not think the two are mutually exclusive and that one should prevail. Even if the authors have supporting data for the former, the latter is probably also at play. The simplest reason being that the accumulation of the MT fibers has to somehow be &quot;evacuated&quot; as it is pulled, to prevent its accumulation on one side of the HC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The cellular mechanisms that drive the deflection of the kinocilia during generation of polarity are unknown. In the submission from Tona and Wu, they use some lovely live cell imaging to understand the migration of the mother and daughter centriole in the establishment of the polarised hair cell.</p><p>They find that the daughter centriole precedes the mother, in the migration to one side of the cell. Emx2, which seems to reverse the polarity of utricular hair cells, seems to also reverse the migration of the daughter centriole, suggesting there are intrinsic propensities within the hair cell that enable the centriolar response to polarity generation signals.</p><p>I like the story very much, and I think that there is the potential to have very profound insights into the process of polarity generation in the inner ear. As it is, there are more questions raised that I would like to see answered.</p><p>Immunostaining of the centrioles should be performed. In particular looking a centrin (mother and daughter), Odf2 (mother-specific), PARP3 and centrobin (daughter-enriched) should be done. Ideally this would be done with Gai staining as well, to ask if the position of the daughter centriole is coordinated.</p><p>Supporting cells also have centrioles that will generate the basal body for their cilia. What are the supporting cell centrioles doing? Are they coordinated as well? Does Emx2 change their migration?</p><p>One of the obvious parallels is that with spindle orientation. It is surprising that the Gai/LGN system was not directly investigated, although the insinuation is that this data is available (in Figure 8?). What is migration like when the explant is treated with pertussis toxin.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59282.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide further analysis of the processes that influence the plasticity period of PCP establishment (centriole motility post-Phase II, and the relationship between cuticular plate development and kinocilium migration (reviewer 1, points 1, 7, 12).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we correlated the centriole trajectory that we described with cuticular plate formation using anti-spectrin antibody as well as the polarity complex, LGN/Ins/Gαi, required for hair bundle establishment using anti-Gαi antibody.

In the medial utricle, some hair cells are born (post-mitotic) as early as E11.5, whereas the peak of cell cycle exit for hair cell precursors in the lateral utricle is not until E14.5 (Jiang et al., 2017). Therefore, most hair cells in the lateral utricle were not formed yet at the beginning of the live imaging and thus they seemed to spend a much longer time in Phase I than Md HCs. The delay in the appearance of tdTomato signal in the Lat HCs is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Migration of DC precedes MC in medial utricular HCs during hair bundle establishment”. It was stated that DC directional migration precedes that of MC in Phase II. It would be important to show supporting data (e.g. plotting temporal changes in MC and DC positions in addition to showing their cumulative trajectories).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added additional color-coded, temporal trajectory during the end of Phase I and beginning hours of Phase II when DC migrated ahead of the MC in Md HCs (Figures 2, 3), Lat HCs (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3) as well as conditions in which centriole trajectory was redirected such as hair cells overexpressing Emx2 (Figure 3), hair cells infected with Emx2-AAV (Figure 5), and hair cells recovering from nocodazole treatments (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Reversing hair bundle orientation by ectopic Emx2”. Likewise, it would be important to show data demonstrating that counter-migration of DC precedes reorientation of MC during MHC repolarization, by tracking DC and MC movement during repolarization over time. It would lend further support to the idea that DC actively participate in kinocilium migration.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to #4 above. These results have been incorporated into the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since it is not known how long Phase II lasts, it is uncertain that the peripheral location of the centrioles indicated &quot;that these cells were at the end of Phase II&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. This phrase has been fixed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In fact, the AAV-Emx2 transduced MHCs provide an excellent opportunity to compare and contrast centriole behaviors between repolarized and non-repolarized MHCs. This would determine whether centriole behaviors around the time of Tomato expression could predict repolarization competence, and shed light on whether centriole motility underlies the repolarization &quot;plasticity&quot; window.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, bundle repolarization is not correlated with the intensity of tdTomato or Emx2 expression. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the stage of the hair bundle establishment at the time of Emx2 activation determines whether the centrioles will repolarize. Furthermore, since most HCs at E14.5 are not sensitive to microtubule disruption as in E13.5, the time-window when a nascent hair cell can respond to effects of Emx2 may be quite limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 6C. Ninein staining around the centrioles at different phases of centriole migration should be quantified to demonstrate the &quot;broad&quot; vs. &quot;focused&quot; distribution pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewer’s request, we have quantified the distribution of the ninein staining during centriole migration and those results are now shown in Figure 6. On the other hand, association of ninein with a specific centriole was not consistent and those results are also included in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 7 shows one example of destabilized centriole position upon Nocodazole treatment and centriole re-positioning following washout. Since treated MHCs were at different stages of polarization, it should be both feasible and informative to assess a number of treated cells and determine whether and how many (a) Phase I cells proceeded to Phase II, (b) Phase II cells reverted to Phase I (as shown in Figure 7C), and (c) post-Phase II cells with unaffected centriole position in the presence of Nocodazole. This would more convincingly demonstrate the role of microtubules in kinocilium migration.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have now included results showing nocodazole effects on hair cells in Phase I and beginning of Phase II, in addition to the existing results of hair cells in late Phase II (see Figure 7). To address the effects of nocodazole on post-Phase II hair cells, we analyzed nocodazole-treated utricular explants at E14.5 (see Figure 8). Under the same dosage and culture conditions, we did not observe similar changes in centriole movements in hair cells at E14.5 compared to E13.5, suggesting that microtubules are more important during the centriole migration phase of hair bundle establishment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Given that the role of kinocilium in utricular hair bundle polarity is debated, it would be important to interfere with microtubules and assess hair bundle polarity. Does prolonged treatment of utricle explants with either nocodazole or SiR-tubulin (which can stabilize microtubules) affect hair bundle polarity?</p></disp-quote><p>Prolong treatment of E13.5 utricular explants with 5 μM nocodazole for 6 hours caused the two centrioles to remain in the center of the hair cell (Figure 8A-C) similar to treatment after 1 hr (Figure 7). We extrapolated from these results that hair bundle polarity will most likely be affected due to mispositioned centrioles, even though our culture system does not last long enough for us to specifically address hair bundle polarity. However, nocodazole treatments of E14.5 cultures did not cause the two centrioles to move to the center of the hair cell as readily as in E13.5 cultures. Even though some centrioles did move towards the center eventually, the movements were quite different at E14.5, where the two centrioles moved in unison, suggesting that perhaps these movements may be secondary due to reduction of the apical surface of the hair cells (Figure 8). Therefore, these results suggest that centriole positioning in more mature hair cells is less sensitive to microtubule disruption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Related to above, studies of auditory hair cells by Ezan et al. suggest that microtubule cortical capture is critical for kinocilium migration. Thus it would be important to test whether blocking microtubule dynamic instability (without destroying microtubules per se) using low-dose nocodazole would disrupt Ninein localization, Phase I and Phase II centriole behaviors and utricle hair bundle polarity.</p></disp-quote><p>In principle, this is a good idea. In practice, it is a very difficult experiment to execute since nocodazole basically affects microtubule polymerization and stability. It may not be feasible to find an optimal low dosage that does not affect microtubule dynamics too much but changes centriole trajectories. Nevertheless, we made an attempt and tried an experiment using 1μM of nocodazole and the centriole migration under this concentration was normal. For reasons described above, we decided to abandon this line of experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The relationship between cuticular plate formation and kinocilium migration was not addressed and warrants further analysis. Correlating anti-spectrin staining with centriole position in hair cells at early stages of polarization (e.g. Phase I, Phase II and post-Phase II equivalent) would inform how the developing cuticular plate might physically constrain centriole migration and impede repolarization competence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have correlated different stages of centriole migration with formation of the cuticular plate and polarity complex LGN/Ins/Gαi by using anti-spectrin and anti-Gαi antibodies, respectively. Our results indicate that anti-Gαi staining is present during Phase I but the signal is diffused. Then, starting at early Phase II, both spectrin and Gai staining are apparent and on opposite side of the hair cell. This complementary expression pattern between spectrin and Gαi continues to strengthen and maintained by late stage of Phase II (see Figure 9). Therefore, the reviewer may be right that the developing cuticular plate may constrain centriole migration and impede repolarization competence. We have incorporated this idea into our Discussion. Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The authors mention an interesting study by the group of Michel Bornens (Piel et al., 2000) where Piel and colleagues evaluate the role of the cytoskeleton on centrioles movement. These authors notably show that the &quot;characteristic motions of the daughter centriole persist in the absence of microtubules (Mts), or actin, but are arrested when both Mts and actin filaments are disrupted.&quot; Tona and Wu use transient nocodazole treatment to disrupt MT and as a result observed a return of the centrioles to the center of the hair cell and an increase in DC movement. But is actin also participating in the peripheral movement of the centrioles and/or its maintenance at the periphery? The authors seem to suggest that it is only MT dependant.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewer’s suggestions, we investigated the role of actin in centriole trajectory using an inhibitor of actin filament organization, latrunculin-A. We conducted two experiments using 5 μM of Lat-A for approximately 11 hours. Under these conditions, the centrioles did not readily migrate centrally as nocodazole-treated samples at E13.5. In fact, the centrioles in Lat-A-treated samples behaved more like E14.5 HCs treated with nocodazole that both centrioles appeared to move gradually towards the cell center. However, since we haven’t done a dose-response experiment, we cannot confidently conclude whether actin plays a role in centriole migration or not. Given our manuscript is already data-heavy with 10 figures and 9 supplementary figures, we feel the role of actin should be deferred for a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In that same paper, the authors measured the area covered by the centriole as a measure of the persistent motion exhibited by a centriole (Figure 5C of that paper). Would it be possible, with the data already at hand, to extract an area covered by the centriole, with respect to HC surface? Or at the very least to highlight a bit better the typical trajectory of a MC and a DC? The trajectories as illustrated in Figure 1D in yellow and orange are difficult to follow. Though the corresponding videos are quite clear, it would be nice to have a schematic with an expended HC surface and different colors to better follow.</p></disp-quote><p>There were so many frames taken of the centriole positions that it is difficult to demonstrate the temporal trajectory well. Therefore, we decided to highlight the most critical period, in which the daughter centriole precedes ahead of the mother centriole in the migration to the peripheral location (see Figures 2, 3, 5 and 7; Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We hope this addition will help to clarify the centriole movements recorded. Additionally, we included the apical surface of the hair cell by using the Imaris software, in pertinent figures as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not entirely convinced by the conclusions from Figure 6. It is a really informative piece of data but despite a number of cells recorded displaying what seems to be a similar profile of expression of ninein, the staining is spread out and uneven. I would point to Figure 6C Phase II (early), the ninein staining, though covering both centrioles, seems stronger/enriched at the level of the MC. Is it always true? Same observation for image Phase II (late). Is there a way to illustrate this with a heat map or some sort of quantification?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the distribution of ninein in relationship to centrioles during Phase I and II. While the migration of centrioles was always consistent with a broader ninein expression domain, the location of ninein in relationship to the two centrioles was quite variable. These results are now shown in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors speculate on temporal sensitivity of the hair cells in response to Emx2 in different contexts: the transgenic knockout mice, the overexpression mice, and the AAV. They discuss this in the subsection “The role of Emx2 in reversing hair bundle orientation”, always in terms of timing. I am wondering if the levels of Emx2 could not participate in the overall mechanism. It is well known for example that core PCP signaling needs to be finely controlled, as too much or too little of core PCP protein will affect the polarity of the tissue. Could the authors speculate, based on what is known about Emx2 in other species and/or tissues, regarding this aspect? I agree that the 3 days delay between the detection of Emx2 in the future sensory epithelium and the detection of hair cells could reflect other roles of Emx2, but could it also be necessary for some accumulation? From a quick survey of the literature, it seems a concentration-dependent mechanism has been suggested for Emx2 in cortical progenitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an optimal concentration is probably important for most proteins in cells. However, considering the short lag time (approx. 12 hours) of AAV-Emx2 in changing the trajectory of the centrioles and yet this effect is not necessarily correlated with the high levels of ectopic Emx2 expression suggests that the onset of Emx2 expression 3 days ahead of hair bundle establishment is likely to have a different function rather than time required to accumulate enough Emx2 to mediate hair bundle orientation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the discussion on &quot;pulling&quot; versus &quot;shortening&quot; of the MT (subsection “Hair bundle establishment in HCs”), I do not think the two are mutually exclusive and that one should prevail. Even if the authors have supporting data for the former, the latter is probably also at play. The simplest reason being that the accumulation of the MT fibers has to somehow be &quot;evacuated&quot; as it is pulled, to prevent its accumulation on one side of the HC.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and the description has been modified in the revised manuscript. See the Discussion and other places of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Immunostaining of the centrioles should be performed. In particular looking a centrin (mother and daughter), Odf2 (mother-specific), PARP3 and centrobin (daughter-enriched) should be done.

Nevertheless, we are confident in our identification of the mother and daughter centrioles, based on the association with or the lack of Arl13b staining and the relative difference in the apical-basal differences between the location of the two centrioles. Furthermore, the additional Gαi staining correlated well with the position of the daughter centriole (see Figure 9) suggesting that the LGN/Ins/Gαi complex may be involved in regulating the daughter centriole migration as well. In fact, the DC being more laterally positioned than the MC was found to be closer to the LGN/Ins/Gαi complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supporting cells also have centrioles that will generate the basal body for their cilia.
