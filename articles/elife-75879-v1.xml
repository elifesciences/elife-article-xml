This is partially achieved by integration of temporal patterning and spatial patterning of neural progenitors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin and Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan and Thor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>). Temporal patterning of neural progenitors refers to the generation of differently fated progeny in a birth-order-dependent manner, and this is observed in both invertebrates and vertebrates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pearson and Doe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oberst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maurange, 2020</xref>). The central nervous system in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been an excellent model to study temporal patterning. Neural progenitors called neuroblasts (NBs) have been shown to sequentially express series of temporal transcription factors (TTFs), which are each required to specify subsets of neuron fates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyares and Lee, 2019</xref>). For example, neuroblasts in the embryonic ventral nerve cord (VNC) are temporally patterned by a TTF cascade Hunchback (Hb), Kruppel (Kr), Nubbin/Pdm2 (Pdm), Castor (Cas), and Grainy head (Grh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brody and Odenwald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgardt et al., 2009</xref>), while <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe medulla neuroblasts utilize a different TTF cascade composed of Homothorax (Hth), SoxNeuro (SoxN), Doublesex-Mab related 99B (Dmrt99B), Odd paired (Opa), Eyeless (Ey), Earmuff (Erm), Homeobrain (Hbn), Sloppy-paired (Slp1,Slp2), Scarecrow (Scro), Dichaete (D), BarH1/2, Tailless (Tll), and Glial cell missing (Gcm) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Konstantinides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). In these TTF cascades, cross-regulations were identified among TTF genes based on loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes, and they were proposed to form transcriptional cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>) that can in theory self-propagate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbukh et al., 2018</xref>). However, with a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hirono et al., 2012</xref>), the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of these TTF genes haven’t been characterized. Thus, it is not known whether these cross-regulations are indeed direct transcriptional regulations. Moreover, in the embryonic TTF cascade, although mis-expression of one TTF is sufficient to activate the next TTF and repress the ‘next plus one’ TTF, loss of one TTF often does not block temporal progression, but only causes the corresponding fates to be skipped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>). In the medulla TTF cascade, one TTF is required but not sufficient to promote the TTF cascade progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>). These studies suggest that additional mechanisms besides cross-regulations among TTFs might function to regulate TTF progression.</p><p>As the neural progenitors go through the TTF cascade, they need to generate a certain number of postmitotic progeny at each temporal stage. Therefore, it has been questioned whether cell cycle progression is required for the TTF cascade progression. In the embryonic VNC TTF cascade, cytokinesis is required for the first transition (Hb to Kr) and acts by promoting the nuclear export of seven-up (<italic>svp</italic>) mRNA encoding a switching factor, but all later temporal transitions progress normally in G2-arrested neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mettler et al., 2006</xref>). In larval VNC NBs, timely transition from the Imp /Castor/Chinmo to Syncrip/Broad stage also requires cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Ameele and Brand, 2019</xref>). These results suggest that the requirement of cell-cycle progression varies depending on the specific temporal transition. In the vertebrate cortex, the temporal transition from generating deep layer neurons to generating upper layer neurons is not affected by blocking cell cycle progression when constitutively active Notch signaling is provided to maintain the un-differentiated status of cortical neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Okamoto et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is possible that Notch signaling, which is normally dependent on the asymmetric cell division of neural progenitors, may have rescued the possible phenotype caused by the arrest of cell cycle progression.</p><p>Notch signaling plays pleiotropic roles in neurogenesis and neural development in both vertebrates and invertebrates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moore and Alexandre, 2020</xref>). Upon binding to a ligand from a neighboring cell, the Notch receptor is cleaved to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which then enters the nucleus and associates with the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/RBPjκ/Su(H)/Lag-1). The NICD-CSL then recruits the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind (MAM) to activate transcription of Notch target genes, mainly the bHLH transcriptional repressors of the HES (hairy and enhancer of split) /HEY families (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fortini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bray and Furriols, 2001</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> NBs divide asymmetrically multiple times and at each division generate a self-renewed neuroblast and a more differentiated progeny, that is either an intermediate progenitor [Ganglion Mother Cell (GMC) for type I NBs, or Intermediate Neural Progenitor (INP) for type II NBs], or a postmitotic progeny (type 0 NBs) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>). During the asymmetric division of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, Numb, a negative regulator of Notch signaling, is asymmetrically localized to the intermediate progenitor, resulting in unidirectional Delta-Notch signaling from the intermediate progenitor to the neuroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knoblich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rhyu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roegiers and Jan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuerstenberg et al., 1998</xref>). Ectopic activation of Notch signaling in the progeny causes them to revert into neuroblasts and over-proliferate, while inhibition of Notch signaling in type II NBs eliminates the whole lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zacharioudaki et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, in most type I NB lineages, loss of N signaling does not affect neuroblast maintenance, and it was shown that E(spl) complex proteins and Deadpan act redundantly to maintain the un-differentiated state (stemness) of neuroblasts by repressing differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zacharioudaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida and Bray, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Magadi et al., 2020</xref>). Notch signaling is also involved in controlling the daughter cell proliferation modes specifically the type I to type 0 switch in embryonic VNC NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ulvklo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bivik et al., 2016</xref>). Work in the vertebrate central nervous system suggests that during the asymmetric division of neural progenitors, the more differentiated progeny expresses Delta and activates Notch signaling in the sister cell to maintain the neural progenitor fate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moore and Alexandre, 2020</xref>). In addition, Notch signaling shows cell-cycle-dependent activation and the expression of the Notch target Hes genes oscillates during the cell cycle in neural progenitors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kageyama et al., 2009</xref>). Although Notch signaling has been shown to play many important roles in neural lineage development, whether Notch signaling also has a role in temporal transitions between TTFs has not been investigated.</p><p>Here, we use <italic>Drosophila</italic> medulla neuroblasts to address these questions. In the larval optic lobe, a neurogenesis wave spreads in a medial to lateral direction to sequentially convert neuroepithelial cells into medulla neuroblasts. As a result, medulla neuroblasts of different ages are orderly aligned on the lateral to medial spatial axis with the youngest on the lateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Medulla neuroblasts divide asymmetrically multiple times to self-renew and to generate a series of GMCs. At the same time, they transit through the TTF sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Among the TTFs, Slp1 and Slp2 are two homologous fork-head family transcription factors expressed in the same temporal pattern in medulla neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B’’’</xref>). We have chosen the Ey to Slp1/2 transition as a focal point because in the earliest studies that reported temporal patterning of medulla neuroblasts, Slp was the first medulla TTF whose regulatory relationship with the previous TTF Ey was clearly understood from genetic studies: Slp expression is activated by Ey and Slp in turn represses Ey expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, we identified two <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory enhancer elements that regulate the temporal expression pattern of Slp1/2, and showed that the previous TTF Ey, another TTF Scro, and the Notch signaling pathway directly regulate the transcription of <italic>slp</italic> through these enhancers. Slp1/2 expression is delayed when N signaling is lost or when cell cycle progression is blocked which also causes loss of N signaling. Furthermore, we show that supplying transcriptionally active Notch can rescue the timely Ey to Slp transition in cell-cycle arrested neuroblasts. Thus, our work demonstrates that cell cycle-dependent Notch signaling cooperates with TTFs to promote the progression of the TTF transcriptional cascade.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>slp1</italic> and <italic>slp2</italic> genes in medulla neuroblasts is controlled at transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain at the third instar larval stage highlighting the location of the optic lobe medulla. Medulla NBs (shown as circles), located on the surface of the optic lobe, are transformed from neuroepithelial cells (NE) as a neurogenesis wave spreads in a medial to lateral direction. As a result, medulla NBs of different ages are aligned on the lateral (<bold>L</bold>) to medial (<bold>M</bold>) spatial axis. Schematic to the right shows part of the temporal patterning program of medulla NBs with a focus on the Ey to Slp1/2 transition. NBs undergo asymmetric divisions to self-renew and to produce intermediate progenitors called Ganglion Mother Cells that each divide once to produce two neurons. In the Ey stage, NBs undergo a few divisions while gradually activating Slp expression resulting in a significant overlap between Ey and Slp expression in NBs. After Slp level reaches a certain threshold, Ey expression is down-regulated and eventually deactivated completely. This process repeats as subsequent temporal patterning factors are activated and earlier factors down-regulated over several neuroblast division cycles. After several temporal stages that are not shown here indicated by the dashed arrow, neuroblasts express TTF Gcm and exit the cell cycle. The larval brain graphic was created using BioRender.

The protein expression pattern of TTFs is not necessarily the same as that of their mRNA transcripts.

Previous cross-taxa comparative studies have indicated that in many cases, circuits regulating critical patterning processes are conserved across vast evolutionary distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brody et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awgulewitsch and Jacobs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malicki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wray et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that enhancers of genes essential for temporal patterning might be conserved at least across various related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We compared using Evoprinter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Odenwald et al., 2005</xref>) the sequence within <italic>GMR35H02</italic> DNA element across twelve <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. This comparison revealed three broadly conserved segments within <italic>GMR35H02</italic> of sizes 2.1 kbp (R2.2), 973 bp (M1), and 1.5 kbp (L1.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows their relative positions within the <italic>GMR35H02</italic> sequence). For the first iteration of enhancer bashing experiments, we cloned these three sequences into pJR12 vector that expresses an eGFP reporter gene from a basal <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rister et al., 2015</xref>) and made transgenic flies (See primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All DNA constructs containing the enhancer fragments were inserted at the same genomic landing site by φC31 transgenesis, to minimize variation due to genomic position differences and to ensure direct comparability between different reporters. The transgenic line containing the 1.5 kbp enhancer fragment named SlpL1.5 expressed GFP in the same pattern observed for <italic>GMR35H02-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-B&quot;</xref>), indicating that the active enhancer of <italic>slp1</italic> and <italic>slp2</italic> genes in <italic>GMR35H02</italic> is located within this smaller 1584 bp sequence. We then searched for smaller conserved DNA segments within this 1584 bp sequence by Evoprinter and identified three even smaller conserved sequences of sizes 220 bp, 592 bp, and 123 bp, respectively, that we named Slpf1 (220 bp), Slpf2 (592 bp), and Slpf3(123 bp)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As earlier, we cloned these three smaller DNA elements into the pJR12 vector and generated transgenic flies expressing the GFP reporters from an identical chromosomal location. Transgenic flies containing the 220 bp fragment (Slpf1) expressed GFP very similar to the <italic>GMR35H02-Gal4</italic> line we had earlier observed, while the other two did not show any expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B’’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-E&quot;</xref>), indicating that we had narrowed down the active enhancer within the <italic>GMR35H02</italic> sequence to a 220 bp element.</p><p>However, the deletion of this element by CRISPR-Cas9 failed to eliminate the expression of Slp1 and Slp2 in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-A’’’</xref>), though it noticeably reduced the expression domain of Slp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Given that the expression of developmentally regulated genes is often controlled by multiple enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujioka and Jaynes, 2012</xref>) and that enhancer redundancy is important for achieving robust developmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ghiasvand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lagha et al., 2012</xref>), this indicated that other enhancers might act redundantly with this 220 bp enhancer to regulate Slp1/2 expression in medulla neuroblasts. To find other enhancers of <italic>slp</italic> expression, we scanned through the REDfly database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rivera et al., 2019</xref>) – a curated repository of enhancers reported for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genes. An earlier study had conducted an exhaustive analysis of a 30 kbp genomic region surrounding the <italic>slp</italic> transcription units to understand better the regulatory networks underlying <italic>slp</italic> expression during embryonic segmentation and to identify <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements driving <italic>slp1 /2</italic> expressions at parasegment boundary formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujioka and Jaynes, 2012</xref>). In this study, segments of regulatory DNA within 30 kbp of <italic>slp1</italic> and <italic>slp2</italic> transcription start sites, averaging 2kbp in size, were incorporated in a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter coupled to an <italic>even-skipped</italic> promoter, and patterns of lacZ expression were then observed in transgenic flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We obtained transgenic lines used in this study (kind gifts from Dr. Miki Fujioka and Dr. James B. Jaynes) and then tested by antibody staining whether the expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> driven by these enhancers colocalized with endogenous Slp1 and Slp2 proteins in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Through this screen we identified a second regulatory segment corresponding to the REDfly enhancer d5778 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that drove GFP expression in medulla neuroblasts within the endogenous Slp1/2 expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3Q-Q’’</xref>). Since the overlapping d6383 did not express GFP in medulla neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3R-R’’</xref>), we narrowed down the active enhancer’s location to an 850 bp segment within the d5778 enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–C’’’</xref>). Reporter expression driven by this second enhancer (hereafter referred to as d5778 850 bp enhancer) is initiated at a slightly later time compared to the first identified enhancer, and it is in older Slp expressing neuroblasts and also in glial cells at the junction of the medulla and the central brain. To confirm that the d5778 850 bp driven reporter is expressed in medulla neuroblasts, we used <italic>dpn-</italic>Gal4 to drive <italic>UAS-GFP-RNAi</italic> in neuroblasts, and this eliminated GFP expression in medulla neuroblasts. In contrast, GFP expression in neuroblasts is not affected when we use <italic>repo-</italic>Gal4 to drive <italic>UAS-GFP-RNAi</italic> in glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our analysis of the REDfly enhancers that could potentially regulate expression of Slp1/2 in the medulla also revealed that the 220 bp enhancer segment identified earlier is contained within another REDfly enhancer named u8772 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, we refer to the first identified enhancer hereafter as u8772 220 bp. As in the case of the u8772 220 bp enhancer deletion, sole deletion of the d5778 enhancer by CRISPR-Cas9 did not abolish Slp1/2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-B’’’,C</xref>), suggesting that these two enhancers function redundantly and may make additive contributions to attaining the observed levels of Slp1 and Slp2 expression.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Fragments screened or cloned for identifying enhancers of <italic>slp1/2</italic> transcription in medulla neuroblasts.</title><p>Table summarizing names and chromosomal locations of enhancer fragments screened or cloned.

On inducing RNAi knockdowns of the critical Notch pathway components Notch and Su(H) – members of the tripartite core of the active Notch transcriptional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bray, 2006</xref>), it is seen that Slp2 expression is delayed within the RNAi knockdown clones marked by GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–A’’’ and B–B’’’</xref> respectively) compared to wild-type neuroblasts of the same age (i.e. in the same vertical ‘stripe’). Since the lateral to medial spatial axis is a proxy of the neuroblast age, we counted the number of neuroblast when Slp2 is first turned on. In control regions, Slp2 is turned on at the 4th- 5th neuroblast from the lateral edge, while in N-RNAi clones (n=12), Slp2 is turned on at the 10th-15th neuroblast. Similarly, Slp2 expression initiates between the 7th and 10th neuroblasts inside Su(H)-RNAi clones (n=11). A similar effect is seen when a dominant-negative variant of the third core component of the Notch transcriptional complex Mastermind (Mam) is expressed under the control of <italic>ay</italic>-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–C’’’</xref>). Within <italic>mamDN</italic> expressing clones (n=6), Slp2 is initiated between the 7th and 10th neuroblast as with <italic>Su(H) RNAi</italic> clones. These data suggest that timing of Slp1/2 expression in medulla neuroblasts is regulated by the Notch pathway.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The Notch pathway regulates expression of <italic>slp</italic> genes in medulla neuroblasts.</title><p>White arrow to the right indicates the neuroblast age from young to old.

Of these only <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> driven by <italic>delta-Gal4</italic> was seen to be expressed in medulla neuroblasts and in their progeny GMCs. We then examined whether loss of Dl recapitulates the effects we observe on Slp1/2 expression with loss of function of core Notch transcription complex components, as would be expected if Dl is required for activating Notch signaling in these cells. In neuroblasts within Dl-RNAi expression clones, Slp2 expression is initiated at the 6th-10th neuroblasts from the medulla lateral edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–D’’’</xref>) (n=5), consistent with our observations of Slp2 expression in mutants of other Notch pathway components discussed above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Genetic interactions between Notch, Ey, and Scro in the regulation of Slp expression</title><p>Since Ey is required for Slp expression, the delay of Slp expression with loss of N signaling might be due to a delay in earlier temporal transitions resulting in late Ey onset, or a specific delay in the Ey to Slp transition, or both. To test this, we examined the expression of Ey with loss of N pathway components. Ey is normally turned on in the 2nd-3rd neuroblast. In <italic>N-RNAi</italic> clones, Ey is turned on in the 5th-8th neuroblast (n=6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A1-A8</xref>), suggesting that Notch signaling is required for the timely transition into the Ey stage. However, this does not preclude an additional direct role for Notch signaling in the Ey to Slp transition. To examine this, we counted the number of Ey +neuroblast in which the transition to Slp stage occurs. We observed that in wild-type neuroblasts, Slp2 starts to be expressed at a weak level in the 2nd-3rd Ey +neuroblast, and the level becomes stronger one or two neuroblasts later and then remains strong for several neuroblasts, thus the transition to the Slp stage occurs in the 3rd –4th Ey +neuroblast, and after the transition, Ey level starts to decrease because of repression by Slp. In <italic>N-RNAi</italic> clones, the transition to the Slp stage occurs in the 6th-9th Ey +neuroblast (n=6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A1-A8</xref>). In <italic>Su(H)</italic> mutant clones, the transition occurs after the 6th-8th Ey +neuroblasts (n=5)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C’’</xref>). To make sure the delayed Slp transition is not mediated through Ey with loss of Su(H), we supplied Ey using a <italic>dpn</italic>-Gal4 and UAS-Ey in <italic>Su(H)</italic> mutant clones. In such clones, Ey is over-expressed, but the transition to Slp stage is still delayed to the 6th-7th Ey +neuroblast (n=6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E’’</xref>).

This result is consistent with our hypothesis that Notch signing, as a general signaling pathway active in all neuroblasts, requires the previous TTF Ey for its specificity to facilitate Slp expression and promote the transition. Furthermore, overexpression of Scro was also not sufficient to rescue Slp expression in <italic>ey-RNAi</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–J’’</xref>).

Though this suggests that Slp1/2 are not required to initiate their own expression, it does not preclude a possible role of Slp1/2 in sustaining their own expression in older Slp1/2 stage neuroblasts or progeny, but the perdurance of the GFP reporter prevents us from testing this possible role.

We identified all potential matches to consensus binding motifs for these factors using the DNA Pattern Find Tool within the Sequence Manipulation Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stothard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and using the FIMO based web-application to predict transcription factor binding sites mentioned earlier (accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biss.epfl.ch">https://biss.epfl.ch</ext-link>) (please see Materials and methods for details). We adopted this combined approach instead of solely mutating FIMO predicted binding sites for a TF since mutation of FIMO predicted binding sites alone did not always result in GFP reporter expression patterns that were consistent with our observations from genetic experiments. For instance, in the u8772 220 bp enhancer, deletion of the Su(H) binding site that was predicted using FIMO (220-Su(H)-site1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) did not result in a loss of reporter GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This contradicted our result from genetic experiments with the wild type u8772 220 bp GFP reporter, where GFP expression from the reporter is lost or delayed in <italic>su(H)-RNAi</italic> knockdown clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–C’’’</xref>). We suspected this lack of correspondence between phenotypes from genetic experiments and those observed from our transgenic GFP reporters could be explained by our failure to identify all potential transcription factor binding sites using FIMO alone.</p><p>The “DNA Pattern Find” pattern recognition tool accepts transcription factor (TF) binding consensus sequences and DNA sequences to search within for TF binding sites as inputs, and returns the locations of sites matching the consensus within the provided sequence. Consensus DNA sequences recognized by transcription factors were obtained for Ey, Su(H) and Slp1 from Fly Factor Survey, JASPAR databases and from published literature (for Ey) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tanaka-Matakatsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We noticed that predicted binding sites identified by FIMO such as the 220-Ey-Site2 and 850-Ey-Site1 often had minor mismatches to the consensus binding sequence (for example, the 220-Ey-Site2 had two mismatches to the consensus). Therefore, we also considered sites with a maximum of two mismatches on non-critical bases to our consensus sequences as potential binding sites for a particular transcription factor. For Scro, no consensus sequences could be found, hence we searched d5778 850 bp enhancer using available binding consensus sequences for a closely related NK-2 transcription factor Vnd and 19 other related NK-2 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and selected seven most commonly occurring sequence motifs for these factors as putative Scro binding sites. Given the small size of the u8772 220 bp enhancer we identified just the binding site predicted for Vnd within this enhancer as the probable Scro binding site to avoid mutating a significant fraction of its sequence length. We then designed strategies to either delete or mutate the identified binding sites for each TF based on their proximity; when two sites for any two or more TFs overlapped, we used mutations that would not disrupt binding of the other factor. We also tried to keep the lengths of the mutated enhancer variants as close as possible to the wild-type enhancers. We then checked our mutant sequences through the FIMO and DNA Pattern Find to select mutation sequence designs that minimized disruptions of other predicted binding sites. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> lists the original TF binding sites identified and the sequences to which they were mutated. Custom-designed gene blocks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) containing the mutated enhancer sequences were cloned upstream of the GFP reporter in pJR12 vector as before, and transgenic flies expressing these reporter constructs were then made using the same landing site in the genome as the wild-type reporters. We next compared the expression patterns and intensities of GFP reporters with mutated TF binding sites against GFP reporter expression driven by the ‘wild type’ version of that same enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–A’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–A’’’</xref>).

Although the expression pattern and mutant phenotypes suggest that TTFs form a transcriptional cascade, direct transcriptional regulation between TTFs has not been demonstrated in most cases. This work has characterized two enhancers of the <italic>slp</italic> genes that enable the expression of Slp1 and Slp2 in medulla neuroblasts. The u8772 220 bp enhancer is activated at an earlier stage relative to the d5778 850 bp enhancer. In these two enhancers, we identified sites for the previous TTF -Ey and Scro-a TTF expressed at around the same time as Slp1. Deleting either enhancer alone did not eliminate the expression of endogenous Slp1 and Slp2, suggesting that they act partially redundantly with one another. Deletion of both enhancers completely eliminates Slp1 and Slp2 expression in medulla neuroblasts but does not affect their expression in lamina neurons or glia, confirming the specificity and necessity of these two enhancers. Using GFP reporter assays, we have shown that mutation of Ey binding sites in these enhancers abolishes reporter expression similar to genetic experiments where we observe a loss of GFP reporter within <italic>ey</italic> RNAi clones. Our results are also consistent with previous studies that showed a complete loss of endogenous Slp1/2 expression in <italic>UAS-ey-RNAi</italic> expressing neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>). We also confirmed the in vivo binding of Ey to the identified enhancers of Slp by Dam-ID sequencing. The expression of the TTF Scro is initiated simultaneously as Slp1/2, and it has been shown that loss of Scro significantly reduces Slp expression level. Mutation of most probable Scro binding sites on the u8772 220 bp or d5778 850 bp enhancers led to a dramatic reduction of GFP reporter expression. Thus, the combined effect of mutating Scro binding sites on both enhancers recapitulates the observed impact of Scro knock-down on endogenous Slp1/2 expression, which is reduced expression of Slp1/2 in neuroblasts expressing <italic>UAS scro-RNAi</italic> and a consequent loss of neural fates specified by Slp1/2 in their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). It is interesting to note that our observation of multiple enhancers regulating Slp1/2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) is consistent with regulation of Slp1/2 in other developmental contexts. Previous studies have noted the presence of multiple enhancers of Slp1/2 expression in the vicinity of the <italic>slp1</italic> and <italic>slp2</italic> coding loci. Many of these regulatory DNA segments function as stripe enhancers enabling Slp1/2 to function as pair-rule genes during embryonic segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujioka and Jaynes, 2012</xref>). Although these enhancers share some overlapping functions and domains of activation, a full complement of stripe enhancers is required for maintaining parasegment boundaries and wingless expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cadigan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujioka and Jaynes, 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>A coordinated action of temporal patterning factors Eyeless (Ey) and Scarecrow (Scro) and the Notch signaling pathway regulates the expressions of Slp1 and Slp2 in medulla neuroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic summarizing the main findings of this study.

There is always a time delay after the start of Ey expression to the start of Slp expression to ensure the sufficient duration of the Ey window. How is the timing controlled? From our analyses of the <italic>slp1/2</italic> enhancer sequences we found several binding sites for the CSL transcription factor Su(H), most prominently known as a central component of the ternary Notch transcription complex and the primary DNA binding component. To confirm the involvement of the Notch pathway in regulating Slp1/2, we observed the effects of knocking down key Notch pathway components on endogenous Slp1/2 expression. In all cases we observed a delay in the expression of Ey and a further delay in the transition to the Slp1/2 stage in neuroblasts expressing the RNAi knockdowns. Mutating Su(H) binding sites in the u8772 220bpenhancer led to a loss or reduction of GFP reporter expression in neuroblasts. However, mutating Su(H) binding sites in the d5778 850 bp enhancer did not decrease the reporter expression. These results suggest that Notch signaling directly regulates Slp expression through the u8772 220 bp enhancer, but not the d5778 850 bp enhancer, and this is consistent with the delayed expression driven by the d5778 850 bp enhancer. However, Ey still plays a more critical role in activating Slp1/2 expression than the Notch pathway, since Slp1/2 are still expressed albeit later in the absence of Su(H) and other Notch components, and Notch signaling requires Ey to speed up the Ey to Slp transition. As with Ey, we confirmed Su(H) binding to the u872 220 bp enhancer using DamID-seq. Thus, our work provided strong evidence that N signaling, a general signaling pathway involved in neuroblast development, regulates the timing of activation of a TTF gene directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). In addition, our results also raised the interesting hypothesis that Notch signaling might be involved in facilitating all temporal transitions, because the turning on of Opa and Ey is also delayed, and we observed a further and further delay in turning on of later TTFs. Whether Notch signaling regulates other TTF expression directly or indirectly still awaits further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cooperative regulation of target genes including <italic>slp</italic> by the TTF Ey and Notch signaling</title><p>What might explain the delay in Slp1/2 expression in the absence of Notch signaling? Recent developments in single-molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) technology and live imaging techniques using the MS2-MCP system have enabled studying the transcription process in molecular detail. Imaging transcription driven by Notch responsive enhancers in native contexts has shown this process to be inherently 'bursty', i.e., episodes of transcription (enhancer 'On' state) are punctuated with gaps in activity (enhancer in 'Off' state) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).

Additionally, binding of tissue-specific regional factors to these Notch responsive enhancers may prime these enhancers and help synchronize transcription and sustain a steady transcriptional output upon Notch binding to enhancers; this helps integrate important positional cues and the perception of context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>).

In the medulla neuroblasts, we also observed that in <italic>Su(H</italic>) mutant clones, the clone size and neuroblast proliferation are not significantly affected. On the other hand, we observed that N signaling is dependent on cell-cycle progression, and the Notch target gene is lost when cell cycle progression is blocked.</p><p>In the medulla, blocking cell cycle progression in neuroepithelial cells prematurely transforms them into neuroblasts, and these neuroblasts seem to be arrested or severely delayed in the TTF cascade. When we arrested or slowed down the cell cycle later in neuroblasts to preserve Ey expression, we observed Slp expression is still delayed. Therefore, cell cycle progression also has a role in the Ey to Slp transition. Further, we showed that supplying Notch signaling is sufficient to rescue the delay in the Ey to Slp transition caused by cell cycle defect. Thus at the Ey to Slp transition, the cell cycle effect is mediated through the direct regulation of Slp transcription by Notch signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that in Ey stage neuroblasts, Ey is required to initiate Slp expression but not sufficient to activate it to a strong level right away, and after each asymmetric division, activation of Notch signaling in the neuroblast enhances Slp expression, until Slp expression reaches a certain level to repress Ey expression and make the transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This can be part of a mechanism to coordinate the TTF temporal transition with the cell cycle progression to generate the appropriate number of neural progenies at a given temporal stage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>Flies were reared on yeast food at 25 °C unless otherwise stated.</p><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Enhancer identification</title><p>Flies carrying the <italic>GMR35H02-Gal4</italic> insertion (BDSC 49923) were crossed with transgenic flies expressing <italic>UAS-GFPnls</italic> (BDSC 4776).

We searched for consensus motifs of transcription factor binding sites for Ey, Su(H), Slp1 in JASPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandelin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fornes et al., 2020</xref>) and Fly Factor Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). We then searched for potential matches to these consensus sequences in our enhancers using the DNA Pattern Find program in Sequence Manipulation Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stothard, 2000</xref>). Since consensus motifs for binding sites of Scro were not reported in either JASPAR or Fly Factor Survey, we picked 20 related transcription factors of the NK-domain TF family with known binding motifs as templates for finding possible Scro binding sequences (NK2 TFs used are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We looked for potential matches to these motifs within our enhancers using the Pattern Recognition Tool of the Sequence Manipulation Suite. Sequences that were most shared between the 20 NK domain containing TFs were scored as the most likely motifs for Scro binding in the d5778 870 bp enhancer. Given the smaller size of the u8772 220 bp enhancer, only motifs corresponding to Vnd binding sites were mutated since Scro has been suggested to share the greatest homology to Vnd of all NK domain containing TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zaffran et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The consensus sequences we used for identifying binding sites for each of our candidate regulators Ey, Su(H), and Scro in the DNA Pattern Recognition program are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Using this approach, we found additional potential binding sites for Ey and Su(H) than what were predicted using FIMO. We noticed that predicted binding sites identified by FIMO such as the 220-Ey-Site2, 850-Ey-Site1 and 850-Scro-Site 1 and 6, often had minor mismatches to the consensus binding sequence used as input (for example, the 220-Ey-Site2 had two mismatches to the consensus). Therefore, we also considered sites with a maximum of two mismatches to our consensus sequences for the DNA Pattern Find program as potential binding sites for a particular transcription factor. We detected such potential binding sites that deviated by at most two base pairs from the consensus search sequence using less stringent pattern search conditions in the DNA Pattern Find program.</p><p>To test this binding site search method’s validity, we cloned custom gene blocks of enhancer segments containing mutated binding sites for each transcription factor into the pJR12 vector. We subsequently made transgenic flies expressing these ‘mutant’ reporters as described elsewhere in Methods. All transgenes were inserted at the same chromosomal location as the wild-type GFP reporters. Reporter GFP expressions driven by these mutation-carrying enhancers were consistent with evidence from genetic experiments where wild-type GFP reporter expressions were observed in Ey, Su(H), or Scro knockdown or loss of function clones, thus demonstrating the reliability of this approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Plasmids constructs and the making of transgenic fly stocks</title><p>Primer sequences for all cloning are provided in a supplementary file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>For making all constructs DNA was amplified from the template using Expand High-Fidelity Polymerase (Roche) unless stated otherwise and all constructs were verified by sequencing.

Individual G1 males were then crossed to the same double balancer line to create stocks. The G1 males were then genotyped by PCR to identify whether their genome had been edited, using RedExtract-n-Amp tissue PCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The G2 progeny of genome-edited males were then raised until homozygous stocks were established. To delete both enhancers, gRNAs for the d5778 enhancer was injected into a fly line carrying <italic>nos-Cas9</italic> and deletion of the u8772 enhancer and genotyped as previously. Genomic DNA from CRISPR-Cas9 edited flies was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Mating crosses were incubated at 25 °C. Eggs laid within an 8-hr window were then shifted to 18 °C for 3 days until they hatched. The expressions of the Dam-fusion proteins were then induced in larval brains by shifting the larvae to 29 °C for 72 hr. Climbing third instar larvae were then dissected. Only the optic lobes were used for further sample preparation. For each sample around 100 brains were dissected.</p><p>Dam-ID libraries were made as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>. Briefly, fly brains were dissected in 1 X PBS and genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was then digested with DpnI and purified using spin column purification (Qiagen PCR-purification kit). To the DpnI digested DNA DamID-PCR adaptors were ligated. Subsequently the adaptor-ligated DNA fragments were digested with DpnII. The DpnII digested genomic DNA fragments were then amplified by PCR to enrich for bound GATC fragments. To make sequencing libraries the PCR enriched genomic DNA sample was sonicated using a Bioruptor bath sonicator (Diagenode), purified using AMPure XP beads, end-repaired and 3’-adenylated. Illumina sequencing indexes were then ligated to these fragments. Index-labeled DNA fragments were then further enriched by PCR amplification, checked for quality and fragment size distribution on an Agilent Bioanalyzer and by qPCR (Quality control of all libraries was carried out at the Functional Genomics Unit of Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, UIUC). Libraries that were deemed acceptable were then sequenced on a single SP100 lane of an Illumina NovaSeq sequencer. Read lengths were 100 bp. Two Biological replicates of <italic>Ey-Dam</italic>, <italic>Su(H)-Dam</italic> and <italic>Dam</italic>-only samples were sequenced, and each biological replicate is defined as one library generated from ~100 dissected brains. The number of reads obtained were as follows: Dam replicate1: 53745480 reads, Dam replicate 2: 85637355 reads, Ey-Dam replicate 1: 81121107 reads, Ey-Dam replicate 2: 82085708 reads, SuH-Dam replicate 1: 77448608 reads, replicate 2: 80015207 reads.

The main utility- the damid-seqpipeline was used to align reads to the genome using bowtie2, bin and count reads, normalize counts and generate log-2 ratio bedgraph files for each DamID-sample and its corresponding Dam-only control. The provided gatc.track file was used for running the script. Next, the findpeaks utility was used with an F.D.R. &lt;0.01 to identify peaks. We then used the provided peaks2genes utility to assign peaks to genes. To assess the reproducibility of our data we also ran the findpeaks script using F.D.R &lt;0.1 to discover peaks with weaker statistical confidence and used this as input for the I.D.R.

Image analysis was carried out using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Signal intensities in the GFP and the Dpn channels were measured over a small rectangular selection for all variants. For the same enhancer a ‘scaling factor’ was calculated for each mutant by dividing the Dpn channel intensity for the mutant reporter by the channel intensity of the corresponding wild-type reporter. The GFP channel intensities for each variant were then multiplied by this scaling factor. Finally, a ratio of the scaled GFP channel intensity to the Dpn channel intensity was calculated for each GFP reporter variant. Ratios of scaled GFP/Dpn intensities were then plotted using GraphPad Prism. For each enhancer, Ordinary One-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test were carried out between reporter variants of the same enhancer. For the d5778 870 bp enhancer, five sets of data from twenty different optic lobes were acquired for each enhancer (one set- wild type and all mutant variations all imaged using the same conditions).

Yet nothing is known about whether the transcription factor cascades are built from direct gene regulation, e.g. factor A binding to enhancers in gene B to activate its expression. Here, Ray and Li show that one temporal factor, Slp1/2, is regulated transcriptionally via two molecularly defined enhancers that directly bind two other transcription factors in the cascade as well as integrating Notch signaling. This is a major step forward for the field and provides a model for subsequent studies on other temporal transcription factor cascades.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75879.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0293rh119</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Oregon</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0293rh119</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Oregon</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Maurange</surname><given-names>Cédric</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02feahw73</institution-id><institution>Aix Marseille University, CNRS</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.29.466469">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.29.466469v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Chris Q Doe as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Cédric Maurange (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Overall, the manuscript is a beautiful body of work using multiple methods to address the question of how one TTF (Slp1/2) is temporally regulated. There are two major comments that require experiments (hopefully they have been anticipated and are near completion) and numerous minor comments for clarity.</p><p>We encourage you to address the two essential points and all of the minor points prior to resubmission. We look forward to the speedy publication of your work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Deletion of both enhancers is necessary to show that they are required for activation of Slp1/2.</p><p>(2) Currently the role of N signaling in direct regulation of Slp1/2 is unclear.

What am I missing here?</p><p>Figure 7 was the most difficult figure to process. The indicated phenotypes where hard to visualize. A reporter gene needs to be added to show the Vsx domain; the brackets were hard to link to the phenotype (e.g. there seemed to be phenotypes outside the bracketed region).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The whole paragraph describing how the two enhancers u8772 and d5778 are identified is really not clear. In particular, it is not mentioned in the text how many and which candidate regulatory segments were cloned in the GFP-reporter vector and tested, and on what basis they were identified. The authors should better introduce the previous work that was made in particular by Fijioka and Jaynes on the dissection of the regulatory regions in the slp locus, and how much they rely on their work to identify some regulatory regions active in medulla NBs. They should also better explain the basis underlying REDfly-mediated identification of enhancers. The authors should also make a scheme depicting which regions they have screened for activity in medulla NBs and through what type of constructs and transgenic assays. Finally, do the authors think they have exhaustively covered the locus?</p><p>– The description of the bioinformatic analysis is unclear. The authors mention that they use different strategies to search for binding motifs. Their first strategy using TOMTOM and BISS appears to fail identifying the important sites after validation using mutated transgenic constructs. However the data are not shown. A second strategy using JASPAR, Fly Factor Survey and the Sequence Manipulation Suite appeared more fruitful. It would be useful to know what is the precise outcome from the two approaches. Did the first strategy only identified a subset of the predicted binding sites ? If yes which one were missing and identified via the second strategy?</p><p>Please also make, in a main figure, a scheme depicting the putative binding sites of the different transcription factors within the two enhancers and with the identified binding motifs.</p><p>– I am not familiar with the resolution that this technology should provide but the DamID profiles of SuH and Ey seem very similar in Figure 6, perhaps too similar. Can you show profiles on genes known to be targeted by either of the transcription factors as controls?</p><p>– Not clear whether the delay in Slp activation upon inactivation of Notch signaling is due to a global delay of all temporal transitions, or a specific delay in the Ey-&gt;slp transition. What about the Hth-&gt;Ey transition NBs upon inactivation of Notch Signaling? Are the late D+ and Tll+ temporal fates induced?</p><p>– Do you think Notch signaling is required, or facilitates all temporal transitions, or is only involved in the Ey-&gt;Slp transition? Please discuss this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors should show that Slp1/2 mRNA transcription colocalize well with Slp1/2 expression in combined high magnification image to strengthen the conclusion the Slp1/2 expression is controlled at the transcription level.</p><p>2. The data shown in Figure S1F does not demonstrate that the two identified enhancer elements actually regulate Slp2 expression. While the authors show data to suggest that these enhancers can drive an expression pattern that is overlapping to Slp2, they do not show that the enhancers have any significant effect on the expression pattern of Slp2. The authors should consider performing deletion of both enhancers to see if this can significantly reduce Slp2 expression or should limit their conclusions to Slp1 with regards to these enhancer elements.</p><p>3. The data shown in Figure 1E and 1F are not sufficient to confidently describe the expression pattern of these enhancer elements. If the authors claim that d5778 is expressed in neuroblasts is true, they should be able to reduce neuroblast-specific GFP expression by driving gfpRNAi using a neuroblast-specific gal4 line but not by driving gfpRNAi using a glia-specific gal4 line.</p><p>4. In Figure 2, the data suggested that Su(H)RNAi delayed expression of Slp2 expression, and in figure 3, Su(H)RNAi causes a reduction in enhancer activity. The authors should stain for Slp1/Slp2 and the GFP enhancer in the same brains where Su(H)RNAi or eyRNAi are driven. Currently, the data presented does not suggest that the enhancer expression is directly linked to the expression of Slp1/2.</p><p>5. The authors claim that they identify Su(H) peaks around scro or hbn, however, the data shown in Figure S2B does not indicate any significant peaks for Su(H), only for eyeless. The authors either need to repeat the experiment to generate a strong enough consensus for Su(H) peaks in order to demonstrate significance or remove this claim.</p><p>6. The authors' DamID data suggests that eyeless is bound by Su(H). Could the effects seen by Su(H)RNAi be due to a reduction in eyeless signaling? The authors should consider the possibility that Su(H) acts on Slp1/2 through eyeless.</p><p>7. In regards, to Figure 4, the authors claim that mutating Slp binding sites did not significantly reduce reporter expression, but in the figure the graph shown suggests that the Slp binding site mutant had a significantly reduced expression, while the image shown suggests that patterning of the Slp binding site mutants is still intact. The authors should reconcile these inconsistencies.</p><p>8. The authors claim in Figure 5D and 5F, that the upon mutating Su(H) sites in enhancer, that GFP signal is still intact in the glia and likely intensified. If this is the case, the authors should be able to demonstrate this glial expression changes in the supplement. Additionally, the images in Figure 5D show what appears to be a complete decoupling in enhancer patterning. It is not clearly shown if this is due to the GFP signal in the glia, or if this loss of patterning is from another cause.</p><p>9. For Figure 7E and 7F the authors conclude the overexpression of NICD in the PCNA RNAi background rescues Slp2 expression loss, but the authors do not include a control showing what occurs if NICD is overexpressed in a WT background. The authors also did not offer any potential explanation for what role the cell cycle is playing</p><p>10. Please examine if the temporal transcription factors upstream of Slp1/2 can be activated by Notch.</p><p>11. In Figure 7E and 7F the authors use AyGal4 to minimally affect Ey expression, but the clones shown make it difficult to see how much Ey expression is affected. To more clearly illustrate Ey role, the authors should show if NICD can rescue Slp1/2 expression pattern in an Ey Loss of function background. This would help to clarify if Notch signaling is playing only a direct role or if Ey can mediate Notch activation of Slp1/2.</p><p>12. The authors do not include a model summarizing their findings, especially in regards to what role Notch and cell cycle progression play in temporal patterning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75879.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Deletion of both enhancers is necessary to show that they are required for activation of Slp1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have successfully generated a line in which both enhancers are deleted (<italic>slp<sup>DED</sup></italic>).

We examined whether loss of Notch affects earlier factors, and indeed the upstream TTF Ey is also delayed when we knock down Notch or Su(H). Medulla neuroblasts from the youngest to the oldest are aligned on the lateral to medial spatial axis. Ey is normally turned on in the 2<sup>nd</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> neuroblast from the lateral edge of the medulla. In N-RNAi clones, Ey is turned on in the 5<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> neuroblast (6.50±1.05, n=6) (Figure 5A1-8), suggesting that Notch signaling is required for the timely turning-on of Ey. However, this does not preclude an additional direct role for Notch signaling in the Ey to Slp transition. To examine this, we counted the number of Ey+ neuroblast in which the transition to Slp stage occurs. We observed that in wild type neuroblasts, the transition to Slp stage occurs in the 3<sup>rd</sup> -4<sup>th</sup> Ey+ neuroblast, while in N-RNAi clones, the transition to Slp occurs in the 6<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup> Ey+ neuroblast (7.67±1.21, n=6) (Figure 5A1-8). In <italic>Su(H)<sup>47</sup></italic> mutant clones, the transition occurs in the 6<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> Ey+ neuroblasts (6.80±0.84) (Figure 5B-C’’). To make sure the delayed Slp transition is not mediated through Ey in <italic>Su(H)<sup>47</sup></italic> mutant clones, we supplied Ey using a <italic>dpn</italic>-Gal4 and UAS-Ey in <italic>Su(H)<sup>47</sup></italic> mutant clones. In such clones, Ey is over-expressed, but the transition to Slp stage is still delayed to the 6<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup> Ey+ neuroblast (6.40±0.54, n=6) (Figure 5D-E’’). The difference from wild type is significant by t-test (see Figure 5 legend). These results suggest that Notch signaling is also required to facilitate the Ey to Slp transition in addition to an earlier role on Ey. We also examined the expression of Opa, the TTF upstream of Ey. Opa has two stripes of expression in medulla NBs. When we knock-down Notch pathway components, the 1<sup>st</sup> stripe of Opa is expanded, while the 2<sup>nd</sup> stripe is delayed. Furthermore, the expression of later factors D and BarH1 are severely delayed or mostly lost when we knocked down Su(H) (Figure 5G-H’). Overall, these results suggest that Notch may facilitate each temporal transition. Specifically for the Ey to Slp transition, we demonstrated a direct role for Notch signaling to promote Slp expression through the u8772 220bp enhancer. Mutating two predicted Su(H) binding sites in the u8772 220bp enhancer dramatically reduced the reporter expression, while mutating all four predicted Su(H) binding sites abolished the reporter expression. It is a different case for the d5778 850bp enhancer, mutation of four or six out of six predicted Su(H) binding sites did not decrease the reporter expression, suggesting Notch signaling does not activate the d5778 850bp enhancer through these binding sites. Taken together, these data suggest that Notch signaling may activate Slp expression only through the u8772 220bp enhancer. This explains why the d5778 850bp enhancer drives reporter expression later than the 220bp enhancer and the endogenous Slp. Further, with loss of Notch signaling, endogenous Slp expression is only delayed but not completely lost, and this can also be explained by our finding that the d5778 850 bp enhancer directs a delayed expression of Slp and this expression is not dependent on Notch signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work is from a new lab working on the mechanism of temporal transcription factor (TTF) gene regulation in optic lobe neuroblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

For the d5778 850bp enhancer, we also see prominent Ey binding peaks but less Su(H) binding peaks, consistent with our new observation that Notch signaling activates Slp expression through the 220bp enhancer but not the 850bp enhancer. Binding peaks for Ey and Su(H) are also observed surrounding the enhancer and promoter of <italic>slp</italic> genes, possibly because of the relatively low resolution of Dam-ID compared to ChIP-seq, and/or possible enhancer/promoter looping that brings the fusion protein close to the promoter region. It is also possible that Ey and Su(H) may bind to other enhancers in the region that are responsible for driving expression of <italic>slp</italic> genes in other contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 was the most difficult figure to process. The indicated phenotypes where hard to visualize. A reporter gene needs to be added to show the Vsx domain; the brackets were hard to link to the phenotype (e.g. there seemed to be phenotypes outside the bracketed region).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included PCNA staining to show where the affected region is. In the affected region, the nuclear staining of PCNA is lost.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The whole paragraph describing how the two enhancers u8772 and d5778 are identified is really not clear. In particular, it is not mentioned in the text how many and which candidate regulatory segments were cloned in the GFP-reporter vector and tested, and on what basis they were identified. The authors should better introduce the previous work that was made in particular by Fijioka and Jaynes on the dissection of the regulatory regions in the slp locus, and how much they rely on their work to identify some regulatory regions active in medulla NBs. They should also better explain the basis underlying REDfly-mediated identification of enhancers. The authors should also make a scheme depicting which regions they have screened for activity in medulla NBs and through what type of constructs and transgenic assays. Finally, do the authors think they have exhaustively covered the locus?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this great suggestion. We have now included a Table (Table 1) showing all of the fragments that we have screened or cloned. The coordinates of the fragments on chromosome 2L are also included. We have added detailed description of how we screened the lines generated by Fijioka and Jaynes on the dissection of the regulatory regions in the slp locus, and included all of our data on these lines as a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We also included how we did two rounds of enhancer bashing to identify the minimal 220bp enhancer, and how we narrowed down the second enhancer to 850bp. We have generated a schematic depicting all of the fragments we screened and cloned (Figure 2A). We have covered most of the locus. Furthermore, we showed deleting both enhancers by CRISPR completely eliminated Slp1 and Slp2 expression in medulla neuroblasts, suggesting that there is no other enhancer to drive Slp1and 2 expression in medulla neuroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The description of the bioinformatic analysis is unclear. The authors mention that they use different strategies to search for binding motifs. Their first strategy using TOMTOM and BISS appears to fail identifying the important sites after validation using mutated transgenic constructs. However the data are not shown. A second strategy using JASPAR, Fly Factor Survey and the Sequence Manipulation Suite appeared more fruitful. It would be useful to know what is the precise outcome from the two approaches. Did the first strategy only identified a subset of the predicted binding sites ? If yes which one were missing and identified via the second strategy?</p><p>Please also make, in a main figure, a scheme depicting the putative binding sites of the different transcription factors within the two enhancers and with the identified binding motifs.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the first strategy only identified a subset of the predicted binding sites. We have included a figure (Figure 3) and a table (Table 2) showing the location of the predicted binding sites for different transcription factors within the two enhancers, and the identified binding motifs. In our Table 2, we listed all of the binding sites identified by the second approach, and the sites also identified by the first strategy are indicated with a star*. We also included data for our first round of mutation on the 220bp enhancer: deletion of the FIMO-predicted binding site of Su(H) did not affect the reporter expression (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I am not familiar with the resolution that this technology should provide but the DamID profiles of SuH and Ey seem very similar in Figure 6, perhaps too similar. Can you show profiles on genes known to be targeted by either of the transcription factors as controls?</p></disp-quote><p>For DamID-sequencing, the locations of readings also depend on the open chromatin region and the presence of GATC sequences. Therefore in the genomic regions where both transcription factors bind, their reading profiles may appear very similar. Furthermore, we need to look at the IDR reproducible peaks for the real binding events.</p><p>Our analysis did identify a list of genes that were bound reproducibly both by Ey and Su(H) (Supplementary Table 4). We think it is reasonable to expect that the TTF Ey and the Notch signaling pathway, both being critical regulators in the neuroblasts, may cooperatively regulate a large number of genes in neuroblasts. Using DAVID, we conducted a functional annotation clustering analysis of this gene list. Genes related to the Notch pathway and participating in cell cycles were strikingly enriched within this list of co-bound genes (Supplementary Table 5), thus raising the possibility that in medulla neuroblasts, TTFs such as Ey can modulate the responsiveness of Notch target genes in the medulla to mitogenic Notch signaling as has been seen in Type II neuroblasts (Farnsworth et. al 2015).</p><p>Our analysis also identified a set of genes bound uniquely by Ey. For example, only Ey I.D.R peaks were observed in the genomic region of <italic>hmx</italic> gene, and the profiles are now shown in (Figure 10—figure supplement1B). Hmx is a transcription factor expressed in Notch-off neurons born from the Ey stage neuroblasts, and consistently our results demonstrates specific binding for Ey but not Su(H).</p><p>A third set of genes are bound uniquely by Su(H) reproducibly (Supplementary Table 4). For example, an I.D.R peak only for Su(H) was found in the dll genomic region (Figure 10—figure supplement1C). Since it has been shown that Notch-on neurons born from the Tll stage neuroblasts express Dll, it will be interesting to test whether Notch signaling activates Dll expression directly through binding to this peak region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Not clear whether the delay in Slp activation upon inactivation of Notch signaling is due to a global delay of all temporal transitions, or a specific delay in the Ey-&gt;slp transition. What about the Hth-&gt;Ey transition NBs upon inactivation of Notch Signaling? Are the late D+ and Tll+ temporal fates induced?</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed in our response to “Essential Revisions #2”, loss of Notch signaling does affect the onset timing of earlier TTFs like Opa and Ey. However, by counting the number of Ey+ neuroblast in which the transition to Slp occurs, we found that the Ey-&gt;slp transition is further delayed by loss of Notch signaling. The expression of later factors D and BarH1 (a TTF that we recently identified to be between D and Tll, and required for Tll expression) are severely delayed or mostly lost when we knocked down Su(H). Thus our results suggest that Notch signaling may facilitate each temporal transition. Specifically for the Ey to Slp transition, we demonstrated a direct role for Notch signaling to promote Slp expression through the u8772 220bp enhancer. Mutating two predicted Su(H) binding sites in the u8772 220bp enhancer significantly reduced the reporter expression, while mutating all four predicted Su(H) binding sites abolished the reporter expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Do you think Notch signaling is required, or facilitates all temporal transitions, or is only involved in the Ey-&gt;Slp transition? Please discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, our data suggest that Notch signaling may facilitate each temporal transition. However, whether Notch signaling acts directly to regulate transcription of other TTFs remain to be investigated. We have added this discussion to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors should show that Slp1/2 mRNA transcription colocalize well with Slp1/2 expression in combined high magnification image to strengthen the conclusion the Slp1/2 expression is controlled at the transcription level.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided data showing that Slp2 mRNA colocalizes well with Slp2 protein in medulla neuroblasts (Figure 1D). Slp1 antibody, unfortunately doesn’t work well after the <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization procedures.

The data shown in Figure S1F does not demonstrate that the two identified enhancer elements actually regulate Slp2 expression. While the authors show data to suggest that these enhancers can drive an expression pattern that is overlapping to Slp2, they do not show that the enhancers have any significant effect on the expression pattern of Slp2. The authors should consider performing deletion of both enhancers to see if this can significantly reduce Slp2 expression or should limit their conclusions to Slp1 with regards to these enhancer elements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included our double enhancer deletion result which demonstrated that these two enhancers together are necessary and specific enhancers for both Slp1 and Slp2 in medulla neuroblasts and progeny.

The data shown in Figure 1E and 1F are not sufficient to confidently describe the expression pattern of these enhancer elements. If the authors claim that d5778 is expressed in neuroblasts is true, they should be able to reduce neuroblast-specific GFP expression by driving gfpRNAi using a neuroblast-specific gal4 line but not by driving gfpRNAi using a glia-specific gal4 line.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this great suggestion. We used a neuroblast-specific Gal4 (dpn-Gal4) to drive UAS-GFP-RNAi in neuroblasts, and this eliminated GFP expression in the medulla region. In contrast, GFP expression in neuroblasts is not affected when we use repo-Gal4 to drive UAS-GFP-RNAi. We provide these data in the Figure 2—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 2, the data suggested that Su(H)RNAi delayed expression of Slp2 expression, and in figure 3, Su(H)RNAi causes a reduction in enhancer activity. The authors should stain for Slp1/Slp2 and the GFP enhancer in the same brains where Su(H)RNAi or eyRNAi are driven. Currently, the data presented does not suggest that the enhancer expression is directly linked to the expression of Slp1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We did have Slp2 staining in the same experiment, but didn’t show the Slp2 channel in the original figure. Now we have included the Slp2 channel (current Figure 6). We can see that both the reporter expression and the Slp2 expression are delayed, and they closely correlate with each other. These data show that the enhancer expression is directly linked to the expression of Slp1/2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors claim that they identify Su(H) peaks around scro or hbn, however, the data shown in Figure S2B does not indicate any significant peaks for Su(H), only for eyeless. The authors either need to repeat the experiment to generate a strong enough consensus for Su(H) peaks in order to demonstrate significance or remove this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors' DamID data suggests that eyeless is bound by Su(H). Could the effects seen by Su(H)RNAi be due to a reduction in eyeless signaling? The authors should consider the possibility that Su(H) acts on Slp1/2 through eyeless.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined whether loss of Notch or Su(H) affects Ey expression. Indeed Ey is also delayed when we knock down Notch or Su(H). Ey is normally turned on in the 2<sup>nd</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> neuroblast. In N-RNAi clones, Ey is turned on in the 6<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> neuroblast (6.50±1.05, n=6) (Figure 5A1-8), suggesting that Notch signaling is required for the timely turning-on of Ey. However, this does not preclude an additional direct role for Notch signaling in the Ey to Slp transition. To examine this, we counted the number of Ey+ neuroblast in which the transition to Slp occurs. We observed that in wild type neuroblasts, the transition to Slp occurs on the 3<sup>rd</sup> -4<sup>th</sup> (3.83±0.41, n=6) Ey+ neuroblast, while in N-RNAi clones, the transition to Slp occurs on the 6<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup> Ey+ neuroblast (7.67±1.21, n=6) (Figure 5A1-8). In <italic>Su(H)<sup>47</sup></italic> mutant clones, the transition occurs on the 6<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> Ey+ neuroblasts (6.80±0.84) (Figure 5B-C’’). To make sure the delayed Slp expression is not mediated through Ey in <italic>Su(H)<sup>47</sup></italic> mutant clones, we supplied Ey using a <italic>dpn</italic>-Gal4 and UAS-Ey in <italic>Su(H)<sup>47</sup></italic> mutant clones. In such clones, Ey is over-expressed, but the transition to Slp stage is still delayed to the 6<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup> Ey+ neuroblast (6.40±0.54, n=5) (Figure 5D-E’’). The difference is significant by t-test ( see figure 5 legends). These results suggest that Notch signaling also facilitate the Ey to Slp transition in addition to an earlier role on Ey.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In regards, to Figure 4, the authors claim that mutating Slp binding sites did not significantly reduce reporter expression, but in the figure the graph shown suggests that the Slp binding site mutant had a significantly reduced expression, while the image shown suggests that patterning of the Slp binding site mutants is still intact. The authors should reconcile these inconsistencies.</p></disp-quote><p>Mutating Slp binding site reduced the expression level significantly, but didn’t affect the expression pattern. We have clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors claim in Figure 5D and 5F, that the upon mutating Su(H) sites in enhancer, that GFP signal is still intact in the glia and likely intensified. If this is the case, the authors should be able to demonstrate this glial expression changes in the supplement. Additionally, the images in Figure 5D show what appears to be a complete decoupling in enhancer patterning. It is not clearly shown if this is due to the GFP signal in the glia, or if this loss of patterning is from another cause.</p></disp-quote><p>Mutating Su(H) sites in d5778 850bp caused greatly intensified glia expression preventing us to assess the neuroblast expression. We now provide a co-staining with glia marker Repo to show the intensified GFP expression in glia (Figure 9 —figure supplement1). When we used repo-Gal4 to drive GFP-RNAi in glia to remove the glia expression as suggested (Figure 9), we actually can see the neuroblast expression pattern again. This shows that the apparent change in enhancer patterning is due to very strong GFP signal in the glia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. For Figure 7E and 7F the authors conclude the overexpression of NICD in the PCNA RNAi background rescues Slp2 expression loss, but the authors do not include a control showing what occurs if NICD is overexpressed in a WT background.

We have now included panels showing Ey and Slp expression with the same NICD construct under same heat shocking conditions in wild type background.

In Figure 7E and 7F the authors use AyGal4 to minimally affect Ey expression, but the clones shown make it difficult to see how much Ey expression is affected.
