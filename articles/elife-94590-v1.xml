Our study reveals that the RAS–p110α signalling pathway, known for its involvement in various biological processes and tumourigenesis, regulates two vital aspects of the inflammatory response in macrophages: the initial monocyte movement and later-stage lysosomal function. Disrupting this pathway, either in a mouse model or through drug intervention, hampers the inflammatory response, leading to delayed resolution and the development of more severe acute inflammatory reactions in live models. This discovery uncovers a previously unknown role of the p110α isoform in immune regulation within macrophages, offering insight into the complex mechanisms governing their function during inflammation and opening new avenues for modulating inflammatory responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>RAS–p110α</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003339</institution-id><institution>Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JAEICU-21-IBMCC-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosell</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014180</institution-id><institution>Junta de Castilla y León</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSI185-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alcón Pérez</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000654</institution-id><institution>Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF7 MCA-ITN317445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krygowska</surname><given-names>Agata Adelajda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI2018-099161-A-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosell</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuesta</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>de Paz</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><name><surname>Castellano Sanchez</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Asociación Española Contra el Cáncer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EPAEC222641CICS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Paz</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014180</institution-id><institution>Junta de Castilla y León</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CLC-2017-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellano Sanchez</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019154</institution-id><institution>CRUK Barts Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Development Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellano Sanchez</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disruption of RAS–p110α signalling in macrophages impairs both the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses, revealing a critical regulatory role in immune function and inflammation control.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) are a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositides (PtdIns) at the 3′-hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuesta et al., 2021</xref>). Upon activation, PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). PIP<sub>3</sub> serves as a second messenger that recruits proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, such as Akt (also known as protein kinase B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castellano and Downward, 2011</xref>). This activation of PI3K regulate various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, growth, survival, motility, inflammation, and metabolism, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuesta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madsen and Vanhaesebroeck, 2020</xref>). In macrophages, the activation of PI3K–Akt signalling is crucial to restrict inflammation and to promote anti-inflammatory responses in Toll-like receptor-induced macrophages, contributing to macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Troutman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vergadi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid kinases composed of catalytic and adaptor/regulatory subunits that can be categorized into three classes based on their structures and substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castellano and Downward, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kok et al., 2009</xref>). Class I catalytic isoforms, including p110α, p110β, p110γ, and p110δ, play essential roles in integrating signals from growth factors, cytokines, and other environmental cues. While p110α and p110β are ubiquitously expressed, p110δ and p110γ are largely restricted to the myeloid and lymphoid lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kok et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hawkins and Stephens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okkenhaug, 2013</xref>). While p110α is primarily associated with cell growth regulation and survival in epithelial cells, it must be considered that this isoform is also expressed in immune cells, including macrophages. The role played by p110α in macrophages is not well understood, although some studies have suggested that it might regulate the survival and the regulation of the phagocytic activity of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>). In the context of cancer, impairment of RAS binding to p110α somatically results in reduced recruitment of macrophages to the tumour site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murillo et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, this disruption leads to a change in macrophage polarization, favouring a more pro-inflammatory M1 state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murillo et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that p110α plays a crucial role in regulating macrophage-dependent functions. However, despite these insights, the precise impact of p110α on macrophage function and the underlying molecular mechanisms influencing the inflammatory response are not yet fully understood.</p><p>Inflammation is a complex and tightly regulated series of events triggered by various stimuli such as pathogens, harmful mechanical and chemical agents, and autoimmune reactions. The inflammatory response primarily occurs in vascularized connective tissues, involving a dynamic interplay of plasma components, circulating cells, blood vessels, and cellular and extracellular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaplin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Medzhitov, 2021</xref>). During inflammation, mediators released by recruited leukocytes orchestrate a response that aims to facilitate tissue repair and protect the body against harmful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Medzhitov, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerhardt and Ley, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages play a vital role in the inflammatory response by performing functions such as antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and immunomodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Medzhitov, 2021</xref>). Their role begin with the active recruitment of monocytes from the bloodstream to the site of infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi and Pamer, 2011</xref>) where they differentiate into macrophages and recognize microbes and cellular debris through specific mechanisms. Macrophages subsequently actively participate in phagocytosis, a vital process involving the internalization and elimination of pathogens. Microbial destruction predominantly takes place within lysosomes and phagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballabio and Bonifacino, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saftig and Puertollano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gordon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kourtzelis et al., 2020</xref>). At later stages of inflammation, macrophages contribute to the resolution of inflammation, thus preventing progression from acute to persistent inflammation that would cause additional tissue damage.</p><p>In this study, we have used a combination of cell biology techniques and animal models to better understand the role of RAS-dependent activation of p110α at the different stages of the inflammatory response. Our findings show that RAS–p110α signalling plays a key role in the initial stages of inflammation, facilitating the extravasation of monocytes from the bloodstream by promoting the necessary cytoskeletal changes. Subsequently, RAS–p110α has a crucial role in lysosomal acidification and activation of cathepsins, which are indispensable for efficient degradation of lysosomal cargo; when these functions are impaired, prolonged acute inflammatory responses and delayed resolution steps are observed. These results significantly enhance our understanding of the complex mechanisms governing the immune response to inflammation, emphasizing the pivotal role played by RAS–p110α signalling in orchestrating proper monocyte extravasation and maintaining optimal lysosomal function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disruption of RAS–p110α causes prolonged and more acute responses to inflammatory stress in vivo</title><p>Previous data suggested that, in a tumoural setting, somatic disruption of RAS–p110α prevents macrophage recruitment to tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murillo et al., 2014</xref>) and favours polarization of macrophages to a pro-inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murillo et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a possible role for p110α in macrophage function. To determine whether RAS-dependent activation of p110α participates in innate or adaptive immune responses to inflammation in macrophages, we used an established mouse model designed for the tamoxifen-inducible disruption of RAS binding to p110α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To assess the impact of RAS–p110α-binding deficiency on inflammatory intracellular signalling, we first examined Akt activation. The results revealed a decrease in Akt activation levels under inflammatory conditions in BMDMs lacking RAS–p110α binding, while no discernible change was observed in ERK activation, another well-known RAS effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

Results showed that, under unstimulated conditions, RAS–PI3K disruption decreases the expression of IP-10, MIP-1α (Ccl3), JE (Ccl2/MCP1), IL-16, and IL-12p70, with no upregulated cytokines observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The downregulation of IP-10, MIP-1α, and JE indicates an impaired ability to recruit monocytes, macrophages, and T cells to sites of inflammation. This suggests that macrophages lacking RAS–PI3K interaction may have a reduced capacity to mount a robust immune response, particularly in recruiting and activating essential immune cells needed to combat pathogens or initiate inflammation.</p><p>Regarding LP + IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages, results showed a decrease in the expression of IL-1β and IL-17, key drivers of pro-inflammatory responses, and an upregulation of IL-7, Ilra, JE, BLC, I-309, Eotaxin, and G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Elevated levels of these factors are associated with enhanced chemotactic signals and regulatory functions. Thus, the cytokine and chemokine expression profile observed in RAS–PI3K-deficient macrophages suggests impaired pro-inflammatory responses and altered immune cell recruitment patterns, potentially influencing the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair processes.</p><p>Next, we assessed whether the absence of RAS binding to p110α affects the ability of BMDMs to acquire a pro-inflammatory state characterized by increased expression of markers such as CD80, CD86, and MHCII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas and Mantovani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mercalli et al., 2013</xref>). To assess this, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> BMDMs were stimulated with LPS + IFN-γ, followed by flow cytometry analysis. Expression levels of CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), and MCHII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>) were examined. No significant differences were observed in the expression levels of any of these markers between the two genotypes under study.</p><p>Consequently, our next objective was to investigate whether in vivo disruption of RAS–p110α might lead to altered inflammatory responses. To address this, we administered tamoxifen to 10- to 12-week-old <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice with tamoxifen and, after a 2-week interval, conducted a paw swelling assay. In this assay, zymosan (10 μg/μl) or PBS was injected into the hind paws of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice with paw thickness measured at regular intervals over a 5-day period. The results revealed a significant increase in paw inflammation in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice compared to <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice, evident from the earlier time points measured and persisting throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Paws from the <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice, which had not received tamoxifen, exhibited comparable levels of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). This reaffirms that the absence of p110α triggers a significant alteration in the inflammatory response and confirms that <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice do not show any phenotype, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, analysis of the blood sedimentation rate, a reliable indicator of systemic inflammation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paulsen et al., 2017</xref>), showed a lower basal sedimentation ratio in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice under PBS-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Following zymosan injection, both genotypes exhibited an increase in sedimentation rate, but the rise was more pronounced in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice, indicating a heightened systemic inflammatory response. These findings underscore that disruption of RAS–p110α interaction results in an exacerbated inflammatory state, reflected in both localized paw inflammation and systemic inflammatory mediator levels.</p><p>To delve deeper into the inflammatory response induced by zymosan, we collected paw samples at 2- and 5-day post-injection and conducted haematoxylin and eosin studies. This approach enabled a comprehensive analysis, allowing us not only to scrutinize the early stages of inflammation but also to monitor the subsequent resolution phase of the inflammatory process. Paws obtained from mice injected with zymosan for 2 days displayed extensive areas of damaged connective tissue in both <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> paws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, the inflamed region in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice was larger compared to control samples. After 5 days of zymosan injection, there was a significant reduction in the inflamed area, although it remained comparatively larger in the paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This observation suggests a prolonged and heightened inflammatory response in mice lacking RAS–p110α interaction, emphasizing the role of this interaction in the regulation of inflammatory processes.</p><p>The cellular composition within the inflammatory abscess offers crucial insights into the severity and progression of the disease. Close examination with the pathologist revealed features indicative of an acute inflammatory response, including an inflammatory abscess with elevated numbers of polymorphonuclear cells, primarily neutrophils, and macrophages displaying altered cell shape and increased cell death, accompanied by fibrin and chromatin deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Notably, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice exhibited lower numbers of macrophages, a larger necrotic area with increased chromatin remnants, and reduced fibrin content compared to the paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>). By day 5, paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice showed a significant increase in the number of macrophages, a decrease in polymorphonuclear cells, and a nearly complete resolution of the necrotic area, indicating the initiation of the resolution phase. Moreover, there were abundant activated fibroblasts, suggesting active production of new connective tissue. In contrast, paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice exhibited a delayed healing process characterized by a larger central area of polymorphonuclear cells, abundant fibrin deposits, reduced numbers of infiltrating macrophages, and limited fibroblast activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-H</xref>). These findings collectively indicate an imbalance in the inflammatory response and a slower progression towards resolution in the absence of RAS–p110α interaction, emphasizing the pivotal role of this interaction in orchestrating an effective and timely resolution of inflammation.</p><p>To evaluate the presence of macrophages within the inflammatory lesion, we performed specific immunohistochemical analysis using the macrophage-specific marker CD68 in paws from day 5, where more cellular preservation and initiation of the healing process had been observed. A notable decrease in the number of CD68-positive cells was observed in the inflamed abscess region of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the involvement of p110α signalling in the acute inflammatory response, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> mice were subjected to daily treatment with BYL719 (Alpelisib), a specific inhibitor of p110α isoform. After an initial 48-hr treatment period, the mice received injections of zymosan or PBS into their back-hind paws and were sacrificed 2 days later for analysis. Similar to what we had observed in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice, the inflamed area in BYL719-treated mice exhibited a larger extension than the inflamed are from non-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>). The central necrotic region was significantly larger in the BYL719-treated mice, and it contained large amount of apoptotic polymorphonuclear cells, lower number of macrophages, and increased deposits of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) resembling the observations from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice. Immunostaining for CD68 revealed a reduction in the number of macrophages present in the inflammatory abscess upon inhibition of p110α signalling with BYL719 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings highlight that both genetic disruption of RAS–p110α interaction and pharmacological inhibition of p110α contribute to an expanded inflamed area and central necrotic region, concurrently reducing macrophage infiltration in a zymosan-induced inflammation model. These results collectively underscore the pivotal role of the p110α isoform of PI3K in orchestrating the resolution of inflammatory responses, emphasizing its significance in modulating the dynamics and outcomes of inflammatory processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Disruption of RAS binding to p110α impairs the number of inflammatory monocytes in blood and spleen</title><p>Given the decrease in macrophages observed in the inflammatory abscess, we next set out to determine whether disruption of RAS binding to p110α had an effect on the number of monocytes circulating in the blood of adult mice. <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice were treated with tamoxifen at 12–14 weeks of age and 4 weeks later, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and immune populations were analysed by flow cytometry. To assess the effects of RAS–p110α disruption on immune populations, we employed a flow cytometry gating strategy as described in the Methods section. Briefly, CD45+ cells were initially gated to define the overall immune cell population. Within this population, B cells were identified by CD19+ CD11b− staining, and T cells were defined by CD3+ expression. Further differentiation of T cell subtypes (CD4+, CD8+, and double-negative T cells) was conducted based on CD4 and CD8 markers within the CD3+ cell population. Additionally, myeloid cells were gated as CD11b+ cells, with further identification of granulocytes and monocytes based on Ly6G and Ly6C expression. Specifically, granulocytes/neutrophils were characterized as Ly6G+ Ly6C+, classical monocytes as Ly6G− Ly6C+, and alternative monocytes as Ly6G− Ly6C− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

As such, its accumulation is proportional to the number of acidic vesicles. Data analysis showed that disruption of RAS–p110α in BMDMs leads to a significant decrease in lysotracker uptake, both in unstimulated conditions and also after activation with LPS + IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Although RAS–p110α signalling disruption affects all the hematopoietic cells, several lines of evidence indicate that macrophages play a central role in the observed phenotype. In our chimera mice experiments, neutrophil depletion did not alter the reduced transendothelial extravasation, suggesting that macrophages are the primary cell type involved. Furthermore, in the paw oedema model, macrophages were the population exhibiting the most significant functional defects. Together, these findings, along with the specific deficiencies observed in myeloid populations, support a predominant role of macrophages in mediating the impaired inflammatory response. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that other myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells or additional immune populations, may also contribute to the global phenotype and further analysis should be performed to address this.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The role of RAS–p110α in macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses.</title><p>In the presence of functional RAS–p110α, monocytes efficiently migrate through the endothelium in response to inflammatory signals.

The increase in cytoskeletal components, particularly F-actin, causes a notable increase in cell stiffness and a concurrent decrease in cell deformability. The orchestration of these changes underscores the intricate balance in cytoskeletal dynamics. Notably, the regulatory role of Rho-GTPases comes into focus as potential mediators of this phenomenon. Rho-GTPases are well-known mediators of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soriano et al., 2021</xref>), and their dysregulation is known to impact cell mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolfenson et al., 2019</xref>). The observed increase in cell stiffness and deformability, may thus be governed by the modulation of Rho-GTPase activity. This intricate interplay provides a compelling avenue for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms through which RAS–p110α disruption influences Rho-GTPases, ultimately shaping the biomechanical properties of macrophages and may open avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting cytoskeletal dynamics in macrophages.</p><p>Monocyte extravasation shares many features with monocyte egression from the bone marrow. During monocyte egress, monocytes also undergo changes in cytoskeleton dynamics to detach from the sinusoidal endothelial cells and to migrate through the endothelial fenestrae and basement membrane into the bone marrow sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamnev et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the decrease in the number of classical monocytes in the <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/</sup></italic><sup>–</sup> mice in blood may be due, at least in part, to a defect in the extravasation process. This result may also explain, at least partially, the lack of macrophage recruitment to lung tumours found in previous studies using the RBD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murillo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our findings also revealed a crucial role of RAS–p110α activation in the acute phase of the inflammatory response by regulating effective lysosomal degradation of phagocytosed and engulfed material. Phagocytosis constitutes a vital step in the inflammatory response, whereby phagosomes bind to lysosomes to form phagolysosomes in which pathogens are eradicated to facilitate an appropriate host response. This response encompasses antigen presentation to engage T-cell responses, secretion of inflammatory mediators that guide the adaptive immune response, and initiation of tissue repair mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gordon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Underhill and Goodridge, 2012</xref>). Our data provide evidence that the activation of RAS–p110α signalling pathway is involved in the critical process of lysosomal acidification, which is essential for the efficient degradation of internalized particles and the activation of proteolytic enzymes, ultimately resulting in the formation of fully functional lysosomes. Consequently, lack of lysosome acidification impairs the expression and activation of important proteases such as Cathepsins B and D. The proper functioning of lysosomes is essential for mounting a robust response to inflammatory stress. Lysosomes play a central role in the breakdown of pathogens and dead cells by providing the necessary degradative enzymes and maintaining an acidic environment that facilitates the degradation of engulfed particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballabio and Bonifacino, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saftig and Puertollano, 2021</xref>). When lysosomal function is compromised in macrophages, the degradation of phagocytosed material becomes impaired, leading to the accumulation of toxic debris. This accumulation subsequently triggers inflammation and causes damage to the surrounding tissues, leading to chronic inflammation and appearance of lysosomal storage diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scerra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferreira and Gahl, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our data showed that the disruption of Ras–p110α in macrophages presents a multifaceted impact in inflammatory response, notably manifesting as a reduction in NF-κB activation and cathepsin expression coupled with diminished lysosomal function. NF-κB, a pivotal regulator of inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tak and Firestein, 2001</xref>), is intricately linked to lysosomal dynamics, with lysosomes playing a crucial role in modulating NF-κB signalling through the degradation of relevant molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Mingo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the observed decrease in NF-κB activation aligns with the decline in lysosomal function, which has previously been suggested in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). This bidirectional influence, where perturbations in lysosomal function coincide with alterations in NF-κB activity, underscores the intricate and context-dependent nature of this regulatory network, suggesting a plausible mechanistic interdependence. Our data suggest that disruption in Ras–p110α signalling cascade could trigger downstream effects impacting both NF-κB activity and lysosomal integrity. This nexus between Ras–p110α signalling, NF-κB activation, cathepsin expression, and lysosomal function underscores the complexity of cellular regulatory networks. Further analysis of the molecular pathways connecting these observations holds the potential to reveal novel insights into the coordinated regulation of inflammatory and lysosomal processes in macrophages. Thus, further investigations are necessary to decipher the causal relationships and unravel the broader implications of Ras–p110α disruption in shaping these intricate cellular responses during the inflammatory response.</p><p>The possible functional link between the increased actin polymerization and lysosomal dysfunction observed in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice remains an unanswered question. Lysosome acidification and actin polymerization are tightly interconnected processes that have pivotal roles in numerous cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kast and Dominguez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taunton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ettelt et al., 2023</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that lysosome acidification can influence actin polymerization dynamics through the activation of specific actin-binding proteins and the modulation of actin-regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kast and Dominguez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stockinger et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, disruption in lysosome acidification, such as impaired proton pump activity or lysosomal storage disorders, have been associated with changes in actin polymerization and the organization of the cytoskeleton. Notably, it has been reported that depolimeryzation of F-actin plays a crucial role in assembling the macromolecular components of the acidification machinery in nascent endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hryciw et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the intricate relationship between lysosome acidification and actin polymerization suggests a potential reciprocal influence, where perturbations in one process could impact the other. Further investigation is required to determine the precise regulatory mechanisms by which p110α influences both lysosome acidification and actin polymerization, whether it occurs in a linear manner or through separate pathways.</p><p>This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that govern the immune response to inflammation, particularly emphasizing the essential role of RAS–p110α signalling. Our results underscore the pivotal role of RAS–p110α signalling in both the initiation and resolution of inflammation. The impaired ability of RAS–PI3K-deficient monocytes and macrophages to effectively migrate, initiate a robust inflammatory response, and resolve inflammation highlights the critical importance of this pathway in maintaining immune homeostasis. The persistent inflammation observed in these models may contribute to the development and perpetuation of chronic inflammatory conditions. Given the centrality of p110α in both initiating and resolving inflammation, its dysfunction could be a key factor in the chronic, dysregulated inflammation characteristic of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, or systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><p>The potential of p110α as a therapeutic target in these conditions is especially intriguing. The recent identification of a p110α small molecule activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2023</xref>) offers a promising tool to explore this avenue. By transiently enhancing p110α function, it may be possible to promote the resolution of inflammation and thereby alleviate the symptoms and progression of these inflammatory diseases. Further research into this therapeutic strategy could open new pathways for treating chronic inflammatory disorders, providing much-needed relief for patients affected by these debilitating conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p><italic>Pik3ca</italic><sup>RBD/lox</sup>/Rosa26<sup>CreERT2/WT</sup>/KRAS<sup>G12D/WT</sup> mouse model was kindly given by Dr. Downward Laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>For removal of <italic>Pik3ca</italic>- floxed allele, <italic>Pik3ca</italic><sup>RBD/lox</sup> and <italic>Pik3ca</italic><sup>WT/flox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) were given 3.2 mg tamoxifen (Sigma) dissolved in 80 μl of corn oil by oral gavage once per day during 3 consecutive days.

Six hours later, anesthetized chimeric mice (150 mg/kg ketamine, 7.5 mg/kg xylazine, i.p.) were placed in supine position on a heating pad (37°C) for maintenance of body temperature. The mesenteric vascular bed was exteriorized, placed on a purpose-built stage of an upright brightfield microscope (Zeiss Axioskop). Mesenteries were superfused with warmed (37°C) Tyrode’s solution (Sigma). After a 5-min equilibration period, analysis of leukocyte–endothelium interactions was made in at least 9 (and up to 16) randomly selected segments (100 µm in length) of post-capillary venules (20–40 µm in diameter) for each mouse. Leukocyte rolling was quantified by counting the number of rolling cells passing a fixed transversal line in the middle of the vessel segment for 5 min. Leukocyte adhesion (stationary position of the cell for 30 s or longer) was quantified along a 100-µm vessel length and data were normalized as the number of cells per 500 µm vessel segments. Leukocyte extravasation response was quantified within 50 µm on either side of the 100 µm vessel segment in the perivenular tissue; and data were normalized as the number of extravasated leukocytes per mm2 of extravascular tissue. At the end of the analysis period, mice were humanely killed by cervical dislocation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>BMDM elastic modulus</title><p>The elastic modulus of BMDMs was quantitatively assessed utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM). Specifically, cells were cultured on cover glass slides, which were subsequently positioned in a specialized BIO-AFM setup integrated with an inverted optical microscope (Nikon TE2000). The BIO-AFM was equipped with a V-shaped, four-sided pyramidal silicon nitride tip (Bruker AFM Probes) to facilitate accurate force measurements. To avoid localized variations and ensure data representativeness, no more than three cells were selected from a single field of view for mechanical characterization, and these cells were never contiguous. Subsequently, the stiffness of each individual cell was characterized through measurements obtained at three perinuclear points. For each point, force–displacement (<italic>F</italic> vs. <italic>z</italic>) curves were captured (10 µm amplitude at a speed of 5 µm/s). The determination of the elastic modulus was performed based on the analysis of force–displacement curves. A total of five curves were recorded for each perinuclear point at an indentation depth of 300 nm. Data were analysed by fitting the curves to the Hertz model as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jorba et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rico et al., 2005</xref>).

Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,100 RCF for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined using a Qbit 2.0 Fluorometer. A total of 1400 μg of protein was diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with Array Buffer 6, followed by the addition of 0.5 ml Array Buffer 4 and 15 μl of the reconstituted Mouse Cytokine Array Panel A Detection Antibody Cocktail. The samples were mixed and incubated for 1 hr on a shaker at room temperature. Nitrocellulose membranes from the mouse cytokine array were blocked with Array Buffer 6 for 1 hr at room temperature on a shaker. The blocking buffer was then removed, and the sample mixture was added to the arrays, which were incubated overnight at 4°C on a shaker. Membranes were washed with Wash Buffer provided by the manufacturer. Membranes were then incubated with 1× Streptavidin-HRP in Array Buffer 6 for 30 min at room temperature.

Twenty-four hours later LPS + IFN-γ was added when necessary. Triplicates of each condition and genotype were prepared. Time-lapse imaging was carried out for 24 hr. One image was taken every 10  min within the same well using a Nikon microscope driven by Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Chicago, IL, USA). A total of 80–100 cells per condition were tracked using the Fiji plugin Trackmate. Pre-processing was done using Mexican hat filter 3.0 radius to increase particle detection. Images were segmented using the fluorescence channel with the Laplacian of the Gaussian detector with a 30-μm estimated particle diameter, a 10.0 threshold and median filter option selected. Segmented objects were linked from frame to frame with a Linear Assigment Problem (LAP) tracker with 45 μm frame-to-frame linking distance and 2 frame gap closure.

The mass spectrometer was controlled by Xcalibur software and operated in the positive mode. The spray voltage was 1.95 kV and the capillary temperature was set to 200°C. The LTQ Orbitrap XL was operated in data-dependent mode with one survey MS scan followed by 5 MS/MS scans. Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis was performed using three independent biological samples per group. Additionally, each sample was analysed in technical duplicates. To ensure robust quantitative analysis, we utilized LTQ Orbitrap XL tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to generate six distinct mass spectral profiles from each group.</p><p>MS raw files were converted into Mascot Generic Format using Mascot Distiller (version 2.3.0) and searched against the SwissProt database (release December 2015) restricted to human entries using the Mascot search daemon (version 2.3.1).

All these peptides were specific of mouse proteins and in many cases were unique. The corresponding proteins were annotated and labelled together with each measured peptide. Next, low-quality samples were also removed, testing the overall signal per sample to identify if there were clear outliers with very low signal or with a very different signal distribution. Comparison of the overall signal distributions of the 30 samples (comparing boxplots) and identified 3 samples that were very different were obtained and discarded (WT/-Phag_s3r2 (sample 3, replicate 2), RBD/-_s2r1 and LKRc_s1r1).

Subsequently, B cells, identified by their positivity for CD19 and negativity for CD11b, were selected. To determine the frequency of T cells, the CD45+ cell population, devoid of both CD19 and CD11b, underwent examination for CD3 expression. CD3+ cells were further categorized based on CD4 and CD8 expression, distinguishing CD4+, CD8+, and double-negative (DN) T cells. Following the application of these gating criteria across all samples, the percentages of CD45-positive cells expressing CD19 and T cells (CD3+) within the CD45+ population were calculated. Additionally, myeloid populations were analysed by quantifying the proportion of CD11b+ cells. To distinguish between circulating monocytes and granulocytes, we assessed their expression of Ly6G (granulocytes) and Ly6C proteins (monocytes). Classical monocytes were characterized by negativity for Ly6G and positivity for Ly6C, while alternative monocytes lacked both markers, and neutrophils/granulocytes displayed weak positivity for Ly6C and positivity for Ly6G.</p><p>Samples were acquired on a BD LSR FORTESA FACS or FACS Aria III machine that uses FACS DIVA software (BD Biosciences).

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I thank the authors for addressing my comments.</p><p>- I believe that additional in vivo experiments, or the inclusion of controls for the specificity of the inhibitor, which the authors argue are beyond the scope of the current study, are essential to address the weaknesses and limitations stated in my current evaluation.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully acknowledge the reviewer's concern but would like to reiterate that demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitor is beyond the scope of this study. Alpelisib (BYL-719) is a clinically approved drug widely recognized as a specific inhibitor of p110α, primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer. Its selectivity for the p110α isoform has been extensively validated in the literature.</p><p>In our study, we used Alpelisib to assess whether pharmacological inhibition of p110α would produce effects similar to those observed in our genetic model, which is particularly relevant for the potential translational implications of our findings. Given the well-documented specificity of this inhibitor, we believe that additional controls to confirm its selectivity are unnecessary within the context of this study. Instead, our focus has been to investigate the functional role of p110α activity in macrophage-driven inflammation using the models described.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insight and hope this clarification addresses their concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While the neutrophil depletion suggests neutrophils are not required for the phenotype, there are multiple other myeloid cells, in addition to macrophages, that could be contributing or accounting for the in vivo phenotype observed in the mutant strain (not macrophage specific).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's observation regarding the potential involvement of other myeloid cells. However, it is important to highlight that the inflammatory process follows a well-characterized sequential pattern. Our data clearly demonstrate that in the paw inflammation model:</p><p>· Neutrophils are effectively recruited, as evidenced by the inflammatory abscess filled with polymorphonuclear cells.</p><p>· However, macrophages fail to be recruited in the RBD model.</p><p>Given that this critical step is disrupted, it is reasonable to expect that any subsequent steps in the inflammatory cascade would also be affected. A precise dissection of the role of other myeloid populations would require additional lineage-specific models to selectively target each subset, which, as we have previously stated, would be the focus of an independent study.</p><p>While we cannot entirely exclude the contribution of other myeloid cells, our data strongly support the conclusion that macrophages are, at the very least, a key component of the observed phenotype. We explicitly address this point in the Discussion section, where we acknowledge the potential involvement of other myeloid populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Inclusion of absolute cell numbers (in addition to the %) is essential.

However, as stated in the Materials and Methods section, we analyzed 50,000 cells per sample, and the percentages reported in the manuscript are directly derived from this standardized count.</p><p>Our decision to present the data as percentages follows standard practices in flow cytometry-based analyses, as it allows for a clearer and more biologically relevant comparison of relative changes between conditions. This approach ensures consistency across samples and facilitates the interpretation of population dynamics during inflammation.</p><p>We would also like to clarify that all data are based on actual counts, and rigorous controls were implemented throughout the study to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.

Disrupting this pathway, through genetic tools or pharmacological intervention in mice, impairs the inflammatory response, leading to delayed resolution and more severe acute inflammation. The authors suggest that activating p110α with small molecules could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating chronic inflammation. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms by which p110α regulates macrophage function and the overall inflammatory response.</p><p>The updates made by the authors in the revised version have addressed the main points raised in the initial review, further improving the strength of their findings.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cell intrinsic signaling pathways controlling the function of macrophages in inflammatory processes, including in response to infection, injury or in the resolution of inflammation are incompletely understood.

We understand the reviewer’s concern regarding the modest yet statistically significant differences observed between wild-type and mutant macrophages in vitro, as well as between wild-type and Pik3ca<sup>RBD</sup> mice in vivo. Our current study aimed to provide a foundational exploration of the role of RAS-p110α signaling in macrophage function and inflammatory response, focusing on a set of core readouts that demonstrate the physiological relevance of this pathway. While a more extensive in vivo assessment could offer additional insights into macrophage activity and the nuanced effects of RAS-p110α disruption, it would require an array of new experiments that are beyond the current scope.</p><p>However, we believe that the current data provide significant insights into the pathway’s role, highlighting important alterations in macrophage function and inflammatory processes due to RAS-p110α disruption. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies that can build upon our results with a more comprehensive analysis of macrophage activity in various inflammatory contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the in vivo model, all cells have disrupted RAS-p100α signaling, not only macrophages. Given that other myeloid cells besides macrophages contribute to the orchestration of inflammatory responses, it remains unclear whether the phenotype described in vivo results from impaired RAS-p100α signaling within macrophages or from defects in other haematopoietic cells such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. To address this, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion section acknowledging that RAS-p110α signaling disruption affects all hematopoietic cells (lines 461-470 in the discussion). However, we also provide several lines of evidence that support macrophages as the primary cell type involved in the observed phenotype. Specifically, we note that neutrophil depletion in chimera mice did not alter transendothelial extravasation, and that macrophages were the primary cell type showing significant functional defects in the paw edema model. These findings, combined with specific deficiencies in myeloid populations, suggest a predominant role of macrophages in the impaired inflammatory response, though we acknowledge the potential contributions of other myeloid cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inclusion of information on the absolute number of macrophages, and total immune cells (e.g. for the spleen analysis) would help determine if the reduced frequency of macrophages represents an actual difference in their total number or rather reflects a relative decrease due to an increase in the number of other/s immune cell/s.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We understand the value of presenting actual measurements; however, we opted to display normalized data to provide a clearer comparison between WT and RBD mice, as this approach highlights the relative differences in immune populations between the two groups.

We have now removed this implication from the abstract to maintain clarity and to better reflect the scope of the data presented in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inclusion of a control in which RBD/- cells are also treated with BYL719, across experiments in which the inhibitor is used, would be important to determine, among other things, the specificity of the inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to include RBD/- cells treated with BYL719 as an additional control. However, we would like to clarify that this approach would raise a different biological question, as treating RBD mice with BYL719 would not only address the specificity of the inhibitor but also examine the combined effects of genetic and pharmacologic disruptions on PI3K pathway signaling. Investigating this dual disruption falls outside the scope of our current study, which is focused specifically on the effects of RAS-p110α disruption.</p><p>It is also important to note that our RBD mouse model selectively disrupts RAS-mediated activation of p110α, while PI3K activation can still occur through other pathways, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus, inhibiting p110α with BYL719 would produce broader effects beyond the inhibition of RAS-PI3K signaling, impacting PI3K activation regardless of its upstream source.</p><p>In addition, incorporating this control would require us to repeat nearly all experiments in the manuscript, as it would necessitate generating and analyzing new samples for each experimental condition. Given the scope and resources involved, we believe this approach is unfeasible at this stage of the revision process.</p><p>We hope this explanation is satisfactory and that the current data in the manuscript provide a rigorous assessment of the RAS-p110α signaling pathway within the defined experimental scope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3I is missing the statistical analysis (this is mentioned in the legend though).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We apologize for the oversight. The statistical analysis for Figure 3I has now been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gating strategies and representative staining should be included more generally across the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To address this, we have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 2-Supplement Figure 2) that illustrates the gating strategy along with a representative dataset. Additionally, a brief summary of the gating strategy has been included in the main text to further clarify the methodology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is recommended that authors show actual measurements rather than only data normalized to the control (or arbitrary units).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
