RNA virus responsible for over 20 million infections annually. HEV’s open reading frame (ORF)1 polyprotein is essential for genome replication, though it is unknown how the different subdomains function within a structural context. Our data show that ORF1 operates as a multifunctional protein, which is not subject to proteolytic processing. Supporting this model, scanning mutagenesis performed on the putative papain-like cysteine protease (pPCP) domain revealed six cysteines essential for viral replication. Our data are consistent with their role in divalent metal ion coordination, which governs local and interdomain interactions that are critical for the overall structure of ORF1; furthermore, the ‘pPCP’ domain can only rescue viral genome replication in trans when expressed in the context of the full-length ORF1 protein but not as an individual subdomain. Taken together, our work provides a comprehensive model of the structure and function of HEV ORF1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepatitis E virus</kwd><kwd>viral hepatitis</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LeDesma</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Maya</surname><given-names>Stephanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LeDesma</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combined computational, genetic, and biochemical analysis of the hepatitis E virus open reading frame 1 (ORF1) protein identifies a novel domain-domain interaction that is vital for fitness and supports a proposed structural model of the ORF1 polyprotein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has a global disease burden of over 20 million cases per annum, leading to approximately 70,000 fatalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rein et al., 2012</xref>). This burden is especially pronounced in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women, the latter of whom experience a close to 30% mortality rate in the third trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khuroo and Kamili, 2003</xref>) and/or approximately 3000 stillbirths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rein et al., 2012</xref>). HEV infection can be prevented with a prophylactic vaccine which is currently only licensed in China. Presently, treatment is limited to ribavirin (RBV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Hung, 2014</xref>) and pegylated type I interferon (IFN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamar et al., 2010</xref>). However, these therapies are plagued with considerable side effects, as RBV is teratogenic and thus cannot be administered during pregnancy, and IFN therapy can lead to transplant rejection in organ transplant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haagsma et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, HEV strains with fitness-enhancing mutations have been identified in patients showing clinical resistance to RBV treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todt et al., 2018</xref>). One clinical case study has suggested that sofosbuvir, a drug approved for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, may have a beneficial additive effect when used in combination with RBV; however, other studies have observed no therapeutic benefit, and the use of this drug for HEV treatment remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Valk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Wezel et al., 2019</xref>). Other clinical drugs are currently not approved for the treatment of HEV, obviating the need for direct acting antivirals and a better understanding of the viral replication cycle.</p><p>HEV is a (+) ssRNA virus in the <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> genus in the <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> family of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). The genome of HEV has a 5’-methylated cap and a 3’-poly (A) tail and is composed of three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the viral replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koonin et al., 1992</xref>), ORF2 encodes the capsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reyes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tam et al., 1991</xref>), and ORF3 encodes a viroporin necessary for viral egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). While the primary functions of ORF2 and ORF3 have been characterized, much of ORF1 remains to be understood. ORF1 has been organized into seven domains based on prior bioinformatic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koonin et al., 1992</xref>), only four of which have been functionally characterized in some detail: namely the methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magden et al., 2001</xref>), macrodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parvez, 2015</xref>), helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Devhare et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karpe and Lole, 2010</xref>), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koonin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Heijden and Bol, 2002</xref>). Of the remaining domains of HEV ORF1, the putative papain-like cysteine protease (pPCP) has been the subject of some debate; several groups assessing the functionality of this region have disagreed on the presence of protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanade et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karpe and Lole, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paliwal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parvez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parvez and Khan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perttilä et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ropp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sehgal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suppiah et al., 2011</xref>) and if present, whether this region has viral protein or host cellular protein targets. Evidence supporting and refuting these activities have been building for almost three decades; however, the possibility remains that this region may exert orthogonal activities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutations within the hepatitis E virus (HEV) putative protease domain render the virus replication incompetent.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Genome organization of HEV and Kernow strain genotype 3 reporter replicon.

Though two structures of small regions within ORF1 have been recently obtained - one being the amphipathic ‘thumb’ of the RdRp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oechslin et al., 2022</xref>), the other being an intra-ORF1 region spanning portions of the pPCP and hypervariable region (HVR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Proudfoot et al., 2019</xref>) - neither are functional outside of the context of the ORF1 protein, limiting our understanding of how uncharacterized regions of ORF1 fold and operate. Without structural information readily available, <italic>in silico</italic> analyses have been previously attempted to glean information of ORF1’s functions, with limited success. For instance, bioinformatic analysis of the HEV pPCP of genotype 1 SAR55 strain predicted three disulfide bridges and a putative zinc-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parvez and Khan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saraswat et al., 2019</xref>), though previous computational approaches have been lacking in power and iterative ability. With the advent of AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021</xref>), research into protein structure has entered a new era where testable hypotheses can be generated in an iterative, high-throughput manner.</p><p>To understand how the pPCP - and ORF1 more broadly - operate, we opted to combine biochemical, genetic, mass spectrometric, and computational approaches. We identified amino acid motifs within the pPCP that are vital for viral replication via an unbiased triplet alanine scanning mutagenesis, as well as characterized the necessity or dispensability of eight conserved cysteines within the pPCP domain. Of these eight, six were identified as indispensable, forming a hexa-cysteine motif commonly seen in host metal-binding proteins. We established a transcomplementation system to demonstrate that the pPCP is only functional within the context of the full-length (FL) ORF1 protein. We have been able to validate A.I. driven protein structure prediction programs with testable genetic and biochemical data; using the AlphaFold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), we determined the replicative capacity lost via site-directed mutagenesis to not be due to a deficiency of proteolytic activity, but rather a loss in structural integrity due to an inability to bind divalent metal ions. Moreover, we identified a novel interdomain divalent metal ion binding interaction between the pPCP and the upstream uncharacterized Y-domain of HEV ORF1. Furthermore, utilizing a tolerable epitope locus within ORF1’s HVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szkolnicka et al., 2019</xref>), we were able to purify ORF1 protein for downstream inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis and discovered that point mutants in either the pPCP or Y-domain differed in divalent ion binding activity. Taken together, our work demonstrates that HEV ORF1 likely functions as one large multidomain protein that does not undergo proteolytic processing, and that the putative catalytic residues predicted by prior bioinformatic analyses are actually structural in nature via their ability to bind divalent metal ions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations within the HEV putative protease domain render the virus replication incompetent</title><p>The functional domains and genome organization of HEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were first suggested based on bioinformatic alignments of the genotype 1 Burma reference strain with other well-characterized viruses in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koonin et al., 1992</xref>), and the putative protease domain was proposed based on limited sequence identity with the distantly related rubella virus. These analyses suggested the existence of a putative papain-like protease within HEV ORF1 and that the proposed catalytic dyad were residues C483 (which is highly conserved across all known HEV genotypes) and H590 - which is variable across all eight known HEV genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since, tools have been developed to systematically interrogate the HEV genome, such as the development of infectious clones of cell-culture adapted strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shukla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>), and reporter replicons utilizing green fluorescent protein (GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emerson et al., 2004</xref>) or Gaussia luciferase (Gluc; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To determine the importance of the residues that have been proposed as the putative catalytic dyad, we mutated C483 and/or Y590 to chemically similar amino acids, alanine, or in the case of Y590, residues found in other genotypes of HEV. Huh7.5 human hepatoma cells were transfected with in vitro transcribed RNA from a recombinant version of an HEV genome derived from the KernowC1/p6 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>) in which ORF2 and ORF3 are replaced by a secreted version of Gluc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>), termed Kc1/p6 Gluc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Gluc activity as a measure for the efficiency of RdRp-mediated viral replication was quantified in the culture supernatants over 4 days post RNA transfection (4 d.p.t.). Transfection of the wild type (wt) Kc1/p6 Gluc into naïve Huh7.5 human hepatoma cells led to a ca. 34,000-fold increase in luminescence over mock cells. Transfection of a polymerase deficient genome harboring a mutation in the highly conserved catalytic triad (GDD motif of the RdRp (deemed pol [-])) expectedly did not augment Gluc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Notably, genomes harboring mutations in the C483 and/or Y590 positions were incapable of establishing stable replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to understand if this lack of viral replication brought on by mutating the highly conserved C483 was unique to the Kc1/p6 cell culture adapted strain of HEV, or if it translated to other known human-tropic HEV strains. Thus, we mutated the C483 residues in the Gluc reporter genome configurations of HEV strains SAR55 (genotype 1), SHEV3 (genotype 3), and TW6196E (genotype 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2018b</xref>), and transfected in vitro transcribed RNA into HepG2C3A human hepatoma cells similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>. In line with our observations using Kc1/p6 replicon, HEV RNA replication was severely impaired in SAR55, SHEV3, and TW6196E genomes harboring the C483A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>). Notably, Gluc levels were equivalently as low as the pol (-) versions of the reporter replicons.</p><p>To determine if this deficiency was due to a disruption in RNA folding, we mutagenized C483 into each available codon for cysteine and alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These analyses demonstrated that encoding the alternate cysteine had a mild negative affect on viral replication efficiency, while any alanine codon usage brought replication levels down to those of the Pol (-) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting that the deficiency primarily lies in protein folding or function.

Gluc activity as a measure of the efficiency for HEV replication was quantified in the culture supernatants over 4 d.p.t. Notably, when the mock signal fold change over WT luciferase signal was examined, cells expressing a mutant form of ORF1 demonstrate a deleterious effect on WT replicon replication, likely due to competitive inhibitory binding of the mutant protein with the replicon RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Impairments in viral genome replication due to the pol (-) or C483A mutations could be rescued in trans by expression of WT ORF1 near to levels of those following transfection of WT replicon RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Of note, expression of the pPCP failed to restore replication of Kc1/p6 Gluc C483A, suggesting that the functions of this region of ORF1 are not adequately maintained outside of the context of the ORF1 polyprotein.

To glean more information about the domain organization and protein folding of HEV ORF1, we turned to AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) to predict the structure of ORF1. The complete sequence of HEV ORF1 was fed into the AlphaFold algorithm, and the best ranked model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) was chosen for further analysis. To gain confidence in the best ranked model, we analyzed the AlphaFold prediction in several ways. First, we analyzed the confidence levels produced by AlphaFold (predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score) for each residue across the ORF1 structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). This analysis revealed varying levels of confidence throughout the entirety of ORF1, and importantly, low confidence throughout much of the pPCP. We further looked at how AlphaFold predicts the pPCP outside of the context of ORF1 and found that the pLDDT averages are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), with the pPCP alone averaging a pLDDT score of 65.92, and the pPCP within the context of ORF1 scoring a slightly better average of 66.05. Second, we tested how closely the AlphaFold prediction aligned with two separate solved structures of fragments of HEV ORF1, as well as the known solved structures of the macro domains in other distantly related viruses. To this end, we used a combinatorial approach of sequence-based alignments with structure-based alignments to gain the most accurate distance matrices of relevant atomic coordinates within each alignment of regions of ORF1 and the corresponding known structures (approach reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carpentier et al., 2019</xref>).

Understandably, alignment of the macrodomains of SINV and CHIKV also show high local alignment, though less robust than that of other HEV strains to Kc1/p6 ORF1 of HEV.

This prompts several considerations: (1) AlphaFold is not able to accurately predict the amino acid backbone or side chains of the pPCP with a high amount of confidence. (2) If this region were a protease domain, it would likely have a highly ordered and readily predicted secondary structure. To test this latter point, we analyzed AlphaFold’s ability to accurately predict the structure of a known protease, which it does very well. When comparing the known structure of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3 C protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergmann et al., 1999</xref>) with the AlphaFold prediction, they align with an average superimposition distance of 1.03 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, AlphaFold was able to fold the HAV protease with very high confidence, with an average pLDDT score of 97.14 across the entirety of the prediction, giving high confidence of interpretation to both the amino acid backbones and side chain chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Due to the low pLDDT score of the pPCP, we visualized the predicted folding of this region by color-coding the outcomes of the alanine-scanning mutagenesis to better understand whether the secondary structures predicted by AlphaFold stand. We found that the majority of the predicted alpha-helices and beta-sheets do not tolerate mutations well, while the majority of the tolerated mutants lie within predicted regions of disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest the structure predictions of HEV ORF1 by AlphaFold demonstrate high confidence within known regions that possess a high level of secondary structure. AlphaFold is able to predict the structure of a known viral protease with high confidence, suggesting further that the HEV pPCP domain does not possess the necessary secondary structure of a protease.

Utilizing the structural predictions of HEV ORF1 generated with AlphaFold, we began by analyzing the predicted folding structure of WT ORF1, and two of the point mutants within the pPCP: C483A and C563A (chosen based on the heterogeneity of their phenotypes). C483A is fully replication deficient, while C563A is blunted in replication at two orders of magnitude lower than WT 4 d.p.t.

Cysteine side chain residues at positions 457 and 459 at the end of the predicted beta sheet leading into the pseudo-zinc-finger were shown to be projecting into inter-domain space. These residues are predicted to form a potential tetrahedral divalent ion binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laitaoja et al., 2013</xref>) with D248 and H249 in the upstream Y-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, middle), which had pLDDT scores of 82.99 and 87.67, respectively, giving high confidence in the predicted location of the amino acid backbones and potentially their side-chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues are well known to bind divalent metal ions and form tetrahedral geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laitaoja et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>).

We noticed that by comparing the structure of ORF1 WT (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) next to the mutants while highlighting domains of ORF1 with well-defined functions such as the methyltransferase, helicase, and RdRp, structural differences emerge. Mutating C483A, C563A, or H249A are predicted to cause regions of the methyltransferase, helicase, and RdRp to reconfigure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>, 6 respectively). Furthermore, mutating C563A, D248A, or H249A causes a predicted membrane association domain that is exposed in the WT ORF1 protein to become buried, possibly preventing the association with intracellular membranes and preventing/hindering the formation of a replication compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Metzger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szkolnicka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>, respectively).

These results shed light on a potential novel mechanism by which mutants in the pPCP and upstream Y-domain interfere with HEV’s replication cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the advent of reporter replicons for the HEV replicase in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emerson et al., 2004</xref>), research into the functional domains of ORF1 become possible. Perturbations to the viral replicase could be assessed qualitatively and be quantified for the first time, allowing researchers to begin dissecting regions of ORF1 necessary to viral replication. In our study, we first sought to determine whether our results with the Kc1/p6 genotype 3 HEV were in agreement with previous results that utilized a GFP reporter replicon of HEV genotype 1 SAR55 strain in S10-3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parvez, 2013</xref>). We were able to demonstrate that mutations in the core six of the eight highly conserved cysteines within the pPCP, as well as the heterogenous residue at position 590, renders Kc1/p6 HEV replication incompetent. We were also able to show that the putative catalytic cysteine in the HEV pPCP renders HEV in three additional genotypes replication incompetent. Taking this analysis further, we demonstrate that the dysfunction in our reporter replicon is likely at the protein level due to the replicon being able to tolerate an alternate codon for cysteine and none of the codons for alanine, suggesting a conserved need of this amino acid residue for HEV.</p><p>Of all the domains within ORF1, the functions of the pPCP remain the most debated. Though evidence for and against proteolytic cleavage continues to mount on both sides, it is important to take the scientific results, as well as the functionality of the ORF1 protein, in context. Our data in this study has shown that the pPCP of ORF1 cannot function outside of the context of the FL protein, which is rather uncommon for many RNA viruses such as HAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemon et al., 1991</xref>), HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2000</xref>), and flaviviruses such as Zika virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018a</xref>). While most characterized (+) ssRNA viruses rely on proteases to liberate individual gene products from their encoded polyprotein, HEV may be an exception. While it remains conceivable that host proteases may post-translationally process ORF1, there is rather limited evidence that subunits of ORF1 itself harbors proteolytic activity. Furthermore, if processing were to occur, it is likely that only a small fraction of ORF1 might be cleaved, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Metzger et al., 2022</xref>); however, the smaller species of ORF1 in the previously cited study were unable to be characterized by mass spectrometric analysis, leaving the processing of ORF1 still subject to debate. The inability for the putative HEV PCP to act outside of the context of the FL ORF1 protein suggests that it has some orthogonal activity and that HEV ORF1 likely functions as one large multi-domain protein. However, other known viral proteases such as HCV’s NS3/4A possess <italic>cis</italic>-acting activity as well as <italic>trans</italic>-acting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kazakov et al., 2015</xref>). With this in mind, the possibility remains that some undiscovered domain of ORF1 that possesses <italic>cis</italic>-acting processing activity is required to functionally rescue a defective genome in trans; results in favor if this possibility have yet to come to light.</p><p>To take an unbiased approach to analyzing the pPCP domain, we attempted to identify motifs within the region that were either vital or dispensable to viral replication. To this end, we conducted an alanine scanning mutagenesis screen in triplets across the entire viral region and found that while the majority of the region is needed for replication, there were 11/54 triplets that were able to replicate at near WT levels. Several of these triplets fell very near to the HEV (CxC[x<sub>11</sub>]CC[X<sub>8</sub>]CxC) motif within the pPCP; we aimed to identify the potential function of this region, as well as obtain as much structural information. To this end, we were able to identify proteins with known functions that shared close homology to the HEV motif and found that these proteins were enriched for metal ion binding or for disulfide bond formation, suggesting a structural activity rather than a catalytic one. We then capitalized on the power of AlphaFold to gain structural insights into the nature of this vital region. When looking at the structure predictions of the HEV motif, we noticed a striking pseudo-zinc finger formation, as well as a tetrahedral binding pocket canonically associated with Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding with two residues in the upstream Y-domain. When mutations to conserved cysteines or the aspartic acid or histidine in the upstream Y-domain were modeled, several changes noticeable: first, for the two mutants that are rendered replication incompetent (C483A and H249A), the alpha-helix of the pseudo zinc-finger is disrupted. Furthermore, several bond lengths between potential coordinating residues are relaxed to beyond biological relevance. Furthermore, a putative membrane contact site predicted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parvez, 2017</xref> becomes buried in these mutants, hinting at a potential mechanism behind the loss of replicative ability. Many RNA viruses are known to adopt a similar strategy of metal ion coordination to carry out necessary functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chasapis, 2018</xref>). For instance, HCV utilizes a metalloprotein in its replicase, the nonstructural protein NS5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tellinghuisen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tellinghuisen et al., 2005</xref>); HCV utilizes four cysteines within a C[<italic>x</italic>]<sub>17</sub>C<italic>x</italic>C[x]<sub>20</sub>C motif, conserved among <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> and <italic>Pestivirus</italic> genera, for Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination and proper function of the HCV replicase machinery.</p><p>To determine whether mutants in these predicted metal ion binding motifs actually led to a decrease in ion binding activity, we needed to be able to purify ORF1 protein for subsequent analyses. One of the many difficulties in interrogating HEV ORF1 is its low expression level in infected cells, as well as the lack of a well-characterized commercial antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lenggenhager et al., 2017</xref>). However, recent identification of sites within ORF1 that tolerate epitope tags without sacrificing viral replicative capacity have opened up new avenues for researchers to investigate ORF1, and the pPCP, more robustly and critically. Utilizing one such insertion site, we were able to purify WT and mutant ORF1 proteins and subject them to ICP-MS. We found that across all mutants, none were able to bind zinc ion species as well as the WT ORF1, save the Pol(-) RdRp mutant, lending validity to our structural hypotheses generated with AlphaFold. We then determined whether the predicted burying of the putative membrane contact site in the replication deficient mutants affected ORF1 localization within cells expressing the epitope tagged ORF1. Utilizing confocal microscopy, we were able to demonstrate that the C483A mutation loses ORF1 nuclear localization, while the H249A mutation decreases nuclear localization of ORF1, and prevents puncta formation throughout the cytoplasm, which lies in stark contrast to WT ORF1. Taken together, with the advent of new tools such as reporter replicons for HEV, AlphaFold, and tolerable epitope insertion sites discovered within ORF1, our bioinformatic and genetic analyses have been able to go far beyond previous attempts at predicting functional domains within ORF1: we have been able to demonstrate a powerful, iterative pipeline of testing A.I. driven predictions via hypothesis generation and testing with the tools at our disposal. We have been able to demonstrate a novel domain-domain interaction between the upstream Y-domain and the metal-coordinating structural domain of HEV, previously (and incorrectly called the PCP), and we suggest a change in the accepted nomenclature of this vital and enigmatic viral region to reflect this function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>HepG2C3A cells (ATCC and CRL-10741), Huh7, and Huh7.5 cells (kindly provided by Charles Rice, The Rockefeller University) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin and streptomycin, in a humidified 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Multiple sequence alignment</title><p>The following HEV strains were used for sequence alignment: GenBank identifiers (IDs) or accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M73218">M73218</ext-link> (genotype 1 a, Burma strain), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M74506">M74506</ext-link> (2 a, Mex), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JQ679013.1">JQ679013.1</ext-link> (3,Kernow-C1/p6), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB197673">AB197673</ext-link> (4 a), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB573435">AB573435</ext-link> (5 a), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB856243">AB856243</ext-link> (6, wbJNN_13), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KJ496144">KJ496144</ext-link> (7, 180 C), and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KX387866">KX387866</ext-link> (8, 48XJ).

IP was done with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, catalog number C29F4) at a ratio of 1:50 in a laminar flow tissue culture hood that was sterilized with 70% ethanol and washed with MilliQ water prior to IP. The IP was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and each collected fraction (crude cell lysate, unbound fraction, and IP eluate) was split into large (80% total volume) and small (20% total volume) fractions. The large fractions were used for downstream nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide digestion and ICP-MS analysis, whereas the small fraction was used for protein quantification and western blot analysis.

All elements were measured in standard (STD) mode with the exception of lithium and iron, which were measured in kinetic mode to remove unwanted polyatomic interferences with the argon plasma. Samples were bracketed by an additional blank and STD curve to monitor instrument drift and ensure consistency throughout each experimental run. Samples were run via a series of three dilutions per sample, per run. Any measurement for a sample within the dilution series that fell outside of the dilution series range was excluded from further analysis. Contamination of trace elements from reagents and MilliQ water was monitored by processing MilliQ ‘samples’ through the entire immunopurification and protein digestion protocol on a run-by-run basis. Any trace metal analyses that were not statistically different from the MilliQ control ‘sample’ were excluded from further consideration.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nels C Elde (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The paper aims to provide structural and functional information on the hepatitis E virus replication complex. The study will be of interest to broad number of people studying at virus replication, since the replication complex are targets for therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The failure-to rescue-by-protease-alone experiment is not as convincing as the other arguments, because intramolcularly cleaving proteases are well-known in RNA viruses. It is plausible that cis-acting function of an actual protease within ORF1 is needed for its processing in order to complement a defective genome. The authors should cite the literature of intramolecular proteolysis (eg. Lindenbach) and modify their interpretation.</p><p>2. It would greatly strengthen the paper to directly rule out ORF1 processing with biochemical approaches like the purifications shown in Figure 6b. Are the additional bands on the western from the purification fragments of ORF1? If so, are these non-specific processing events? Can this be distinguished from a protease function of pPCP? If it isn't possible to gain more direct evidence, the final sentence of the discussion ruling out protease activity needs to be more measured.</p><p>3. The mass spectrometry data in Figure 6 shows about a ~20-40% decrease in zinc levels with the various mutants, which is about the same as some of the other ions used as a control. As a general observation, zinc binding proteins have an extremely tight binding affinity for zinc and the ion is usually necessary for proper folding. Similar experiments, looking at zinc ion levels in mutant proteins, show very low levels relative to wt (less than 10%). Currently, the data are not convincing, however it is appreciated that production of recombinant material for the study could be challenging. Perhaps producing a smaller fragment in bacteria or other eukaryotic systems would be more useful. At a minimum, better addressing the results of metal binding differences in Figure 6d and HEV biology would help bolster the manuscript, including controls where mutations don't alter metal binding to have better context for the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80529.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The reviewer brings up an interesting point; for other RNA viruses, such as HCV, <italic>cis</italic> activity of a protease requires multiple domains of the polyprotein (e.g. NS3/4A protease), and that not all singular protein domains are rescuable in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic> (doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004817) and may require a larger portion of the genome in order to exert their functions. Further, <italic>cis-</italic>acting activity is first required prior to function <italic>in trans</italic> in the case of several HCV non-structural proteins (doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004817). To address this, we have altered the manuscript in the following ways (with additions/changes highlighted in yellow):</p><p>– The final sentence of the section outlining the trans-complementation results has been modified to say:</p><p>This trans-complementation platform provides further means to uncouple the putative functions of the pPCP or larger intramolecular regions of ORF1, e.g. polyprotein processing or modulation of the host cellular environment, from viral genome replication.</p><p>– The discussion where these results are expounded upon has been modified to include this possibility in the following way:</p><p>Of all the domains within ORF1, the functions of the putative PCP remain the most debated. Though evidence for and against proteolytic cleavage continues to mount on both sides, it is important to take the scientific results, as well as the functionality of the ORF1 protein, in context. Our data in this study has shown that the pPCP of ORF1 cannot function outside of the context of the full length protein, which is rather uncommon for many RNA viruses such as hepatitis A virus(Lemon et al., 1991), HCV(Yang et al., 2000), and flaviviruses such as Zika virus(Ding, Gaska, et al., 2018). While most characterized (+) ssRNA viruses rely on proteases to liberate individual gene products from their encoded polyprotein, HEV may be an exception. While it remains conceivable that host proteases may post-translationally process ORF1, there is rather limited evidence that subunits of ORF1 itself harbors proteolytic activity. Furthermore, if processing were to occur, it is likely that only a small fraction of ORF1 might be cleaved, as suggested previously (Metzger et al., 2022); however, the smaller species of ORF1 in the previously cited study were unable to be characterized by mass spectrometric analysis, leaving the processing of ORF1 still subject to debate. The inability for the putative HEV PCP to act outside of the context of the full length ORF1 protein suggests that it has some orthogonal activity, and that HEV ORF1 likely functions as one large multi-domain protein. However, other known viral proteases such as HCV’s NS3/4A possess <italic>cis</italic>-acting activity as well as <italic>trans</italic>-acting activity (Kazakov et al., 2015). With this in mind, the possibility remains that some undiscovered domain of ORF1 that possesses <italic>cis</italic>-acting processing activity is required to functionally rescue a defective genome in <italic>trans</italic>; results in favor if this possibility have yet to come to light.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We ran a 12% polyacrylamide gel with total protein lysates from stable expressing HepG2C3A cells , (using two different versions of replication incompetent WT ORF1 as comparisons (HA-ORF1-FLAG and ORF1 with a FLAG-tag in the HVR at a non-tolerable site)), and isolated novel bands between conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> GelCode Blue stained gel, isolated bands highlighted by white rectangles [far left lane is naïve cell lysate so bands isolated differed from this lane]). We then worked with the Mass Spectrometry core at Princeton University to run an in-gel digest prior to tandem mass spectrometric analysis via a time-of-flight instrument.</p><p>Briefly, gel fragments were washed sequentially with Ammonium Bicarbonate (AB), AB/Acetonitrile mix, then Acetonitrile, and reduced and alkylated with TCEP and CAA prior to in gel digestion. Gels were digested with Trypsin, then quenched with formic acid and washed with formic acid/acetonitrile mixtures prior to lyophilization and reconstitution in formic acid for MS/MS analysis. MS/MS analysis was trained to observe ORF1 encoded sequences by feeding the algorithm FASTA sequences of ORF1 WT and ORF1 C483A, and all cleavage junctions of peptides were interrogated for novel non-trypsin cleavage junctions, though none were found. This early experiment in our interrogation of the potential processing of ORF1 combined with our reported results and the current literature (e.g. Metzger et al.) led us to the conclusion that ORF1 is not-processed at any appreciable level and acts as a large multi-domain protein. These experiments were cost-prohibitive and not repeated with the replication competent ORF1, also due to recent publications that produced similar results. (e.g. Metzger et al.)</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80529-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Our results reported here aimed at dissecting the function of this region within the full context of ORF1, as results generated via expressing arbitrary domains of ORF 1 are difficult to interpret. It would be hard to argue that this region was natively folding outside of the intramolecular forces of the rest of the protein, as suggested by our AlphaFold data (Figure 5). However, we agree with the reviewer that the ICP-MS results could be bolstered with the inclusion of other replication competent and incompetent mutants that exist outside of the context of these predicted zinc-binding domains and subjected them to the same ICP-MS analysis. To this end, we generated epitope tagged versions of the replication deficient mutant that harbors a mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (GDD mutated to GAD). This mutant is deficient likely due to an enzyme deficiency and not a folding deficiency (though this remains to be definitively proven). Further, we included a tolerable mutant found via the alanine scanning mutagenesis screen that was predicted to residue in an area of disorder that putatively serves as some sort of linker and thus not implicated in folding or ion binding (E489A; Figure 3).</p><p>Our results from these analyses (New Supplementary Figure 6, updated source data) suggest show that the Pol (-) mutant and the tolerable E489A mutant do not alter the ion binding potential of any ion in a statistically significant way, though the C483A still did. These new data combined with our initially submitted data suggest that mutating C483A inhibits the protein’s ability to bind zinc, and likely fold correctly for functionality.</p></body></sub-article></article>
