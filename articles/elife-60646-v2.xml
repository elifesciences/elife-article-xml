recruitment and activation of different macrophage populations. However, little is known about how macrophages are attracted to the pancreas after injury or an oncogenic event, and how they crosstalk with lesion cells or other cells of the lesion microenvironment. Here, we delineate the importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling during the early phase of murine pancreatic cancer. We show that CXCL10 is produced by pancreatic precancerous lesion cells in response to IFNγ signaling and that inflammatory macrophages are recipients for this chemokine. CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in macrophages mediates their chemoattraction to the pancreas, enhances their proliferation, and maintains their inflammatory identity. Blocking of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in vivo shifts macrophage populations to a tumor-promoting (Ym1<sup>+</sup>, Fizz<sup>+</sup>, Arg1<sup>+</sup>) phenotype, increases fibrosis, and mediates progression of lesions, highlighting the importance of this pathway in PDA development. This is reversed when CXCL10 is overexpressed in PanIN cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>CXCL10</kwd><kwd>CXCR3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA229560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA200572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50CA102701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Blockage of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling between murine pancreatic precancerous lesion cells and inflammatory macrophages generates a tumor-promoting microenvironment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is difficult to target because its fibrotic microenvironment not only acts as a barrier for delivery of tumor cell targeting drugs, but it also generates an anti-inflammatory environment and prevents immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balachandran et al., 2019</xref>). One of the current paradigms for treatment of PDA focuses on combining chemotherapy with immune modulators that reprogram tumor-promoting macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastea et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pandey and Storz, 2019</xref>). A deeper understanding of the mechanisms that play a role in macrophage polarization can provide insights to develop such new interventions.</p><p>Genetic mouse models have shown that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) most likely originates from precancerous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PanIN) lesions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Storz, 2017</xref>). The development and progression of these early lesions is dependent on crosstalk between a multitude of host cells in their microenvironment. Of these, inflammatory (M1-polarized) and alternatively activated (M2-polarized) macrophages are the most consequential cell types.</p><p>The initial influx of macrophages, which induces local inflammation, occurs in response to an aberrant release of chemokines from pancreatic cells undergoing transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liou et al., 2015</xref>). However, local inflammation alone is not an efficient driver of oncogenic progression and requires additional inflammatory signaling, genetic alterations, and downregulation of factors that maintain acinar cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrière et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guerra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guerra et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Inflammatory macrophages contribute to pre-neoplastic lesion formation via secretion of inflammatory mediators, which regulate reorganization of the acinar microenvironment and initiate acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sawey et al., 2007</xref>). While pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages are important for the initiation of precancerous lesions, this population dwindles and M2 macrophages become more predominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liou et al., 2017</xref>). These M2 macrophages are chitinase-like protein 3 (Ym1/<italic>Chil3</italic>), arginase-1 (Arg1), resistin-like alpha (Fizz1/<italic>Retnla</italic>), and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1ra) positive and promote lesion growth, drive fibrogenesis, and block T-cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastea et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liou et al., 2017</xref>). Later, at the tumor stage, alternatively activated macrophages represent approximately 85% of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Partecke et al., 2013</xref>). For full-blown pancreatic cancer, tissue-resident macrophages have been suggested to shape fibrotic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), while infiltrating monocytes generate an immunosuppressive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), also known as IFNγ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), acts through its cognate receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Groom and Luster, 2011</xref>) and regulates the chemotaxis of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> immune cells such as macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luster and Ravetch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tomita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). With respect to cancer aggressiveness and patient prognosis, the presence of CXCL10 and CXCR3 has shown conflicting results depending on the type and stage of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fulton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacquelot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In pancreatic cancer, both CXCL10 and CXCR3 are expressed in tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delitto et al., 2015</xref>), and their presence has been correlated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lunardi et al., 2014</xref>). However, the role of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling during early development of the disease has not been addressed.</p><p>In our present study, we show that CXCL10, produced by precancerous lesions cells, is involved in the onset of inflammation by chemoattracting macrophages. We further show that CXCL10 signaling to CXCR3 is a key event for inflammatory macrophage identity and that inhibition of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling leads to a polarization shift to an alternatively activated phenotype. In vivo, we demonstrate the importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in the maintenance of an inflammatory microenvironment, and that its blockage drives tumor progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pre-neoplastic ADM and PanIN lesions produce CXCL10</title><p>To identify factors that are released by precancerous lesion cells, we performed a cytokine/chemokine assay.

Therefore, we tested if this pathway is active in PanIN cells. Treatment of SM3 cells with IFNγ induced an over 60-fold increase in <italic>Cxcl10</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as well as increased CXCL10 protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To test whether CXCL10 expression is indeed mediated through STAT1 signaling, we combined IFNγ stimulation with the pan-JAK inhibitor NVP-BSK805. We found that IFNγ stimulation led to phosphorylation of STAT1 at Y701 (activating phosphorylation), increased expression of CXCL10, and that pre-treatment with NVP-BSK805 inhibited IFNγ-induced pY701-STAT1 and CXCL10 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Moreover, CXCL10 has been demonstrated as a chemoattractant for macrophages along with other immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). This prompted us to test whether macrophages are responsive to CXCL10. We found that non-polarized peritoneal macrophages express high levels of the CXCL10 receptor <italic>Cxcr3</italic>, while M1-polarized (inflammatory) macrophages express moderate levels, and M2-polarized (alternatively activated) macrophages do not express this receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

IFNγ released from immune cells (T and NK) in the pancreatic tissue stimulates CXCL10 release from early lesions (ADM, PanIN1). CXCL10 stimulates chemoattraction and proliferation of peritoneal macrophages and helps maintain their inflammatory phenotype. Blocking the ligand–receptor interaction with a CXCR3 NAB leads to loss of M1 identity, resulting in an increase in the Ym1<sup>+</sup> macrophage population, along with more lesions and a higher fibrotic content.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata1"><label>Figure 5—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of abnormal area, SMA, F4/80, M1 macrophages, and M2 macrophages in athymic nude mice orthotpically implanted with lentivirally infected SM3-CXCL10 or SM3-control PanIN organoids (panels B-E).</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-60646-fig5-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60646-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While inflammatory and alternatively activated macrophages have important functions in different stages of pancreatic cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stone and Beatty, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Storz, 2017</xref>), little is known about how these populations are regulated after injury or an oncogenic event, and how they crosstalk with lesion cells or other cells of the lesion microenvironment. In this study, we delineate the importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling during the early phase of pancreatic cancer development.</p><p>The CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling axis has been implicated in generating inflammation in various diseases including pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2007</xref>). This is because it regulates the chemotaxis of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> immune cells such as macrophages, T cells, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luster and Ravetch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taub et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tomita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). With respect to cancer, gastric cancer patients with upregulated CXCR3 expression showed better survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Also, high expression of CXCL10 and other CXCR3 ligands in ovarian, esophageal, and non-small cell lung carcinoma indicate favorable prognoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bronger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sato et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, in pancreatic cancer, expression of both CXCL10 and CXCR3 in tumor tissue has been correlated with a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lunardi et al., 2014</xref>) mostly due to increased chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delitto et al., 2015</xref>). However, the role of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling during early development of the disease has not been addressed.</p><p>Using the KC mouse model, we show that CXCL10 is produced by cells of precancerous ADM and PanIN1 lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). CXCL10 is also known as interferon gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luster et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohmori and Hamilton, 1993</xref>), suggesting IFNγ as a potential factor sufficient to drive CXCL10 expression. Indeed, SM3 PanIN cells showed upregulation of CXCL10 expression in response to IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). This was mediated through JAK-STAT1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which has been previously described to be upregulated and activated via IFNγ in acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallmeier et al., 2005</xref>). Many cell types, including T cells and NK cells in the pancreatic microenvironment, have been shown to secrete IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corthay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fogar et al., 2011</xref>), and analysis for CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and NKG2D<sup>+</sup> cells indicated T cells and NK cells in the vicinity of lesions as a potential source for IFNγ in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro data implicate peritoneal or bone-marrow-derived inflammatory macrophages as major recipients for CXCL10, where CXCL10 can act as a chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is important because influx of macrophages is a major driver of pancreatic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gea-Sorlí and Closa, 2009</xref>). This correlates with in vivo data showing that in the KC model CXCR3 is expressed by pancreatic inflammatory macrophages, but not by Ym1<sup>+</sup> M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In patient tissue, we found that approximately 70% of CXCR3 expressing cells are inflammatory (CD68<sup>+</sup>;iNOS<sup>+</sup>) macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>).</p><p>Unlike other factors contributing to macrophage chemoattraction into the pancreas, such as sICAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liou et al., 2015</xref>), the expression of CXCL10 from acinar cells is not driven by the activation of oncogenic KRas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This finding is supported by other studies that have shown CXCL10 upregulation in chronic pancreatitis patients, which occurs in the absence of oncogenic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in inflammatory macrophages is underscored by the fact that blocking this interaction causes them to lose their identity, as evident by upregulation of markers for alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Even though neutralizing CXCR3 did not simultaneously decrease iNOS expression while increasing M2 markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), there was a marked drop in <italic>Cd38</italic>, a distinct marker for M1 polarized macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jablonski et al., 2015</xref>), indicating a loss in M1 identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mechanistically, this shift in polarization upon CXCR3 neutralization may be explained by upregulation of the M2 transcription factor <italic>Irf4</italic> and downregulation of the M1 transcription factor <italic>Irf5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the resulting alternatively activated macrophage population is characterized by expression of markers (Ym1, Fizz1, Arg1) that previously have been attributed to a subset of pancreatic macrophages (usually described as Ym1<sup>+</sup> macrophages) that drive fibrinogenesis and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In support of this explant data, neutralizing CXCR3 in vivo also led to a decrease in inflammatory (F4/80<sup>+</sup>;pY701-STAT1<sup>+</sup>) macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>) and an increase in Ym1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This accompanied increased fibrosis at the pancreatic lesion areas and more abnormal regions in the pancreas overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D, and F</xref>). Our data is in line with a recent study in which it was reported that <italic>Cxcr3<sup>−/<italic>−</italic></sup></italic> mice show an abundance of M2 macrophages in breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oghumu et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, similar to what we observed after CXCR3 neutralization, <italic>Cxcr3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages from these mice had reduced ability to upregulate iNOS and showed a predisposition for M2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oghumu et al., 2014</xref>). Since there are other ligands described that can engage the receptor CXCR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Raemdonck et al., 2015</xref>), we also neutralized CXCL10 in KC mice and found similar trends of increased presence of Ym1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and increased fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In a reverse experiment, enhanced expression of CXCL10 in PanIN cells significantly decreased overall abnormal lesion areas, fibrosis, and presence of M2 macrophages, but increased the presence of M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>CXCL10 is known to chemoattract cell types other than macrophages, mainly T cells, and approximately 15% of pancreatic T cells in KC mice are positive for CXCR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, our in vivo study in which we overexpressed CXCL10 in PanIN cells and observed reverse effects to CXCR3 or CXCL10 neutralization was performed in nude mice which lack T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in immunocompetent KC mice had no impact on total abnormal tissue area or M1 and M2 macrophage abundance after CXCR3 neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–E</xref>). Taken together these data suggest no significant role for T cells in CXCL10/CXCR3-driven development of pancreatic cancer.</p><p>During pancreatic cancer development, inflammatory macrophages are predominantly located at ADM lesions, driving the transdifferentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liou et al., 2013</xref>). Our data now indicate that cells undergoing ADM (and to some extent low-grade PanIN) express CXCL10 to chemoattract inflammatory macrophages and that CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling is crucial for the sustenance of their inflammatory identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). More progressed PanIN1 lesions have been shown to express the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), which causes a polarization shift from M1 toward an alternatively activated, Ym1<sup>+</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liou et al., 2017</xref>). Given the importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 interaction in the maintenance of the inflammatory identity of macrophages in our study, the reduced CXCL10 expression by PanIN as compared to ADM lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) may leave macrophages more susceptible to M2 polarization by cytokines like IL-13.</p><p>Considering our results, use of agonists for the receptor CXCR3 at stages of low-grade lesions may be useful to modulate macrophage polarization in the microenvironment such that a predominantly inflammatory population (M1) can be sustained. However, it needs to be noted that in pancreatic cancer expression of both CXCL10 and CXCR3 in tumor tissue have been correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cannon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lunardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Romero et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear if treatment of pancreatic tumors with a CXCR3 agonist will result in a polarization switch of tumor-associated macrophages that renders the lesion microenvironment less supportive for tumors, and increases efficiency of chemotherapy, or if it has a tumor-promoting effect. This will be addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>SM3 primary duct-like cells were isolated from pancreata of 6 week old KC mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agbunag et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liou et al., 2017</xref>).

Cells were incubated with CD45<sup>+</sup> MicroBeads (Miltenyi) followed by magnetic separation using LS Columns (Miltenyi) on a QuadroMACS magnet (Miltenyi) per the manufacturer’s protocol. CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were then labeled with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before subsequent fixation and staining using the PerFix-nc kit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Antibodies are described in detail in <bold>Key Resources Table</bold>. The Attune NxT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for multicolor flow cytometric detection, and analysis was done using FlowJo (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>The procedure for ISH has been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastea et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, ISH was performed using RNAscope Assay 2.5 HD Reagent Kit–Brown or RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections (5 μm) were baked at 60°C for 1 hr, deparaffinized in xylene for 15 min, dehydrated in 100% ethanol, and dried at room temperature overnight in a desiccator. Next day, slides were treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, followed by target retrieval for 8 min. Protease treatment was done for 15 min at 40°C in a hybridization oven. Next, slides were incubated with the appropriate probe for 2 hr. RNAscope target probes used were <italic>Cxcl10</italic> (Mm-Cxcl10 408921), <italic>Cxcr3</italic> (Mm-Cxcr3 4025110), <italic>CXCR3</italic> (Hs-CXCR3 539251), and <italic>Ifng</italic> (Mm-Ifng 311391). After probe hybridization, amplification steps were followed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, except Amp 5 step, which was modified to 1 hr incubation in the DAB procedure (RNAscope Assay 2.5 HD Reagent Kit–Brown). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.</p><p>When followed by IF, slides were treated with boiling 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min to repeat antigen retrieval and the regular IF protocol was followed. Primary antibodies were used at concentrations listed in <bold>Key Resources Table</bold>.</p><p>For the fluorescent detection (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2), following AMP1, 2 and 3 steps according to the manufacturer’s protocol, probes were labeled using the Opal 690 fluorophore reagent pack (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Next, regular IF procedure was performed for co-staining. Samples were counterstained with DAPI and mounted. For imaging, whole slides were scanned at 40× magnification using the Aperio fluorescence scanner (Leica).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Isolation of primary acinar cells</title><p>Pancreas was removed quickly following euthanasia and placed in cold HBSS media. After washing in cold HBSS media twice, pancreas was minced into small 1–5 mm pieces and digested with collagenase I in a 37°C shaker for 20 min. After 20 min, the digestion was stopped by adding an equal volume of cold HBSS media with 5% FBS. The digested pieces were passed through a 500 μm mesh. More 5% FBS media was passed through the mesh with digested pieces to further strain them. The filtrate was then passed through a 105 μm mesh. The filtrate from this step was added dropwise to a tube containing HBSS media with 30% FBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 205 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Acinar cells were then resuspended in complete Waymouth’s media (1% FBS, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml dexamethasone).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>3D collagen explant culture of pancreatic acinar cells</title><p>Cell culture plates were coated with collagen I in Waymouth media without supplements. Freshly isolated primary pancreatic acinar cells were added as a mixture with collagen I/Waymouth media on the top of this layer (3D on-top method). Furthermore, Waymouth complete media was added on top of the cell/gel mixture and replaced the following day and then every other day. When inhibitors, peptides, or proteins were added, the compound of interest was added to both, the cell/gel mixture and the media on top. To express proteins using adenovirus, acinar cells were infected with adenovirus of interest and incubated for 3–5 hr before embedding in the collagen I/Waymouth media mixture. At day 6 or 7 (dependent on time course of duct formation), numbers of ducts were counted under a microscope, and photos were taken to document structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Adenoviral infection of acinar cells</title><p>For adenoviral infection, Adeno-cre-GFP or Adeno-null-GFP viruses (Vector Biolabs, Malvern, PA) were added to the resuspended acinar cells in Waymouth’s complete media in a non-adherent dish.

After the 3 hr infection, cell suspension was mixed with Rat tail collagen-Type I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and plated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Lentiviral infection of PanIN lesion cells, organoid formation, and orthotopic implantation in athymic nude mice </title><p>SM3 PanIN cells were infected using control lenti-eGFP (LPP-EGFP-Lv105-025-C) or lenti-cxcl10 (LPP-Mm03214-Lv105-100) lentiviral particles (Genecopoeia, Rockville, MD) with 5 μg/ml of polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at 70–80% confluency. Infected cells were incubated at 4°C for 2 hr and then at 37°C overnight. On the following day, media containing lentiviral particles and polybrene was removed and replaced with fresh media to allow the cells to recover. Next day, selection media containing 2.5 µg/ml puromycin was added to the cells and was replaced every 2–3 days. After 11 days of selection, cells were harvested and embedded in Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY) with regular media without puromycin. After 2 days, cells formed duct-like PanIN organoid structures. Using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation reagent (Corning), PanIN organoids were harvested and mixed with activated primary pancreatic stellate cells at a ratio of 1:4. Cell mixture was resuspended in phenol-red free Matrigel, and 50 µl (25,000 organoid cells + 100,000 activated primary stellate cells) was injected directly into the pancreas of athymic nude (<italic>Foxn1<sup>nu</sup></italic>) mice (Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mara Sherman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript reports a role for the CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling axis in pancreatic preneoplastic lesions in promoting inflammatory macrophages phenotypes. The authors provide data to support a causal role of CXCL10 and CXCR3 in the recruitment and polarization of macrophages in the pancreas, as well as the degree of fibrosis in PanIN lesions. The work provides potential insight into mechanisms that affect tumor formation.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the data were interesting and potentially appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. With that said, the reviewers were also in agreement that some conclusions were overstated, and the data presentation needs to be improved included more attention to controls and statistical analysis. I have included all comments from the reviewers, however when submitted a revised manuscript it is essential to address the following points:</p><p>1. Please clarify the statistical methods used and provide information on replicates for all data.</p><p>2. The reviewers all agreed that the CXCL10 data comprises the core of the findings, but though those findings could be strengthened with further experiments. The current <italic>eLife</italic> policy also allows limiting the claims if new experiments are not possible. Specifically, to support the claim that CXCL10/CXCR3 blockade enhances cancer development, one suggested additional experiment is to evaluate tumor formation in KC mice upon longer treatment with CXCR3 Nab. However, this experiment would take a long time and thus may not be feasible. In the absence of further support that CXCL10/CXCR3 blockade enhances cancer development, and alternative would be to focus your conclusions on the role of CXCL10 in promoting an inflammatory macrophage identity. This latter option likely would include adjusting the title of the manuscript which refers to a role in tumor development.</p><p>3. Please address the questions raised by reviewers around the source of the macrophages as this speaks to the central claims of the study.</p><p>4. Address overstatements suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>5. Some reviewers questioned how much the IRF4/5 data added to the paper? One possibility is to focus entirely on the role of CXCL10 in promoting an inflammatory macrophage identity, others thought this was interesting but perhaps is better included as supplementary data.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General assessment of the work:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript addresses one piece of a major question in the pancreatic cancer field – how the inflammatory microenvironment of these tumors is sculpted through paracrine signaling pathways. In general, while the data reported are supportive of their conclusions, in most cases alternative explanations were not ruled out. This could be addressed with additional experiments. In particular, the question of the initial trigger for the CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway did not exclude other explanations and this was a major component of the story. In addition, there were a number of technical concerns and questions that limit our ability to interpret the data. These could be remedied in a resubmission but require careful attention to detail.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1. Utilized ISH data as proof for protein expression. While necessary in order to identify which cell synthesize secreted proteins like CXCL10, it would be informative to see paired protein staining or Western blots for those experiments that don't already include them, as mRNA expression isn't always indicative of protein expression/levels.</p><p>2. In figure 1, the authors conclude that IFNγ is responsible for activation fo CXCL10 expression. Treatment with IFNγ did induce CXCL10, but this only proves that the pathway is sufficient and does not address whether it is necessary. To learn this, one could use an anti-IFNγ antibody and see if this blocks CXCL10 activation. Otherwise, the conclusions drawn from this experiment should be stated in a more constrained manner.</p><p>3. Similarly, the conclusions drawn regarding T cell and NK cell involvement in the CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway are not fully supported.</p><p>– The combined ISH/IF experiment in Figure 1G is an elegant technical approach to studying the source-cell of a secreted protein. However, not a single control was presented for this experiment, making it impossible to interpret these results.</p><p>– Presence of T cells and NK cells in the area around precursor cells, and the knowledge that T cells and NK cells express IFNγ is not sufficient to conclude that T cells and NK cells are responsible for initiation of CXCL10 expression. It is a potential explanation, but no work was done to rule out other unknown factors.</p><p>– Additionally, when done in a T cell free environment, the pathway still functioned and the authors themselves claim that there is &quot;no significant role of T cells in CXCL10/CXCR3 driven development of pancreatic cancer.&quot; IFNγ from T cells cannot be both the initial driver and also not significant.</p><p>4. In Figure 2B, was the migration assay performed on M2 macrophages? One would expect them not to be responsive based on 2A, but this should be examined.</p><p>5. The conclusion that macrophage polarization occurred through the IRF4/5 transition is not sufficiently supported. It is not clear that the reported observation should even be included is it is not integral to the overall message of the paper.</p><p>6. Please provide a statistical analysis of the data in 4G, particularly with regard to the incidence of higher grade lesions. Given the variance in the extent of PanIN lesions that present in the KC model, it is generally necessary to analyze far more than 4 animals per group to assess impact on this type of phenotype.</p><p>7. In general, for many experiments it was not clear how many replicates were performed and whether these were technical or biological replicates. It is important that this be stated the legend for each panel in each figure, otherwise it is impossible to provide an informed analysis of the data.</p><p>8. Related to the prior point, the data representation in most figures utilized outdated approaches (eg. bar plots) that communicate a minimum amount of information about distribution, variance, and replicates. We strongly recommend the adoption of more modern, informative data display conventions, such as those described in PMID: 32346721.</p><p>9. Additionally, it is important to indicate which statistical test was utilized in each figure. The blanket statement in the Methods that Student's T was used is not sufficient as this is not always the appropriate test. For example, in Figure 4B, the authors present normalized ratiometric data (% positive area). A Student's T is not an appropriate test for this comparison because ratiometric data violate the assumption of a normal distribution required by this test. We strongly suggest the authors review every experiment with a biostatistician.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>CXCL10/CXCR3 contributes to an inflammatory microenvironment and its blockade enhances pancreatic cancer development</p><p>In this manuscript, Pandey et al., reports a novel CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling axis between pancreatic preneoplastic lesions and inflammatory macrophages to shape the microenvironment of PanIN. The authors provide strong in vivo experimental data to support a causal role of CXCL10 and CXCR3 in the recruitment and polarization of macrophages in the pancreas, as well as the degree of fibrosis in PanIN lesions. Addressing the following concerns will further strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>1. CXCL10 has previously been reported to be the major chemokine produced by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) in the PDA tumor microenvironment. CAFs expressing IP10 are thought to recruit Tregs to promote immune evasion and tumorigenesis. CXCL10 levels have also been shown to positively correlate with stromal content in human PDAC (PMID25415223). In the current manuscript, the authors report a very robust increase in fibrosis in PanIN (using SMA as a marker) when the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis is supressed using neutralizing antibodies. This raises the interesting question of whether CXCL10 exhibit opposite functions during premalignant vs malignant stages of tumorigenesis. This can be addressed using a syngeneic orthotopic model of PDA to evaluate the effect of CXCL10/CXCR3 inhibition in established tumors. Alternatively, the authors may consider revising the title of their manuscript to focus on the effect of CXCL10/CXCR3 in preneoplastic lesions as opposed to pancreatic cancer. CXCR3 Nab did not lead to a significant change in % of PanIN or ADM in mice (Figure 4G) so it is hard to extrapolate from the current data what the role of this signaling axis is in the context of cancer unless additional data is provided beyond the current timepoints to evaluate tumorigenesis.</p><p>2. What is the spatial relationship between interferon-γ-producing T cells and PanIN lesions? A multiplex FISH of CXCL10 and IFNγ will strengthen the model that short-distance-acting IFNγ from T cells within the pancreatic parenchyma induces CXCL10 production in neighbouring acinar/ADM cells. Along the same lines, what is the percentage of T cells in PanIN and ADM-bearing pancreata?</p><p>3. Tumor associated macrophages are generally thought to originate from circulating monocytes derived from bone marrow HSCs. While thioglycollate activated peritoneal macrophages is a tractable experimental model, they are phenotypically very different from non-elicited, resident peritoneal macrophages, or naïve bone marrow derived macrophages, and as such do not serve as a proper control for &quot;non-polarized&quot; macrophages. Experiments presented in Figure 2A and B should also be done using naïve (M0) and M1 , M2 macrophages derived from the bone marrow. Experimental evidence showing that CXCR3-expressing macrophages in the pancreas originated from the peritoneum is currently absent, the authors should therefore refrain from drawing conclusions on the origin of these macrophages.</p><p>4. The authors should extend their characterization of the effect of CXCR3 in fibrosis by using pan-CAF markers (eg podoplanin) and markers for other CAF populations eg inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs). Is collagen deposition also increased upon CXCR3 inhibition?</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript by Pandey and colleagues, the authors investigate regulation of macrophage phenotype during pancreatic cancer initiation. While prior studies have demonstrated significant pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles for macrophages during pancreatic tumorigenesis, mechanistic insights are mostly limited to those promoting pro-tumorigenic macrophage phenotypes, with little known about heterocellular interactions that promote a potentially tumoricidal or tumor-suppressive macrophage state. The data presented here support the novel hypothesis that a CXCL10-CXCR3 axis promotes an inflammatory macrophage identity and suppresses tumor initiation. The work is significant in providing insights into tissue homeostatic mechanisms that limit tumor formation. However, the authors' claims that peritoneal macrophages are the relevant macrophage pool for the phenotypes reported and that CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling controls inflammatory macrophage abundance via chemoattraction are not convincingly supported by the results in the manuscript. A limited number of edits and additional analyses would be helpful in clarifying the authors' findings.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. While the authors convincingly demonstrate that the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis regulates macrophage phenotype in vitro and in vivo, the significance of chemoattraction for the reported phenotypes is not clear. Tissue-resident macrophages express CXCR3 and are known to play significant roles in pancreatic tumor progression, proliferate in situ during tumor progression, and contribute to fibrosis, consistent with a phenotypic switch in these tissue-resident cells upon CXCL10-CXCR3 inhibition as the underlying mechanism as opposed to recruitment of peritoneal macrophages. Either the chemoattraction and recruitment model should be addressed experimentally in vivo, or text should be edited to accommodate this alternative model.</p><p>2. Total F4/80+ cells should be quantified in the genetically engineered KC model treated with CXCR3 NAB (results in Figure 3D) to address the impact of the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis on total macrophage abundance in these tissues and assess, in the presence of a functional immune system, whether macrophage phenotype alone is altered or if total abundance is also impacted by CXCL10-CXCR3 inhibition.</p><p>3. Several key references are absent from the introduction and should be added and briefly discussed in the context of this study, including prior studies of CXCL10 in PDAC (Hirth, Kuner et al., Gastroenterology, 2020; Romero, Gallinger et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2020) and of macrophages/macrophage heterogeneity in pancreatic tumor initiation (Zhang, Pasca di Magliano et al., Gut, 2017; Zhu, DeNardo et al., Immunity, 2017).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60646.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The reviewers all agreed that the CXCL10 data comprises the core of the findings, but though those findings could be strengthened with further experiments. The current eLife policy also allows limiting the claims if new experiments are not possible. Specifically, to support the claim that CXCL10/CXCR3 blockade enhances cancer development, one suggested additional experiment is to evaluate tumor formation in KC mice upon longer treatment with CXCR3 Nab. However, this experiment would take a long time and thus may not be feasible. In the absence of further support that CXCL10/CXCR3 blockade enhances cancer development, and alternative would be to focus your conclusions on the role of CXCL10 in promoting an inflammatory macrophage identity. This latter option likely would include adjusting the title of the manuscript which refers to a role in tumor development.</p></disp-quote><p>One reviewer suggested an additional experiment to evaluate tumor formation in KC mice upon longer treatment with a CXCR3-NAB.

Moreover, CXCL10 has been demonstrated as a chemoattractant for macrophages along with other immune cells [3].

In general, while the data reported are supportive of their conclusions, in most cases alternative explanations were not ruled out. This could be addressed with additional experiments. In particular, the question of the initial trigger for the CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway did not exclude other explanations and this was a major component of the story. In addition, there were a number of technical concerns and questions that limit our ability to interpret the data. These could be remedied in a resubmission but require careful attention to detail.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1. Utilized ISH data as proof for protein expression. While necessary in order to identify which cell synthesize secreted proteins like CXCL10, it would be informative to see paired protein staining or Western blots for those experiments that don't already include them, as mRNA expression isn't always indicative of protein expression/levels.</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion ISH is the method of choice to determine the cells that produce proteins that are secreted. In our experience simple IHC analyses does not provide reliable information if the protein of interest is produced by a cell or if it is bound to its target cell. The alternative, to perform Western blot analyses for protein expression from tissue would require precise microdissection, or the analyses of primary cells (i.e. SM3 cells for PanIN1), which are representative of the lesion that is to be analyzed. Whenever possible, we performed such analyses. However, we would like to point out that antibodies used for IHC need to be rigorously tested for non-specific signaling. For detection of IFNγ, for example, the antibodies we have tested for IHC (e.g. Bioss #0480R) failed our test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In figure 1, the authors conclude that IFNγ is responsible for activation fo CXCL10 expression. Treatment with IFNγ did induce CXCL10, but this only proves that the pathway is sufficient and does not address whether it is necessary. To learn this, one could use an anti-IFNγ antibody and see if this blocks CXCL10 activation. Otherwise, the conclusions drawn from this experiment should be stated in a more constrained manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that there is a whole body of published work showing that IFNγ can induce CXCL10. CXCL10 is widely known in the literature as the interferon γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and previously has been shown to be induced by IFNγ via activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Our data confirms this for SM3 PanIN cells. However, as suggested by the reviewer, in the revised version of our manuscript, we state the conclusions drawn from this set of experiments in a more constrained manner in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Similarly, the conclusions drawn regarding T cell and NK cell involvement in the CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway are not fully supported.</p><p>– The combined ISH/IF experiment in Figure 1G is an elegant technical approach to studying the source-cell of a secreted protein. However, not a single control was presented for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment has neighboring negative cells included as internal controls. For example, we show CD8+ cells that express IFNγ and neighboring CD8- cells that do not express IFNγ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Presence of T cells and NK cells in the area around precursor cells, and the knowledge that T cells and NK cells express IFNγ is not sufficient to conclude that T cells and NK cells are responsible for initiation of CXCL10 expression. It is a potential explanation, but no work was done to rule out other unknown factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer on this point and since presence of IFNγ in the pancreatic microenvironment is well established, there may be more cell types besides T cells and NK cells that produce IFNγ. Since the focus of our study was not to delineate/establish all the IFNγ producers in the tumor microenvironment, following the guidance of this reviewer, we have modified the text of our manuscript and suggest that T cells or NK cells could be a potential source of IFNγ in our experimental system. We also changed the model in Figure 5F and added “or other sources in the pancreas microenvironment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Additionally, when done in a T cell free environment, the pathway still functioned and the authors themselves claim that there is &quot;no significant role of T cells in CXCL10/CXCR3 driven development of pancreatic cancer.&quot; IFNγ from T cells cannot be both the initial driver and also not significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that T cells cannot be both, “the initial driver” and also “not significant” at the same time. In a T cell free environment effects can be explained by presence of other IFNγ producing sells (such as NK cells) in the microenvironment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 2B, was the migration assay performed on M2 macrophages? One would expect them not to be responsive based on 2A, but this should be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important control. In the revised manuscript (New Figure 2B) we have included a migration assay performed on M2 macrophages. We found that migration of M2-polarized macrophages is not affected by CXCL10. Since this macrophage population does not express CXCR3 (See Figure 2A) this is an expected result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The conclusion that macrophage polarization occurred through the IRF4/5 transition is not sufficiently supported. It is not clear that the reported observation should even be included is it is not integral to the overall message of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This is based on previous published work in which it was shown that the balance between these two transcription factors determines if macrophages are M1 or M2 polarized [1, 2].

Please provide a statistical analysis of the data in 4G, particularly with regard to the incidence of higher grade lesions.

Additionally, it is important to indicate which statistical test was utilized in each figure. The blanket statement in the Methods that Student's T was used is not sufficient as this is not always the appropriate test.

A Student's T is not an appropriate test for this comparison because ratiometric data violate the assumption of a normal distribution required by this test. We strongly suggest the authors review every experiment with a biostatistician.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer and have worked with our biostatistician Dr. Yan Asmann (Associate Professor of BioMedical Informatics, Mayo Clinic) on the statistical analyses of all experiments. For example, for all experiments in which pancreatic areas were compared (previous Figures 4F and 5B), since % values are not normally distributed, we transformed the data via arcsin transformation before a t-test was performed.

The authors provide strong in vivo experimental data to support a causal role of CXCL10 and CXCR3 in the recruitment and polarization of macrophages in the pancreas, as well as the degree of fibrosis in PanIN lesions. Addressing the following concerns will further strengthen the manuscript:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. CXCL10 has previously been reported to be the major chemokine produced by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) in the PDA tumor microenvironment. CAFs expressing IP10 are thought to recruit Tregs to promote immune evasion and tumorigenesis. CXCL10 levels have also been shown to positively correlate with stromal content in human PDAC (PMID25415223). In the current manuscript, the authors report a very robust increase in fibrosis in PanIN (using SMA as a marker) when the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis is supressed using neutralizing antibodies. This raises the interesting question of whether CXCL10 exhibit opposite functions during premalignant vs malignant stages of tumorigenesis. This can be addressed using a syngeneic orthotopic model of PDA to evaluate the effect of CXCL10/CXCR3 inhibition in established tumors. Alternatively, the authors may consider revising the title of their manuscript to focus on the effect of CXCL10/CXCR3 in preneoplastic lesions as opposed to pancreatic cancer. CXCR3 Nab did not lead to a significant change in % of PanIN or ADM in mice (Figure 4G) so it is hard to extrapolate from the current data what the role of this signaling axis is in the context of cancer unless additional data is provided beyond the current timepoints to evaluate tumorigenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that investigating whether CXCL10 exhibits opposite functions during premalignant versus malignant stages of tumorigenesis is an exciting question. However, we feel that animal experiments to address this question rigorously are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Therefore, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and revised the title of our manuscript to focus on the effect of CXCL10/CXCR3 in preneoplastic lesions as opposed to pancreatic cancer. The new title is:</p><p>“CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling contributes to an inflammatory microenvironment and its blockade enhances progression of pancreatic precancerous lesions”.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we also addressed the possible opposite functions of CXCL10 in pre-malignant versus malignant stages in the last paragraph of the Discussion section on page 17. It reads:</p><p>“Considering our results, use of agonists for the receptor CXCR3 at stages of low-grade lesions may be useful to modulate macrophage polarization in the microenvironment such that a predominantly inflammatory population (M1) can be sustained. However, it needs to be noted that in pancreatic cancer expression of both CXCL10 and CXCR3 in tumor tissue has been correlated with poor prognosis (Liu et al., 2011; Lunardi et al., 2014). Therefore, it is unclear if treatment of pancreatic tumors with a CXCR3 agonist will result in a polarization switch of tumor associated macrophages that renders the lesion microenvironment less supportive for tumors, and increases efficiency of chemotherapy, or if it has a tumor promoting effect. This will be addressed in future studies”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the spatial relationship between interferon-γ-producing T cells and PanIN lesions? A multiplex FISH of CXCL10 and IFNγ will strengthen the model that short-distance-acting IFNγ from T cells within the pancreatic parenchyma induces CXCL10 production in neighbouring acinar/ADM cells. Along the same lines, what is the percentage of T cells in PanIN and ADM-bearing pancreata?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that quantifying the T cell populations that produce IFNγ at ADM or PanIN lesions, as well as measuring their spatial proximity to these lesions is interesting, but we feel that this does not really belong into the current manuscript and requires a thorough analysis, which will be a separate project. However, we would like to point out the following to answer above reviewer questions: Multiple cell types within the pancreatic microenvironment, including T cells and NK cells, have been shown to secrete IFNγ [1-3]; and in Figure 1G we show that all of these are present and produce IFNγ. With respect to T cells, we (and others) previously have shown that they occur in proximity to ADM/PanIN areas in the KC model. For example, in Liou et al., Cell Reports, 2017 [4], we show in Supplemental Figure S3A that CD3- and CD4-positive cells are present in ADM/PanIN areas. Similarly, in Liou et al., Cancer Discovery, 2015 [5], we show in Supplemental Figure S1B, panel B7, that CD3-positive cells are present in ADM/PanIN areas. Moreover, in a more recent paper from Bastea et al., Cancer Research, 2019 [6], in Figures 6H and 6I we demonstrate the presence of CD3+;CD4+;IFNγ+ and CD3+;CD8+;IFNγ+ T cell populations in the pancreas of KC mice. An additional analysis of this data suggests that the percentage for CD3+;CD4+;IFNγ+ cells in ADM/PanIN bearing pancerata (n=3) is approximately 0.33% -/+ 0.28% of all cells and for CD3+;CD8+;IFNγ+ cells in ADM/PanIN bearing pancreata (n=3) is approximately 0.02% -/+ 0.02% of all cells.</p><p>References for this response:</p><p>1.

Tumor associated macrophages are generally thought to originate from circulating monocytes derived from bone marrow HSCs. While thioglycollate activated peritoneal macrophages is a tractable experimental model, they are phenotypically very different from non-elicited, resident peritoneal macrophages, or naïve bone marrow derived macrophages, and as such do not serve as a proper control for &quot;non-polarized&quot; macrophages. Experiments presented in Figure 2A and B should also be done using naïve (M0) and M1 , M2 macrophages derived from the bone marrow. Experimental evidence showing that CXCR3-expressing macrophages in the pancreas originated from the peritoneum is currently absent, the authors should therefore refrain from drawing conclusions on the origin of these macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. For the revised version of our manuscript we performed additional experiments using naïve and M1-polarized or M2-polarized macrophages derived from the bone marrow, and obtained data (shown in New Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) consistent with previous data obtained with polarized peritoneal macrophages. We also agree that there is no experimental evidence of the origin of the chemoattracted macrophages and made appropriate changes throughout the text to refrain from implicating that they originate in the peritoneum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should extend their characterization of the effect of CXCR3 in fibrosis by using pan-CAF markers (eg podoplanin) and markers for other CAF populations eg inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs).

However, the major point in our manuscript (Figure 4) is to determine the effects of CXCR3 signaling on alternatively-activated (M2) macrophage populations. We have included an analysis of SMA+ fibroblasts (see Figures 4A and 4B) because we previously have shown that in the KC model M2 macrophages (marked by expression of Ym1) regulate this population, and a depletion of M2 macrophages decreases fibrosis as measured by staining for SMA [1]. This is why we used IHC for SMA as readout for fibrosis affected by the M2 macrophage population. A detailed analysis of effects of CXCR3 signaling on different CAF populations is clearly beyond the scope of the current study since there are no single markers for these populations described. Such analyses need co-staining for several markers (i.e. IF-IHC for podoplanin and SMA; or IHC for podoplanin combined with ISH for CXCL12) to distinguish myCAFs from non-myCAFs or to determine changes in iCAFs by analyzing CD45-/Ly6c+ population changes.

While prior studies have demonstrated significant pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles for macrophages during pancreatic tumorigenesis, mechanistic insights are mostly limited to those promoting pro-tumorigenic macrophage phenotypes, with little known about heterocellular interactions that promote a potentially tumoricidal or tumor-suppressive macrophage state. The data presented here support the novel hypothesis that a CXCL10-CXCR3 axis promotes an inflammatory macrophage identity and suppresses tumor initiation. The work is significant in providing insights into tissue homeostatic mechanisms that limit tumor formation. However, the authors' claims that peritoneal macrophages are the relevant macrophage pool for the phenotypes reported and that CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling controls inflammatory macrophage abundance via chemoattraction are not convincingly supported by the results in the manuscript. A limited number of edits and additional analyses would be helpful in clarifying the authors' findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Specific comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While the authors convincingly demonstrate that the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis regulates macrophage phenotype in vitro and in vivo, the significance of chemoattraction for the reported phenotypes is not clear. Tissue-resident macrophages express CXCR3 and are known to play significant roles in pancreatic tumor progression, proliferate in situ during tumor progression, and contribute to fibrosis, consistent with a phenotypic switch in these tissue-resident cells upon CXCL10-CXCR3 inhibition as the underlying mechanism as opposed to recruitment of peritoneal macrophages. Either the chemoattraction and recruitment model should be addressed experimentally in vivo, or text should be edited to accommodate this alternative model.</p></disp-quote><p>In normal pancreata of 7-8 weeks old mice we detect only very few tissue resident macrophages, with an average of 5.51 -/+ 4.06 macrophages per mm2.

Approximately 80% of tissue resident macrophages in normal mouse pancreas express CXCR3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), but these cells, when isolated do not proliferate in response to CXCL10 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). In sum our in vitro data suggests that CXCL10 may drive the chemoattraction of inflammatory macrophages to the pancreas”.</p><p>References for this response:</p><p>1.

Total F4/80+ cells should be quantified in the genetically engineered KC model treated with CXCR3 NAB (results in Figure 3D) to address the impact of the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis on total macrophage abundance in these tissues and assess, in the presence of a functional immune system, whether macrophage phenotype alone is altered or if total abundance is also impacted by CXCL10-CXCR3 inhibition.</p><p>This is an excellent point and we have included a quantification of total F4/80+ cells in the New Figure 3—figure supplement 1F.</p><p>3. Several key references are absent from the introduction and should be added and briefly discussed in the context of this study, including prior studies of CXCL10 in PDAC (Hirth, Kuner et al., Gastroenterology, 2020; Romero, Gallinger et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2020) and of macrophages/macrophage heterogeneity in pancreatic tumor initiation (Zhang, Pasca di Magliano et al., Gut, 2017; Zhu, DeNardo et al., Immunity, 2017).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these references and apologize for having missed them in our initial manuscript. In our revision these publications are now included.</p></body></sub-article></article>
