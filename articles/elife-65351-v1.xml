cells must deploy mechanisms that sense and neutralize host microbicidal effectors. For <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, these mechanisms allow the bacterium to rapidly adapt from aerosol transmission to initial growth in the lung alveolar macrophage. Here, we identify a branched signaling circuit in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that controls growth in the lung through integrated direct sensing of copper ions and nitric oxide by coupled activity of the Rip1 intramembrane protease and the PdtaS/R two-component system. This circuit uses a two-signal mechanism to inactivate the PdtaS/PdtaR two-component system, which constitutively represses virulence gene expression. Cu and NO inhibit the PdtaS sensor kinase through a dicysteine motif in the N-terminal GAF domain. The NO arm of the pathway is further controlled by sequestration of the PdtaR RNA binding response regulator by an NO-induced small RNA, controlled by the Rip1 intramembrane protease. This coupled Rip1/PdtaS/PdtaR circuit controls NO resistance and acute lung infection in mice by relieving PdtaS/R-mediated repression of isonitrile chalkophore biosynthesis. These studies identify an integrated mechanism by which <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> senses and resists macrophage chemical effectors to achieve pathogenesis</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>bacterial pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>nutritional immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI138446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buglino</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sankhe</surname><given-names>Gaurav D</given-names></name><name><surname>Glickman</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buglino</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sankhe</surname><given-names>Gaurav D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lazar</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name><name><surname>Glickman</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19AI11143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buglino</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name><name><surname>Glickman</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the bacterium that causes the disease tuberculosis, uses a signaling system that senses multiple products of the host's immune system to modify gene expression to colonize the lung.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and Salmonella that infect macrophages have evolved elaborate mechanisms to respond to the toxic environment of the macrophage phagosome and associated endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olive and Sassetti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stallings and Glickman, 2019</xref>). Phagosomal pathogens must contend with such host-inflicted stresses as oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bustamante et al., 2011</xref>), nitrosative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darwin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and VÃ¡zquez-Torres, 2019</xref>), iron deprivation, copper and zinc toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheldon and Skaar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi and Darwin, 2015</xref>), and low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vandal et al., 2009</xref>), among others. The pathogen response to these molecules is multifaceted and must be dynamic and graded to respond both to rapidly changing environments and the prospect of combinations of stresses that vary in intensity and composition over time. When expelled by coughing and inhaled by the naÃ¯ve host, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> must transition from the nutrient-rich environment of the pulmonary cavity to deposition in the alveolus and engulfment by an alveolar macrophage. Such rapid transitions in environment require rapid changes in gene expression for successful adaptation.</p><p>Bacterial two-component systems (TCS) are widespread sensing systems that respond to a wide variety of ligands, including ions, gases, and metabolites. For pathogenic bacteria, TCS promote pathogenesis by modifying bacterial gene expression in response to host-inflicted toxic stresses or metabolic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bretl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groisman, 2016</xref>). The classic TCS sensing system consists of a membrane-bound sensor kinase that senses an extracellular ligand and activates through autophosphorylation on a cytoplasmic histidine. Transfer of this phosphate to an aspartate in the receiver domain of the cognate response regulator (RR) activates the RR to bind DNA of its target genes, thereby controlling gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sankhe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zschiedrich et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to TCS signaling, proteolysis is another widespread mechanism of bacterial signal transduction in which membrane-embedded proteases process membrane-embedded proteins, often anti-sigma factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schneider and Glickman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Urban, 2009</xref>). The S2P class of intramembrane proteases is widely distributed in bacteria, and several have been implicated in controlling virulence functions of bacterial and fungal pathogens, including <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almagro-Moreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matson and DiRita, 2005</xref>), Cryptococcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bien et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis</italic> Rip1 is an important virulence determinant required for both acute growth in the lung and long-term persistence during chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makinoshima and Glickman, 2005</xref>). Rip1 controls four independent sigma factor pathways through four anti-sigma factors substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sklar et al., 2010</xref>), but the virulence function of Rip1 appears to be independent of these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sklar et al., 2010</xref>). Given the importance of this pathway for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis, we sought to determine the virulence pathway(s) controlled by Rip1. These investigations, described below, uncover a new signaling system that integrates the bacterial response to Cu and NO and thereby controls growth in the host lung. The hub of this signaling system is the PdtaS/R cytoplasmic TCS, which constitutively represses virulence gene expression until inactivation by Cu and NO. The NO arm of the pathway is further controlled by titration of PdtaR from its RNA targets by an NO-induced, Rip1-controlled, small RNA, which binds directly to PdtaR and controls expression of isonitrile chalkophores. The ultimate CuÂ resistance mechanism controlled by Rip1/PdtaS/R is independent of chalkophores and remains to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Rip1 pathway defends against metal and nitrosative stress</title><p>To understand the basis for the severe virulence defect of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lacking the Rip1 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makinoshima and Glickman, 2005</xref>), a phenotype that is independent of the four identified Rip1-controlled sigma factor pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sklar et al., 2010</xref>), we hypothesized that Rip1 defends against specific host-imposed bactericidal effector molecules. We performed bacterial killing assays of wild-type (WT)Â <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and Î<italic>rip1</italic> with nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, copper, zinc, low pH, detergent, lysozyme, and nutrient starvation. We observed no Rip1-dependent sensitization to starvation, lysozyme, oxidative stress, detergent, or low pHÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). However, we observed that Rip1 is required for resistance to copper ions, nitric oxide, and zinc. M. tuberculosis Îrip1 is 10,000-fold more sensitive to copper on agar media than wild-type Mtb, and this phenotype is restored by genetic complementation by a plasmid encoding a wild-type copy of Rip1, but not a proteolytically inactive Rip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sensitivity was also observed for Îrip1 cells grown in liquid media with Cu supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, Îrip1 growth is inhibited by 100 Î¼M Zn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but not iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Rip1 is also required for resistance to nitric oxide. Treatment of wild-type Mtb for 3 days with 200 Î¼M of the NO donor diethylenetriamine nitric oxide (DETA-NO) minimally reduced bacterial viability, whereas Îrip1 titers were reduced 100-fold, a phenotype that was also complemented with wild-type Rip1 but not proteolytically inactive Rip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, similar metal nor NO sensitivity was observed for M. tuberculosis strains lacking individual or any tested combination of Rip1-controlled sigma factor pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>), indicating that the Rip1-controlled metal/NO resistance pathway is a previously unrecognized, sigma factor-independent arm of the Rip1 pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Rip1 protease controls copper and nitric oxide resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Rip1 pathway confers resistance to copper.

Although signal transduction systems that respond to each of these molecules have been identified, the true in vivo determinants of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resistance to these molecules are unknown. Additionally, although stresses are often assayed monolithically in vitro, this approach belies the situation in vivo, which the pathogen must sense and respond to simultaneous chemically distinct stresses that vary in intensity over time. Our studies identify an integrated sensing system that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> uses to directly sense combinations of stresses using a single sensing circuit.</p><p>The hub of this signaling system is the PdtaS/R TCS. This TCS is distinct from previously characterized TCS in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in both structure and mechanism of regulation. The sensor kinase, PdtaS, is cytosolic rather than membrane bound. PdtaS is constitutively active in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehta et al., 2020</xref>), and our data indicates the mechanism of signal transduction is ligand-induced inhibition of this constitutive activity. Rather than being activated by its ligands, PdtaS is inhibited by copper and NO through a dicysteine motif in the N-terminal GAF domain, defining an integrated mechanism by which two chemical effectors are sensed. The constitutively active PdtaS/R system negatively regulates a subset of genes required for NO resistance and relief of this inhibition by ligand-induced shutoff of PdtaS is necessary, but not sufficient, for expression of genes required NO resistance.</p><p>Our data also strongly demonstrates that full inhibition of PdtaS/R signaling requires the transduction of a cell surface signal by the intramembrane protease Rip1. Rip1 was originally identified as a S2P required for both acute growth in the mouse lung and persistence of the bacterium during chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makinoshima and Glickman, 2005</xref>). Four anti-sigma factor substrates have been identified, but none of these previously identified pathways explain the virulence defects of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lacking Rip1. The data presented here indicate that critical virulence function of Rip1 is to relieve PdtaR repression through control of a previously unrecognized small RNA at the 5â² end of the PPE1 gene. Rip1-controlled expression of PPE1 5â² is required for NO resistance as re-expression of this element is sufficient to reverse the NO sensitivity of Î<italic>rip1</italic> and to re-express the chalkophore operon, itself sufficient to mediate NO resistance. The PPE1-5â² RNA binds directly to PdtaR in vitro, and this binding is enhanced, but does not absolutely require, PdtaR phosphorylation by PdtaS. This data, coupled with our genetic data, indicates that Rip1 control of PPE1-5â² directly inhibits PdtaR and de-represses PdtaR targets, which are ordinarily repressed by the PdtaS/R cascade. This mechanism of RNA-based titration of ANTAR domain RRs away from competitor target RNAs has been described as a mechanism of regulation in Enterococcus and Listeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DebRoy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mellin et al., 2014</xref>). This model suggests a branched logic of the Rip1/PdtaS/PdtaR system. Two signals are required to fully inactivate the PdtaS/R system and mediate NO resistance. A positive Rip1 transcriptional signal from the membrane to produce PPE1-5â² to sequester PdtaR, and a cytoplasmic inhibitory signal through the PdtaS kinase mediated by direct sensing of NO by the PdtaS GAF domain, which inhibits kinase activity. Our findings that PdtaR phosphorylation is not absolutely required for its function in NO resistance in vivo or RNA binding in vitro supports the model that two signals, PdtaS inhibition and PdtaR titration by the PPE1-5â² RNA, cooperate to titrate the activity of the PdtaS/R system. Our integrated model of this system is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of the Rip1/PdtaS/PdtaR signaling circuit and its response to copper and nitric oxide.</title><p>NO and copper resistance is mediated by cell surface and cytoplasmic convergent signals that inactivate PdtaS/PdtaR. In basal conditions, PdtaS/R is constitutively active, and that activity holds virulence genes, including chalkophore biosynthesis, inactive. NO or copper directly inhibit PdtaS activity through direct sensing by PdtaS N-terminal GAF domain. NO shutoff of PdtaS kinase activity requires C53 and 57, whereas Cu shutoff requires C53 with the role of C57 unknown. Sensing of NO at the cell surface contributes a second signal to relief of PdtaS/R by inducing Rip1-dependent expression of a hairpin containing small RNA at the 5â² end of the PPE1 gene (PPE1-5â²), which binds directly to the ANTAR domain containing PdtaR. These signals relieve PdtaS/R repression of virulence gene expression, including chalkophore biosynthesis, to activate NO resistance. Although our data clearly implicates the upstream Rip1/PdtaS/PdtaR cascade in Cu resistance, the downstream targets that mediate Cu resistance are not known (indicated by ?).

Despite this Cu binding and an expectation that this property would predict a role in Cu resistance, our data instead indicate that these molecules are not acting to diminish copper toxicity and rather that their function is to ameliorate or prevent NO toxicity. The exact mechanisms by which chalkophores contribute to NO resistance in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> are not defined here, but in Methanotrophs chalkophores help maintain the activity of Cu-containing enzymes in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenney and Rosenzweig, 2018</xref>). An analogous function in mycobacteria might imply that NO stress displaces Cu from thiol metal centers, an activity that has been shown with MymT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gold et al., 2008</xref>), and that chalkophores may compensate for this toxicity. This hypothesis and others will require further characterization of chalkophore functions in mycobacteria.</p><p>Although the Rip1/PdtaS/PdtaR cascade jointly controls NO and Cu resistance, we did not identify the chromosomal targets of PdtaS/R that mediate the Cu arm of the pathway. The Cu resistance controlled by this signaling cascade is distinct from known mechanisms of Cu binding or efflux based on our genetic data. Our data showing that NO-induced transcription of the PPE1-5â²Â RNA is the second signal in the NO resistance pathway, but not Cu resistance, leads us to hypothesize that as yet unidentified Rip1-controlled small RNA titrates away PdtaR from targets involved in Cu resistance. This model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) implies that the target RNAs controlled by PdtaR may be modified based on the activating stress, a hypothesis that will be pursued in future work to determine the full complement of RNAs binding to PdtaR under Cu and NO stress.</p><p>In summary, our results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism of bacterial signal transduction that allows Mtb to rapidly adapt to the toxic environment of the host lung. This study opens a window into several important future questions, including the full spectrum of RNAs bound by the PdtaR RR, the ultimate mechanism by which this sensing circuit controls NO resistance, and the mechanisms of PdtaS sensing of ligand. These future questions will add additional detail to the critical mechanisms of TB pathogenesis identified here and potentially identify a critical pathway for therapeutic development against Mtb.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The experiments demonstrate that a two-component system, together with a protease, sense and integrate NO stress to control expression of biosynthetic genes required for synthesis of high affinity copper-binding molecules. The authors thus demonstrate a complex set of mechanisms for response to important stress determinants that prevail during colonization of macrophages.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Voskuil (Reviewer #2); Jeffery S Cox (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this submission, Buglino and colleagues investigate a regulatory circuit in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> that facilitates the response to nitric oxide and copper ions, both of which are components of antibacterial response in macrophages. They build on previous work demonstrating that the membrane-embedded site-2 protease (S2P), Rip1 is required for virulence in the mouse model of tuberculosis infection, an effect that is related to activity of Ï factors. In this work, the authors further explore the role of this protease in regulating the response to stress conditions.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, Rip1 is required for resistance to copper ions, nitric oxide, and zinc, with deletion of rip1 resulting in a 10 000 fold increase in sensitivity to copper, which did not appear to result from the activity of any known copper pathways in this organism.</p><p>2. In the mouse model of tuberculosis infection, Rip1 appears to defend against the antimicrobial effect of NO, as attenuate virulence of the mutant was reversed in infections of NOS2 deficient mice.</p><p>3. Using a screen for suppression of the copper sensitivity, two mutations were detected in PdtaS, suggesting that the PdtaS/R system was involved in the observed response. The authors confirm this by complementing the mutant with variants of PdtaS that lack kinase activity and by creating a deletion mutant of the two-component regulator.</p><p>4. The authors then reconstitute the Pdta phosphotransfer reaction and show that this two-component system is able to sense copper, zinc and nitric oxide. Binding of these ligands inhibits signalling through the system. Ligand binding requires the GAF domain of the sensor and required a cysteine residue.</p><p>5. Using RNA sequencing of their mutant panel, the authors define the set of genes regulated by the PdtaS/R system, including a gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of isonitrile lipopeptide chalkophores (which bind copper with high affinity) and PPE1-5.</p><p>6. To further investigate the link with PPE1-5, the authors demonstrate that PPE1-5 RNA binds to PdtaR and these combined effects are critical for chalkophore biosynthesis and NO resistance in vitro and during infection.</p><p>Conclusion: The study shows that the PdtaS/R two-component system and the Rip1 protease sense and integrate NO stress to control expression of biosynthetic genes required for synthesis of high affinity copper-binding molecules.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers commented on the high quality and rigour of the data presented in the manuscript but also raised concerns that there was insufficient evidence presented to support the conclusion that the circuit is important for copper stress resistance. It is our assessment that your work still has significant value without a strong focus on copper stress resistance. I suggest you modify the manuscript to keep the focus on NO stress resistance and indicate the role for copper in regulation of the circuit is not firmly delineated. In a separate section below, I have provided the reviewer suggestions for additional copper experiments to give you a sense of the concerns and how best to address them. You can address these by modifying the manuscript or adding any new supporting data, if these are available. Extensive new experimentation on this aspect is not expected.</p><p>Concerns regards copper sensing/resistance:</p><p>It seems counterintuitive that a copper acquisition system would be activated during copper stress and it appears that it is probably not from the data presented, although chalkophore gene expression during copper stress was not investigated. If copper is blocking PdtaS/R signaling as is indicated by the in vitro biochemistry, then the unknown Rip1 mediator may be preventing the downstream activation of the chalkophore biosynthesis genes. Although this would be an opposite role for Rip1 than that convincingly demonstrated with NO. Figure 5D shows overexpression of the chalkophore biosynthetic operon instead of increasing copper resistance, as is the case with NO, results in a modest increase in sensitivity to copper stress on plates. However, deletion of the nrp gene, which is part of the chalkophore biosynthetic operon, appears to also modestly increase sensitivity to copper stress on plates (Figure S7B and C). These two findings provide the phenotypic data that suggest a role for the system in copper stress resistance, but they also appear to be contradictory findings. In addition, restoration of chalkophore gene expression or expression of PPE5' or PPE1 did not rescue copper sensitivity of the rip1 mutant strains demonstrating that chalkophore regulation is not likely the mechanism in which loss of Rip1 causes copper sensitivity. Since the PdtaS/R system controls chalkophore synthesis it seems unlikely that the in vitro finding that copper blocks the system like NO occurs in the cell during copper stress. Alternatively, if copper mediate blockage of activation does occur in the bacilli, it may not result in de-repression of chalkophore biosynthesis genes as occurs with NO. As gene expression was not determined during copper stress, the impact of copper on gene expression cannot be assessed. While it appears that copper stress is in some manner integrated into the sensory inputs of the overall circuit, the above findings make the role of copper sensing vague. The authors indicate that the PdtaS/R system is not involved in copper resistance, but it is not clear why copper would not trigger de-repression of chalkophore genes as it appears to block the system like NO. To establish the role of copper in the system several experiments would be helpful. These include expression profiling during copper stress to determine if genes such as the chalkophore operon are regulated during copper stress as they are induced by NO.</p><p>Copper stress experiments could also be performed in liquid culture to determine true lethality upon plating instead of copper exposure only on plates. As copper challenge experiments were done with copper added to plates not in liquid culture, as was the case for NO and zinc experiments, it is difficult to compare NO and copper experiments. As solid agar copper toxicity experiments cannot differentiate lethal and static effects of copper, the copper experiments should be labeled as &quot;relative inhibition&quot; instead of &quot;relative survival.&quot;</p><p>The Ki for copper binding PdtaS was found to be 34 microM, since PdtaS is cytosolic and free intracellular copper is known to be highly toxic, this level of intracellular copper should be put into context with potential intracellular levels.</p><p>A mechanism should be discussed to incorporate the contradictory findings that copper should activate chalkophore synthesis genes through its interaction with PdtaS, even though this interaction seems to not have a role. It may be the impact on PdtaS autophosphorylation by copper is unavoidable due to the chemistry therefor the Rip1 system is employed to short circuit the activation of chalkophore synthesis from copper stress to prevent increased copper accumulation.</p><p>The paragraph starting on line 103: The logical basis for the epistasis tests is not entirely clear. The first idea makes sense â Rip1 mutants may be sensitive to high copper levels because they are unable to derepress the RicR and CsoR regulons which function to export copper, and thus removal of the repressors would suppress the sensitivity phenotype of the rip1 mutant. While the rip1 csoR double mutant is sensitive to high copper, isn't it possible that RicR is still repressing something that is required for copper resistance. That is, wouldn't it be more definitive to remove both ricR and csoR? This needs some clarification. Secondly, the transition from the two copper regulators (RicR and CsoR) to the two gene targets is not intuitive, it would help the reader if the functions of MymT and CtpV are explained. This part is a bit confusing as the mymT and ctpV mutants aren't sensitive to copper concentrations that are toxic to rip1 mutant cells â isn't that the main evidence that the Rip1 pathway for copper resistance is mediated through mechanisms other than MymT or CtpV mediated copper efflux (or perhaps not due to efflux at all)? Or are the mymT and ctpV mutants still able to efflux copper? Here the logic for the epistasis test isn't clear â it would seem that if the Rip1 pathway for copper resistance is independent of the MymT/CtpV pathway, the main expectation of double mutants would be that there would be ultra-sensitivity, i.e. synergy or &quot;negative epistasis&quot;. It seems that there is a fairly potent synergistic effect of ctpV and csoR in combination with the rip1 mutation in Figure S3C, especially at medium [Cu] (2 and 3 logs). This is not evident with mymT. Finally, the term &quot;copper handling&quot; is vague (line 116).</p><p>Major concerns that must be addressed:</p><p>1. In order for the authors to claim that NO and copper modulates the PtdaS/R/Rip1 signal transduction system via direct interaction with a thiol switch, they need to demonstrate a direct effect of copper or NO on the Cys residue. For example, evidence of S-nitrosylation, the covalent addition of NO moiety to the sulfur atom of Cys, would provide conclusive evidence of a thiol switch. Also, the authors have not demonstrated whether copper could modify the Cys resideu. Standard spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry or other assays (e.g., biotin switch) could demonstrate these modifications. Also, if the Cys residue plays a key role, why was not it identified in the suppressor screen? What about the 2nd Cys residue (C57)? In fact, other residues were identified strongly suggesting that Cys is not central to a thiol switch as other residues (e.g., V) are also involved. As indicated above, rephrasing these conclusions and removing the emphasis on copper should assist in addressing these issues.</p><p>2. Did the authors consider that PdtaS may bind other cofactors (e.g. c/gAMP) or prosthetic groups such as heme? Although doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2011.11.012 reported that there is no evidence of a bound metabolite they did not comment on the presence of heme in the GAF domain and stated that the internal cavity is too small to bind heme in the PAS domain. Although not required, since the authors have purified PdtaS, a simple UV-vis scan will reveal whether this protein binds heme (potentially loosely as it was not identified in the crystal structure), which will provide a clear mechanism of responding to NO and potentially copper.</p><p>3. The rational for performing RNA seq experiments using NO and not also copper is unclear. Can you explain this reasoning? The main reason for this request is you identified a putative copper binding operon under NO stress. Please also expand on your statement that isonitrile binds copper with high affinity as this binding data is not provided in the references (at least not in the PNAS paper), which suggests it is involved in copper transport and not binding. Strong copper binding is also mentioned in lines 303 without any reference; please provide.</p><p>4. In figure 6, the authors examined 4 mutants (some of them are double knockouts) in vivo, but no complementation experiments were performed. We understand the challenges and complexities involved in re-doing these time-consuming experiments however, genetic complementation is the standard in the field. Can the authors provide a compelling reason for the lack of complementation?</p><p>5. Although the authors predict in lines 323-326 that the in vivo virulence defect conferred by loss of rip1 should be reversed in a rip1/pdtaR knockout, this is not entirely true. Although the authors attempt to explain this by separating the response during acute infection versus chronic infection, this is not entirely consistent with their prediction in lines 323 â 326 and the data points in figure 6C and D. This will become more evident if the authors provide the statistics for not only the wild-type and rip1 comparison, but also for the wild-type and rip1/pdtaR and wild-type and pdtaR comparisons. As it stands, it is incomplete.</p><p>6. Lines 133-134. this conclusion is too strong â it seems that increased growth of an Mtb mutant in an iNOS knockout mouse does not establish that the gene is directly involved in defending against the antimicrobial effect of NO. Certainly this is consistent with the direct NO sensitivity of the mutant in culture, but there are many effects of NO during anti-TB immune responses.</p><p>7. Figure 3. There is a bit of a disconnect between the gel in panel B and the quantification in panel F. Perhaps it is the pdf but while there is a noticeable decrease in the band intensity in the two-fold drop from 5 to 10 uM, but the 10-100 Î¼m bands all look the same to me (unlike the Zn inhibition data in Figure S5, which looks really good). Also, a -Cu control is missing â how was the % inhibition calculated without this?</p><p>8. Isn't the simple expectation that chalkophore synthesis would lead to Cu resistance? It seems unexpected that it would only affect NO and not Cu sensitivity. That is mentioned in the Discussion section but it seems confusing in the results without any explanation.</p><p>9. The role of PPE1-5' RNA could be more thoroughly explored. First, the expression of the PPE1-5' RNA is in the context of expression of the entire PPE1 gene. Thus, it is not clear that expression of PPE1-5' is sufficient to suppress the NO sensitivity phenotype of the Rip1 mutant. Can just the RNA be expressed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65351.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers commented on the high quality and rigour of the data presented in the manuscript but also raised concerns that there was insufficient evidence presented to support the conclusion that the circuit is important for copper stress resistance.

The statement that â a copper acquisition system would be activated during copper stressâ seems to assume that the <italic>nrp</italic> operon is involved in copper acquisition because the natural product produced by these enzymes binds copper. The molecular function of the molecules produced by the <italic>nrp</italic> operon encoded proteins is not known. The reviewers seem to assume that any molecule that binds copper is acting to modulate copper toxicity via binding, as is the case for copper binding proteins such as MymT. However, in the case of the chalkophores of Methanococcus, the function of the chalkophore is to supply copper to a membrane bound copper enzyme, not to directly ameliorate toxicity. Although we agree that it is surprising that the chromosomal target of the cascade that mediates NO resistance, but not copper resistance, is a copper binding molecule, the experiments in the paper were executed to definitively demonstrate this point.</p><p>Therefore, we agree that our study does not fully define the Cu arm of the pathway. However, what is definitive in our data, and acknowledged in the review, is: (1) Rip1 is required for resistance to both stresses (2) loss of PdtaS/R function is a suppressor of BOTH the NO and Cu sensitivity of the D<italic>rip1</italic> strain, and (3) Cu and NO both inhibit the signaling system biochemically. The fact that the chromosomal targets that mediate resistance to each of these stresses are distinct indicates that there is some mechanism that specifies PdtaR function to specific gene sets under specific stress conditions. Our data identifies the Ppe1-5â RNA as that factor under NO stress and we hypothesize, but do not identify, a Cu induced similar factor. The fact that Cu and NO both inhibit PdtaS must be understood in the context of our two signal model, in which inhibition of the kinase is not sufficient to depress gene expression without a second signal (PPE1-5â in the case of NO) and therefore the assertion in the review that inhibition of PdtaS by copper would stimulate <italic>nrp</italic> expression is not correct. The RNAseq data in the PdtaR ko in the absence of any stress demonstrates this unambiguously, there is no induction of the <italic>nrp</italic> operon in the PdtaR ko in basal conditions.</p><p>In addition, the review points to several pieces of data for example âFigure 5D showsâ¦â and âappears to also modestly increase sensitivity to copper stress.â that are nonsignificant differences and therefore were not highlighted in our analysis or integrated into the model. They should not be invoked as supporting the assertion that our data is âcontradictoryâ.</p><p>In summary, although we agree that our study does not resolve the ultimate downstream chromosomal target of the Rip1/PdtaS/PdtaR cascade that controls Cu resistance, we do definitively implicate this cascade in Cu resistance. The fact that a Cu binding molecule mediates NO, but not Cu resistance, may be surprising based on the notion that any Cu binding molecule must be ameliorating toxicity, but this is a presumption that is not borne out in the data. Multiple other hypotheses can be advanced but must be explored by further experimentation. For example, NO may induce a Cu deficient state in membrane bound enzymes which is ameliorated by a restorative function of chalkophore-bound Cu through a loading function.</p><p>In response to these points raised by the reviewers, we have clarified the discussion to better incorporate these concerns and make clear that our study does not elucidate the downstream mechanisms of Cu resistance controlled by the Rip1/PdtaS/R system. We have focused the data presentation more on the NO phenotypes. We have maintained the model figure to emphasize this point because this visual representation clearly indicates a â?â on the chromosomal target of Cu arm of the pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Copper stress experiments could also be performed in liquid culture to determine true lethality upon plating instead of copper exposure only on plates. As copper challenge experiments were done with copper added to plates not in liquid culture, as was the case for NO and zinc experiments, it is difficult to compare NO and copper experiments. As solid agar copper toxicity experiments cannot differentiate lethal and static effects of copper, the copper experiments should be labeled as &quot;relative inhibition&quot; instead of &quot;relative survival.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added data to Figure 1-Figure Supplement 1D showing that the copper sensitivity of the Î<italic>rip1</italic> strain is present when cells are exposed to Cu in liquid media.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Ki for copper binding PdtaS was found to be 34 microM, since PdtaS is cytosolic and free intracellular copper is known to be highly toxic, this level of intracellular copper should be put into context with potential intracellular levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. The intracellular copper concentration noted in phagosomes is in the range of 20 â 40 Î¼m (Wagner D, et al. J Immunol 2005;174:1491â1500). It is difficult extrapolate these levels to the physiologic relevance to PdtaS particularly because of the equilibrium between Cu<sup>+1</sup> and Cu<sup>+2</sup>. Although we apply Cu<sup>+2</sup> in these assays, we cannot control the conversion to Cu<sup>+1.</sup> As a point of reference, the biochemical data in PMID 21166899 indicates that dissociation of RicR from its operator requires 15-20 Î¼M copper, suggesting that the cytosolic concentration reaches this level under copper stress given the robust induction of RicR targets under the conditions we test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the PdtaS/R system controls chalkophore synthesis it seems unlikely that the in vitro finding that copper blocks the system like NO occurs in the cell during copper stress. Alternatively, if copper mediate blockage of activation does occur in the bacilli, it may not result in de-repression of chalkophore biosynthesis genes as occurs with NO. As gene expression was not determined during copper stress, the impact of copper on gene expression cannot be assessed. While it appears that copper stress is in some manner integrated into the sensory inputs of the overall circuit, the above findings make the role of copper sensing vague. The authors indicate that the PdtaS/R system is not involved in copper resistance, but it is not clear why copper would not trigger de-repression of chalkophore genes as it appears to block the system like NO.</p><p>A mechanism should be discussed to incorporate the contradictory findings that copper should activate chalkophore synthesis genes through its interaction with PdtaS, even though this interaction seems to not have a role. It may be the impact on PdtaS autophosphorylation by copper is unavoidable due to the chemistry therefor the Rip1 system is employed to short circuit the activation of chalkophore synthesis from copper stress to prevent increased copper accumulation.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, this comment presumes the inhibition of PdtaS/R alone is sufficient to activate all downstream gene expression, which is not correct. We have performed RNA sequencing of the PdtaR mutant without stress and find very few differences in gene expression (see figure 4B,C) and specifically that the chalkophore operon is not induced. This piece of data is part of the support for our two-signal model in which inhibition of PdtaS signaling is necessary but not sufficient for activation of gene expression. Our data indicate that a second signal to modify PdtaR binding is required, and, in the case of NO, we identify this signal as the NO induced transcription of PPE1-5â. The reviewer is correct that we have not identified this second signal for Cu, nor identified the chromosomal target(s) it regulates, but the data does not support the assertion that Cu inhibition of PdtaS is sufficient to activate chalkophore biosynthesis and that, based this is assumption, our findings are contradictory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paragraph starting on line 103: The logical basis for the epistasis tests is not entirely clear. The first idea makes sense â Rip1 mutants may be sensitive to high copper levels because they are unable to derepress the RicR and CsoR regulons which function to export copper, and thus removal of the repressors would suppress the sensitivity phenotype of the rip1 mutant. While the rip1 csoR double mutant is sensitive to high copper, isn't it possible that RicR is still repressing something that is required for copper resistance. That is, wouldn't it be more definitive to remove both ricR and csoR? This needs some clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>The RicR and CsoR regulons are nonoverlapping according to prior literature. It is possible there is redundancy in function, but the experiment requested would require creation of triple mutant and based on the data that all RicR targets measured are intact, in addition to the lack of epistasis with RicR targets (i.e. CtpV and MymT, see below), we have not created this mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the transition from the two copper regulators (RicR and CsoR) to the two gene targets is not intuitive, it would help the reader if the functions of MymT and CtpV are explained. This part is a bit confusing as the mymT and ctpV mutants aren't sensitive to copper concentrations that are toxic to rip1 mutant cells â isn't that the main evidence that the Rip1 pathway for copper resistance is mediated through mechanisms other than MymT or CtpV mediated copper efflux (or perhaps not due to efflux at all)? Or are the mymT and ctpV mutants still able to efflux copper? Here the logic for the epistasis test isn't clear â it would seem that if the Rip1 pathway for copper resistance is independent of the MymT/CtpV pathway, the main expectation of double mutants would be that there would be ultra-sensitivity, i.e. synergy or &quot;negative epistasis&quot;. It seems that there is a fairly potent synergistic effect of ctpV and csoR in combination with the rip1 mutation in Figure S3C, especially at medium [Cu] (2 and 3 logs). This is not evident with mymT.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, the data shows that the Cu resistance phenotype of the Rip1 strain is independent of MymT and CtpV. The confusion may arise because the MymT and CtpV mutants are not themselves sensitive to Cu, but this result is actually consistent with the published literature, which shows variable copper sensitivity in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains. For example, CDC1551 (more similar to Erdman than H37Rv) is 100 fold more resistant to Cu than H37Rv, and loss of <italic>mmcO</italic>, which confers severe sensitivity to Cu in H37Rv, has no phenotype in CDC1551 (PMID 24549843). With regard to epistasis, if the CtpV or MymT mutants are not sensitive to Cu, but the <italic>rip1</italic> mutant is, then it is not plausible that the phenotype of the Rip1 strain is due to MymT or CtpV dysfunction. If the CtpV or MymT mutants were indeed sensitive, then the predicted result would have been additive sensitivity, i.e. lack of epistasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the term &quot;copper handling&quot; is vague (line 116).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this wording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns that must be addressed:</p><p>1. In order for the authors to claim that NO and copper modulates the PtdaS/R/Rip1 signal transduction system via direct interaction with a thiol switch, they need to demonstrate a direct effect of copper or NO on the Cys residue. For example, evidence of S-nitrosylation, the covalent addition of NO moiety to the sulfur atom of Cys, would provide conclusive evidence of a thiol switch. Also, the authors have not demonstrated whether copper could modify the Cys resideu. Standard spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry or other assays (e.g., biotin switch) could demonstrate these modifications.</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies, our intention in using the term âthiol switchâ was not to imply that the PdtaS cysteine is directly modified by either Cu or NO, which we did not show, and we were unaware that the term âthiol switchâ implicitly indicates covalent modification. Our intended meaning was that the thiol (originally C53 but see below for our new data also implicating C57) is required for the NO and Cu inhibition of PdtaS kinase activity. The structural and biochemical mechanism of this thiol dependent inhibition will require further study, but our data does demonstrate that PdtaS lacking either thiol cannot be inhibited by NO or Cu. We have altered our terminology to eliminate the term âthiol switch.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, if the Cys residue plays a key role, why was not it identified in the suppressor screen?</p></disp-quote><p>There could be multiple explanations for this finding such as non-saturation of the screen, some maladaptive property of the Cysteine mutation in vivo that prevents its isolation, or the fact that both thiols seem to be involved in sensing and therefore a mutation that lies in proximity to both may uniquely disrupt their geometry in a way that is maximally suppressive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What about the 2nd Cys residue (C57)? In fact, other residues were identified strongly suggesting that Cys is not central to a thiol switch as other residues (e.g., V) are also involved. As indicated above, rephrasing these conclusions and removing the emphasis on copper should assist in addressing these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We agree that C57 is plausibly involved due to its proximity to C53 and to the suppressor mutation that was identified. To investigate this possibility, we purified PdtaS C57A and assayed this protein for kinase activity and inhibition by Cu and NO. We found that the C57A mutation did not modify the basal activity of the kinase but did confer resistance to inhibition by the NO (see revised Figure 3G and Figure 3-Figure Supplement 2). We were unable to assay this protein for Cu inhibition due to solubility problems in the assay with high Cu concentrations and therefore the role of this residue in Cu inhibition remains unresolved. Figure 7 has been updated to incorporate C57.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Did the authors consider that PdtaS may bind other cofactors (e.g. c/gAMP) or prosthetic groups such as heme? Although doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2011.11.012 reported that there is no evidence of a bound metabolite they did not comment on the presence of heme in the GAF domain and stated that the internal cavity is too small to bind heme in the PAS domain. Although not required, since the authors have purified PdtaS, a simple UV-vis scan will reveal whether this protein binds heme (potentially loosely as it was not identified in the crystal structure), which will provide a clear mechanism of responding to NO and potentially copper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question, which we have also considered. We are aware of reports that the PdtaS binds cyclic-di-GMP (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/615575v1.abstract) at the GAF domain of the sensor. The interaction of this metabolite with Cu and NO sensing documented here is an interesting subject for further study but beyond the scope of this study. It does suggest that PdtaS integrates multiple inputs and we have added this point to the discussion.</p><p>With regard to heme binding by PdtaS, we have performed UV-vis spectroscopy on our purified protein in comparison to BSA as a negative control and cytochrome C as a positive control. We see clear absorbance for CytC, but no signal for either BSA or PdtaS, suggesting that PdtaS does not contain heme, as previously reported.

In figure 6, the authors examined 4 mutants (some of them are double knockouts) in vivo, but no complementation experiments were performed. We understand the challenges and complexities involved in re-doing these time-consuming experiments however, genetic complementation is the standard in the field. Can the authors provide a compelling reason for the lack of complementation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that complementation is an essential genetic control. We have included complementation in Figure 6A,B for the Î<italic>nrp</italic> strain. For the Î<italic>rip1</italic> strain in figure 6C,D, the complemented strain has been previously reported in mice and is therefore not repeated here (although it is included in all in vitro assays, see all prior figures). For the <italic>rip1</italic>/<italic>pdtaR</italic> double mutant, we are interrogating reversion of the Rip1 in vivo phenotype by the PdtaR null mutation. The complementation control we assume the reviewer is asking about is testing is the animal phenotype of Î<italic>rip1</italic>Î<italic>pdtaR</italic>+<italic>pdtaR</italic> to show that the reversion we observe is due to the <italic>pdtaR</italic> mutation and not a spontaneous suppressor. We acknowledge that we have not done this infection due to the large number of strains, time, and expense, but note that this strain is included in every in vitro assay in Figure 2, alongside analogous complemented strains for the PdtaS suppressors. Both the PdtaS SNP, the Î<italic>pdtaS::hyg</italic> mutation, and the Î<italic>pdtaR::hyg</italic> mutation all share the same reversion phenotype, strongly arguing against a spontaneous mutation. In addition, in all assays in Figure 2, these suppressors are complemented, and, in all cases, the suppressor effect is reverted by complementation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Although the authors predict in lines 323-326 that the in vivo virulence defect conferred by loss of rip1 should be reversed in a rip1/pdtaR knockout, this is not entirely true. Although the authors attempt to explain this by separating the response during acute infection versus chronic infection, this is not entirely consistent with their prediction in lines 323 â 326 and the data points in figure 6C and D. This will become more evident if the authors provide the statistics for not only the wild-type and rip1 comparison, but also for the wild-type and rip1/pdtaR and wild-type and pdtaR comparisons. As it stands, it is incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if there was some display problem with the figure, since the statistics requested are mostly displayed on the figure. We have added additional statistics. We agree with the reviewer that the suppression of the Rip1 virulence phenotype is limited to early infection in the lung, but in this period the suppression is very strong, reversing the Rip1 CFU decrement by approximately 100 fold. The PdtaR single mutant has a virulence phenotype alone, although this was not our focus. However, this result indicates that the suppression of the Rip1 phenotype by PdtaR would not be expected to replicate WT titers since the Rip1 independent virulence function of PdtaR, which we do not define, is still defective in the Rip1 PdtaR double mutant. Indeed, there is a significant difference between WT and PdtaR and WT vs Rip1/PdtaR for this reason (see added stats in Figure 6). We do not believe the stage specific reversion of the Rip1 phenotype in the lung is a weakness; it shows that the signal transduction cascade we identify is only relevant in early infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lines 133-134. this conclusion is too strong â it seems that increased growth of an Mtb mutant in an iNOS knockout mouse does not establish that the gene is directly involved in defending against the antimicrobial effect of NO. Certainly this is consistent with the direct NO sensitivity of the mutant in culture, but there are many effects of NO during anti-TB immune responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this wording to accommodate this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 3. There is a bit of a disconnect between the gel in panel B and the quantification in panel F. Perhaps it is the pdf but while there is a noticeable decrease in the band intensity in the two-fold drop from 5 to 10 uM, but the 10-100 Î¼m bands all look the same to me (unlike the Zn inhibition data in Figure S5, which looks really good). Also, a -Cu control is missing â how was the % inhibition calculated without this?</p></disp-quote><p>The densitometric analysis of the band displayed in percentage inhibition dose response plots are mean of replicates while the image is representative of it.

That is mentioned in the Discussion section but it seems confusing in the results without any explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>See above. It was our expectation as well, but the data does not support this idea. In this case, the simplest model, one of copper chelation by copper binding, is not the correct model.

First, the expression of the PPE1-5' RNA is in the context of expression of the entire PPE1 gene. Thus, it is not clear that expression of PPE1-5' is sufficient to suppress the NO sensitivity phenotype of the Rip1 mutant. Can just the RNA be expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not yet been able to define the minimal PPE-5â element that can reproduce the restoration of NO resistance in vivo. The in vitro biochemistry showing that PdtaR binds directly to the PPE1 5â RNA uses the RNA (shown in Figure S6A) derived from the PPE1 5â peak, strengthening our assertion that this RNA is the functionally important element, but we have not yet been able to reproduce this effect in vivo and it will require further experimentation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
