We investigated their clinical significance and underlying mechanisms through linked clinical, clinicopathological and image analysis studies. Orange vessels and severe foveal whitening (clinical examination, n = 817, OR, 95% CI: 2.90, 1.96–4.30; 3.4, 1.8–6.3, both p&lt;0.001), and arteriolar involvement by intravascular filling defects (angiographic image analysis, n = 260, 2.81, 1.17–6.72, p&lt;0.02) were strongly associated with death. Orange vessels had dense sequestration of late stage parasitised red cells (histopathology, n = 29; sensitivity 0.97, specificity 0.89) involving 360° of the lumen circumference, with altered protein expression in blood-retinal barrier cells and marked loss/disruption of pericytes. Retinal whitening was topographically associated with tissue response to hypoxia. Severe neurovascular sequestration is visible at the bedside, and is a marker of severe disease useful for diagnosis and management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plasmodium falciparum cerebral malaria</kwd><kwd>sequestration</kwd><kwd>paediatric coma</kwd><kwd>neurovasculature</kwd><kwd>blood-retinal barrier</kwd><kwd>malarial retinopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#092668/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harding</surname><given-names>Simon Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000098</institution-id><institution>NIH Clinical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#5R01AI034969-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Terrie Ellen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#074125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molyneux</surname><given-names>Malcolm Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clinical, clinicopathological and image data from Malawian children shows that sequestration in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cerebral malaria is visible clinically in the eye as orange retinal vessels and is strongly associated with death.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Paediatric cerebral malaria (CM) is a frequently fatal complication of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria that disproportionately afflicts children in sub-Saharan Africa; the WHO Malaria Report estimated that malaria killed 429,000 people worldwide in 2016, about 70% of whom were African children under 5 years of age (World Malaria Report 2016). CM is clinically defined as peripheral parasitaemia with coma not directly attributable to convulsions, hypoglycaemia, meningitis or any other identifiable cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newton et al., 1998</xref>). This definition is broad and is likely to over-diagnose a significant proportion of cases.

Unlike in the brain, the degree and location of neurovascular abnormalities can be observed clinically in the retina using routinely available ophthalmological techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2006</xref>). Features comprise orange or white retinal vessels, patchy or confluent retinal whitening and white centred retinal haemorrhages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The incidence has fallen but is notoriously difficult to enumerate. Clearly, malaria is still causing significant numbers of deaths each year despite widespread use of artesunate-based combination therapies and moves to improve the early diagnosis of CM in district general hospitals (World Malaria Report 2016). New diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are being developed and tested. Our group has developed an automated algorithm platform for detection of MR from colour photographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We with other colleagues have previously reported descriptive pathological investigations of the features of MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lewallen et al., 2000</xref>), including clinical associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">White et al., 2009</xref>) and suggesting mechanisms. We have previously hypothesised that the orange vessels in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lewallen et al., 2000</xref>) and the intravascular material seen on fluorescein angiography may indicate sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beare et al., 2009</xref>), but definitive evidence is required. We have previously identified that retinal whitening is caused by capillary nonperfusion, but the relationship of this nonperfusion to sequestration is unclear.</p><p>We studied orange and white vessels and retinal whitening to understand sequestration and its effects on the retina, and to inform clinical management of CM. We addressed these complex questions in a large series of children with CM recruited over 15 years all of whom had retinal examinations (clinical dataset), and in two subgroups, one comprising children who died and from whom eyes were available for histopathology (clinicopathology dataset) and a second of children who underwent retinal angiography (image analysis dataset). Findings from other cohorts and subcohorts from our programme have been reported previously by our group, addressing other research questions. The further analysis of our clinical dataset is an extension of our previous association study, while all other analyses presented in this manuscript are new.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Correlation of vessel discolouration with disease outcome (clinical dataset)</title><p>We investigated the clinical significance of orange vessels seen in children admitted between 1999 and 2014 who had a retinal examination within 24 hr of admission and who were retinopathy-positive.

Orange and white microvessels (cases = 12, vessels = 212) were sampled using manual microdissection techniques (marked quadrant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and compared microscopically with clinically normal vessels (cases = 8, vessels = 200) in different retinal segments of the same case or from different specimens across Grade 1 and Grade 2 MR groups. All orange vessels exhibited pigmented pRBCs sequestered in layers on the endothelium at the margin of the vessel lumen, with a blood column consisting of uninfected RBCs in the centre of affected vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Our dataset of clinical outcomes, the largest to date, and our independently graded angiographic data show that this visible sequestration is strongly associated with death, with an increased risk when arterioles are involved. The tissue effects of sequestration are widespread within the neurovascular unit, including novel findings of severe loss/disruption of pericytes. Retinal whitening, also strongly associated with death, is associated with features of cytotoxic oedema, consistent with sequestration causing ischaemia.</p><p>We used three datasets to investigate if the features seen clinically in the retina represent sequestration, which is the principal underlying pathophysiological event in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria. Our data from 817 children point definitively to the importance of sequestration seen clinically as visible orange vessels, associated with a 2.71-fold increased odds of death. Our data add to previous work by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beare et al., 2004</xref>) but with greater confidence and with specific reference to orange vessels rather than all retinal vessel abnormalities.</p><p>The orange colour of the sequestered intravascular material appears to be a result of a mix of sequestered late-stage pRBCs (containing haemozoin) adherent to the endothelium, surrounding a central narrowed blood column consisting of uninfected RBCs. Our numbers of cases and controls are typical for this type of pathological study and the numbers of vessels sampled were high. Our findings add to those reported by some of us previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lewallen et al., 2000</xref>), which described dehaemoglobinised RBCs in sequestration, by adding new topographical clinicopathology data. We found that sequestration involving 360<bold>°</bold> of the circumference of the vessel lumen was strongly associated with the presence of orange discolouration clinically. We think orange vessels can be considered as an indication of severe sequestration and, as such, are clinically extremely valuable. This severe sequestration is easily visible with indirect ophthalmoscopy after pupil dilation. Less severe sequestration may be detectable with the newly available technology of hand-held optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina.</p><p>Retinal capillary involvement, in contrast to orange vessels, appears to be a phenomenon in CM not associated with death. Clinically, this is visible as white vessels and histologically predominantly as ruptured RBCs and extra-erythrocytic haemozoin, with no intact or non-parasitised RBCs. This feature was associated with non-perfusion on FA.</p><p>Our large fluorescein angiography (FA) study, which extended over eight seasons, shows that the retinal intravascular material was seen in nearly all MR-positive cases, especially the post-capillary and small venules (98.3% and 87.9% of gradeable vessels, respectively). These findings are novel, whereas our and others’ earlier data have been descriptive. The limitations of imaging in comatose young children mean that our grading method was unable to reliably identify capillaries, and so we were unable to robustly investigate the capillaries angiographically. We believe that capillary involvement is typical of pRBC sequestration in the neurovasculature. The presence of intravascular material in the arterioles was much less likely (pre-capillary 58.4%, small 43.9%, large 15.3%). However, arteriolar intravascular material was associated with longer recovery times (p&lt;0.01- &lt; 0.02) and greater risk of death, with involvement of the large arterioles conferring a 2.81-fold increased risk of death. It appears that the involvement of the arteriolar side can be taken as a clinical marker of severity, indicating a greater extent or load of sequestration. We have previously described the features of intraretinal material coining the term ‘intravascular filling defects’. This FA term can now be replaced by ‘retinal sequestration’.</p><p>We identified an association between sequestration and profound changes in the cells of the retinal neurovascular unit. These cells are critical to the preservation of BRB function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaur et al., 2008b</xref>) and the changes have important parallels in the brain, especially for swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seydel et al., 2015</xref>). Reduced expression of CD34 in endothelial cells and of SMA and PDGRFβ in pericytes indicates significant dysfunction of both cell types. Our pericyte data are novel; pericytes have not been extensively studied in malaria before, with only one study reporting pericyte vacuolation in adult fatal CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pongponratn et al., 2003</xref>). Reduction of SMA immunoreactivity may be related to two pathological mechanisms: vessel dilatation with altered pericyte function, or pericyte loss. PDGF-signalling is critical for the survival of endothelium in physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armulik et al., 2005</xref>). Pericytes are highly sensitive to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kamouchi et al., 2012</xref>), especially in brain and retina where they are most abundant, and when vessels lose or develop abnormal pericytes they become hyperdilated, show signs of vessel dysfunction, and haemorrhage may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergers and Song, 2005</xref>). Within the MR cases, we found more retinal vessels with abnormal pericyte staining in those cases presenting with retinal haemorrhages than those cases without. The retina and brain present similar pathological features in CM, including haemorrhages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greiner et al., 2015</xref>). We found the same significant loss of pericytic SMA and PDGFRβ in a further small analysis comparing brain microvessels in the presence of pRBC sequestration (median %, min-max% of vessels with SMA intact: 15%, 9–20%; PDGFRβ: 13%, 6–24%) with non-parasitaemic vessels (SMA intact: 92%, 79–100%; PDGFRβ: 96%, 91–100%) (p&lt;0.001 for all) (n = 5; Barrera V et al, unpublished). These data suggest that retina and brain may have similar dysfunction/loss of pericytes in fatal paediatric CM.</p><p>We also identified effects on astrocytes and Müller cells indicating wider effects on neural retinal cells than previously identified. Late reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hiscott et al., 1984</xref>) GFAP was upregulated, but the greater effect was seen for the early-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ortinski et al., 2010</xref>) perivascular ICAM-1 perhaps reflecting the short survival time of children with fatal CM. Our group has also previously identified upregulation of β-amyloid precursor protein as evidence of axonal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">White et al., 2009</xref>). These neuroglial effects of retinal sequestration are likely to be widespread and include disturbance of tight junction regulation causing BRB/BBB breakdown with vasogenic oedema, an implicated pathway for brain swelling and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohanty et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Retinal whitening is a key feature of MR. Our finding of whitening at the fovea conferring a 3.4-fold increased risk of death strengthens our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beare et al., 2004</xref>). We have previously shown that retinal whitening is topographically associated with capillary non-perfusion and is found in watershed zones of the retina, sites of high metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beare et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that tissue hypoxia is a principal pathogenic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">White et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our immunohistochemistry data provide further evidence that the inner retina is affected by tissue hypoxia and intracellular oedema. Ganglion cells showed increased expression of VEGFR1, which, in combination with VEGF, is neuroprotective during ischaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saint-Geniez et al., 2008</xref>). Glia in retinal zones where whitening is mainly localised were found to express AQP4, a water channel protein linked to hypoxic oncotic swelling. This observation is supported by our previous electrophysiologcal study, which showed abnormal B wave implicit time indicating inner retinal dysfuction in retinal whitening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lochhead et al., 2003</xref>). This all supports inner retinal neuronal ischaemia as opposed to dysfunction of the outer retinal photoreceptors and choroidal circulation. Further studies with the OCT may shed new light on the retinal whitening.</p><p>We have some conflicting evidence on the importance of capillary non-perfusion (CNP). There are undoubted tissue effects of sequestration-induced hypoxia in the vessel and extending into the neuroretina causing tissue swelling and opacification. However, the whitening seen in capillaries was not associated with death, and sequestration seen in the post-capillary venules on FA, a frequent association with CNP, showed a trend for survival. Sequestration in post-capillary venules is more common than arterioles, and this suggests these children as a group were not as critically ill as those with sequestration extending additionally into arterioles.</p><p>So how can our findings affect the clinic management and future research directions in CM? The detection of orange vessels on clinical examination has a high sensitivity and specificity for a severe degree of sequestration, which is associated with death. Sequestration detectable on FA in the arterioles, and especially the large arterioles, is also predictive of death and probably indicates a high parasite load. Orange vessels can be seen clinically with the indirect and direct ophthalmoscope through a dilated pupil by a trained physician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>), but these skills are mainly available in research or tertiary centres in malaria endemic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swamy et al., 2018</xref>). We have with others recently developed MR detection algorithms offering a potential automated diagnostic tool for severe malaria in district hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>). Our new clinical markers of severe disease and poor outcome (visible orange vessels and arteriolar involvement indicating severe sequestration, and severe foveal whitening) should be a focus for diagnosis and management. It should be recognised that including children without MR in clinical trials is likely to reduce their power to detect an effect of an intervention on CM outcomes.</p><p>There is good evidence that the clinicopathological features of CM in the retina parallel those seen in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacCormick et al., 2014</xref>): ring-shaped haemorrhages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">White et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorovini-Zis et al., 2011</xref>), pathology of sequestration, associations between retinal features and that key neurological pathways seem to be non-functioning ('pathways to neural cell death'). Mendis K and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendis et al., 2009</xref>) have argued that the long-term goal of eliminating malaria remains dependent on continuing research and the development of new drugs and therapeutic strategies to sustain control programmes. Better identification and treatment of severe malaria will also be needed. Our findings from manual and semiautomated image analysis provide an indication that quantification of the load of retinal sequestration is promising as a useful metric in clinical trials and merits further development to identify a severity cut-off.</p><p>The results we have presented in this paper from our long-term programme of research strongly support the concept that sequestration can be identified clinically in the retina at the bedside, and offer important new insights into the widespread effects of sequestration on the neural microvasculature and cells of the neurovascular unit. This sequestration can be seen in clinical practice at a critical time in the management of the comatose child in malaria endemic areas offering opportunities to study the effects of new therapies, as well as an early concrete diagnosis and a marker of severe disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32208.026</object-id><label>Key resources table</label><caption><title>Antibodies used for immunohistochemistry analysis of the clinicopathology dataset</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Antigen</th><th valign="top">Specificity</th><th valign="top">MR feature</th><th valign="top">Manufacturer <break/>(clone);

Specimens were obtained from the archive with: a full clinical eye examination performed during life, available severity grading of specific MR features, a clinical diagnosis of CM (see above) and evidence of valid consent (see below). Key pathology methods are given here, with further details available in Appendix 1.</p><p>Cases were allocated to three severity groups shown previously to reflect maturation stage and pigmentation of sequestered pRBC in the retinal capillaries and venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2015</xref>):</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Grade 0 - pRBC sequestration 0–20% of retinal microvessels post mortem (and no extra-erythrocytic HZ deposition in retinal vessels), which also represents the cut-off value in the brain to confirm CM as the cause of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade 1 - pRBC sequestration in 20–60% of retinal microvessels and extra-erythrocytic HZ in ≤15% of retinal vessels</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade 2 - severe pRBC sequestration (&gt;60% of retinal microvessels) and &gt;15% contain extra-erythrocytic HZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2015</xref>)</p></list-item></list><p>Eye specimens were anonymised, coded and, after fixation in 10% v/v neutral buffered formalin, processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">White et al., 2009</xref>). Specimens were opened either horizontally in the pupil-optic nerve (PO) plane, or vertically. Retinal pathological features, such as orange/white vessel discoloration and intravascular material, were photographed and sampled using punch biopsies before wax embedding. Classification of the retinal zones used to compare levels of histological markers with severity of MR features detected during grading is described in Appendix 2.</p><p>All histopathological observations were performed masked to MR status. Up to 100 sequential sections were cut for each specimen and stained for H&amp;E, Martius-Scarlet-Blue or immunohistochemistry. For detection of parasitic stage and elements in retinal vasculature, H&amp;E stained sections were assessed for presence of pRBCs, and intra- and extra-erythrocytic HZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2015</xref>). Percentages of capillaries and venules parasitised were calculated per MR grade (means ±SD reported): 6 ± 5% (grade 0); 54 ± 12% (grade 1); 87 ± 16% (grade 2).</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) immunostaining were quantified by retinal layer, using a densitometry-based automated analysis method on eight randomly selected fields per section (see Appendix 1). For the vascular-related antigen markers (see Key Resources Table), the numbers of immunoreactive retinal vessels or segments were counted manually by one of the authors (VB) and at least one second independent observer (TF, SM or DG, see Acknowledgments). At least 100 capillaries and venules were analysed in each case and an inter-observer error count of less than 10% considered acceptable, otherwise a third observer assessed the case.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Image analysis dataset</title><p>Children deemed by the admitting paediatrician to be sufficiently stabilised clinically underwent colour photography and FA following previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beare et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beare et al., 2009</xref>). Subjects were excluded if their guardians withdrew consent, if their clinical condition was deteriorating or rapidly improving to normal consciousness, or if the ophthalmologist was not available. A trained ophthalmologist graded the FA images against previously published protocols developed by the Liverpool Ophthalmic Reading Centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">MacCormick et al., 2015</xref>). Classification of retinal zones is described in Appendix 2 and used standardised validation procedures. The following were included: presence/absence, extent and distribution of whitening, vessel discolouration (divided into orange and white vessels as per analysis), haemorrhages and papilloedema. An automated segmentation algorithm was developed (method described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>]) to identify vessels with IVFD, applied to the macular image with best field definition and clarity from one eye of each case and analysed by proportion of vessel affected by IVFD/proportion not affected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>Relationships between clinical dichotomous outcome and studied variables was first analysed using simple logistic regression. To test for confounding, a multivariable logistic regression model was fitted within the clinical dataset, adjusting for variables significant at p&lt;0.01 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and including age. We did not include variables not fulfilling those described by Greenland et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greenland et al., 1999</xref>): coma score (part of the causal pathway to death) and retinal haemorrhages (orange vessels can evolve to haemorrhages because of sequestration affecting vessel stability). Potential bias because of missing data was investigated by comparison between subjects examined and not examined. Coma recovery time was truncated at zero and highly skewed with over dispersion, and so we used truncated negative binomial regression to estimate unadjusted associations with this outcome. Clinicopathological correlation analyses used data from the last clinical examination before death and one eye per subject. After quantitative evaluations were completed, specimen codes were broken and results compared with the clinical data. Continuous scale data were assessed for normal distribution with the Shapiro-Wilk test. When normality was satisfied, one-way ANOVA (with Bonferroni post-hoc correction) was used to compare continuous scale data across MR severity groups, or retinal layers. Spearman correlation (with significance at p&lt;0.01) was used to correlate a continuous scale variable with severity grades for macular and peripheral whitening. Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables (e.g. ICAM-1 or GFAP perivascular staining, discoloration presence/absence) and p values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant after adjustment where appropriate for multiple comparisons. SPSS Statistics 22 was used throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data availability</title><p>The anonymised datasets for this study – clinicopathology dataset (author: Valentina Barrera), clinical dataset (author: Ian MacCormick) and FA dataset (authors: Ian MacCormick and Yalin Zheng) – are stored at the University of Liverpool Research Data Management Archive (datasets archive created on 20/02/2018).

The dataset is large, complex and unique and has been added to over 15 years to address complex questions as they have emerged. In the case of the work presented in this publication we set out to understand sequestration and its relationship to clinically identifiable features on ophthalmoscopy. The focus on ophthalmoscopy is important because it opens up opportunities to improve clinical management of comatose children with advanced CM.</p><p>Our previous work on vessel changes and whitening has described the clinical appearance but not established the aetiology. In Beare et al., 2004 we gave descriptive data and uni- and multivariate analyses of 278 clinical examinations performed between 1999 and 2003. We identified “vessel changes” and retinal whitening as associated with death (OR: 2.4, 2.0 respectively). In the publication under review now we extended our previous analysis of 5 years’ clinical data to 15 years to confirm the clinical importance of specific features of MR and identified orange vessels and foveal whitening as important predictors of death. We used these findings to design our clinicopathological study.</p><p>The histological data presented in this manuscript is presented for the first time. We, with others, have published four previous papers on the retinal histopathology of CM. Lewallen et al. (2000) (n=6) and White et al. (2009) (n=64) reported descriptive and correlation data from a different cohort from the same autopsy study, describing sequestration in retinal vessels and identifying a relationship with death from CM. Some of the cases in the White 2009 dataset were used in constructing a new dataset for the novel topographical clinicopathology study that we present in this manuscript. Our previous paper from this new cohort of cases (Barrera et al., 2015) reported differential sequestration rates in different ocular tissues. The paper from Griener et al studied brain-retina correlations in haemorrhage, ganglion cell axons and barrier integrity. All these studies reported sequestration in retinal vessels but without clinicopathological or topographical correlation. The clinical relevance of the features visible on clinical examination has not been well established.</p><p>In Beare et al., 2009 we gave descriptive data on the images from fluorescein angiography of 34 cases in the 2006 season. We described the intravascular material but its cause and significance remained unknown. Since then we have recruited a further 226 children to create our image analysis dataset allowing association studies that have not been feasible previously and data from semiautomated image analysis that is novel.</p><p>We have reviewed the descriptions of the datasets and have restructured the final paragraph in the Introduction and the first paragraph in the Materials and methods section. We have taken the opportunity to try to improve the clarity of the dataset descriptors and the study design.</p><p>Introduction: “We with other colleagues have previously reported descriptive pathological investigations of the features of MR (Lewallen et al., 2000) including clinical associations (White et al., 2009) and suggesting mechanisms. […] The further analysis of our clinical dataset is an extension of our previous association study while all other analyses presented in this manuscript are new”.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>Study design and setting</p><p>“A research programme based in Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) and the College of Medicine in Blantyre, Malawi since 1996 provided the setting for the study. A prospective cohort of children (clinical dataset) was recruited between 1999 and 2014. A subcohort was selected for ocular histopathology (clinicopathology dataset, 1999 – 2011)and a second recruited for retinal photography (image analysis dataset, 2006-2014)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Retinal findings and associated conclusions regarding these findings require additional consideration and analyses, including multivariant analyses, correlation with brain findings (imaging/tissue markers), impact on clinical diagnostic criteria, and further identification and assessment of additional relevant variables/confounders.</p></disp-quote><p>Our team has carefully considered these important comments as suggested and give our responses below. We have conducted multivariable analyses, and some additional experiments to add further insight into correlation with brain histopathology for our new findings on tissue effects of sequestration.</p><p>Multivariant analyses and confounders:</p><p>We performed multivariable analyses of the clinical dataset. We reviewed potential confounders which showed a significant univariate association with death at the level of p&lt;0.01 (see Table 1 unadjusted associations) and where they do in our view fulfill the confounder criteria described by Greenland, Pearl and Robins, 1999. We did not include two variables that we believe do not meet Greenland’s criteria: coma score (part of the causal pathway to death) and retinal haemorrhages (orange vessels can evolve to haemorrhages due to sequestration affecting vessel stability). We included white cell count, lactate, HRP2, papilloedema as potential confounders. We also included age as it has been previously identified as a potential confounder in other paediatric CM studies.</p><p>We ran two separate regression analyses of outcome=death for the two ophthalmoscopic features of MR that are the focus of our study, as mentioned in the Introduction: orange vessels and foveal whitening. Both of the variables remained significant (p&lt;0.01) and odds ratios were similar.</p><p>Both analyses add further evidence of the association of orange vessels and foveal whitening with death. Both analyses reported above were run on data from the worse eye, but significance did not change when two eyes were assessed separately (not shown). We have added brief statements on these results, and related methodology, in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Results: “The presence of visible orange vessels on ophthalmoscopy (Figure 1C-D) was significantly associated with death (OR 2.90, 1.96-4.30, p&lt;0.001) as was severe foveal whitening (&gt;2/3 foveal area; OR 3.40, 1.80-6.30, p&lt;0.001 in simple logistic regression – see Table 1). When including potential confounders (age, WCC, HRP2, lactate, papilloedema (see Materials and methods)) in a multivariable regression model for the presence of the two retinal features for death, we found similar ORs and significance (orange vessels: OR 2.85, 1.72-4.74, p&lt;0.001, n=549; foveal whitening: OR 3.57, 1.57-8.13, p=0.002, n=615).”</p><p>Materials and methods: “Relationships between clinical dichotomous outcome and studied variables was first analysed using simple logistic regression. […] We did not include variables not fulfilling the confounder criteria described by Greenland et al. (Greenland, Pearl and Robins, 1999): coma score (part of the causal pathway to death) and retinal haemorrhages (orange vessels can evolve to haemorrhages due to sequestration affecting vessel stability)”.</p><p>Correlation with brain findings:</p><p>We acknowledge the importance of comparing retinal and brain findings. This paper is focused on the retina and we believe that adding in analyses on brain imaging and tissue markers will greatly lengthen the paper. However we have used this opportunity to review the discussion on the retina/brain correlates undertaken some additional brain histology to extend our new findings in the retina on pericytes.</p><p>We have added in data on pericyte markers (SMA and PDGFRβ) in cerebral cortex sections from 5 cases with or without MR positive CM. The cases were from the patient cohort included in our manuscript, thus data corresponding to retinal staining are available. A minimum of 50 parasitised and non-parasitised microvessels were counted per case, by 2 independent observers (VB and LHC). In these brain samples, we found a significant reduction of normal pericytic SMA and PDGFRβ staining, in the presence of pRBC sequestration (median% , min-max% of vessels with SMA intact: 15%, 9-20%; PDGFRβ: 13%, 6-24%), compared to non-parasitemic vessels (SMA intact: 92%, 79-100%; PDGFRβ: 96%, 91-100%) (p&lt;0.001 for all). These proportions are very similar to those observed in MR positive and MR negative cases. This suggests that retina and brain present a similar dysfunction/loss of pericytes in fatal paediatric CM.</p><p>Discussion: “Pericytes are highly sensitive to hypoxia (Kamouchi et al., 2012), especially in brain and retina where they are most abundant, and when vessels lose or develop abnormal pericytes they become hyperdilated, show signs of vessel dysfunction and may haemorrhage (Bergers and Song, 2005). […] These data suggest that retina and brain present a similar dysfunction/loss of pericytes in fatal paediatric CM”.</p><p>Impact on clinical diagnostic criteria:</p><p>We considered again the impact of our findings on the clinical criteria used in the diagnosis of CM. The focus of our publication is not on the primary diagnosis of CM but on the previous uncertainty of the role of sequestration in the features of malarial retinopathy, as well as the identification of those comatose children who can progress to advanced and fatal CM. The identification that orange material is sequestration adds strength to the importance of the previously poorly understood “vessel changes” in making the diagnosis. The separation from white vessels may also prove helpful. However our study presents some limitations as the studied cohort does not include comatose children without CM. We have added some emphasis to paragraph eleven of the Discussion.</p><p>Discussion: “Our new clinical markers of severe disease and poor outcome (visible orange vessels and arteriolar involvement indicating severe sequestration, and severe foveal whitening) should be a focus for diagnosis and management”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In general, the manuscript comes across a bit overwhelming in the breadth of information provided and is difficult to follow as a cohesive narrative. Further clarity on what populations were used for what analyses (and again if this is new or an expansion of previously published data) is needed as well as improvements on how all the findings presented diverge into a common narrative at the conclusion of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognise that the content of our manuscript is extensive. As stated in our covering letter we decided to study 3 datasets from our longstanding research programme designed to provide sufficiently new and definitive evidence in response to the comments from our submission of the histopathological data in 2015. We have tried to offset the large amount of data by concentrating only on sequestration and its tissue effects. We have addressed and clarified the populations studied in our response to point 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
