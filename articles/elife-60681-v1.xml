roles in silencing repetitive elements to promote fertility in metazoans. Studies in worms, flies, and mammals reveal that piRNAs are expressed in a sex-specific manner. However, the mechanisms underlying this sex-specific regulation are unknown. Here we identify SNPC-1.3, a male germline-enriched variant of a conserved subunit of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex, as a male-specific piRNA transcription factor in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. SNPC-1.3 colocalizes with the core piRNA transcription factor, SNPC-4, in nuclear foci of the male germline. Binding of SNPC-1.3 at male piRNA loci drives spermatogenic piRNA transcription and requires SNPC-4. Loss of <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> leads to depletion of male piRNAs and defects in male-dependent fertility. Furthermore, TRA-1, a master regulator of sex determination, binds to the <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> promoter and represses its expression during oogenesis. Loss of TRA-1 targeting causes ectopic expression of <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> and male piRNAs during oogenesis. Thus, sexually dimorphic regulation of <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> expression coordinates male and female piRNA expression during germline development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>piRNA</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>sex determination</kwd><kwd>germline development</kwd><kwd>TRA-1</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1746891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tay</surname><given-names>Rebecca J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM130272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Suhua</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>Steven E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM119775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montgomery</surname><given-names>Brooke E</given-names></name><name><surname>Montgomery</surname><given-names>Taiowa A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM12301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Charlotte P</given-names></name><name><surname>Tay</surname><given-names>Rebecca J</given-names></name><name><surname>Starostik</surname><given-names>Margaret R</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Emily</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammonds</surname><given-names>Maya A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>John K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM118875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Charlotte P</given-names></name><name><surname>Tay</surname><given-names>Rebecca J</given-names></name><name><surname>Starostik</surname><given-names>Margaret R</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Emily</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammonds</surname><given-names>Maya A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>John K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moresco</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yates III</surname><given-names>John R</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value> <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> specifies male piRNA transcription and is regulated by the sex determination pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a distinct class of small noncoding RNAs, function to preserve germline integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batista et al., 2008</xref>;

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutation of any of the three Piwi genes (<italic>piwi</italic>, <italic>aub</italic>, <italic>ago3</italic>) results in rampant activation of transposons in the germline and severe defects in fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harris and Macdonald, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lin and Spradling, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vagin et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, mutation of the Piwi protein MIWI leads to the misregulation of genes involved in germ cell development, defective gametogenesis, and sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Deng and Lin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> piRNAs can be inherited across multiple generations and trigger the transgenerational silencing of foreign elements such as transgenes. Disruption of this inheritance results in eventual germline collapse and sterility, known as the germline mortal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, piRNAs are essential to preserve germline integrity and ensure the reproductive capacity in metazoans.</p><p>Loss of the piRNA pathway can have distinct consequences between the sexes and across developmental stages. Many species show sex-specific expression of piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armisen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Demonstrated by hybrid dysgenesis, the identity of maternal, but not paternal, piRNAs in flies is important for fertility of progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brennecke et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the piRNA pathway in mammals appears to be dispensable for female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carmell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murchison et al., 2007</xref>), but distinct subsets of piRNAs are required for specific stages of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carmell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Di Giacomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gainetdinov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Girard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grivna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuramochi-Miyagawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In worms, most piRNAs are uniquely enriched in either the male or female germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kato et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, in all of these contexts, how the specific expression of different piRNA subclasses is achieved is poorly understood.</p><p>piRNA biogenesis is strikingly diverse across organisms and tissue types. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline, piRNA clusters are found within pericentromeric or telomeric heterochromatin enriched for H3K9me3 histone modifications. The HP1 homolog Rhino binds to H3K9me3 within most of these piRNA clusters and recruits Moonshiner, a paralog of the basal transcription factor TFIIA, which, in turn, recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to enable transcription within heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klattenhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pane et al., 2011</xref>). Two waves of piRNA expression occur in mouse testes: pre-pachytene piRNAs are expressed in early spermatogenesis and silence transposons, whereas pachytene piRNAs are expressed in the later stages of meiosis and have unknown functions. While the mechanisms of pre-pachytene piRNA transcription remain elusive, pachytene piRNAs require the transcription factor A-MYB, along with RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, SNPC-4 is essential for the expression of piRNAs in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasper et al., 2014</xref>). SNPC-4 is the single <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of mammalian SNAPC4, the largest DNA binding subunit of the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) activating protein complex (SNAPc). A complex of SNAPC4, SNAPC1, and SNAPC3 binds to the proximal sequence element (PSE) of snRNA loci to promote their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henry et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jawdekar and Henry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ma and Hernandez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Su et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yoon et al., 1995</xref>). SNPC-4 occupies transcription start sites of other classes of noncoding RNAs across various <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissue types and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weng et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, piRNA biogenesis factors PRDE-1, TOFU-4, and TOFU-5 are expressed in germ cell nuclei and interact with SNPC-4 at clusters of piRNA loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weng et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that SNPC-4 has been co-opted by germline-specific factors to transcribe piRNAs.</p><p>The vast majority of the ~15,000 piRNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are encoded within two large megabase genomic clusters on chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Das et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruby et al., 2006</xref>). Each piRNA locus encodes a discrete transcriptional unit that is individually transcribed as a short precursor by Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cecere et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billi et al., 2013</xref>). Processing of precursors yields mature piRNAs that are typically 21 nucleotides (nt) in length and strongly enriched for a 5′ uracil (referred to as 21U-RNAs). Transcription of these piRNAs requires a conserved eight nt core motif (NNGTTTCA) within their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cecere et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruby et al., 2006</xref>). piRNAs enriched during spermatogenesis are associated with a cytosine at the 5′ most position of the core motif (<underline>C</underline>NGTTTCA); mutation of cytosine to adenine at this position results in ectopic expression of normally male-enriched piRNAs during oogenesis. In contrast, genomic loci expressing piRNAs enriched in the female germline show no discernable nucleotide bias at the 5′ position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billi et al., 2013</xref>). While differences in cis-regulatory sequences contribute to the sexually dimorphic nature of piRNA expression, sex-specific piRNA transcription factors that drive distinct subsets of piRNAs in the male and female germlines remain to be identified.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that SNPC-1.3, an ortholog of human SNAPC1, is required specifically for male piRNA expression. Furthermore, TRA-1, a master regulator of sex determination, transcriptionally represses <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> during oogenesis to restrict its expression to the male germline. Taken together, our study reports the first example of a sex-specific piRNA transcription factor that drives the expression of male-specific piRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SNPC-4 is a component of the core piRNA transcription complex that drives all piRNA expression</title><p>SNPC-4-specific foci are present in both male and female germ cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasper et al., 2014</xref>), but the role of SNPC-4 in the male germline is not well understood.

After meiotic differentiation in the male germline, male spermatids are induced by ejaculation and undergo spermiogenesis, a process that converts immature spermatids to motile sperm with a functioning pseudopod. Spermiogenesis can be induced in vitro by isolating spermatids directly from males and treating them with pronase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shakes and Ward, 1989</xref>). Males lacking <italic>prg-1</italic> still generate differentiated spermatids, but rarely produce normal pseudopodia upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Reinke, 2008</xref>). Similar to <italic>prg-1(-)</italic> mutants, <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> spermatids were rarely able to form normal pseudopodia. In contrast, <italic>snpc-1.3 (3xtbs)</italic> sperm formed normal pseudopodia at a frequency similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). In addition, many of the <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> spermatids resembled sperm undergoing intermediate stages of spermiogenesis. Spermiogenesis, in vivo, starts off with spherical spermatids that enter into an intermediate stage characterized by the growth of spiky protrusions. This stage is then followed by fusion of the spiky protrusions into a motile pseudopod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To understand the dynamics of <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> sperm progression through spermiogenesis, we treated spermatids with pronase and observed each activated spermatid over time. Wild-type spermatids spent an average of 6.2 min ± 4.5 min in the intermediate state before polarization and pseudopod development. In contrast, <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> spermatids occupied the intermediate state for a significantly shorter period of time (2.9 min ± 3.7 min, p&lt;0.05; Student’s t-test) before forming pseudopods. By tracking each individual spermatid across spermiogenesis, we found most <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> spermatids were unable to sustain pseudopod growth. While wild-type spermatids exhibited pseudopod growth and motility for an average of 24 min ± 10.35 min, <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> spermatids sustained growth for a significantly shorter period of time (7.3 min ± 5.7 min, p&lt;0.05; Student’s t-test) before becoming immotile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

SNPC-1.3 interacts with SNPC-4 in foci in male germ cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and, by preferentially binding male piRNA promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), is critical for their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). SNPC-1.3 expression, reflecting the developmental profile of male piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), is highest during spermatogenesis.

However, loss of <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> also results in increased female piRNA expression during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), whereas ectopic overexpression of <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> during oogenesis leads to decreased female piRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that transcription of male and female piRNAs is not completely separable from each other and that the balance in expression of the two piRNA subclasses may be dictated by the allocation of shared core transcription factors such as SNPC-4.</p><p>Similar to multiple gene classes activated by general transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Levine et al., 2014</xref>), we speculate that male and female promoters compete for access to a limited pool of the core transcription complex, which includes SNPC-4, PRDE-1, TOFU-4, and TOFU-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, we propose a model in which the expression and binding of SNPC-1.3 to core piRNA factors serves to ‘sequester’ the core complex away from female promoters. Mechanistically, we posit that the core piRNA transcription complex is specified to female promoters, and that only upon association with SNPC-1.3 is the core machinery directed to male promoters. We predict that when SNPC-1.3 is absent, more SNPC-4 and other previously identified cofactors are available to transcribe female piRNAs. Conversely, overexpression of SNPC-1.3 leads to the disproportionate recruitment of the core machinery to male promoters, leading to the indirect downregulation of female piRNAs. By controlling male piRNA expression, SNPC-1.3 is crucial for maintaining the balance between male and female piRNA levels across development.</p><p>While the default specification of the core complex to female promoters presents perhaps the most parsimonious explanation underlying male and female piRNA expression, we cannot exclude the possibility that an additional female-specific <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor may direct the core piRNA complex to female promoters. If true, we speculate that the developmental expression of such a factor (low during spermatogenesis and high during oogenesis), coupled with the developmental expression of SNPC-1.3, would coordinate the differential expression of male and female piRNAs. During spermatogenesis, SNPC-1.3 is more highly expressed such that the core machinery would primarily be directed to male promoters. In contrast, during oogenesis, SNPC-1.3 expression is low, concomitant with elevated expression of a female factor to license transcription of female piRNAs. This model, where both factors are present during both spermatogenesis and oogenesis, but in different ratios, would also be consistent with our piRNA expression analysis in <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> loss-of-function and overexpression mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The piRNA pathway co-opts snRNA biogenesis machinery</title><p>Our work adds to a growing body of evidence that snRNA machinery has been hijacked at multiple stages in <italic>C. elegans</italic> piRNA biogenesis, including transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weng et al., 2019</xref>) and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beltran et al., 2019</xref>). Investigating potential parallels between snRNA and piRNA biogenesis may provide useful clues into the role of SNPC-1.3 in the piRNA complex.</p><p>The minimal snRNA SNAP complex consists of a 1:1:1 heterotrimer of the subunits SNAPC4, SNAPC1, and SNAPC3 in humans and SNAP190, SNAP43, and SNAP50 in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Henry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hung and Stumph, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ma and Hernandez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mittal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In vitro studies have shown that the trimer must assemble before the complex is able to bind DNA. Similarly, our data show SNPC-1.3 requires SNPC-4 to bind at the piRNA clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), although we cannot formally rule out that loss of SNPC-4 only affects the stability of SNPC-1.3, rather than directly recruiting SNPC-1.3 to piRNA promoters. We speculate the piRNA complex is assembled in a similar fashion to the snRNA complex. Based on this model, we expect that SNPC-4 binding at male piRNA loci is abolished in a <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> mutant. However, conclusive evidence that SNPC-4 binding at male piRNA promoters requires SNPC-1.3 is still lacking. Due to the highly clustered nature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> piRNAs, we anticipate that detecting differences in SNPC-4 binding between male and female piRNAs in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants may not be possible with traditional ChIP-seq methods, and may require application of higher resolution techniques.</p><p>Given that piRNAs have co-opted <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors from snRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasper et al., 2014</xref>), it would not be surprising if piRNAs also co-evolved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for transcription factor binding from snRNA loci. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beltran et al., 2019</xref> identified similarity between the 3′ end of PSEs of snRNA promoters and the eight nt piRNA core motif in nematodes. In addition, Pol II and Pol III transcription from snRNA promoters share a common PSE, but are distinguished by the presence of other unique motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hung and Stumph, 2011</xref>). Correspondingly, the canonical Type I and less abundant Type II piRNAs can be discriminated by the presence or absence of the eight nt core motif, respectively. Factors such as TOFU-4 and TOFU-5 function in both Type I and II piRNA expression, whereas PRDE-1 is only required for Type I piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weng et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these observations highlight the importance of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in specifying the expression of snRNAs and piRNA classes. In addition to enrichment of cytosine at the 5′ position in the male core motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billi et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesize that as-yet unidentified motifs may further discriminate male from female piRNA promoters. While we observed SNPC-1.3 binding to be enriched upstream of male piRNA loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we cannot definitively conclude that SNPC-1.3 binds to the male-specific core motif, given the limitations of conventional ChIP-seq in resolving the SNPC-1.3 footprint.

Together, these findings suggest that worm piRNAs function in capacities distinct from canonical transposon silencing. While a recent methodology used crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of piRNA:target hybrids (CLASH) to determine that female piRNAs engage with almost every germline transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2018</xref>), how female piRNAs select their targets has yet to be examined. Like piRNAs characterized in the female germline, male piRNAs may be interfacing with a broad range of targets to regulate gene expression for proper spermatogenesis.

This may explain the decrease in fertility we observed in multiple TRA-1 binding site mutant hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

transcription factor that drives male piRNA expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Kennedy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary and Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers and editors think that, in principle, this manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. It provides intriguing novel insights into the regulation of piRNA expression and its sexually dimorphic nature, implicating an intriguing novel player in this regulatory phenomenon. However, there was also general consensus about the need for a number of revisions. They follow essentially into two parts:</p><p>1) The only necessary experimental revision that is required to bolster claims made in the manuscript relates to the demonstration of the specificity of SNPC-1.3 expression. You will see the criticism of the current approach detailed below (particularly by reviewer #1) and the request to use available reagents (epitope tagged alleles) to attempt in situ staining. smFISH is another option. Reviewer #4, a sperm expert, was pulled into the review process late, in order to corroborate the feasibility of these studies. In further discussion among the reviewers, reviewer #4 further states: &quot;I think the question is male germline specificity of SNPC-1.3 rather than &quot;sperm specificity&quot;. Sperm do not express any genes but the sperm producing germline does. Presumably, males will continually express snpc-1.3 while hermaphrodites will only express around L4. You can do antibody staining on whole worms or dissected gonads. You would expect expression in the germline of males but not in the germline of adult hermaphrodites.&quot; We hope these comments are helpful.</p><p>2) The other set of revisions all deal with further data analysis and textual revisions/explanations. Reviewer #2 has the most extensive comments here and they all seem reasonable to address and require no further experimentation. All other reviewers have additional requests for editorial changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript submitted by Choi et al. entitled, &quot;SNPC-1.3 is a sex-specific transcription factor that drives male piRNA expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; describes the identification of a novel sex-specific transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of Piwi interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in a sexually dimorphic manner. The authors do an excellent job of combining biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches to support their conclusions. While a few questions remain, overall, the findings of the manuscript represent a significant advance in the field, and therefore, warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A major point of the manuscript is that a seemingly generic transcriptional complex fulfils sperm-specific functions, via the sperm-expression of a specific subunit of the complex, SNPC-1.3. However, sperm-specificity of SNPC-1.3 is not satisfactorily shown. Only a single, non-quantified, Western Blot of whole animals is shown and the reader is asked to believe that the reduction in intensity of band(s) at specific stages/in specific mutant background(s) indicates sperm-specificity. Apart from a failure of proper quantification, this is not enough. The authors have engineered two different epitope tags into the SNPC-1.3 locus and this should enable in situ antibody staining of whole animals. This should conclusively show the sperm-specificity of expression (not only sperm vs. oocyte, but also no expression in somatic tissues). Previous studies have shown the feasibility of antibody staining of sperm-expressed proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Kim and colleagues have identified a Transcription Factor (TF), SNPC-1.3, specifically expressed during spermatogenesis in the hermaphroditic gonad of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that drives the expression of male piRNAs. SNPC-1.3 forms a specific complex with the known piRNA TF SNPC-4 during spermatogenesis. Indeed, animals lacking SNPC-1.3 specifically lose the expression of male piRNAs, even though they acquire some expression of female piRNAs. Moreover, they have identified another TF, TRA-1, which restricts the expression of SNPC-1.3 exclusively during spermatogenesis. TRA-1 is expressed during oogenesis and binds the snpc-1.3 promoter to silence the expression of SNPC-1.3 during oogenesis. Thus, mutation of the binding sites of TRA-1 leads to ectopic expression of male piRNAs during spermatogenesis. Finally, snpc-1.3 mutation leads to spermatogenesis defects and loss of fertility similarly to piRNA mutants, suggesting a role for male piRNAs in spermatogenesis. Overall the experiments are well done and executed with appropriate controls. Even though the function of these male and female piRNAs are still uncharacterized, the study is certainly of general interests given the fact that is currently unknown how the transcription of male and/or female piRNAs are specifically achieved. The manuscript is well written, and the data are well presented, although some additional controls, experiments, and edits might help to solidify their findings. My only major concerns regard the specificity of binding and action of SNPC-1.3 for male-specific piRNAs. Given that mutation of sncp-1.3 affects both male and female piRNAs during spermatogenesis and there are not clear evidences of binding by ChIP of SNCP-1.3 on male piRNA promoters vs. the other piRNAs, it remains unclear from the present data how SNPC-1.3 drives the exclusive expression of male piRNAs, and how SNPC-1.3 cooperates with SNPC-4 to specifically bind the promoters of male piRNAs and not female piRNAs. The localization of SNPC-1.3, SNPC-4, and TRA-1 in hermaphrodite and male germlines might help to elucidate their temporal and sex-specific functions together with the specific binding of male piRNA consensus sequence. Below I have listed the specific comments that the authors should address in order that the paper may be considered for publication on <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) As I mention above, it remains unclear how SNPC-3.1 specifically binds the promoter of male piRNAs. The authors should evaluate whether the ChIP-seq signal is enriched around the consensus motif of male piRNAs and not the female (or neutral NE) piRNAs. Also, it is not clear how SNPC-1.3 provides the specificity to SNPC-4 in transcribing only male piRNAs. For instance, they have mentioned in the Discussion that SNPC-4 can still bind piRNA loci in absence of SNPC-1.3 (the authors should also provide such data, see other points). Moreover, in the Discussion they mentioned that they &quot;cannot definitively conclude that SNPC-1.3 binds to the male-specific core motif, given the limitations of conventional ChIP-seq in resolving the SNPC-1.3 footprint. Identifying the factors that specifically bind the 8 nt core motif and other potential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements important for sex-biased piRNA expression will require further investigation&quot;. I think the authors can at least assess whether SNPC-1.3 binds the male consensus motif and not the female one in vitro by EMSA.</p><p>2) In absence of any specific binding of SNPC-1.3 to male/spermatogenic piRNAs the only experiment that suggests such specific function is the piRNA quantification in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants. However, as they mentioned in their manuscript: &quot;oogenesis-enriched piRNAs were upregulated at least 2-fold in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants undergoing spermatogenesis and in <italic>him-8(-)</italic>; <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> males. These findings suggest that, in addition to activating male piRNAs, SNPC-1.3 suppresses the expression of female piRNAs in the male germline, possibly by preferentially recruiting core factors such as SNPC-4 to male piRNA loci&quot;. This model should be demonstrated by SNPC-4 ChIP in sncp-1.3(-) mutants. However, they mention in the Discussion that sncp-1.3(-) mutants do not affect SNPC-4 binding. So, this is unlikely the case. An alternative explanation of these results might be that mutation in sncp-1.3 caused some developmental defects in the temporal switching between spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Also, the ChIP signal of SNPC-1.3 do not appear to occur specifically on male piRNA, but also on neutral non-enriched (NE) piRNAs and to some degree to female piRNAs (Figure 3E). Even in the context of tra-1 mutation there is not an exclusive upregulation of male piRNA, but also downregulation of female piRNA. Therefore, the specificity of SNPC-3.1 for male piRNA transcription is not clear.</p><p>3) Throughout the whole manuscript the authors wrote that SNPC-1.3 drives the expression of male piRNAs. However, the experiments have been conducted in hermaphrodite germlines (or mutants) and not in male germlines. Maybe it is more correct to talk about spermatogenic expressed/enriched and oogenic expressed/enriched piRNAs instead of male/female piRNAs. In this regard, the authors mention that SNPC-1.3 is expressed during spermatogenesis and is specific for male. But, this has been only deducted by RNA-seq at different time point of hermaphroditic germline development. Ideally the authors should create a fluorescent tag version of SNPC-1.3 to evaluate its specific temporal expression in hermaphrodite as well as in male. If this is not possible the authors should perform immunostaining using FLAG antibody. This can be combined with SNPC-4 and TRA-1 staining. Also, it would be interesting to evaluate the expression of PIWI by staining and/or WB during spermatogenesis and oogenesis in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants.</p><p>4) In the legend of Figure 3 it is written &quot;SNPC-1.3::3xFlag binding normalized to input (mean ± SD of two technical replicates) on chromosome IV by ChIP-qPCR in a no-tag control, the strain expressing SNPC-4::3xFlag (wildtype), and in the strain expressing SNPC-4::3xFlag::AID, which undergoes TIR-1-mediated degradation by addition of auxin (<italic>snpc-4::aid</italic>)&quot;. This is very confusing and if it is true it means that the SNPC-1.3 ChIP can detect also the binding of SNPC-4 (they are both tagged with FLAG), hence the specific binding of SNPC-3.1 vs. SNPC-4 cannot be determined. Maybe there is a mistake in the legend and the authors should clarify this (it was difficult for me to find this information in the strain list). Also, to avoid such confusion the authors should not call wild-type an edited strain and all the information about the strain should be clearer in the figures.</p><p>5) In the Discussion, the authors wrote &quot;Due to the highly clustered nature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> piRNAs, we have been unable to discriminate detectable differences in SNPC-4 binding between male and female piRNAs in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants, as assayed by traditional ChIP-seq methods.&quot; I was unable to find these data in the manuscript. Are they present in another publication? Or those are data not shown? I think it would be important to add these data and comment on why only SNPC-4 is required for SNPC-1.3 binding and not vice versa. Also, in case these data are included, the authors should comment on the point I raised above.</p><p>6) In Figure 2A the levels of male piRNAs is not completely abolished (like in piwi mutant). The authors should comment on this and whether they think there are additional TF factors that drive the expression of male piRNAs. This is also evident in the small RNA-seq experiment in Figure 2D. Here, not all the male piRNA are depleted at similar levels. Maybe the authors can look at the consensus motif of the most affected vs. less affected piRNA groups to see if they find any differences. Also, it would be interesting to analyze the expression levels of the most affected ones compared to the less affected ones to verify that the severity of the loss is not caused by their relative abundance.</p><p>7) In Figure 5A the authors show that snpc-3.1 mutant has reduced brood size at 25°C similarly to <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant. However, <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant is not shown for comparison. Also, given that <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant shows progressive sterility or mortal germline at 20°C and 25°C, it would be important to know at which generation they have performed their experiment and whether snpc-3.1 mutant is also mortal. Finally, they need to evaluate the fertility at 20°C as well as at 25°C to have a good comparison with <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>piRNAs are major regulators of gene expression and transposable elements in animal germlines. Many aspects of piRNA biology are sexually dimorphic and the mechanistic underpinnings of this dimorphism are largely unknown. In this work, Choi et al. provide compelling evidence that they have defined the mechanism by which some piRNAs are expressed specifically in the male germline of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The subject matter is of broad interest. The paper is very well written. The data are of very high quality. The conclusions are well supported by the data. I recommend publishing the work in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60681.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers and editors think that, in principle, this manuscript is suitable for publication in eLife.

While an EMSA, in theory, is a good way to test specificity of the male motif, we do not find it feasible for this paper. Specifically, in vitro work done using fly cells shows that SNPC-1.3 binding can only occur within the context of the entire SNPC1/3/4 complex. Therefore, we decided against performing these types of experiments because we expect that an EMSA may not be feasible unless we also purify multiple SNAP complex proteins, as well as other piRNA factors (such as the TOFUs and PRDE-1). Additionally, the presence of the core motif may not be sufficient for SNPC-1.3 binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In absence of any specific binding of SNPC-1.3 to male/spermatogenic piRNAs the only experiment that suggests such specific function is the piRNA quantification in snpc-1.3(-) mutants.

We have edited the Discussion to stress that the perturbation of SNPC-4 binding in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> is our working hypothesis and requires further investigation in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An alternative explanation of these results might be that mutation in sncp-1.3 caused some developmental defects in the temporal switching between spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Also, the ChIP signal of SNPC-1.3 do not appear to occur specifically on male piRNA, but also on neutral non-enriched (NE) piRNAs and to some degree to female piRNAs (Figure 3E). Even in the context of tra-1 mutation there is not an exclusive upregulation of male piRNA, but also downregulation of female piRNA. Therefore, the specificity of SNPC-3.1 for male piRNA transcription is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these observations and agree that the loss of male piRNAs could be a consequence of increased female piRNA expression, but technical limitations make this difficult to test. While it is plausible that <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> is involved in the sexual identity switch of the germline, we think this is highly unlikely as we do not observe any morphological defects that would suggest transformation of sexual identity from male to female in <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> mutants.</p><p>In reference to the lack of specificity of SNPC-1.3 binding to male, female and NE piRNAs, we think this could be due to the technical limitations of our ChIP datasets. We have plotted the distance of the nearest neighboring piRNA for each piRNA in the two chromosome IV clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). As the distances between piRNAs fall below the average footprint obtained by conventional ChIP-seq methods, we were unable to identify distinct binding sites for individual piRNAs.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Distance of the nearest neighboring piRNA for each piRNA in the two chromosome IV clusters.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60681-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The SNAP complex is well defined as a transcription activator. We therefore believe that female piRNA repression is a result of sequestration of SNPC-4 by the male piRNA promoters rather than direct repression.We feel the novelty of our paper is based on the observation that SNPC-1.3-dependent regulation is required for the balance between male and female piRNAs. If the resolution of our ChIP was higher (e.g. to the level of Cut-N-Run or ChIP-exo), we hypothesize that we would be able to address whether or not SNPC-1.3 binds directly to male piRNA promoters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the whole manuscript the authors wrote that SNPC-1.3 drives the expression of male piRNAs. However, the experiments have been conducted in hermaphrodite germlines (or mutants) and not in male germlines. Maybe it is more correct to talk about spermatogenic expressed/enriched and oogenic expressed/enriched piRNAs instead of male/female piRNAs. In this regard, the authors mention that SNPC-1.3 is expressed during spermatogenesis and is specific for male. But, this has been only deducted by RNA-seq at different time point of hermaphroditic germline development.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these points and acknowledge that these terms can often be confusing. However, we would like to keep the existing designation of “male/female” piRNAs as we feel that the use “spermatogenic/oogenic” piRNAs would create additional confusion when describing piRNA populations that are inappropriately expressed during spermatogenesis and oogenesis in certain <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> mutants. We also feel that this designation is appropriate as we used this terminology in our previous study (Billi et al., 2013), which validated that “male” and “female” piRNAs discovered by sequencing in male and female germlines are indeed expressed in hermaphrodites during spermatogenesis and oogenesis, respectively, by Taqman qPCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ideally the authors should create a fluorescent tag version of SNPC-1.3 to evaluate its specific temporal expression in hermaphrodite as well as in male. If this is not possible the authors should perform immunostaining using FLAG antibody. This can be combined with SNPC-4 and TRA-1 staining.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We have examined SNPC-1.3 and SNPC-4 expression by immunostaining in the new Figure 2C, which shows that SNPC-1.3 co-localizes with SNPC-4 and is detectable only in male germline nuclei.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it would be interesting to evaluate the expression of PIWI by staining and/or WB during spermatogenesis and oogenesis in snpc-1.3(-) mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have shown that PRG-1 localizes to perinuclear granules and its function in the piRNA RISC complex is likely downstream of piRNA transcription. Nevertheless, while evaluating PRG-1 expression in the context of <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants could be interesting, we feel that this analysis is outside the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the legend of Figure 3 it is written &quot;SNPC-1.3::3xFlag binding normalized to input (mean ± SD of two technical replicates) on chromosome IV by ChIP-qPCR in a no-tag control, the strain expressing SNPC-4::3xFlag (wildtype), and in the strain expressing SNPC-4::3xFlag::AID, which undergoes TIR-1-mediated degradation by addition of auxin (snpc-4::aid)&quot;. This is very confusing and if it is true it means that the SNPC-1.3 ChIP can detect also the binding of SNPC-4 (they are both tagged with FLAG), hence the specific binding of SNPC-3.1 vs. SNPC-4 cannot be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this error in the text. The experiments were performed in <italic>snpc-1.3::3xflag</italic> worms in the N2 and <italic>snpc-4::aid::ollas</italic> backgrounds. We have corrected this in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe there is a mistake in the legend and the authors should clarify this (it was difficult for me to find this information in the strain list). Also, to avoid such confusion the authors should not call wild-type an edited strain and all the information about the strain should be clearer in the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. The legends, figures, and text have been changed to clarify the genetic background of each strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Discussion, the authors wrote &quot;Due to the highly clustered nature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> piRNAs, we have been unable to discriminate detectable differences in SNPC-4 binding between male and female piRNAs in snpc-1.3(-) mutants, as assayed by traditional ChIP-seq methods.&quot; I was unable to find these data in the manuscript. Are they present in another publication? Or those are data not shown? I think it would be important to add these data and comment on why only SNPC-4 is required for SNPC-1.3 binding and not vice versa. Also, in case these data are included, the authors should comment on the point I raised above.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. We have not been able to generate our own SNPC-4 ChIP +/- <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> in this manuscript. We have edited the text to stress that we anticipate resolving changes in SNPC-4 binding in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> will be difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 2A the levels of male piRNAs is not completely abolished (like in piwi mutant). The authors should comment on this and whether they think there are additional TF factors that drive the expression of male piRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is possible that other male transcription factors exist. However, we think the slightly elevated expression of male piRNA expression in <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> compared to <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants (Figure 3A) is likely a result of leaky transcription at piRNA loci. Given that PRG-1 is the major Argonaute that loads all piRNAs downstream of biogenesis, we do not find it surprising that <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants exhibit more severe loss of piRNAs compared to <italic>snpc-1.3</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is also evident in the small RNA-seq experiment in Figure 2D. Here, not all the male piRNA are depleted at similar levels. Maybe the authors can look at the consensus motif of the most affected vs. less affected piRNA groups to see if they find any differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Our motif analysis has demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of SNPC-1.3-dependent male piRNAs have the 5’C motif (3,429/3,452).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it would be interesting to analyze the expression levels of the most affected ones compared to the less affected ones to verify that the severity of the loss is not caused by their relative abundance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To test if the degree of male piRNA expression changes seen in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants are correlated to their relative abundance during wildtype spermatogenesis, we plotted the absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) of each male piRNA depleted in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants against its mean expression level during spermatogenesis in wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We conclude from this additional analysis that, overall, piRNAs with greater relative abundance in wildtype do show greater depletion in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants during spermatogenesis.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) of each male piRNA depleted in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants against its mean expression level during spermatogenesis in wildtype.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60681-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 5A the authors show that snpc-3.1 mutant has reduced brood size at 25°C similarly to prg-1 mutant. However, prg-1 mutant is not shown for comparison. Also, given that prg-1 mutant shows progressive sterility or mortal germline at 20°C and 25°C, it would be important to know at which generation they have performed their experiment and whether snpc-3.1 mutant is also mortal. Finally, they need to evaluate the fertility at 20°C as well as at 25°C to have a good comparison with prg-1 mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point. We have made sure to include in the legends and Materials and methods that all brood count assays were shifted and assayed at the P0 generation at 25°C in Figure 6. We were careful not to make any direct comparisons between <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> and <italic>prg-1(-)</italic> fertility, but we did want to show that <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> mutants exhibit significant fertility defects. We also see a significant but attenuated fertility defect in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> at 20°C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Although we agree with the reviewers that investigating the transgenerational effects of sex-specific piRNAs could be very interesting, we think this area is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we hope to characterize sex-specific transgenerational effects in future studies.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Fertility defect in <italic>snpc-1.3(-)</italic> at 20°C.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60681-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
