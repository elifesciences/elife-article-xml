both vital biosynthetic processes within mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP), which has a well-known role in FASII, plays an unexpected and evolutionarily conserved role in FeS biogenesis. ACP is a stable and essential subunit of the eukaryotic FeS biogenesis complex. In the absence of ACP, the complex is destabilized resulting in a profound depletion of FeS throughout the cell. This role of ACP depends upon its covalently bound 4’-phosphopantetheine (4-PP)-conjugated acyl chain to support maximal cysteine desulfurase activity. Thus, it is likely that ACP is not simply an obligate subunit but also exploits the 4-PP-conjugated acyl chain to coordinate mitochondrial fatty acid and FeS biogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17828.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17828.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17828.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like animals and plants, yeast cells contain structures called mitochondria. These structures are commonly referred to as the powerhouses of the cell because they provide much of the energy that cells need to survive. All mitochondria contain a protein called acyl carrier protein (ACP), which cells need in order to live. The ACP protein has a number of known roles including manufacturing the molecules that make up certain fats and helping to organise other proteins that are important for energy production. However, neither of these roles explain why yeast cells require ACP because the other proteins required for these processes are not required for survival.</p><p>Mitochondria are also the sites where iron and sulfur atoms are joined together to make the iron sulfur clusters that many proteins need in order to carry out their roles. Van Vranken, Jeong et al. now show that the ACP protein associates with a molecular machine that makes iron sulfur clusters in the mitochondria of budding yeast cells. The experiments show that this interaction is needed to produce iron sulfur clusters, and without it the other proteins involved in the process are not able to work together. Since iron sulfur clusters are essential for life, this could explain why cells cannot survive without ACP. Van Vranken et al. also showed that ACP is only able to efficiently produce iron sulfur clusters when a chemical called a “4-PP-conjugated acyl chain” is attached to it.</p><p>It is possible to separate the activity of ACP in making iron sulfur clusters from its previously known roles. Van Vranken et al. suggest that the addition of the 4-PP-conjugated acyl chain to ACP may help to balance the use of ACP between its different activities. Moving forward, Van Vranken et al. hope to determine the structure of ACP in more detail to understand how it contributes to iron sulfur cluster formation, and why this single protein has evolved to perform so many distinct roles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17828.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17828.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>acyl carrier protein</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis</kwd><kwd>iron sulfur cluster biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutter</surname><given-names>Jared</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM110755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winge</surname><given-names>Dennis R</given-names></name><name><surname>Rutter</surname><given-names>Jared</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The essential function of ACP is not related to mitochondrial fatty acid and lipoic acid synthesis, but rather an evolutionarily-conserved role in iron sulfur cluster biogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) plays a critical role in the evolutionarily conserved type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FASII; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Unlike the cytosolic fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FASI), the mitochondrial FASII system, which is homologous to the prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, utilizes a set of monofunctional enzymes that interact transiently with ACP to catalyze the initiation and elongation of nascent acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hiltunen et al., 2010</xref>). To facilitate FASII, ACP utilizes a 4’-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (4-PP), which is covalently bound to an invariant Ser residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Majerus et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Stuible et al., 1998</xref>). As such, ACP serves as a soluble scaffold for acyl intermediates during the stepwise process of <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis. Currently, it is thought that the primary product of ACP-dependent FASII is octanoate, which is cleaved from ACP and further processed to generate lipoic acid. Lipoic acid is an obligate cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes as well as the branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase and glycine cleavage complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hiltunen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brody et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, a FASII-derived acyl chain other than lipoic acid is required for RNase P function in tRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schonauer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical analyses of mammalian FASII enzymes demonstrate that this pathway is capable of generating ACP-bound acyl chains as long as fourteen carbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Since lipoic acid biosynthesis requires an acyl chain of just eight carbons, it is likely that these extended FASII-synthesized fatty acids serve an alternative function in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brody et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, proteomic and structural studies have demonstrated that ACP is a stable accessory subunit of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sackmann et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angerer et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the pool of ACP associated with CI contains a 4-PP-conjugated 3-hydroxymyristic acid, however, the functional importance of this 14-carbon acyl chain has never been investigated in the context of CI activity or assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carroll et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ACP1</italic>, the gene encoding ACP, is essential for cell viability in multiple strain backgrounds, while the genes required for lipoic acid biosynthesis and ligation are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schonauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brody et al., 1997</xref>). This is consistent with reports demonstrating that ACP is essential for viability in <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dobrynin et al., 2010</xref>) and in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yi and Maeda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria do not have CI or any structurally similar analog of it. Since neither known function explains the essentiality of <italic>ACP1</italic>, we reasoned that ACP must perform a distinct, unknown, and essential mitochondrial function.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17828.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acp1 is a stable subunit of the ISU complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>acp1</italic>Δ heterozygous diploids were dissected with and without a plasmid expressing Acp1-HA (BY4741) and spores were grown on YPAD medium for 2 days.

FASII, which is dependent on ACP, is comprised of a set of monofunctional enzymes that catalyze the various steps in fatty acid synthesis. In order to facilitate mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, apo-ACP must first be converted to holo-ACP by a 4’-phosphopanthetheine transferase (Ppt2), which catalyzes the covalent attachment of the 4-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (4-PP) to an absolutely conserved Ser residue on ACP. The 4-PP contains a terminal thiol that serves as the attachment site to enable Acp1 to scaffold <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis. The enzymes of FASII use malonyl-coA to initiate the fatty acid chain and acetyl-coA for acyl chain elongation. The canonical product of FASII is octanoate, which is the precursor for lipoic acid, an important mitochondrial cofactor. Following ACP-dependent octanoate synthesis, Lip2, Lip3, Lip5, and Gcv3 support the synthesis of lipoic acid and ligation to its target proteins including the E3 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Ppt2 – 4’phophopantetheine transferase; MCT – malonyl-coA transferase; KAS – ketoacyl synthetase; KAR – ketoacyl reductase; HTD2 – hydroxyacyl-thioester reductase type 2; ETR – enoyl-thioester reductase; Lip2, Lip3, Lip5, Gcv3 – lipoic acid biosynthesis and ligation.

We were particularly intrigued by the co-purification of three subunits of the ISU complex—Nfs1, Isd11, and Isu1—each of which is required for FeS biogenesis and essential for viability. The cysteine desulfurase (Nfs1) and Isd11 form the core of the ISU complex and catalyze the conversion of cysteine to alanine thereby generating a persulfide intermediate, which is the source of sulfide ions that combine with ferrous iron on the Isu1 scaffold protein to form [2Fe-2S] clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garland et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mühlenhoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wiedemann et al., 2006</xref>). To confirm these interactions, we immunoprecipitated Acp1-HA from isolated mitochondria and analyzed the eluates by immunoblot. Indeed, Nfs1, Isd11, and Isu1 all specifically co-immunoprecipitate with Acp1, although Isu1 appears to interact less avidly than Nfs1 or Isd11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition to SDS-PAGE, the resultant eluates were also resolved by blue native (BN)-PAGE, which demonstrated that Acp1 co-purifies with the intact core Nfs1-Isd11 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Finally, Nfs1-V5 and Isd11-V5 were each immunoprecipitated from isolated mitochondria. As expected, Acp1-HA was detected in the eluates of each immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results are further supported by proteomics-based interaction studies, which identify human ACP, NFS1, and ISD11 as mutually interacting proteins in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together these data demonstrate that Acp1 is a stable and evolutionarily conserved subunit of the ISU complex with Nfs1, Isd11, and Isu1.</p><p>FeS biogenesis is an essential function of mitochondria and is absolutely dependent on the ISU complex with which Acp1 stably interacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lill et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the essential function of Acp1 might relate to FeS biogenesis. We engineered inducible <italic>ACP1</italic> knockdown strains (Acp1<sup>KD</sup>) using two distinct strategies and strain backgrounds—TetO<sub>7-</sub><italic>ACP1</italic> in the BY4741 background and Gal-<italic>ACP1</italic> in the DY150 background, in which <italic>ACP1</italic> expression is suppressed by doxycycline and galactose withdrawal, respectively. As expected, Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells from each background displayed attenuated growth upon <italic>ACP1</italic> shutdown, which is particularly evident on respiration-requiring glycerol medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Importantly, viability could be restored in each of these strains by episomal expression of the Acp1-HA at endogenous levels. In addition to the expected loss of lipoic acid-containing subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells, we also observed a specific destabilization of the FeS-containing subunits of Complex II (Sdh2) and Complex III (Rip1) and loss of those assembled respiratory complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A similar destabilization of these complexes occurs in cells depleted for Nfs1 and Isu1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wiedemann et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, Complex III biogenesis stalls in Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells at the final stage of assembly – incorporation of the Rieske FeS protein (Rip1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; IB: Rip1)–resulting in the accumulation of a stable assembly intermediate of Complex III lacking Rip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; III<sub>2</sub>*; IB: Qcr7). The presence of the late stage intermediate III<sub>2</sub>* indicates that mitochondrial translation of the Cob cytochrome b subunit is normal in Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, translation of the mitochondrial subunits of ATP synthase is normal as seen by the assembled F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed a loss of activity of aconitase, a mitochondrial enzyme with an obligate FeS cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17828.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Acp1 is required for FeS biogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Isolated mitochondria from the indicated strains were resolved by SDS-PAGE (upper panel) or solubilized in 1% digitonin and resolved by BN-PAGE (lower panel).

In addition, mitochondrial FeS synthesis is important to attenuate the transcriptional activity of two partially redundant iron-responsive factors Aft1 and Aft2. In Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells the expression of Aft1-target genes <italic>FIT2</italic> and <italic>FIT3</italic> was elevated consistent with impaired mitochondrial FeS synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rutherford et al., 2005</xref>). These Aft1 target genes are also induced in cells lacking the two mitochondrial iron transporters Mrs3 and Mrs4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further assess the perturbation of cytosolic FeS function, we quantified the activity of the cytosolic FeS-containing enzyme sulfite reductase and observed a diminution in Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Combined with the essential nature of <italic>ACP1</italic>, these data demonstrate that Acp1 is essential for FeS biogenesis.</p><p>We next sought to define the mechanism underlying the observed necessity of Acp1 for FeS biogenesis, focusing specifically on the ISU complex. Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells exhibited a marked diminution of the assembled Nfs1-Isd11 complex, similar to depletion of the other ISU complex subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Importantly, the Nfs1 and Isd11 protein that remain in these cells is found only in insoluble aggregates in contrast to WT cells where Nfs1 and Isd11 are soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, in the absence of Acp1, the Nfs1-Isd11 complex is destabilized, most likely causing a loss of cysteine desulfurase activity. To determine if mammalian ACP is also necessary for maintaining steady state levels of the FeS biogenesis complex in mammalian cells, C2C12 mouse myoblasts were transfected with a pool of siRNAs targeting <italic>NDUFAB1</italic> (the gene encoding mammalian ACP) or a control siRNA. While our methods were unable to detect the mammalian Nfs1-Isd11 complex by BN-PAGE, depletion of ACP in these cells was accompanied by a clear destabilization of the subunits of the mammalian FeS biogenesis machinery, NFS1, ISD11, and ISCU2, which is the mammalian version of Isu1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

ACP functions as a stable subunit of the ISU complex where it acts to stabilize the complex in part by exploiting a 4-PP-conjugated acyl chain. Unlike ACP, however, the acyl chain is not absolutely required for FeS biogenesis and viability, which raises the intriguing possibility that ACP is not simply an obligate subunit, but may exploit this unique interaction modality to provide additional structural or regulatory functions on FeS biogenesis. It is particularly intriguing to speculate that ACP may serve to coordinate mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and FeS biogenesis, which represent two critical biosynthetic processes performed by mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> BY4741 (<italic>MATa, his3 leu2 met15 ura3), Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> R1158 (BY4741 derivative; <italic>MATa</italic>, URA3::CMV-tTA, <italic>his3 leu2 met15), Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> W303a (<italic>MATa, his3 leu2 met15 trp1 ura3</italic>), and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> DY150 (<italic>MATa ade2-1 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc</italic>)) were used as the wild-type strains where indicated.

Aconitase activity was measured by coupling with NADP<sup>+</sup>- dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. 30 μl of crude lysate was mixed with 150 μl of reaction mixture (1 M Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NADP<sup>+</sup>, 0.32 units of NADP<sup>+</sup>- dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase), and 10 μl of 50 mM citrate. The reaction mixture was recorded at 340 nm for 2 min (15 s intervals). Aconitase activity was normalized to total protein concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Sulfite reductase assays</title><p>To measure cytosolic iron, cells (50 ml cultures) were grown in SC –Met (To avoid repression of the enzyme expression by methionine) medium containing 2% glucose or raffinose as a carbon source till 1 of OD<sub>600 nm</sub>. Total cell lysate preparation and the enzyme assay was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rutherford et al., 2005</xref>) with modifications. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (0.1 M Tris-Cl pH7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mM phenylmethlysulfony fluoride (PMSF)) with lyticase and incubated 30°C for 45 min. After disruption using glass beads, 50 μl of cell lysates were mixed with 400 µl of assay mix with or without sulfite. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min, 100 μl of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate (DPD) and 100 μl of ferric chloride were added to the reaction mix to stop the reaction and incubated in the dark to develop the color for 20 min. The production of methylene blue was measured at 669 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>qPCR analysis</title><p>To quantify the expression of Fe regulon genes, total RNAs were extracted from yeast spheroplasts using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). cDNA were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). 2 μl of 10X diluted cDNA reaction mix were mixed with SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher) with primers and the PCR reaction were performed using the Mastercycler ep <italic>realplex</italic> (Eppendorf).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.

Using genetic tools in yeast, the authors demonstrate loss of the ISU complex and FeS biogenesis (specifically OXPHOS complexes II and III subunits), as well as loss of a lipoic acid-containing PDH subunit as expected. Cytosolic FeS-containing systems were also affected and convincingly demonstrated (qPCR of transcripts known to be upregulated upon impaired mito FeS synthesis, activity of cytosolic sulfite reductase). Turnover of mammalian ISU subunits upon knockdown of NDUFAB1 (human ACP) was also demonstrated, suggesting the phenomenon is conserved (however more work will be needed to establish this given the complexities of the dually and now potentially triple localized human ACP, although this is probably out of the scope of this short report). Finally, using a mutant of ACP unable to conjugate the acyl chain, the authors demonstrate its importance in lipoic acid synthesis as expected, as well as FeS biogenesis. Interestingly, cells expressing only ACP unable to conjugate the acyl chain remain viable, suggesting the essentiality of ACP is in fact due to its involvement in FeS biogenesis. Knockout of the enzyme conjugating the acyl chain to ACP had a similar effect. The authors also found that overexpression of a mitochondrial ion transporter and to a lesser extent another subunit of the ISU complex, restored the levels of the ISU complex (and substrates). Taken together the assumption is that the stability of the ISU complex is being impaired or increased respectively, and also that the acyl chain has a primarily structural role in the ISU complex rather than a functional one. This is very nicely controlled report demonstrating a totally unexpected role for ACP in FeS biogenesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers felt that the paper is very strong but there was a consensus that a stronger caveat should be made with respect to the possible role of the acyl carrier group, based on the phenotype of the S82 mutant. It is possible that there is exclusively a structural role but that there is a structural defect in the S82 mutant that reduces folding/assembly to some extent. This would require a textual change.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17828.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The reviewers felt that the paper is very strong, and primarily minor changes are needed (see below).</italic> </p><p> <italic>There was a consensus that a stronger caveat should be made with respect to the possible role of the acyl carrier group, based on the phenotype of the S82 mutant.

While this alone does not prove that the S82A mutant achieves a native confirmation, we also know that apo-Acp1 has wild-type stability as it accumulates to the same degree as holo-Acp1 and is fully soluble. Furthermore, it is not completely unable to bind Isd11 and Nfs1. Newly included data demonstrates that apo-Acp1 can still bind the core ISU complex albeit with much reduced affinity. This is consistent with the observations that ACP and ISD11 make protein-protein contacts independent of those mediated by the acylated –PP. Taken together we feel strongly that the defects observed in cells expressing Acp1<sup>S82A</sup>, which mirror the defects seen in <italic>ppt2Δ</italic> cells, stem from a failure to make essential cofactor-protein and lipid-protein contacts. So while this does not prove the lack of some misfolding, we feel that the data strongly supports a structural role for the acylated cofactor in the ISU complex. Therefore, we are reluctant to add a statement in the text that we are quite confident is wrong and will be strongly disproven in the next several months with the publication of the structure. However, if the reviewers still feel strongly about this point, we will, of course, include the caveat as a possible interpretation.</p><p>New data: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>. In order to further interrogate the defects observed in cells expressing apo-Acp1, Acp1 was immunoprecipitated from WT and <italic>ppt2Δ</italic> cells. While Acp1 accumulated to similar extents and was readily soluble in each both strains, Acp1 in <italic>ppt2Δ</italic> cells pulled down far less Nfs1 than Acp1 from WT cells. This demonstrates that the 4-PP promotes, but is not absolutely essential, for mediating the Acp1-Nfs1 interaction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
