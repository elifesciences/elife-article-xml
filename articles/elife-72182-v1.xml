The present study was designed to elucidate the mechnaisms by which plant-derived celastrol ameliorated inflammation and lipid accumulation in obesity. The mouse model of diet-induced obesity was induced by feeding high-fat diet for 3 months and subsequently intervented with celastrol for 21 days. Hepatic and adipose tissues were analyzed for lipid accumulation, macrophage activation, and biomarker expression. As result, celastrol effectively reduced body weight, suppressed ER stress, inflammation, and lipogenesis while promoted hepatic lipolysis. RNA-sequencing revealed that celastrol-loaded nanomicelles restored the expression of 49 genes that regulate ER stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism. On the other hand, celastrol-PEG4-alkyne was synthesized for identifying celastrol-bound proteins in RAW264.7 macrophages. ER chaperone GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein) was identified by proteomics approach for celastrol binding to the residue Cys<sup>41</sup>. Upon binding and conjugation, celastrol diminished the chaperone activity of GRP78 by 130-fold and reduced ER stress in palmitate-challenged cells, while celastrol analog lacking quinone methide failed to exhibit antiobesity effects. Thus, covalent GRP78 inhibition may induce the reprograming of ER signaling, inflammation, and metabolism against diet-induced obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>lipid accumulation</kwd><kwd>GRP78</kwd><kwd>celastrol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17146216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rong</surname><given-names>Jianhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21778046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rong</surname><given-names>Jianhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003803</institution-id><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201611159156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rong</surname><given-names>Jianhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17100317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rong</surname><given-names>Jianhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17119619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rong</surname><given-names>Jianhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Celastrol covalently inhibited the chaperone activity of GRP78 and could disconnect the transduction of ER stress signal to downstream inflammatory response and lipid metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysregulation of cross-talks between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and metabolic pathways hallmark the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and acute myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Gaal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rocha and Libby, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flegal et al., 2010</xref>). The 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is an integral ER stress sensor and holds inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) in the ER lumen to prevent the activation of corresponding downstream substrates under the physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Szegezdi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cnop et al., 2012</xref>). Upon the challenge by stress stimuli, however, unfolded or misfolded proteins are overwhelmingly accumulated in ER compartment, disrupt the complexes of GRP78 with IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, and ultimately induce unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cnop et al., 2012</xref>). Obesity and high-fat diet (HFD) not only induce persistent ER stress, leptin resistance, and insulin resistance via activating protein kinase JNK and inducing the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ozcan et al., 2009</xref>), but also promote the generation of unfolded or misfolded proteins and the activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hotamisligil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pagliassotti et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, hyperactive ER stress drives the proinflammatory M1 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages and exacerbates inflammation and metabolic dysfunctions in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bujisic and Martinon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, GRP78 is essential for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, indicating a critical role in the control of fat contents in body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). The activation of ER stress pathways (e.g., PERK and eIF2α) inversely induces the upregulation of GRP78 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, GRP78 may be an important molecular target for the development of new therapies against obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and acute myocardial infarction.</p><p>Pentacyclic triterpene celastrol as a major bioactive compound from the plant <italic>Tripterygium wilfordii</italic> Hook.f. was recently identified as the best antiobesity drug candidate without evident toxicity at the dose of 100 μg kg<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Several recent studies suggest that celastrol may induce rapid weight loss through several mechanisms as follows: (1) To enhance leptin activity and reduce food intake in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenhill, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>); (2) To improve insulin sensitivity via inhibiting NF-κB pathway and control the progression of obesity via enhancing antioxidant capacity and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2014</xref>); (3) To activate HSF1–PGC1α transcriptional axis and elicit beneficial metabolic changes against obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). However, the primary molecular targets have not been well defined for celastrol to bind covalently or noncovalently. At the cell level, celastrol could effectively suppress proinflammatory M1 macrophage polarization and enhance anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). These results strongly promoted effort to development novel celastrol-based antiobesity drugs. Nevertheless, the pharmacological potential of celastrol is largely limited by its strong hydrophobicity and poor bioavailability. We recently attempted to load celastrol into PEG-PCL nanomicelles to yield Nano-celastrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, Nano-celastrol exhibited highly competitive antiobesity effects and less gastrointestinal retention. These results strongly facilitated the pharmaceutical application of celastrol.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to discover the protein targets for celastrol and determine the impact of covalent celastrol–protein conjugation on ER stress in diet-induced obesity. We synthesized celastrol-PEG4-alkyne bearing an alkyne (–C≡C–) group as a molecular probe for the affinity isolation of celastrol-bound proteins. We further determined the in vitro and in vivo effects of celastrol on ER stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Celastrol diminished lipid accumulation in diet-induced obesity</title><p>To examine the effects of celastrol on lipid metabolism, we visualized the morphology of adipocytes and the profiles of fatty acids in livers and adipose tissues from diet-induced obese mice.

Here, we determined whether celastrol could ameliorate ER stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions in diet-induced obesity via covalent modification of chaperone GRP78.</p><p>HFD is well known to induce the deposition of lipids and alter the composition of fatty acids in liver, adipose tissues, and other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cameron-Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oosterveer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Based on transcriptomic profiling and biochemical analysis, HFD upregulated several lipogenic genes for producing fatty acids (<italic>Acc</italic>, <italic>Fas</italic>, <italic>Scd1</italic>, <italic>Elovl6</italic>) and triglycerides (<italic>Dgat</italic>, <italic>Gpat</italic>), elongase for synthesizing long chain fatty acids such as n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and <italic>Srebp1c</italic> and <italic>Pgc1b</italic> for lipid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oosterveer et al., 2009</xref>). Our group and others have recently demonstrated that celastrol effectively reduces adipose hypertrophy in mouse and rats models of HFD-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, firstly, H&amp;E staining confirmed that celastrol ameliorated adipose hypertrophy and reduced lipid accumulation in liver and epididymal adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Secondly, GC–MS technology was employed to profile fatty acids in liver and adipose tissues from Control, HFD and HFD + Celastrol groups. Based on the quantitative analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, celastrol ameliorated HFD-induced elevations of various polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., C16:1, trans-C18:1, cis-C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, cis-C20:2, cis-C20:3) in liver but showed little activity against HFD-impaired production of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosoids (e.g., cis-C20:1, cis-C20:3, cis-C22:6) in epididymal fat pads. These results suggest that celastrol may mainly act on the metabolism of fatty acids in liver. Thirdly, qRT-PCR technique was employed to determine the key biomarkers for adipogensis, hormone secretion and energy expenditure. The key findings include: (1) celastrol could effectively antagonize HFD-induced upregulation of adipogenic genes (e.g., <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, <italic>Fabp4</italic>) and adipocyte-secreted hormones (e.g., <italic>Lepa</italic>, <italic>Retn</italic>, <italic>Cfd</italic>) in livers shortly after 7-day treatment; (2) celastrol markedly elevated the expression of lipolytic genes (e.g., <italic>Cpt1</italic>, <italic>Cat</italic>, <italic>Aco</italic>) and thermogenic gene <italic>Ucp2</italic> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>); (3) celastrol mainly suppressed HFD-induced upregulation of adipogenic genes (e.g., <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, <italic>Fabp4</italic>) and adipocyte-secreted hormones (e.g., <italic>Lepa</italic>, <italic>Retn</italic>, <italic>Cfd</italic>) in epididymal fat pads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that celastrol mainly reprograms the biosynthesis and degradation of fatty acids in liver while inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis and hormone secretion. To facilitate safe control of body weight, we recently prepared Nano-celastrol by entrapping celastrol in PEG-PCL nanomicelles for the treatment of diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we further identified 49 DEGs in the livers from mice in Control, HFD, and HFD + Nano-celastrol groups by next-generation RNA- sequencing technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> classified these DEGs into the functional groups of retinol metabolism (i.e., <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a10</italic>, <italic>Cyp1a2</italic>, <italic>Cyp2a12</italic>, <italic>Cyp2c44</italic>, <italic>Cyp3a25</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a14</italic>, <italic>Retsat</italic>, <italic>Ugt2b5</italic>), lipid biosynthesis (e.g., <italic>Apoc2</italic>, <italic>C3</italic>, <italic>Cyp1a2</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a10</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a14</italic>, <italic>Ehhadh</italic>, <italic>Elovl5</italic>, <italic>Pck1</italic>, <italic>Scd1</italic>, <italic>Thrsp</italic>), oxidative stress (e.g., <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, <italic>Creg1</italic>, <italic>Cyp1a2</italic>, <italic>Cyp2a12</italic>, <italic>Cyp3a25</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a10</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a14</italic>, <italic>Ehhadh</italic>, <italic>Hsd17b10</italic>, <italic>Mdh1</italic>, <italic>Retsat</italic>, <italic>Scd1</italic>), lipid degradation (i.e., <italic>Acat1</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a10</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a14</italic>, <italic>Ehhadh</italic>), glucose metabolism (i.e., <italic>Mup1</italic>, <italic>Mup11</italic>, <italic>Mup12</italic>, <italic>Mup18</italic>, <italic>Mup20</italic>), cholesterol efflux (i.e., <italic>Apoa4</italic>, <italic>Apoc2</italic>, <italic>Apom</italic>), and inflammatory response (e.g., <italic>C3</italic>, <italic>C8a</italic>, <italic>Serpina1e</italic>) although some DEGs might be involved in several other biological processes and pathways. By using online software STRING, functional enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) revealed four protein–protein interaction networks: (1) lipid and glucose metabolism (i.e., <italic>Mdh1</italic>, <italic>Pck1</italic>, <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp1a2</italic>, <italic>Cyp2a12</italic>, <italic>Cyp2c44</italic>, <italic>Cyp3a25</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a10</italic>, <italic>Cyp4a14</italic>, <italic>Ugt2b5</italic>); (2) apolipoprotein metabolism and inflammatory response (i.e., <italic>Apoa4</italic>, <italic>Apoc2</italic>, <italic>Apom</italic>, <italic>Ltih3</italic>, <italic>Ltih4</italic>, <italic>Serpina1e</italic>, <italic>C3</italic>, <italic>Creg1</italic>, <italic>C8a</italic>); (3) mitochondrial energy homeostasis (i.e., <italic>Acat1</italic>, <italic>Enhadh</italic>, <italic>Hsd17b10</italic>); (4) adipose tissue energy homeostasis (<italic>Mt1</italic>, <italic>Mt2</italic>). Thus, RNA-seq profiling basically confirmed the potential of celastrol in the regulation of oxidative stress, lipid accumulation, and inflammatory response in the liver. The genes encoding ER stress signaling proteins were not selected probably due to the cutoff of &gt;2.0-fold.</p><p>On the other hand, free fatty acids induce ER stress and inflammatory response in macrophages and adipose tissues via TLR-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). ER stress in turn orchestrates unfolded protein response, inﬂammation, metabolic dysfunctions, and insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hummasti and Hotamisligil, 2010</xref>). ER chaperone protein GRP78 is integral to the celluluar sensing of fatty acid-induced ER stress and inflammatory stimuli and the regulation of lipid uptake, adipogenesis, lipolysis, glucose metabolism, cholesterol efflux, inflammatory response, and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). GRP78 and CHOP modulate macrophage apoptosis and control the progression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayaub et al., 2016</xref>). The activation of ER stress sensor IRE1α exacebates obesity-associated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). However, celastrol could reduce ER stress via reducing the protein level of p-PERK/PERK in hypothalamus of diet-induced obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, the effects of celastrol on the ER stress signaling pathway were examined in the in vitro and in vivo systems. Firstly, livers and epididymal fat pads were collected from experimental mice and examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. As results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref> shows that HFD upregulated GRP78 expression in macrophages whereas celstrol restored the expression level of GRP78. On the other hand, Western blot analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref> confirmed that HFD upregulated the expression GRP78, ATF6, and p-eIF2α in livers and epididymal fat pads. Celstrol not only restored the expression level of GRP78 but also reduced the levels of ATF6 and p-eIF2α in livers and epididymal fat pads. Secondly, RAW264.7 macrophages were treated by fatty acid palmitate to induce ER stress. Following celastrol treatment, we subsequently employed Western blotting and fluorescence immunostaining to determine the expression levels of ER stress biomarkers. As result, celastrol not only reduced the levels of GRP78, IRE1α, ATF6, CHOP, and XBP1, but also inhibited palmitate-stimulated eIF2α phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Based on the immunostaining results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), celastrol decreased the signal intensity of GRP78, ATF6, and IRE1α and preserved the colocalization of GRP78 with ATF6 and IRE1α in the ER compartment. These results indicate that celastrol could effectively suppress the ER stress signaling pathway in the hepatic and adipose tissues.</p><p>Celastrol bears a chemically reactive quinone methide moiety and thereby tends to form covalent conjugate with certain proteins such as HIV-Tat, IKKalpha, and beta kinases, Cdc37 and HSF although such covalent attachment appears to be reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salminen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Narayan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is critical to identify protein targets with convincing association to ER signaling, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic reprogramming. In the present study, a novel celastrol-PEG4-alkyne bearing an alkyne (–C≡C–) group was firstly synthesized as a small molecule probe through the in-house synthetic procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>). Secondly, RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with celastrol-PEG4-alkyne and lysed. The cellular proteins were biotinylated via Click chemistry ‘azide-alkyne cycloaddition’ and separated by affinity enrichment onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The protein fractions were resolved by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and identified by MALDI-MS technology. The major protein band was identified to be GRP78 and subsequently verified by Western blotting using specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thirdly, recombinant mouse GRP78 protein was prepared in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells and incubated with celastrol. Following trypsin digestion, peptides were mapped by LC–MS/MS analysis. Peptide mapping revealed a celstrol-bound peptide with the sequence of GSEEDKKEDVGTVVGIDLGTTYSC<sup>41</sup>VGVFK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This experiment suggests that celastrol interacts with GRP78 by covalent attachment to Cys<sup>41</sup>. Fourthly, the binding of celastrol to GRP78 was simulated by molecular docking. Interestingly, celastrol binds to the Cys<sup>41</sup>-containing region in GRP78 structure with binding energy of −8.1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> and inhibition constant of 1.55 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Fifthly, a recently identified peptide WDLAWMFRLPVG was synthesized to examine the effects of celstrol on the chaperone activity of GRP78 as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arap et al., 2004</xref>). Biacore X100 SPR system was employed to evaluate whether celastrol could alter the binding of peptide WDLAWMFRLPVG to GRP78 on the Sensor Chip. Indeed, celastrol attenuated the chaperone activity of GRP78 since the average Kd value of peptide binding was increased from 17.7 nM to 2.23 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Sixthly, two new celastrol derivatives were prepared to explore the importance of quinone methide moiety for celastrol to bind to GRP78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Celastrol-PEG3-biotin was readily detected in association with GRP78 although the binding could be blocked by excess celastrol. By contrast, analog-PEG3-biotin failed to bind to GRP78 due to the lack of quinone methide moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Seventhly, the present study addressed whether the formation of celastrol–GRP78 conjugate could be colocalized with the intracellular GRP78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The cells were treated with celastrol-PEG4-alkyne and subsequently labeled with fluorescence dye AFDye555-picolyl azide whereas GRP78 and another ER biomarker calnexin were detected by immunostaining. As result, the fluorescence of celastrol-PEG4-alkyne labeling was well colocalized with GRP78, and, to a large extent, ER biomarker calnexin. Last but not least, the present study determined whether quinone methide moirty was essential for antiobesity effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Celastrol was reduced by NaBH<sub>4</sub> and protected by <italic>O</italic>-methylation to yield celastrol analog. Unlike celastrol, such analog became totally inactive to induce weight loss, reduce fat mass and ameliorate glucose tolerance and insulin tolorance in diet-induced obese mice as assessed by previous described procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest that the unique quinone methide moiety is critical for celastrol to ameliorate ER stress, inflammation, and lipid accumulation via covalent inhibition of GRP78.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that celastrol ameliorated adipose hypertrophy and reduced lipid accumulation in liver and adipose tissues of diet-induced obese mice. Celastrol might induce rapid reduction of body weight through suppressing lipid uptake, lipogenesis and increasing lipolysis and thermogenesis. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, the key finding from the present study was that celastrol covalently inhibited the chaperone activity of GRP78 and could disconnect the transduction of ER stress signals to downstream inflammatory response and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the covalent inhibition of GRP78 is a novel antiobesity mechanism for reprograming the signaling networks that control inflammation, lipid accumulation, ER stress in liver and adipose tissues. Celastrol may be an important lead compound for the development of new selective and irreversible GRP78 inhibitors to treat obesity, diabetes, and related cardiovascular diseases.</p><fig id="fig10"

celastrol derivatives</title><p>Celastrol with the purity of over 98% (high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) was purchased from Nanjing Spring and Autumn Biological Engineering Co, Ltd. (Nanjing, China). Biotin-PEG3-amine and Alkyne-PEG4-amine were purchased from Hunan Huateng Pharmaceutical Company (Changsha, Hunan, China). The solvents and reagents including 4-methoxybenzyl chloride (PMB-Cl), iodomethane (CH<sub>3</sub>I), (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), potassium carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>), dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol (MeOH), chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and triethylamine (TEA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). The solvents for extraction and silica gel column chromatography were purchased from RCI Labscan Limited (Bangkok, Thailand) or Duksan Pure Chemicals Company (Ansan, South Korea). All solvents and reagents were used without further preparation unless otherwise indicated. The NMR <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III HD 400 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shifts were reported in ppm relative to the internal standard signal. The peak splitting patterns were described as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, while the coupling constant, <italic>J</italic>, was reported in Hertz unit (Hz). The molecular mass was determined on AB SCIEX X500R Q-TOF mass spectrometer in positive ion mode or negative ion mode. The purity of the products was determined by HPLC analysis on a reversed phase ACE Excel C18 column (2 μm particle size, 100 × 2.1 mm, Advanced Chromatography Technologies Ltd., Scotland) under the control of UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with quaternary pump, autosampler, thermostat column compartment, and diode array detection system.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ming-Yuen Lee (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We list here two new experiments and suggestion points for the discussion that we think are essential to support the claims made. These are:</p><p>1) Information regarding the cytotoxicity associated with celestrol is needed. This information is important and was requested by all the reviewers.</p><p>2) Reduced GRP78 expression is only shown by immunofluorescence staining in resident macrophage cells of mice liver and adipose tissues by the celastrol treatment. As suggested by Reviewer 2, isolation of macrophages from tissues can be performed in order to quantify protein or mRNA levels.</p><p>3) Expand the discussion of other potential effects of celastrol, given that the effects are not likely to be exclusive to the modulation of ER stress.</p><p>4) Revise the nomenclature of genes and proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this manuscript was clearly written and presented enough data to support the conclusion. The authors should address the following issues to enhance the quality of manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>1. The authors should indicate the herbal source for celastrol.</p><p>2. The authors should provide more details for the toxicity of celastrol.</p><p>3. The authors mentioned that celastrol might target several signaling pathways. It would be important to provide the rationale for the identification of covalent conjugates for celastrol.</p><p>4.

These results can be further strengthened by including the protein and/or mRNA expression of the upstream and downstream regulators of ER stress. This will ensure that the pathway under study is engaged in the experimental model and that it is being modulated by celastrol.</p><p>2. Figure 3. At least, a quantification of Figure 3 showing the changes in the relative number of immune cell infiltration and their respective GRP78 expression should be added.</p><p>3. Figure 4. Authors should discuss why the major regulators of canonical ER stress pathway are not in the list of differentially expressed genes.</p><p>4. Figure 5. Explaining the results depicted in figure 5C, authors mention that celastrol has led to a decrease in the protein levels of IRE1, ATF6 and GRP78 in the ER of macrophage cells, which is evident. But the data does not support their claim that GRP78 localization is affected by celastrol treatment. What is evident in the images is the level of GRP78. One obvious reason is relatively small size of RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. As a proof of concept, one possibility is to use giant mammalian cells like U2OS or H9C2 which are better suited for subcellular compartment studies.</p><p>5. An important experiment that the authors should consider is to show that how much of the effect of celastrol is through GRP78? Anti-inflammatory and lipolytic effects of celastrol should be studied after a genetic or siRNA mediated knock down of GRP78 under conditions of lipotoxicity and celastrol treatment.</p><p>6. Figure 5. Line 194- In the Results section describing Figure 5, authors write &quot;As shown in Figure 5C, palmitate significantly increased the expression of GRP78, 195 IRE1α, ATF6, … &quot; while no description of significance calculation is shown in the figure legend neither any graphs showing the results for that.</p><p>7. Figure 4 legend, line no. 1051 – HDF should be HFD.</p><p>8. Figure 9 – is there any cytotoxicity associated with celestrol? Authors should state the number of mice died in each group and if any was excluded from the final analysis.</p><p>9. Figure 5B – authors should include a description of the abbreviation used here in the figure legend. What does CL, FT, W1, W2, W3, W4 and E mean?</p><p>10. One suggestion is to add a one to two sentence short summary at the end of each result section. This will help to better understand the findings that have been presented.</p><p>11. Authors have relied on macrophage cells to show the binding and localization of celastrol with GRP78. This should also be reflected in the title of the manuscript.</p><p>12. A graphical abstract highlighting important findings of the study will help to gain more appreciation.</p><p>13. Labelling for molecular weight should be added to the western blot images, at least to the source data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Page 7, Lines 112-114, 116-118, 122-125:</p><p>All the lines are describing the regulations of different genes expression in the disease model, but the formatted symbols included are all corresponding to the protein of the respective genes such as in line 112 &quot;adipogenic genes (e.g., PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, aP2)&quot;, PPAR-γ refer to the protein and it is better to change it to Pparg to avoid misunderstanding.</p><p>Page 17, Lines 303-304, 306-309:</p><p>It is describing the gene expression again but all the symbols are corresponding the respective proteins and should be in italics.</p><p>Page 52, Figure 2, (A)(B)(C):</p><p>The figures are describing the fold changes of gene expression of different tissues after treatment but all the symbols in the figure are referring the proteins not the gene symbols</p><p>Page 52, Lines 1031, 1032:</p><p>In line 1031,&quot; in epididymal adipose tissues.&quot; But in line 1032 &quot;total RNAs were extracted from liver&quot; which is confusing and the source of RNA extracted is unclear.</p><p>Page 55, Figure 5 (A):</p><p>It is describing the effect of celastrol on ER stress in RAW264.7 macrophages.

We have indicated the herbal source for celastrol in the lines 66-67 and the commercial source in Methods. For the present study, we purchased celastrol with the purity of over 98% (HPLC) from Nanjing Spring and Autumn Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should provide more details for the toxicity of celastrol.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. We fully agree with the reviewer on the importance of addressing the toxicity of celastrol. Firstly, we have previously determined the effect of celastrol on liver by evaluating the levels of serum AST and ALT in DIO mice following the treatment with celastrol at the dose of 5mg/kg/day p.o. for 21 days. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, celastrol at 5 mg/kg/day effectively suppressed the HFD-induced hepatotoxicity and did not exert further toxicity to the DIO mice.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72182-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Secondly, we examined the effects of celastrol on tissue integrity in the major organs and animal behaviors following 21-day treatment. As shown in the results of hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining, celastrol at the dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 21 days did not alter on the integrity of the major mouse organs including the liver, heart, spleen and kidney (Scale bar: 100μm) nor showed any sign of intoxication.</p><p>Thirdly, Liu et al. previously evaluated the long-term toxicity of celastrol and did not find evident toxic effect in wild-type mice after i.p. administration of 100 μg/kg/day for 195 and 216 days (<italic>Liu</italic> J et al. Cell, <italic>2015</italic> May 21; 161(5):999-1011). However, celastrol is a highly hydrophobic drug and may be accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract. High gastrointestinal retention may affect the integrity of gastrointestinal tract. We have developed nanoparticle delivery system to resolve the gastrointestinal retention of celastrol (Zhao J et al., J Control Release. 2019 Sep 28;310:188-197).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mentioned that celastrol might target several signaling pathways. It would be important to provide the rationale for the identification of covalent conjugates for celastrol.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. Many previous studies have suggested that celastrol could regulate different signaling pathways (Kannaiyan R, et al. Molecular targets of celastrol derived from Thunder of God Vine: potential role in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and cancer. Cancer Lett. 2011 Apr 1;303(1):9-20; Chen SR et al. A Mechanistic Overview of Triptolide and Celastrol, Natural Products from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. Front Pharmacol. 2018 Feb 14;9:104). However, most of celastrol-targeting signaling pathways appear to be the downstream signaling pathways while little is known about the primary molecular targets. Celastrol bears a unique chemically reactive quinone methide and may likely bind to proteins via covalent conjugation. Along the effort to identify the primary target proteins, we designed N-propargyl celastrol amide as a small molecule probe for affinity pulldown of celastrol-modified proteins. We are pleased to report our success in the identification of GRP78 as a major primary target for celastrol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should explain why RNA-sequencing was performed using Nano-celastrol-treated mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your question. We have been working on two pharmacological aspects, bioavailability and molecular mechanisms, towards the development of clinically useful celastrol preparations. As mentioned in the manuscript, our previous study reported the preparation of Nano-celastrol by entrapping celastrol in PEG-PCL nanomicelles for safe control of body weight (Zhao et al. 2019). Nano-celastrol showed competitive efficacy and less gastrointestinal retention relative to free celastrol. As for transcriptomic profiles, a previous study reported the global transcriptional response at genes and enhancers to the natural medicinal compound celastrol (Dukler N, et al. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals a dynamic global transcriptional response at genes and enhancers to the natural medicinal compound celastrol. Genome Res. 2017 Nov;27(11):1816-1829). Thus, we performed RNA-sequencing to profile the transcriptional response to Nano-celastrol in mice. Indeed, our RNA-Seq profiling revealed the effects of Nano-celastrol on the biomarkers of ER stress, inflammation, lipolysis, lipogenesis and thermogenesis. Importantly, such information well supported the conclusion in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 8, the images should be clearly labelled with celastrol-PEG4-alkyne or celastrol in the incubation with the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We have properly labelled the images in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 8, the labeling of celastrol-PEG4-alkyne appeared to be more extensive than the immunostaining of GRP78. The authors should discuss the binding of celastrol to other cellular proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. The extensive labelling with celastrol-PEG4-alkyne may be attributed to three factors: (1) the different brightness and sensitivities of green and red fluorophores, (2) non-specific binding and (3) actual binding of celastrol-PEG4-alkyne to other minor proteins. We have updated such discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Figure 1 and Figure 2. These results can be further strengthened by including the protein and/or mRNA expression of the upstream and downstream regulators of ER stress.

We fully agree with the reviewer on the importance to determine the protein and/or mRNA expression of the upstream and downstream regulators of ER stress. We performed new experiments and determined the effects of celastrol on the expression of GRP78 and related ER stress signaling proteins in livers and epididymal fat pads by Western blotting. We have added the new results into the revised Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 3. At least, a quantification of Figure 3 showing the changes in the relative number of immune cell infiltration and their respective GRP78 expression should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much. We highly respect you for your comments. We are aware of the technical inaccuracy in the quantification of the fluorescence signals in tissues, especially for enumerating cells. We performed new experiments to analyze the protein levels of GRP78 and related ER stress signaling biomarkers in livers and epididymal fat pads by Western blotting. The blots were quantified by a densitometric method. Thus, we included the new results in the revised Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4. Authors should discuss why the major regulators of canonical ER stress pathway are not in the list of differentially expressed genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your question. Based on standard bioinformatics analysis, the list of differentially expressed genes recruited the genes with the change of &gt; 2-fold. On the other hand, the major regulators of canonical ER stress pathway are mainly the sensors for ER stress. The minimal changes of ER stress regulators may result in the sufficient effects on the biomarkers of inflammation, lipolysis, lipogenesis and thermogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

As a proof of concept, one possibility is to use giant mammalian cells like U2OS or H9C2 which are better suited for subcellular compartment studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. We fully agree with the reviewer on the expression and localization of GRP78 in macrophages. Macrophages are the major cell type for handling the dietary lipids, especially in the transformation into foam cells, and thereby frequently used as the cell model for studying inflammation and lipid metabolism. As for the broad distribution, GRP78 may be localized in the ER compartment as its primary localization or transported to the cell surface under stress (Arap MA et al. Cell surface expression of the stress response chaperone GRP78 enables tumor targeting by circulating ligands. Cancer Cell. 2004 Sep;6(3):275-84). Per your suggestion, it would be interesting to study the effects of fatty acids on the expression and localization of GRP78 in giant mammalian cells like U2OS or H9C2 in a separated study. Indeed, we have published several papers with H9C2 in the context of myocardial infarction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. An important experiment that the authors should consider is to show that how much of the effect of celastrol is through GRP78? Anti-inflammatory and lipolytic effects of celastrol should be studied after a genetic or siRNA mediated knock down of GRP78 under conditions of lipotoxicity and celastrol treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. The present study was designed to identify the celastrol-modified proteins. Indeed, we successfully identified GRP78 as a major target protein for celastrol and proved that celastrol could attenuate the chaperone activity of GRP78. Based on careful literature review, it has been well-established that ER stress promotes lipogenesis and inflammation (Kim JY et al. ER Stress Drives Lipogenesis and Steatohepatitis via Caspase-2 Activation of S1P. Cell. 2018 Sep 20;175(1):133-145.e15; Lee JS et al. Pharmacological ER stress promotes hepatic lipogenesis and lipid droplet formation. Am J Transl Res. 2012;4(1):102-13. Epub 2012 Jan 6). The present study demonstrated that celastrol suppressed the expression of ER stress mediators, inflammatory and lipogenic genes while promoted lipolytic and thermogenic genes. Collectively, it is reasonable to propose an important role for the formation of celastrol-GRP78 conjugate. Again, we highly appreciate the reviewer for your constructive suggestions. Indeed, we designed another study to further examine the anti-inflammatory and lipolytic effects of celastrol and celastrol derivatives using different technologies including AAV-mediated knockdown of GRP78 in cell models and animal models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Authors have relied on macrophage cells to show the binding and localization of celastrol with GRP78.

GRP78 is an abundant and ubiquitous protein and governs a common ER stress signaling pathway. In view of the role of macrophages in the metabolism of lipids, we selected macrophages as cell model to demonstrate a general pharmacological phenomenon. Moreover, animal experiments showed overall response to HFD and celastrol treatment. Therefore, it may be better to keep the current title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.

Our previous study has already evaluated the effect of celastrol on the cell viability in RAW264.7 cells over a period of 48 h (Luo D et al. Natural product celastrol suppressed macrophage M1 polarization against inflammation in diet-induced obese mice via regulating Nrf2/HO-1, MAP kinase and NF-κB pathways. Aging (Albany NY). 2017 Oct 16;9(10):2069-2082). We found that celastrol could exhibit detectable cytotoxicity when the concentration was raised up to 1.25 μM (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Celastrol eventually exhibited the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.69 μM against the growth of RAW264.7 cells. We thereby treated RAW264.7 cells with celastrol at the concentrations below 1.25 μM for other experiments. Therefore, 1μM of celastrol wouldn't induce any cytotoxicity in RAW264.7 after incubation for 8 hours.
