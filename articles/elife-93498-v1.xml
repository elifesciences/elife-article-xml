by similar stimuli. This organization of synaptic inputs, called synaptic clustering, is required for high-fidelity signal processing, and clustered synapses can already be observed before eye opening. However, how clustered inputs emerge during development is unknown. Here, we employed concurrent in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp and dendritic calcium imaging to map spontaneous synaptic inputs to dendrites of layer 2/3 neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex during the second postnatal week until eye opening. We found that the number of functional synapses and the frequency of transmission events increase several fold during this developmental period. At the beginning of the second postnatal week, synapses assemble specifically in confined dendritic segments, whereas other segments are devoid of synapses. By the end of the second postnatal week, just before eye opening, dendrites are almost entirely covered by domains of co-active synapses. Finally, co-activity with their neighbor synapses correlates with synaptic stabilization and potentiation. Thus, clustered synapses form in distinct functional domains presumably to equip dendrites with computational modules for high-capacity sensory processing when the eyes open.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd><kwd>spines</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp methodology</kwd><kwd>in utero electroporation</kwd><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>819.02.017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>822.02.006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALWOP.216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OCENW.KLEIN.535</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>865.12.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9126021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OCENW.M.22.310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stichting Vrienden van het Herseninstituut</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>805254845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo calcium imaging in visual cortex neurons before eye opening shows that clustered synaptic inputs develop in dendritic domains, which may be precursors of computational subunits after eye opening.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Building a functional brain requires neuronal circuits to be wired up with high specificity via synapses between connecting neurons. Developing neurons select their synaptic partners based on molecular cues such as adhesion molecules and subsequently refine their connections through activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, stabilization and elimination driven by spontaneous network activity, and later, after the onset sensory function, by experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cline, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanes and Zipursky, 2020</xref>). Electron microscopy revealed that excitatory synapses between neurons emerge during the end of the first postnatal week in mouse and rat sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blue and Parnavelas, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Felipe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller and Peters, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wildenberg et al., 2023</xref>). The addition of new synapses peaks at the end of the second postnatal week and synapse density in the primary visual and somatosensory cortices approaches adult levels once the eyes open at postnatal day (P) 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blue and Parnavelas, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Felipe et al., 1997</xref>). While these structural studies clearly showed the importance of this developmental period for adding large numbers of synaptic connections in emerging circuits, how cortical dendrites establish functional inputs has not been investigated on the level of individual synapses in vivo.</p><p>In the adult cortex, synaptic inputs to dendrites are highly organized with subcellular specificity. Recent studies demonstrated that synaptic inputs of cortical pyramidal cells are clustered, such that synapses with similar activity patterns or stimulus selectivity are located near each other along their dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ju et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerlin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scholl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>). Since pyramidal cell dendrites integrate local inputs supra-linearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branco and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>), this arrangement of clustered inputs is thought to allow for local synaptic integration in dendritic computational subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larkum, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larkum and Nevian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Major et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015</xref>). Local dendritic integration dramatically increases the computational power of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, experimentally blocking supra-linear dendritic integration disturbs sensory stimulus sensitivity and selectivity in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, learning is associated with structural plasticity of clustered synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hedrick et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Makino and Malinow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McBride et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these studies highlight the fundamental importance of the subcellular organization of synaptic inputs along dendrites.</p><p>This raises the question of how the precise subcellular organization of synapses is achieved during development. Synaptic clustering can be observed early on in the developing visual system of tadpoles and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Podgorski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that synaptic inputs develop with some degree of specificity, but the trajectory of functional synaptic input development has been unclear. Specifically, it is unknown (1) when synaptic inputs become clustered, (2) whether synapses are formed in a clustered state or arise in a random state to become sorted into clusters later, and (3) whether synapses with similar input patterns distribute smoothly along dendrites or emerge in distinct domains.</p><p>Here, we performed in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with two-photon calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helmchen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svoboda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>) of mouse primary visual cortex layer 2/3 neurons, allowing us to map functional synaptic inputs across dendritic arborizations in the course of the second postnatal week. We combined resonant scanning with piezo-driven focusing to image large proportions of a neuron’s dendrites. The total dendritic length imaged per neuron was almost 10 times larger than in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>), allowing us to map the large-scale distribution of synapses along developing dendrites.</p><p>We found that the number of functional synapses and the frequency of transmission events at individual synapses increase rapidly before eye opening. Furthermore, we observed that clustered synaptic inputs accumulate in spatially and functionally separated domains already at the beginning of the second postnatal week. By the end of the second postnatal week, dendrites had become almost entirely covered by functional domains of co-active neighbors, most likely through local plasticity driven by coincident spontaneous network activity. Thus, already before eye opening functional domains develop in cortical dendrites, which can serve as distinct computational modules for processing visual stimuli thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping synaptic inputs onto spine and shaft synapses</title><p>To visualize the activity and spatial organization of functional excitatory synapses in the developing mouse primary visual cortex, we imaged spontaneously occurring synaptic calcium transients in apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in L2/3 using the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Together, these dendrites hosted 354 functional synapses, which produced 3440 synaptic transmission events.

Spines provide some chemical and electrical isolation from the dendrite’s shaft and produce clearly detectable calcium signals evoked by presynaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, during development, many cortical synapses are formed directly onto the shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller and Peters, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wildenberg et al., 2023</xref>), where synaptic calcium transients are masked by calcium influx triggered by back-propagating action potentials. Therefore, we prevented action potential firing by recording layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in voltage-clamp mode during imaging and the intracellular sodium channel blocker QX314 in the patch-pipette.

To quantify changes in activity over time, we determined the Mann–Kendall score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hussain and Mahmud, 2019</xref>) for each synapse. This score is positive for monotonic increases, negative for decreases, and zero in the absence of changes. Thus, synapses that increased in transmission frequency across recordings of an experiment yielded positive scores, those that underwent synaptic depression (i.e., decreased in transmission frequency) yielded negative scores, and those that maintained activity levels scored at zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that the Mann–Kendall score was more negative outside than inside domains, indicating that on average synapses outside domains tended to decrease in activity over time, whereas those inside domains showed a more positive activity trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Next, we compared each synapse’s Mann–Kendall score of synaptic plasticity with its local co-activity within 10 µm proximally and distally along the dendrite and revealed a significant positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>), demonstrating that synapses that were synchronized with their neighbors became stabilized or more active compared to those that were out of sync with their neighbors.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Local co-activity of synapses inside dendritic domains correlated with synaptic potentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of two layer 2/3 pyramidal cell dendrites at P12 (D5, D9).

Many recent studies show that synaptic inputs to excitatory neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus are clustered, such that synapses representing similar stimulus features are located near each other. However, when and how structured synaptic inputs assemble during development has been unclear. Here, we show that synaptic inputs to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mouse visual cortex are structurally and functionally organized in distinct dendritic domains already during the second postnatal week, that is, before eye opening and detailed visual input. Furthermore, we find that local co-activity within dendritic domains correlates with synaptic activity changes, indicating that synapses are sorted into distinct functional dendritic domains through plasticity mechanisms driven by spontaneous network activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>We obtained insight into the spatial organization of synaptic inputs onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cell dendrites by mapping synaptic transmission during spontaneously occurring network activity in vivo. Hence, the observed synaptic activity is the result of an interaction between the firing patterns of presynaptic neurons and the features of the individual synapses on the monitored neuron. Therefore, it is important to understand which properties of synaptic inputs we can infer from the recorded input patterns. Firstly, we observed that the distribution of synaptic transmission frequencies is very long-tailed: most synapses show only rare transmission events, whereas roughly 20% of synapses are highly active. In contrast, the largest population of input neurons (i.e., other layer 2/3 pyramidal cells) show very homogeneous firing activity during neonatal spontaneous network events where all neurons participate at a similar rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rochefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, the distribution we observed here for individual synapses is most likely determined by release probability differences between individual presynaptic terminals along the dendrite. Furthermore, our current findings are congruent with our previous results, which show that the transmission frequency of individual synapses is highly plastic and regulated over a large range by local synaptic interactions and a push-pull mechanism between mature BDNF and proBDNF in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niculescu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, transmission frequency is a synapse feature of large dynamic range that is most likely harnessed by the developing circuit to adjust connection strength in response to fine-scale activity patterns. This conclusion is supported by a previous study reporting that differences in cortico-cortical synaptic connections are mostly based on differences in synaptic release probabilities, and that these release probabilities change in response to altered input patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markram et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the amplitude of calcium transients in axonal boutons varies over an order of magnitude, most likely representing a similar degree of variability in release probability, in juvenile rat layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koester and Sakmann, 2000</xref>).</p><p>How many independent inputs, that is, from unique presynaptic neurons, become connected to one dendritic domain? We observed a mean increase from three to six synapses per domain during the second postnatal week. In the adult, connected cortical neurons typically connect through fewer than 10 synapses, most of which are located on different dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feldmeyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Winfield et al., 1981</xref>). However, axons that establish more than one synapse with individual dendritic segments have been observed as well. For example, in the mature somatosensory cortex, approximately 10% of synapses are redundant, that is, dendritic segments receive another synapse (or more) from the same axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>). At the ages investigated in the present study, synapse density is lower than that in the mature sensory cortex and redundant synapses most likely rarer. Nevertheless, our data set probably contains redundant synapses, too. Interestingly, full connectomic reconstruction of mature cortical dendrites and their presynaptic axons suggested that synaptic partner selection based on coincident activity may be responsible for the formation of multiple synapses of one axon with the same dendritic segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that multiple innervation may be generated through the here-described plasticity mechanism that helps shape domains of co-active synapses.</p><p>In the mature visual system, V1 pyramidal cell synaptic inputs are clustered, such that similar stimulus features are represented by neighboring synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). This input organization is thought to underlie local dendritic computations that maximize the computational power of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</xref>). In fact, perturbing local dendritic integration has been shown to decrease the sensitivity or selectivity of cortical neurons to stimuli of different modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Which stimulus features may be encoded by synaptic domains established before eye opening? In the adult, neighboring synapses are more likely to share receptive field properties than more distant synapses. For example, in ferret V1 layer 2/3 neurons, synapses are clustered according to orientation preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>), whereas in mouse V1 layer 2/3 neurons, synapses are clustered based on receptive field localization within the visual field, as well as receptive field similarity, but not on orientation preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, different sensory input features can be arranged in neighborhoods along dendrites, but exactly which features are clustered differs between species. In the retina, spontaneously generated activity travels in waves with specific directions as well as wavefronts of defined orientations. In addition, neighboring neurons are frequently co-active during wave propagating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meister et al., 1991</xref>). Hence, retinal waves encode retinotopy as well as direction and orientation selectivity. Since wave activity in retinal ganglion cells is transmitted along the central visual pathways from the retina to the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>), retinal waves can shape dendritic domains based on neighborhood relationships of retinal ganglion cells representing location in visual space, and orientation and direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirchner and Gjorgjieva, 2021</xref>). Finally, our observation that functional synapses form in distinct domains along dendrites, whereas other dendritic segments are devoid of synapses at the beginning of the second postnatal week, indicates that synapses cluster in defined domains rather than distributing evenly along dendrites.</p><p>Together, patterned spontaneous activity can be sufficient to sort synaptic inputs into domains to establish discrete computational modules along dendrites to prepare the visual cortex for processing with high sensitivity and selectivity before the eyes open. This ‘first guess’ will be refined further by visual inputs after eye opening, based on the statistics of sensory inputs in the actual environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Cells co-expressed the fluorescent protein DsRed for somatic targeting and structural information.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In utero electroporation</title><p>Constructs were introduced through in utero electroporation at E16.5. Pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex were transfected with GCaMP6s (2 mg/ml) and DsRed (0.5–2 mg/ml) at E16.5 using in utero electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>). Pregnant mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and a small incision (1.5–2 cm) was made in the abdominal wall. The uterine horns were removed from the abdomen, and DNA (1 µl) was injected into the lateral ventricle of embryos using a sharp glass pipette. Voltage pulses (five square wave pulses, 30 V, 50 ms duration, 950 ms interval, custom-built electroporator) were delivered across the brain with tweezer electrodes covered in conductive gel. Uterine horns were rinsed with warm saline solution and carefully returned to the abdomen, after which the muscle and skin were sutured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging</title><p>The surgery and stabilization for the in vivo calcium imaging experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>). Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, which was reduced to 0.7–1% after surgery. We previously reported that although this low level of anesthesia does reduce the frequency of spontaneous network events, relative to that seen in awake animals, it does not change the basic properties of spontaneous network activity, such as participation rates and event amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we found previously that synaptic inputs are organized very similarly in vivo under light anesthesia and in slice cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that the activity patterns investigated here are not or only slightly affected by low-level anesthesia. Glass electrodes (4.5–6 MΩ) were fluorescently coated with BSA-Alexa 594 to allow targeted whole-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>) of layer 2/3 neurons located in V1, based on published coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paxinos et al., 1991</xref>) and our previous experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leighton et al., 2021</xref>). To visualize synaptic inputs, action potentials were blocked with QX314 in the intracellular solution (120 mM CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 8 mM NaCl, 15 mM CsCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM QX-314 bromide, 4 mM MgATP, and 0.3 mM Na-GTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>). Currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode at 10 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz (Multiclamp 700b; Molecular Devices). To facilitate the detection of synaptic calcium transients, neurons were depolarized to –30 mV to increase NMDA receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>). When switching to –30 mV, the baseline fluorescence of the patched neurons increased, but not of the neighboring neurons, allowing unequivocal identification of all dendrites in the imaged volume that belonged to the patched neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). No correction was made for the liquid junction potential. Barrages were identified as fast-rising inward currents of at least 10 pA, followed by a return to baseline, which consisted of multiple synaptic currents and were separated by at least 3 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>In vivo calcium imaging was performed on a Nikon (A1R-MP) with a 0.8/16× water-immersion objective and a Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon II, Coherent). Dendrites were imaged at 5–15 Hz with a pixel size of 0.32 µm in single planes or small stacks with planes spaced 1.5–2 µm. We recorded the movement signal of the scan mirrors to synchronize calcium imaging and electrophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image processing</title><p>To remove drift and movement artifacts from each recording, we performed drift correction using NoRMCorre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017</xref>). Each recording was aligned to the first recording in the series to remove any movements between recording sessions. Delta-F stacks were made using the average fluorescence per pixel as baseline. Local synaptic calcium transients were clearly detectable in the delta-F stacks.</p><p>Regions of interest (ROIs), representing putative synapses, were hand-drawn using ImageJ (NIH) at sites where spines were visible and at clearly observed activity sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, all remaining dendritic segments were filled with ROIs to ensure that no sites were missed. Putative synaptic transmission events were automatically identified across all ROIs as mean fluorescence increases that were at least twofold higher than the noise level. These putative signals were then manually reviewed using the full image recordings. Signals were rejected if they were shorter than two frames or coincided with movement. Furthermore, we ensured that there was a clearly visible local maximum at the location of the synapse and that it was stable for the duration of the signal. Automated transient detection and further data processing were performed using custom-made MATLAB (MathWorks) and Python software (Python Software Foundation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leighton et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Identification of spine and shaft synapses</title><p>We identified spine and shaft synapses as follows. Synaptic calcium transients that occurred in small appendages from the dendrite were defined as transmission events at spine synapses (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Synaptic calcium transients located in the center of the dendrite, but at sites that showed small, sharply confined areas of increased fluorescence and where 3D reconstructions suggested that a spine may be located above or below the dendrite in the z-dimension were defined as spine transmission events as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Synaptic calcium transients that occurred in the center of ‘smooth’ dendritic stretches (without clearly defined spots of increased brightness) were identified as transmission events at shaft synapses (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Since the z-resolution of two-photon microscopy is lower in the z-dimension than in xy, we may have misidentified spine synapses as shaft synapses in a few cases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>One dendrite was imaged from each animal except once, when two dendrites were imaged in a single cell in a P12 animal. We used only synaptic sites that were active with a transmission frequency of at least 0.03 per minute. We tested whether the localization of functional synapses was structured or random along the dendrite. To establish randomized distributions of synapse positions, we first assigned ‘empty’ positions between the positions of actual functional synapses such that the entire imaged dendrite was covered with real or empty positions at the typical minimal inter-synapse distance (4 ± 1 µm). Next we determined all pair-wise distances between all synapses and all empty locations along dendrites using the Shortest Path with Obstacle Avoidance function of MATLAB. Then we shuffled all functional synapses across the real and empty positions randomly. For each shuffle and the observed localizations, we determined the distances of each synapse to its nearest proximal and distal neighbors. Finally, we compared the results of 100 shuffles with the observed distribution using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.</p><p>The co-activity of a given synapse (e.g., with its neighbors within 10 µm, with its neighbors in the same domain or with synapses in other domains) was determined by dividing the number of transmission events at the observed synapse by the number of transmission events of the comparison group (e.g., its neighbors) during the same barrages when the observed synapse was active. This number was divided by the number of synapses in the comparison group to normalize to the size of the comparison group. We defined co-activity based on co-transmission during the same barrage because we had previously discovered that co-activity during barrages is crucial for local synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Domains were defined as dendritic segments that contained at least one high-activity synapse (see ‘Results’ for definition). If the distance between two high-activity synapses was 10 µm or less, both were assigned to the same domain. Normal synapses (those that were not high-activity synapses) were assigned to a domain if their distance to the nearest high-activity synapse was 10 µm or less. Normal synapses located between two high-activity synapses from distinct domains with 20 µm or less distance were assigned to the domain of the closer high-activity synapses. The extent of dendritic domains was determined as the distance between its most distant members. The length was padded at the edges with 5 µm from a high-activity synapse if there was no normal member within this distance. Thus single high-activity synapse domains had a length of 10 µm.</p><p>For normally distributed data and data with relatively low sample numbers (6–8), where normality tests are underpowered, we used paired and unpaired, two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests as recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Winter, 2013</xref>). For data that were not normally distributed, we used nonparametric statistical comparisons, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests for independent samples and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired data. To test whether investigated parameters changed with age, we performed linear regression analyses. To test the differences between distributions, we used a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences under Central Committee Animal experiments (CCD) license AVD-801002015249.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-93498-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data and code to reproduce the figures can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/s/3321a023e1da75a15676">https://figshare.com/s/3321a023e1da75a15676</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leighton</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheyne</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Dendritic domain development</data-title><source>figshare</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.6084/m9.figshare.22674748.v3</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jan Kirchner and Julijana Gjorgjieva for discussions, Christiaan Levelt for sharing plasmids, and Helmut Kessels, Alexander Heimel, Wei Wei, David Cabrera, Tamara Buijs, and Julijana Gjorgjieva for critically reading this article.

The voltage-clamp mode is a major improvement over the pioneer versions of this combinatorial experiment that had led to major breakthroughs in the neuroscience field for visualizing and understanding synaptic input activities in single cells in-vivo (sharp electrodes: Svoboda et al, Nature 1997, Helmchen et al, Nature Neurosci 1999; whole-cell current-clamp: Jia et al, Nature 2010, Chen et al, Nature 2011. I suggest that these papers would be cited). This is because in voltage-clamp mode, despite a full control of membrane voltage in-vivo is not realistic, is nevertheless most effective in preventing back-propagation action potentials, which would severely confound the measurement of individual synaptically-induced Ca2+ influx events. Furthermore, clamping the cell body at a strongly depolarized potential (here the authors did -30mV) also facilitates the detection of synaptically-induced Ca2+ influx. As a result, the authors successfully recorded high-quality Ca2+ imaging data that can be used for precise analysis. To date, even in view of the rapid progress of voltage-sensitive indicators and relevant imaging technologies in the recent years, this very old 'art' of combining single-cell electrophysiology and two-photon imaging (ordinary, raster-scanned, video-rate imaging) of Ca2+ signals still enable measurements of the best-level precision.</p><p>On the other hand, the interpretation of data in this study is a bit narrow-minded and lacks a comprehensive picture.

However, caution shall be taken here, because the optical resolution under in-vivo imaging conditions like this cannot reliably tell apart whether a bright spot within or partially overlapping a segment of dendrite is a spine on top (or below) of it. Therefore, what the authors consider as a 'shaft synapse' (by detecting Ca2+ hotspots) has an unknown probability to be just a spine on top or below the dendrite.

However, it has been unclear when this spatial organization of co-active synapses arises during development. In this manuscript, Leighton et al. investigate the emergence of spatially organized, co-active synapses on pyramidal dendrites in the mouse visual cortex before eye opening. They find that some dendrite segments contain highly active synapses that are co-active with their neighbors as early as postnatal day (P) 8-10, and that these domains of co-active synapses increase their coverage of the dendritic arbor by P12-13. Interestingly, Leighton et al. demonstrate that synapses co-active with their neighbors are more likely to increase their activity across a single recording session, compared to synapses that are not co-active with their neighbors, suggesting local plasticity driven by coincident activity before eye opening.</p><p>The current manuscript includes some replication of earlier results from the same research group (Winnubst et al., 2015), including the presence of clustered, co-active synapses in the visual cortex of mouse pups, and the finding that synapses co-active with their neighbors show an increase in transmission frequency during a recording session. The main novelty in the current study compared to Winnubst et al. (2015) is the inclusion of younger animals (P8-13 in the current study compared to P10-15 in Winnubst et al., 2015). The current manuscript is the first demonstration that active synapses are clustered on specific dendrite segments as early as P8-10 in the mouse visual cortex, and the first to show the progression in active synapse distribution along the dendrite during the 2nd postnatal week. These results from visual cortex may help inform our understanding of sensory development more broadly.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors ask a novel question about the emergence of synaptic spatial organization, and they use well-chosen techniques that directly address their questions despite the challenging nature of these techniques. To capture both structural and functional information from dendrites simultaneously, the authors performed whole-cell voltage clamp to record synaptic currents arriving at the soma while imaging calcium influx at individual synaptic sites on dendrites. The simultaneous voltage clamp and calcium imaging allowed the authors to isolate individual synaptic inputs without their occlusion by widespread calcium influx from back-propagating action potentials. Achieving in vivo dendrite imaging in live mice that are as young as P8 is challenging, and the resulting data provides a unique view of synaptic activity along individual dendrites in the visual cortex at an early stage in development that is otherwise difficult to assess.</p><p>The authors provide convincing evidence that synapses are more likely to be co-active with their neighbors compared to synapses located farther away (Fig. 6F-H), and that synapses co-active with their neighbors increase their transmission frequency during a recording session (Fig. 7C). These findings are particularly interesting given that the recordings occur before eye opening, suggesting a relationship between co-activity and local synaptic plasticity even before the onset of detailed visual input. These results replicate previously published findings from P10-15 pups (Winnubst et al., 2015), increasing confidence in the reproducibility of the data.</p><p>The authors also provide novel data documenting for the first time spatially organized, co-active synapses in pups as young as P8. Comparing the younger (P8-10) and older (P12-13) pups, provides insight into how clusters of co-active synapses might emerge during development.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The P8-10 vs P12-13 age comparisons are the primary novel finding in this manuscript, and it is therefore critical to avoid systematic age differences in the methods and analysis whenever possible. In their rebuttal and revised manuscript the authors have acceptably addressed prior concerns regarding this important point, as well as most of the other methodological issues raised.</p><p>One point addressed in the rebuttal, but not corrected in the manuscript relates to the reliable localization of cells to visual cortex.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93498.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Leighton</surname><given-names>Alexandra H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cheyne</surname><given-names>Juliette E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using concurrent in vivo whole-cell patch clamp and dendritic calcium imaging, the authors characterized how functional synaptic inputs across dendritic arborizations of mouse primary visual cortex layer 2/3 neurons emerge during the second postnatal week.

The voltage-clamp mode is a major improvement over the pioneer versions of this combinatorial experiment that has led to major breakthroughs in the neuroscience field for visualizing and understanding synaptic input activities in single cells in-vivo (sharp electrodes: Svoboda et al, Nature 1997, Helmchen et al, Nature Neurosci 1999; whole-cell current-clamp: Jia et al, Nature 2010, Chen et al, Nature 2011. I suggest that these papers would be cited). This is because in voltage-clamp mode, despite the full control of membrane voltage in-vivo not being realistic, is nevertheless most effective in preventing back-propagation action potentials, which would severely confound the measurement of individual synaptically-induced Ca2+ influx events. Furthermore, clamping the cell body at a strongly depolarized potential (here the authors did -30mV) also facilitates the detection of synaptically-induced Ca2+ influx. As a result, the authors successfully recorded high-quality Ca2+ imaging data that can be used for precise analysis. To date, even in view of the rapid progress of voltage-sensitive indicators and relevant imaging technologies in recent years, this very old 'art' of combining single-cell electrophysiology and two-photon imaging (ordinary, raster-scanned, video-rate imaging) of Ca2+ signals still enables measurements of the best level precision.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for reminding us of these important previous studies that we cite now in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, the interpretation of data in this study is a bit narrow-minded and lacks a comprehensive picture. Some suggestions to improve the manuscript are as follows:</p><p>(1) The authors made a segregation of 'spine synapse' and 'shaft synapse' based solely on the two photon images in-vivo. However, caution shall be taken here, because the optical resolution under in vivo imaging conditions like this cannot reliably tell apart whether a bright spot within or partially overlapping a segment of the dendrite is a spine on top of (or below) it.

If there is other imaging data of higher axial resolution to validate or calibrate, the authors shall take some further considerations or analysis to check the consistency of their data, as the authors do need such a segregation between spine and shaft synapses to show how they evolve over the brain development stages.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the differentiation between spine and sha synapses can be difficult for those spines that are located above or below the dendric sha in the z-dimension because of the lower resolution of 2-photon microscopy in the z-dimension compared to the image plane. We have now added a new paragraph to the Methods section to describe in more detail how we identify spine and sha synapses and provide more examples in a new supplementary figure (Fig S5). We believe that we can identify spine and sha synapses reliably in most cases, but added a cautionary note to make the reader aware of potential misidentifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The use of terminology 'bursts of spontaneous inputs' for describing voltage-clamp data seems improper. Conventionally, 'burst' refers to suprathreshold spike firing events, but here, the authors use 'burst' to refer to inward synaptic currents collected at the cell body. Not every excitatory synaptic input (or ensemble of inputs) activation will lead to spike firing under naturalistic conditions, therefore, these two concepts are not equivalent.

Again, the authors drew arbitrary time windows to clump the events for statistical analysis.

We would like to point out that we did determine the percentage of calcium transients that occurred during barrages of synaptic inputs (~60%, page 7). This is important, since the barrages in our patch-clamp recordings most likely reflect spontaneous network events as described in the developing cortex previously by us and many other labs . The time window we chose was not “arbitrary” as the reviewer suggests, but based on the duration of the barrages of synaptic inputs as defined in the Methods section.</p><p>The reason, why we did not perform a more in-depth analysis of the temporal relationship between synaptic calcium transients and synaptic input currents is that it is essentially impossible to relate calcium transients at individual synapses to specific synaptic input events. First, during barrages of synaptic inputs many synapses are active simultaneously, both in the mapped dendrites as well as in the un-observed parts of the dendric arborization as the reviewer notes above. Thus, barrages cannot be broken down into individual synaptic transmission events. Second, since our acquisition frequency is ~10 Hz, we can identify the onset of individual synaptic calcium transients with 100-200 ms precision (1 or 2 frames). However, throughout any 100-200 ms period of recording, several synapses are active across the entire dendric arborization such that we cannot assign a given calcium transient to a specific EPSC within a 100-200 ms epoch. Third, due to the limited clamping capacity of in vivo patch recordings, we cannot be certain that individual transmission events in distal dendrites can be resolved in the patch recording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors claim that &quot;these observations indicate that the activity patterns investigated here are not or only slightly affected by low-level anesthesia&quot;. It would be nice to show some of the recordings in this work without any anesthesia to support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the conclusion that the patterns of activity are only slightly affected by low levels of anesthesia is based on our previous recordings on the network level. Unfortunately, we are still not able to record calcium imaging with single synapse resolution in unanesthezed developing mice (and no one else is as far as we know), because the skull of these young animals is not firm, yet. As a consequence, movements cannot be reduced sufficiently for patching and imaging with single synapse resolution. Our previously published (Siegel et al., 2012) and unpublished work on the cellular level suggests that activity patterns during light anesthesia are very similar to those during sleep in mouse pups at this age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review)</bold>:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There is a growing body of litterature on the clustering of co-active synapses in adult mice, which has important implications for understanding dendritic integration and sensory processing more broadly.

The P8-10 vs P12-13 age comparisons are the primary novel finding in this manuscript, and it is, therefore, critical to avoid systematic age differences in the methods and analysis whenever possible. Specific concerns related to the age comparisons are listed below:</p><p>(1) Given that the same research group previously published P12-13 data (Winnubst et al., 2015), it is unclear whether both age groups in the current study were imaged/analyzed in parallel by the same researcher(s), or whether previous data was used for the P12-13 group.</p></disp-quote><p>While indeed the approach in the present study is similar to that of our previous study (Winnubst et al. 2015), the data set presented here is entirely new. The current study was made possible by a new microscope that allows combining resonant scanning with piezo-focusing to image large fractions of the dendric arborization. In fact, we could now image almost 10 times larger dendric segments including branch points than in our previous study. One author contributed to the experiments in both studies. Image analysis of all experiments was performed by the first author of the present study who was not involved in the Winnubst et al. work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors mention that they used 2 different microscopes, and used a fairly wide range of imaging frame rates (5-15 Hz). It is unclear from the current manuscript whether the same imaging parameters were used across the two age groups. If data for the two experimental groups was collected separately, perhaps at different times, by a different person, or on a different microscope, there is a concern that some differences between the groups may not necessarily be due to age.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer mentions that the experimental settings are not identical across the experiments of this study. In the original manuscript we erroneously reported in the Methods section that 2 different setups were used for this study; however, all experiments were performed on the same microscope. We have corrected this in the new manuscript. We took timelapse recordings of small stacks of varying depth to cover as many dendrites as possible in each recording, therefore, we needed to adjust the rate of acquired stacks within a certain range as the reviewer points out. The data were acquired by two scientists during an overlapping period. And while the different ages were not recorded in a strictly randomized fashion, they were not acquired in sequence according to ages, but rather involved many attempts on animals of different ages from many different litters. For each litter a small percentage of animals would generate successful recordings, and the ages of these successes were random. Therefore, we believe that neither the collection of data nor the analysis (see point above) affected the differences we describe here for the two age groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is unclear whether the image analysis was performed blind to age. Blinding to age during analysis is particularly important for this study, in which it was not possible to blind to age during imaging due to visible differences in size and developmental stage between younger and older pups.</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis was not setup to be performed blind to age. Not only is the age of the animal apparent at the stage (as the reviewer points out), also the number of spines and the activity levels clearly show differences between neurons only a few days apart. However, all age-related findings reported in this study - except the increase in synapse density and activity - became apparent to us only after the full set of synaptic transmission events was determined and the analysis was performed on the entire data set, making it very unlikely that event detection was biased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The relatively low N (where N is the number of dendrites or the number of mice) in this study is acceptable due to the challenging nature of the techniques used, but unintentional sampling bias is a concern. For example, if higher-order dendrites from the apical tuft were imaged at P12-13, while more segments of the apical trunk were imaged at P8-10, this could inadvertently create apparent age differences that were in fact due to dendrite location on the arbor or dendrite depth.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer points out that sampling bias with respect to synapse location along dendrites in the dataset could lead to falsely apparent age differences. In all experiments we imaged dendrites of layer 2/3 neurons that were relatively close to the cortical surface to optimize image quality. In addition, we confirmed that the mean distance of the imaged dendric stretches from the cell body was similar between the dendrites of each age group (Young: 392 +/- 104 µm, Old: 323 +/- 118 µm; mean +/- STD). Therefore, we do not think that sampling bias affected these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional general methodological concerns, which are not specifically related to the age comparisons, are listed below:</p><p>(5) The authors assert that clustered, co-active synapses emerge in the visual cortex before eye-opening, which is an important finding in that it suggests this phenomention is driven by spontaneous activity rather than visual input. However, this finding hinges on the imaged cells being reliably located in the visual cortex, which is difficult to identify with certainty in animals that have not yet opened their eyes and therefore cannot undergo intrinsic signal imaging to demarcate the boundaries of the visual cortex. If the imaged cells were in, for example, nearby somatosensory cortex, then the observed spatial organization could be due to sensory input rather than spontaneous activity.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer argues that if the neurons included in our analysis were located in non-visual sensory cortex, e.g. the somatosensory cortex, sensory experience might have shaped clustered inputs instead of spontaneous activity. We are, however, certain that the neurons were located inside the primary visual cortex. In previous experiments where we performed the same craniotomies, we mapped spontaneous activity across the sensory areas in the occipital neocortex and we know the exact location of V1 which is already very consistent during the second postnatal week. (See for example Supplemental Figure 4 in Leighton et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It is unclear how the authors defined a synaptic transmission event in the GCaMP signal (e.g. whether there was a quantitative deltaF/F threshold).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we describe the procedure of identifying synaptic calcium transients in more detail and added a new supplemental figure to clarify this aspect of the analysis. In short, we use an automated detection with a 2x standard deviation threshold and a subsequent manual control and selection step. Please, find all details in the Methods section and Figure S4 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors' division of synapses into spine vs shaft is unconvincing due to the difficulty of identifying Z-projecting spines in images from 2-photon microscopy, where the Z resolution is insufficient to definitively identify Z-projecting spines, and the fact that spines in young animals may be thin and dim. The authors' examples of spine synapses (e.g. in Fig. 2A) are convincing, but some of the putative shaft synapses may in fact be on spines.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the differentiation between spine and sha synapses can be difficult for those spines that are located above or below the dendric sha in the z-dimension because of the lower resolution of 2-photon microscopy in the z-dimension compared to the image plane (see also response to Reviewer 2, point 1). We have now added a new paragraph to the Methods section to describe in more detail how we identify spine and sha synapses and provide more examples in a new supplementary figure (Fig S5). We believe that we can identify spine and sha synapses reliably in most cases, but added a cautionary note to make the reader aware of potential misidentifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I think the experiments performed were very technically challenging (probably one of the few labs that can do this in the field), and the findings provide in vivo evidence on how structured synaptic inputs are assembled during development that has never been reported.</p><p>I suggest improving the writing and presentation and really explaining how they conducted the experiments and how they defined shaft synapses.</p><p>Line 96: 12 dendritic areas from 11 mice at ages between postnatal day 8 to 13.</p><p>- Do the authors know how many neurons were imaged? It is unclear if the authors patch on all the imaged neurons and only imaged (or analyzed) the dendrites of those patched neurons. If yes, how sparse are the neurons labelled from IUE? From 1B, it looks like there are two cells adjacent to each other. Can the authors really distinguish whether the imaged dendrites are from the patched neuron?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer wonders whether we can tell apart dendrites of patched cells from those of neighboring neurons that were not patched. This is actually very straight forward: the experiment included a depolarization step (see Methods section) which leads to an immediate, but temporary, increase in fluorescence in all of the patched neurons’ dendrites, but none of the neighboring dendrites. We have added this information to the Methods section of the new manuscript and provide now an example (Fig S3). Furthermore, as these cells normally fire frequently, it would immediately become clear that an unpatched cell is being imaged if backpropagating action potentials are predominantly observed rather than synaptic signals. The visualization of these synaptic signals is only possible due to the blockade of Na+ channels with QX314 in the intracellular solution (see Methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the methods section, it says 'dendrites were imaged in single plane or small stacks with plane...'. How do the authors do calcium imaging with small stacks of plane using Nikon MP scope?</p></disp-quote><p>Small stacks were acquired by using the piezo focusing device of our Nikon A1 microscope. Since we combined this fast focusing approach with resonant scanning, we were able to acquire z-stacks of 3-5 frames at a rate of up to 15 Hz (per stack).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I also assume this is not chronic imaging, and there are different mice for each postnatal day. If it's true, this is somewhat important for all the correlation analysis as there are only 2 mice for each postnatal day (other than day 12) and day 13 only has 1 animal.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, indeed these are not chronic experiments and dendrites imaged on different days are from different neurons and different mice. We agree with the reviewer that if it had been possible to image the same neurons across these developmental stages, we would have detected even clearer correlations. Therefore, we see our results as conservative estimates of the developmental trajectory of the analyzed parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 104 - 109: I don't understand why the authors need to hold at -30mV to facilitate calcium influx through NMDA receptors? I assume this helps them to visualize as many synapses as possible? but wouldn't that also make the 'event frequency' not reflect the true value?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed depolarizing the imaged neurons to -30 mV was necessary to get sufficient calcium influx to map synaptic inputs. We don’t think that this affects the frequency of inputs, because the frequency of synaptic inputs is determined by the presynaptic firing rate and the release probability of the presynaptic terminal, which are not affected by the depolarization of the dendrite.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A - It says in the method section that ROIs are manually selected. However, it's not explained what the criteria are. For spine synapses, it's easy to define but for shaft synapses like in Fig 2B, why are there 2 synapses on the shaft? And in Fig 4a, 5a, Fig S1 P13, some of the dendrites are packed with ROIs. What's the distance between those shaft synapses? Can the imaging resolution really separate them?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks for a better description of how we identified individual ROIs and thus synapse locations and whether this is actually feasible. We have now added a more detailed description of how we select synaptic sites based on the occurrence of synaptic calcium transients. In addition, we have added a new supplemental Figure (S4) to give the reader an impression of the image quality and the ability to locate individual synapses reliably. We find that separating sha synapses was possible for inter-synapse distances of ~4 µm or more. The mean sha synapse distance in our data set is 21 µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Similar issue applies to Figure 4A that I'm not sure what's the resolution of each 'hot spot'. They all seem very close together. Maybe additional raw dendrite images with fluorescence changes like 1C or 2A could be helpful (or movies in the supplementary?)</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggests, we have added now additional supplemental figures to illustrate better how we identify synaptic transmission events as well as spine and sha synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Also for line 164, it says that 76% of high-activity synapses were located on spines. This could also maybe support that only the spine synapses are real synapses and many shaft synapses are actually not synapses and they were just categorized as shaft synapses from manual ROI?</p></disp-quote><p>We are actually quite sure that sha synapses are real synapses based on our analysis, since they show repeated synaptic calcium transients that co-occur with barrages of synaptic inputs as measured by patch-clamp recordings. Indeed one would expect to see a number of excitatory synapses on dendric shas of pyramidal neurons at these ages based on previous EM studies (Miller and Peters, 1981; Wildenberg et al., 2023).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While this might not impact the overall novelty of the paper, I would be curious to know if the authors can still observe the same findings if they only analyze spine synapses.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated several analyses with a dataset that contained only spine synapses. For most analyses we observed the expected result: the effect sizes were similar compared to the entire data set, but the power was reduced. For example the effect of distance to closest high-activity neighbor and own activity (Fig 5E, F) was similar, but p-values were around 0.1 (Similar results for Figure 7B). In contrast, the co-activity with synapses within a domain was significantly higher than the co-activity with synapses in other domains also for the spine-synapse only data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 6 - Does the domain co-activity also contribute to the synaptic current recorded (related to Fig 4).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the synaptic activity measured by calcium imaging contributes to the recorded EPSCs. However, the exact relationship between synaptic inputs measured by calcium imaging and those measured by patch-clamping is complicated by 3 factors: first, during barrages of synaptic inputs many synapses are active simultaneously, both in the mapped dendrites as well as in the un-observed parts of the dendric arborization. Thus, barrages cannot be broken down into individual events. Second, since our acquisition frequency is ~10 Hz, we can identify the onset of individual synaptic calcium transients with 100-200 ms precision (1 or 2 frames). However, throughout any 100-200 ms period of recording several synapses are active across the entire dendric arborization such that we cannot assign a given calcium transient to a specific EPSC within a 100-200 ms epoch. Third, due to the limited clamping capacity of in vivo patch recordings, we cannot be certain that individual transmission events in distal dendrites can be resolved in the patch recording as EPSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I suggest the authors should provide the number of cells and mice recorded in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of dendrites and mice is the same across all analyses: 12 dendrites from 11 mice for all experiments, 6/6 for P8-10 and 6/5 for P12-13. All dendrites and synapses (and their ages) are shown in the supplemental figures S1 and S2. We mention the number of imaged dendrites now at the beginning of the Results section and when we split ages for the first me.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Instead of showing only cartoon illustrations of dendrites in Figures 3-6, I suggest showing the two photon images as well together with the cartoon.</p></disp-quote><p>The 2-photon images of all dendrites of the dataset are available in Figure S1. To allow the reader to compare the cartoon representations in the main figures and the 2-photon images of each neuron, we have now labeled each dendrite in the dataset (D1-D12, see figures S1 and S2). For every figure, where we show example neurons (cartoons or zoom ins) we now provide this identifier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>To address the weaknesses outlined above, we recommend that the authors do the following:</p><p>• To address concerns about the rigor and reproducibility of the methods specifically related to age comparisons, please confirm the following:</p><p>- Both age groups were run in parallel by the same researcher(s).</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments were run partly overlapping and experiments from different age groups were performed in parallel by both researchers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Both age groups were imaged on the same microscope, or animals from each age group were imaged on both microscopes. If it was necessary to use different microscopes for the different age groups for biological or practical reasons, please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>All experiments were run on the same microscope, a Nikon A1 2-photon microscope. In the original methods description we erroneously mentioned two microscopes (copy and paste error from a previous publication). We corrected that in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There was no difference in imaging frame rates or other imaging parameters between age groups. If it was necessary to use different parameters for different age groups for biological reasons, please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We varied the frame rates somewhat to allow larger z-stacks for some experiments where dendrites traversed different depths; however the mean frame rates were similar between the experiments in P8-10 vs P12-13 dendrites, 8.5 vs 10 Hz, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Images were analyzed blind to age.</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis was not setup to be performed blind to age. The number of spines and the activity levels clearly show obvious differences between neurons only a few days apart. However, all findings reported in this study related to age - except the increase in synapse density and activity - became apparent to us only after the full set of synaptic transmission events was determined and the analysis was performed on the entire data set, making it unlikely that event detection was biased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There was no difference in the location of analyzed dendrites (e.g. depth from the pia, branch order) between age groups.</p></disp-quote><p>In all experiments we imaged dendrites of layer 2/3 neurons that were relatively close to the cortical surface to optimize image quality. In addition, we determined the mean distance of the imaged dendric stretches from the cell body and found that this distance was similar between the dendrites of each age group (Young: 392 +/- 104 µm, Old: 323 +/- 118 µm; mean +/- STD). Therefore, we do not think that sampling bias affected these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• To address general methodological concerns, please provide additional description of the following points:</p><p>- Please clarify how the visual cortex was identified in P8-13 pups. If there was ambiguity about identifying the visual cortex in these pups, please discuss the implications of this ambiguity.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks how we identified V1 in these experiments. We are indeed certain that the neurons were located inside the primary visual cortex. We have ample experience with mapping V1 in these animals based on patterns of spontaneous activity as well as post-hoc stainings. V1 is quite large already at these ages (&gt; 2 mm long and &gt; 1 mm wide) and its extent very consistent across animals. Thus, we would argue it is actually hard to miss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please clarify how synaptic transmission events were identified in the GCaMP signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a more detailed description of how we identify synaptic calcium transients. In addition, we have added a new supplemental Figure (S3) to give the reader an impression of the image quality and the ability to locate individual synapses reliably.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is acceptable to use the spine vs shaft analysis despite the inevitable difficulty resolving Z-projecting spines, but this caveat should be mentioned in the discussion of the spine vs shaft results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a more detailed description of spine and sha synapse identification, a new supplemental figure (S5) and we now mention the caveat related to the limited z-resolution of 2-photon microscopy in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Two additional minor details should be clarified in the text of the manuscript:</p><p>- Please specify the volume of DNA solution injected into each embryo.</p></disp-quote><p>The injected volume was 1 µl.
