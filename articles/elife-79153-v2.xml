Although most IVF-conceived children are healthy, several studies suggest an increased risk of altered growth rate, cardiovascular dysfunction, and glucose intolerance in this population compared to naturally conceived children. However, a clear understanding of how embryonic metabolism is affected by culture condition and how embryos reprogram their metabolism is unknown. Here, we studied oxidative stress and metabolic alteration in blastocysts conceived by natural mating or by IVF and cultured in physiologic (5%) or atmospheric (20%) oxygen. We found that IVF-generated blastocysts manifest increased reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage to DNA/lipid/proteins, and reduction in glutathione. Metabolic analysis revealed IVF-generated blastocysts display decreased mitochondria respiration and increased glycolytic activity suggestive of enhanced Warburg metabolism. These findings were corroborated by altered intracellular and extracellular pH and increased intracellular lactate levels in IVF-generated embryos. Comprehensive proteomic analysis and targeted immunofluorescence showed reduction of lactate dehydrogenase-B and monocarboxylate transporter 1, enzymes involved in lactate metabolism. Importantly, these enzymes remained downregulated in the tissues of adult IVF-conceived mice, suggesting that metabolic alterations in IVF-generated embryos may result in alteration in lactate metabolism. These findings suggest that alterations in lactate metabolism are a likely mechanism involved in genomic reprogramming and could be involved in the developmental origin of health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>embryo metabolism</kwd><kwd>in vitro fertilization</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 R01HD092267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaudo</surname><given-names>Paolo F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A6A3A14046145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Seok Hee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro fertilization-conceived murine embryos show evidence of oxidative and metabolic stress with alteration in lactic acid metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Assisted reproductive technologies (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF) show excellent success resulting in the birth of over 8 million children worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berntsen et al., 2019</xref>). While the great majority of children born with these technologies are healthy, it has also been suggested that ARTs could be associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome and possibly an increased predisposition to adult-onset chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berntsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kleijkers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, several reports have shown that ART offspring display altered growth pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceelen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kleijkers et al., 2016</xref>), increased risk of cardiometabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ceelen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meister et al., 2018</xref>), premature vascular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meister et al., 2018</xref>), altered lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), and increased the prevalence of cerebral palsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goldsmith et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, assessing the health of ART offspring and understanding the safety of ART is of critical importance.</p><p>Importantly, different culture media and oxygen concentrations may result in different stress to the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chronopoulou and Harper, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feuer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rinaudo and Schultz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rinaudo et al., 2006</xref>) with possible subsequent alterations in health of the individual. In particular, either 5% (physiologic) or 20% oxygen (atmospheric) concentrations have been widely used in clinical settings, and in 2014 only 25% of 265 IVF clinics reported of using 5% oxygen for culture of human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christianson et al., 2014</xref>). This is relevant, since it is well known that environmental oxygen can influence embryo development and their intracellular redox balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bavister, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rinaudo et al., 2006</xref>). Overall, low oxygen tension can significantly improve the cleavage rate, implantation, pregnancy and birth rates in humans compared with an atmosphere condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bavister, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meintjes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Preis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">WaldenstrÃ¶m et al., 2009</xref>). Supraphysiological oxygen concentrations result in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ryan et al., 1998</xref>) and likely result in oxidative damage and metabolic alterations to embryos.</p><p>Despite investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardner and Wale, 2013</xref>), it is unknown how metabolism is reprogrammed in early embryos following culture ex vivo. This is a critical question, since metabolic alterations occurring during embryonic development will likely be responsible for epigenetic reprogramming; therefore, understanding these metabolic alterations might provide an initial window into what ultimately will determine an individualâs health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tzika et al., 2018</xref>). Preimplantation embryo metabolism is unique and different from somatic cells. The Krebs cycle is the main source of energy throughout the preimplantation period. Glycolysis is slowly utilized during the first 1â2 days of development but an increase in glycolysis and oxygen consumption (via mitochondria) is notable at the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leese, 2012</xref>). Importantly, preimplantation embryos show an accentuation of the Warburg metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Warburg, 1956</xref>), i.e., higher production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through glycolysis and increased conversion of pyruvate into lactate, even in the presence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Redel et al., 2011</xref>). This process is facilitated by the lactate dehydrogenase class of enzymes (LDH-A and LDH-B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Redel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given our result to date, we sought to obtain a clearer understanding of embryonic metabolism in mouse embryos generated in vivo or in vitro. Blastocysts generated in vivo after mating were used as a control (flushed blastocyst group or FB). Two experimental groups were used: embryos generated by IVF and cultured to the blastocyst stage in optimal conditions using potassium simplex optimization medium (KSOM) medium with amino acids and 5% oxygen concentration (IVF 5% or optimal conditions group) or 20% oxygen concentration (IVF 20% or suboptimal conditions group). These groups of embryos were compared for: (1) oxidative stress (including ROS levels, markers of oxidative damage to embryos, and glutathione level); (2) changes in mitochondria/glycolytic function using the Agilent Seahorse XF HS Mini Analyzer and measuring selected metabolites (lactate and pyruvate) and embryonic pH; and (3) comprehensive proteomic analysis.</p><p>We found that embryos generated by IVF show profound alterations in metabolism. These findings provide a mechanistic insight that links culture conditions to metabolic states and might be useful to select embryos with greater viability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Embryo generated by IVF show similar morphology but lower development to the blastocyst stage and increased in ROS and oxidative damage</title><p>Only expanded blastocysts of similar morphology were used for all experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref>).

In IVF-generated embryos. Importantly, when atmospheric oxygen was used to culture embryos, the phenotype further worsened.</p><p>While several studies have suggested an increase in ROS and alteration of antioxidant balance in IVF-generated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cebral et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MartÃ­n-Romero et al., 2008</xref>), this study also shows increased oxidative damage to embryos. ROS are second messengers with a likely tight therapeutic window. In fact, during embryo development from the 2 cell to the blastocyst stage, the levels of ROS are increased to maintain their metabolic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ryan et al., 1998</xref>). However, excessive ROS levels causes a lower oocyte maturation during in vitro maturation and lower embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson and Nasr-Esfahani, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luvoni et al., 1996</xref>) in addition to cellular apoptosis, DNA damage, inhibition of DNA synthesis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative modification of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gardner and Fridovich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Blerkom, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The fact that IVF-generated embryos show altered Redox imbalance is also shown by their reduced level of glutathione, since GSH is one of the main non-enzymatic defenses against ROS in mammalian embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rizzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takahashi et al., 1993</xref>).

The 8-epi-prostaglandin F2-Î± (PGF2Î±, F2-isoprostane) and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) are widely regarded as specific and stable oxidative stress indicators to measure the degree of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gongadashetti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halliwell and Lee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keller et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McKinney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montuschi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Psathakis et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The second important finding of this paper is the alteration in mitochondria and glycolytic function of IVF-generated embryos. That IVF embryos have reduced OCR rate is not surprising, given that we <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belli et al., 2019</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marei et al., 2019</xref> have shown alteration in mitochondria morphology and mitochondrial membrane potential. The current analysis further adds to the knowledge by showing that IVF embryos have reduced ATP production via mitochondrial respiration and show a compensatory increase in glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The increase is particularly evident in the IVF20%O<sub>2</sub> embryos, that appear to further need to generate energy via glycolysis even when supraphysiologic oxygen is present. Previous studies have shown that the glycolytic rate (percentage of glucose converted to lactate) for mouse blastocysts flushed from the uterus is less than 40%, whereas it increases to over 75% after 3 hr of in-vitro culture. This is important, since higher glycolytic rate was associated with lower implantation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lane and Gardner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lane and Gardner, 1998</xref>) and indeed our past experiments have shown that mouse embryos generated by IVF have lower live birth rate compared to embryos generated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Hence, it appears that vitro-derived blastocysts increase glycolysis to overcome their impaired mitochondrial function. In future observations, linking glucose consumption, lactate ion and proton efflux rates to embryo viability may be useful as predictors of human embryo viability in ART laboratories.</p><p>Among the additional metabolic alterations found in IVF-generated embryos, the reduction in NAD levels and increase in intracellular pH are very relevant.</p><p>NAD is an essential coenzyme and an obligate cofactor for the catabolism of metabolic fuels in all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frederick et al., 2016</xref>). Growing evidence has confirmed that NAD controls diverse cell signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamaguchi and Yoshino, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang and Sauve, 2016</xref>). Importantly, age-related reductions in NAD concentration were linked to declining oocyte quality and infertility, and restoration of NAD levels is advocated for the treatment of age-related infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertoldo et al., 2020</xref>). The findings of reduced NAD levels in IVF-derived embryos confirm their significant alteration in energy metabolism and open the possibility that culture media supplemented with NAD might help to overcome their impaired energy metabolism.</p><p>The increase in intracellular pH and decreased in extracellular pH found in IVF-generated embryos is particularly important, because it confirms the profound alteration in embryo metabolism. In fact, cancer cells are known to have higher intracellular pH and lower extracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Webb et al., 2011</xref>) and regulation of intra- and extracellular pH is considered essential for cellular physiological and metabolic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker and Deitmer, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Monocarboxylate transporter imbedded in plasma and other cell membranes are symporters moving monocarboxylate anions (e.g. lactate) and protons in a stoichiometric (1:1) ratio. Not surprisingly there is a well-known correlation between intracellular and extracellular pH: while extracellular pH affects intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edwards et al., 1998b</xref>), if the embryos produces excess of metabolic acids (either in the form of lactate, protons, or CO<sub>2</sub>), extracellular acidification occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gatenby and Gillies, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parks et al., 2011</xref>). The existence of this correlation is particularly valuable because precise measurement of extracellular pH could provide insight into the embryonic metabolism and offer diagnostic opportunities to identify healthy embryos. Given that individual blastocysts show variation in intracellular pH, oxidative damage, ROS, NAD levels, and based on the Goldislocks principle of embryo health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leese et al., 2016</xref>), embryo showing less stress could be identified and selected for early transfer.</p><p>We next found that IVF-generated embryos showed decrease in pyruvate and increase in lactate levels. Pyruvate and lactate are key energy sources for the preimplantation embryo. Pyruvate is the preferred energy substrate during the cleavage stage, while glucose consumption is low but tends to increase at the blastocyst stage, when also oxidative phosphorylation increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leese et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, while lactate was once believed to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, it is now clear that it plays a key role in physiology and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks, 2018</xref>). Lactate is continuously produced under aerobic conditions and plays 3 major roles: (1) it is a major energy source, (2) the most important gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) functions as a signaling molecule. Notably, the product of glycolysis is lactate, not pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rogatzki et al., 2015</xref>) and lactate oxidation is dominant in vivo. For example, muscle lactate concentration exceeds that of pyruvate by one (10 Ã) to two (200â400 Ã) orders of magnitude in resting and exercising human muscles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Henderson et al., 2004</xref>). Our findings confirm that lactate concentration is tenfold higher than the lactate concentration, but IVF embryos show a further increase in lactate production since the lactate to pyruvate ratio is 11 for FB embryos, 19 for IVF5%O<sub>2</sub>, and 27 for IVF20%O<sub>2</sub>. We can therefore hypothesize that the increased level of intracellular lactate in IVF embryos might be a strategy adopted by the embryo to survive the suboptimal culture environment.</p><p>The next studies aimed to clarify the molecular mechanism leading to increase lactate levels in IVF embryos. Unsupervised global proteomics analysis revealed that LDH-B was downregulated in IVF embryos. We confirmed these results by performing immunofluorescence studies and found that IVF embryos showed downregulation of both LDHA and B and of the monocarboxylate transporter, MCT1, providing an explanation for the increase in their lactate levels. LDH is a tetramer composed of two subunits (LDH-M, found in muscles and LDH-H, found in heart), encoded by the LDHA and LDHB genes, that catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate to lactate using NAD as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markert et al., 1975</xref>). Lactate production is associated with increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shibata et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, although different isozymes possess different activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Summermatter et al., 2013</xref>), the reduction in protein levels of both isozymes in IVF embryos suggest that LDH is a critical nodus or regulation.</p><p>Both LDH-A and B isoenzymes are active in the preimplantation mouse embryos, but LDH-B is the principal form. LDH-A will become predominant at the time of implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbach and Brinster, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lane and Gardner, 2000</xref>). Human studies suggest a similar pattern: the mRNA of LDH-B was detected in human oocytes, 4- and 8-cell embryos, while the mRNA for LDH-A was detected only in two of four oocytes and one of three 8-cell embryos.

MCT1 is a proton-linked transporter, i.e., it ensures symport of monocarboxylates and protons in a 1: 1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatel et al., 2017</xref>).

The dysregulation of LDH-B and MCT1 in both embryo and tissues of adults conceived by IVF strongly suggest an epigenetic regulation.

Future studies should examine how metabolic differences, ROS and oxidative damage occur during earlier stages of embryo development, both in mice and possibly human embryos. Although ROS production was documented after culture of embryos using commercially available media even under conditions of low oxygen concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MartÃ­n-Romero et al., 2008</xref>), design of optimized culture media, aimed at reduce ROS generation should be encouraged.

In brief, five IU pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) was injected to CF1 female mice (8â9 weeks), and after 48 hr later, 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was injected to those female mice for superovulation. Sperm were collected from the cauda epididymis in B6D2F1 male mice (8â9 weeks) and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained from ampullae 13â14 hr after hCG administration. The COCs were incubated for 4 hr in human tubal fluid (HTF) medium (Millipore Corp; MR-070-D) with appropriate concentration of sperm obtained following 1 hr capacitation. The fertilized embryos were washed in several drops of KSOM (Millipore, MR-106-D) and cultured in the same medium to the blastocyst stage at 37Â°C under Ovoil (Vitrolife, #10029).

All steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise stated. After washing three times in PBS, blastocysts were permeated with 1% (v/v) Triton Xâ100 in PBS for 2 hr. Then, the samples were washed three times in PBS and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 4 hr at 4Â°C. The blastocysts were incubated with primary antibodies for 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, 1:200; ab48508, Abcam), 8-iso prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha, 1:200; ab2280, Abcam), and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH, 1:200; D9656, Sigma), monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1, 1:200; sc-365501, Santa Cruz), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA, 1:200; #3582, Cell Signaling), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB, 1:200; sc-100775, Santa Cruz) at 4Â°C overnight.

Ten blastocysts were incubated in XF base assay media supplemented with 1 mM glutamine, 0.2 mM glucose, 0.2 mM pyruvate, and incubated at 37Â°C in a non-CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator for 1 hr to allow to pre-equilibrate with the assay medium.</p><p>For real-time ATP rate analysis, 1.5 Î¼M oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor) and 0.5 Î¼M rotenone/antimycin A (Complex I/III inhibitor) were sequentially injected after incubation. For mitochondrial respiration analysis, 1.5 Î¼M oligomycin, 1 Î¼M Carbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, a potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation), and 0.5 Î¼M rotenone/antimycin A were sequentially injected. Meanwhile, 0.5 Î¼M rotenone/antimycin A and 50 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG, glycolysis inhibitor) were injected for glycolytic rate analysis. Oligomycin inhibits ATP-synthase and can be considered as indicator of the proportion of O<sub>2</sub> consumption directly coupled to ATP generation. FCCP is a potent mitochondrial uncoupler, which dissipates the proton gradient between the intermembrane and the matrix in mitochondria allowing the maximal OCR measurement. As complex I/III inhibitors, rotenone and antimycin A combine to inhibit the electron transport chain entirely; therefore, the proportion of OCR after the addition of rotenone/antimycin A is considered to be non-mitochondrial effect. 2-DG is a glucose analog which inhibits glycolysis through competitive binding of glucose hexokinase in the glycolytic pathway. These measurements were used to determine the magnitudes of various parameters of OCR, ECAR, ATP rate, mitochondrial respiration rate, and glycolytic rate based on the targets of each successive drug injection. ECAR is the sum of two components: respiratory acidification in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> (which hydrates to H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> then dissociates to HCO<sub>3-</sub> + H<sup>+</sup>) and glycolytic acidification in the form of lactate + H<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Measurement of intracellular/extracellular pH in blastocyst and culture medium</title><p>Intracellular pH was determined by using the pH-sensitive fluorophore, SNARF-1 (esterified derivative; Molecular Porbes, Eugene, OR), loaded into blastocysts by incubating them with 5 Î¼M SNARF-1 at 37Â°C for 20 min in KSOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 1998a</xref>). After SNARF-1 staining, blastocysts (7â13 blastocysts per group, in triplicates) were washed with fresh KSOM and placed in a temperature-controlled chamber. Two fluorescence emission wavelengths were detected, 640 nm (pH sensitive) and 600 nm (pH insensitive), using an excitation wavelength of 535 nm. The ratio of the two emission intensities was calculated by dividing the images after background subtraction. At the conclusion of each experiment, the ratio was converted to an actual intracellular pH value using the calibration standard curve, where intracellular pH is clamped to known extracellular values using the ionophores, nigericin (10 Î¼g/ml). The SNARF-1 staining and exposure to excitation illumination does not adversely affect the blastocyst, as previous research demonstrated that mouse embryos normally cleaved following pH measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 1998a</xref>).

A three-experiment method was set up where each experiment utilized a different FAIMS Pro compensation voltage: â50, â70, and â80 Volts, and each of the three experiments had a 1 s cycle time. A high-resolution MS1 scan in the Orbitrap (m/z range 350â1500, 120 k resolution at m/z 200, AGC 4e5 with maximum injection time of 50 ms, RF lens 30%) was collected in top speed mode with 1 s cycles for the survey and the MS/MS scans. For MS2 spectra, ions with charge state between +2 and+7 were isolated with the quadrupole mass filter using a 0.7 m/z isolation window, fragmented with higher-energy collisional dissociation with normalized collision energy of 30%, and the resulting fragments were detected in the ion trap as rapid scan mode with AGC of 5e4 and maximum injection time of 35 ms. The dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s with a 10 ppm mass tolerance around the precursor.</p><p>Mass spectra were analyzed with SpectroMine software (Biognosys, version 2.7.210226.47784). Search criteria used were: full tryptic specificity (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues unless followed by proline), missed cleavages were allowed, carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification and oxidation (M) as a variable modification. The false identification rate was set to 1%. Quality control, relative quantification, and downstream analysis were performed using the artMS Bioconductor package, which uses MSstats for normalization and differential analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the PathView Bioconductor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luo and Brouwer, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western Blotting</title><p>Extracts for SDS-PAGE were prepared from whole gonadal fat, muscle (gastrocnemius) or liver tissues of 40 weeks old mice generated in vivo (FB, n=8, 50% females) or by IVF (n=8, 50% females) after culture in 5% oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feuer et al., 2014b</xref>). In addition, each individual tissue sample had the blot repeated four times (=4 technical replicates): the average of the 4 measurements was used as the mean intensity for that sample.</p><p>Of note, we did not generate a cohort of adult mice by IVF after culture in 20% oxygen. Tissues were homogenized in cold tissue extraction buffer (100 mM Tris, 2 mM Na3VO4, 100 mM NaCI, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM NaF, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20% Na4P2O7, with protease inhibitors). Protein levels were quantified by BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). 15 Âµg tissue were subjected to gel electrophoresis on 12% PAGEr Gold Precast gels (Lonza) and blotted on to Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore) using semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad). Dried membranes were reactivated in methanol, rinsed with PBS, and blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, 927â40000). Membranes were then probed overnight at 4Â°C with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween-20, washed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1% Tween20. Protein signal detection was performed using the LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Experiments were performed in triplicates. Only lactate and pyruvate levels were measured in a single biological replicate with 10 technical replicates, given the large number of embryos needed. All data were analyzed by the One-way analysis of variance with Tukeyâs multiple comparison test or unpaired t-test using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) were applied to analyze the experimental data. All data are expressed as the means values Â± SD. Differences were considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#AN181614-03) of the University of California, San Francisco.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-79153-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>The source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79153-data1-v2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Diane Barber and Dr. Yi for their help in optimizing intracellular pH measurements and Dr George Brooks for the helpful feedback on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ricardo Azziz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kelle Moley (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should consider and comment on the following questions and criticisms from the three referees when revising their manuscript.</p><p>1. Many abbreviations are used in this manuscript. The authors should provide a list of abbreviations at the beginning of the manuscript. Also, the authors should provide a definition/description of Warburg metabolism up-front in the Introduction rather than in the Discussion. These are editorial changes.</p><p>2. The authors provide measurements and statistics in the Text, Figures, and Legends. To improve the clarity of the Results section (currently awkward to read) it may be best to remove the measurements and statistics since these are in the Figures and Legends and are redundant in the Results. These are editorial changes.</p><p>3. All of the measurements compare natural and IVF blastocysts, and do not look at earlier stage embryos to examine when the metabolic changes begin to occur. For example, it would be useful to look at the developmental timeline (2-cell to blastocyst) for the accumulation of ROS.</p><p>4. In Figure 2D the authors show the RFU for IVF5% and IVF20% but do not provide an RFU for flushed blastocysts (FB).</p><p>5. It is unclear how the authors quantitated the Western blots in Figure 7. The flushed blastocysts (FB) blots, like the IVF blots, exhibit quite a bit of variation in terms of intensity. Since there is so much variability, how did the authors quantitate the differences in LDHB and MCT1 levels in flushed blastocysts (FB) and IVF blots?</p><p>6. Is LDH-B the only LDH isozyme in these murine blastocysts? How about human blastocysts? In this context, there should be some discussion of the author's findings with murine blastocysts and previously published comparable findings with human blastocysts (in the Introduction and Discussion).</p><p>7. It would be useful to the reader to have some estimate of the oxygen tensions routinely used in human IVF treatments (e.g., how many used 5% and how many used 20% oxygen). Also, can the effects of ROS on IVF blastocyst metabolism be minimized by the addition of other components to the culture medium (e.g., glutathione and/or NAD) Is there metabolic heterogeneity within individual murine blastocysts as has been proposed for humans?</p><p>8. Several methods may not be reliable to quantify the parameters analyzed. For example, determining protein content by immunofluorescence may be misleading as it can be affected by multiple parameters.</p><p>9. Intracellular pH was also analyzed by an assay also based on immunofluorescence. This measurement could be affected by embryo size (the blastocoel is a call-devoid cavity).</p><p>10. Given the small size of these embryos (~80 Âµm diameter), it is unclear how they alter significantly the composition of 500 Âµl of culture medium.</p><p>11. Performance of this work in a mouse model could be considered a weakness. However, due to the lack of appropriate cell lines or access to large numbers of human embryos, mouse embryos recapitulate the timing of the early developmental period in humans and are experimentally preferred due to the large number of embryos obtained by superovulation.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Murine blastocysts generated by in vitro fertilization show increased Warburg metabolism and altered lactate production&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Ricardo Azziz (Senior Editor) and two original reviewers.</p><p>We are nearly ready to proceed with acceptance, but first could you please respond (in a rebuttal and/or in the text) to the three points raised by Reviewer #3?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have adequately answered my questions. The changes they have made in response to the other reviewers comments as well as mine have greatly improved the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Authors have clarified some relevant points undisclosed or wrongly described in the first version, such as embryo collection timing and that group culture in a small amount of medium was used to collect samples for metabolite analysis. However, no further experiments were conducted, so I still believe that conclusions are not well supported by the data. Anyway, if other reviewers do not consider these points as critical, we can proceed with manuscript acceptance.</p><p>(1) I understand that efforts to obtain in vivo and in vitro blastocyst at a similar stage were taken, but there is still a pretty significant difference in embryo size (50 vs. 70 cells) which can bias the analysis. In other words, some the differences observed may be due to developmental stage rather than in vivo vs. in vitro, as embryo metabolism changes drastically in the morula to blastocyst transition.</p><p>(2) Alternative methods to fluorescence-based microscopy analysis are available to confirm results.</p><p>(3) It would be advisable to support the hypothesis of lines 333-344 by epigenetics analysis of in vitro vs. in vivo data conducted by the authors or publicly available.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79153.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should consider and comment on the following questions and criticisms from the three referees when revising their manuscript.</p><p>1.

Is LDH-B the only LDH isozyme in these murine blastocysts? How about human blastocysts? In this context, there should be some discussion of the author's findings with murine blastocysts and previously published comparable findings with human blastocysts (in the Introduction and Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>The enzyme Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the inter-conversion of pyruvate and L-lactate with concomitant inter-conversion of NADH and NAD+. There are 2 main mammalian proteins LDH-A and LDH B which in humans are encoded by the LDH-A and LDH-B genes. These enzymes are ubiquitously expressed in tissue. Two additional mammalian LDH subunits can be found in specific compartments: LDHC is a testes-specific LDH protein, (encoded by the LDH-C gene) and LDH-Bx, is peroxisome-specific.</p><p>Both LDH-A and B isoenzyme are active in the preimplantation mouse embryos, but LDH-B is the principal form.

It would be useful to the reader to have some estimate of the oxygen tensions routinely used in human IVF treatments (e.g., how many used 5% and how many used 20% oxygen). Also, can the effects of ROS on IVF blastocyst metabolism be minimized by the addition of other components to the culture medium (e.g., glutathione and/or NAD) Is there metabolic heterogeneity within individual murine blastocysts as has been proposed for humans?</p></disp-quote><p>Although is preeminently clear that low oxygen tension (~5% oxygen) should be used to culture mammalian embryos, a survey performed in 2014 revealed that out of 265 IVF clinics from 54 different countries, less than 25% used physiological (~5%) oxygen to culture human embryos (Christianson 2014).</p><p>Addition of antioxidants (resveratrol, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, Lysophosphatidic acid, etc) to embryo culture media, has been studied in animal models by numerous investigators, but currently there is no consensus on the optimal combination of antioxidant to use.

Several methods may not be reliable to quantify the parameters analyzed. For example, determining protein content by immunofluorescence may be misleading as it can be affected by multiple parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments and concerns. Any single method can result in error and possible bias. Immunofluorescence analysis is a robust method that has been used to analyze the distribution of proteins in cells or tissues. For instance, oxidative stress (Liu et al., 2022, Reprod Domest Anim), several signaling molecule (Spirkova et al., 2022, Biol Reprod) and DNA methylation level (Diaz et al., 2021, Fron Gent) have been measured by immunofluorescence in preimplantation embryos and oocytes. It our study, to minimize errors, we followed exactly the same protocol and we found immunofluorescence to be reliable. In addition, global proteomics analysis of blastocysts provide partial independent confirmation of our results. While LDH-A and MCT1 were not detected, LDH-B was detected and found to be lower in IVF blastocysts, exactly as show by IF studies. Finally, western blot analysis of adult tissues confirmed reduction in LDH-B and MCT-1 levels.</p><p>These comments have been added to the discussion as follows:</p><p>Line 299-302: âUnsupervised global proteomics analysis revealed that LDH-B was downregulated in IVF embryos.

Performance of this work in a mouse model could be considered a weakness. However, due to the lack of appropriate cell lines or access to large numbers of human embryos, mouse embryos recapitulate the timing of the early developmental period in humans and are experimentally preferred due to the large number of embryos obtained by superovulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment.

In other words, some the differences observed may be due to developmental stage rather than in vivo vs. in vitro, as embryo metabolism changes drastically in the morula to blastocyst transition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We agree with the reviewers that the differences in cell numbers are noteworthy. As shown in Figure 1, Figure Supplement 1 we and other invesitgators in the field of reprogramming (Doherty 2000; Ecker 2004; Vrooman 2022; Watkins 2007), have selected and analyzed blastocysts with similar morphology and developmental stage (expanded blastocysts). This is the selection criteria utilized by human embryologist to select an embryo to transfer. Rather than indicating different stages of development, we interpret the differences in total cell number as indicating the profound effects of different embryo environments (in vivo vs. in vitro culture, 5% vs. 20% Oxygen concentration, or type of media; for example Whittens vs KSOM, etcâ¦) on preimplantation embryo development. In other words, the different cell number is a marker of the stress to which embryos have been exposed. If we had waited longer for in vitro embryos to grow in culture, in vitro embryo would have started to hatch and therefore would not have had similar morphology to the in vivo embryos.</p><p>In summary, we observe that different culture conditions alter embryo development (cell number, gene expression, epigenetic marksâ¦) to such an extent that embryos cultured in vitro might be predisposed to adult onset diseases (Fleming 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Alternative methods to fluorescence-based microscopy analysis are available to confirm results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We agree that the alternative method including western blot could be available to confirm our fluorescence-based microscopy results. However, in line with many other authors (Saiz 2016; Schuh 2007), we believe the immunofluorescence analysis in preimplantation embryos and oocytes is of sufficient robustness to draw reliable conclusions. In addition, our global proteomics analysis of blastocysts and western blot analysis of adult tissues offer a measure of support to the immunofluorescence results. In fact, unsupervised proteomics revealed that LDH-B was decreased in IVF-generated embryos.
