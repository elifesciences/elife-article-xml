growth. One potential reason for this is that competition between different species of inoculated consortia members creates conflicts for their survival and functioning. To circumvent this, we used transposon insertion mutagenesis to increase the functional diversity within <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> bacterial species and tested if we could improve plant growth promotion by assembling consortia of highly clonal but phenotypically dissimilar mutants. While most insertion mutations were harmful, some significantly improved <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> plant growth promotion traits relative to the wild-type strain. Eight phenotypically distinct mutants were selected to test if their functioning could be improved by applying them as multifunctional consortia. We found that <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> consortium richness correlated positively with plant root colonization and protection from <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> phytopathogenic bacterium. Crucially, 8-mutant consortium consisting of phenotypically dissimilar mutants performed better than randomly assembled 8-mutant consortia, suggesting that improvements were likely driven by consortia multifunctionality instead of consortia richness. Together, our results suggest that increasing intra-species phenotypic diversity could be an effective way to improve probiotic consortium functioning and plant growth promotion in agricultural systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetic engineering</kwd><kwd>microbial consortia</kwd><kwd>ecological complementarity</kwd><kwd>plant-microbe

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial rhizosphere microbiome diversity has been strongly associated with beneficial effects on plant growth in both natural and agricultural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mendes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Such beneficial diversity effects are often associated with increased functional diversity and community multifunctionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saleem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lindsay et al., 2021</xref>), where different taxa play complementary roles in plant growth promotion, specializing in nutrient solubilization, plant immune priming or for example by interacting with beneficial or pathogenic rhizosphere microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009</xref>). Moreover, high microbial diversity can have other benefits such as providing functional redundancy in the case of species extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison and Martiny, 2008</xref>), community stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2016</xref>), or provide emergent consortia-level properties that cannot be predicted based on the sum of individual species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Netzker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrudan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tilman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tilman, 2004</xref>). While several studies have tried to harness positive effects of bacterial diversity for crop production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weidner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), diverse inoculants often fail to produce the desired benefits in field conditions. This discrepancy could rise due to constraints set by external factors, such as resource availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De-la-Peña et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gransee and Wittenmayer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaparro et al., 2013</xref>), that constrains the expression of plant growth promotion traits, or the presence of competitors, parasites, and predators that reduce the survival of the inoculated bacteria in the rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hibbing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Also intrinsic factors, such as interactions between inoculant consortia members, could constrain their survival in the rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jousset et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2020</xref>). It has thus been suggested that microbial inoculant design should aim to minimize negative interactions within the inoculated consortia without compromising consortia competitive ability, which is important for consortia establishment in the diverse rhizosphere microbiome, especially when being initially rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wei et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Diversity-ecosystem functioning experiments are widely used to study if communities perform better due to inherent benefits of diversity or because certain communities contain specific species that are important for the community functioning (i.e., species identity effects due to presence of certain microbial keystone species) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jousset et al., 2014</xref>). In microbial context, such experiments have been mostly conducted by using taxonomically diverse communities, where associations between community diversity and functioning have been found to range from positive to neutral and negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jousset et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maynard et al., 2017</xref>). One reason for such variety of outcomes might be that increasing community diversity often also introduces competition between the community members, which might overshadow and constrain the benefits of inoculant diversity. For example, antimicrobial activity of pathogen-suppressing volatile organic compounds has been shown to peak at intermediate levels of bacterial community diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raza et al., 2020</xref>), and a similar hump-shaped pattern has also been found between toxin production and bacterial community richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jousset et al., 2011</xref>). Likely explanation for these findings is that the same compounds that are responsible for pathogens suppression also affect the competition between other consortia members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2020</xref>). One way to reduce this negative effect would be to quantify species interactions in advance to assemble multifunctional bioinoculants with weak within-consortia competitive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Such optimization could be achieved by using highly related bioinoculant strains because genetic relatedness is predicted to favor cooperation instead of conflict due to kin selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simonet and McNally, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crespi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kolter and Greenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raymond et al., 2012</xref>). For example, if bioinoculant species produce antimicrobials, it is likely that related strains share the same antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance genes, and hence, unlikely antagonize each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xia et al., 2022</xref>). Increasing intra-species diversity could further lead to increased bioinoculant consortia multifunctionality, which has been shown to play an important role in the functioning of microbial ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Rossum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fields et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nicastro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blake et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoš et al., 2018</xref>). Multifunctionality could be optimized based on ecological complementarity by assembling consortia from strains that use different niches or specialize in different functions within the same niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoš et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). This might allow more efficient expression or production of different compounds at the consortia level and help to overcome any antagonistic pleiotropic effects experienced at the individual strain level (i.e., trade-offs between plant growth promotion traits). Moreover, interactions between near clonal specialist genotypes could allow division of labor, where shared workload by two specialists leads to higher productivity relative to one generalist as has been demonstrated with <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> bacterium during biofilm matrix production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoš et al., 2018</xref>). Such overperformance (or overyielding) could also be driven by other mechanisms such as resource partitioning, abiotic facilitation, or biotic feedbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 2019</xref>), leading to higher consortia functioning than predicted based on the sum of its individual members.</p><p>Here, we used a combination of genetics, molecular biology, and biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saleem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2016</xref>) to test if increasing phenotypic diversity of a single plant growth-promoting <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> T-5 bacterium offers a viable strategy to improve bioinoculant consortia multifunctionality. We chose <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> T-5 strain as our model species because it originates from the tomato rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tan et al., 2013</xref>) and has previously been shown to protect plants from various diseases, including bacterial wilt caused by phytopathogenic <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). To increase functional diversity within a single species, we first created a <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> mutant library using TnYLB-1 transposon mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Le Breton et al., 2006</xref>), resulting in 1999 unique insertion mutants. A representative subset of 479 mutants were chosen for high-throughput phenotyping in vitro in the lab regarding four important plant growth promotion traits: biomass production, biofilm formation, swarming motility, and pathogen suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turnbull et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raaijmakers et al., 2002</xref>). After phenotyping, a subset of 47 mutants that performed better or equally well as the wild-type strain were taken forward to plant experiments to determine if in vitro phenotyping could predict mutant success in terms of tomato root colonization and plant protection from <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> in vivo. Finally, we tested if plant growth promotion could be improved by combining phenotypically distinct mutants into multi-strain consortia. We predicted that increasing mutant consortia richness would lead to improved root colonization and plant protection if mutants are phenotypically dissimilar, which could result in positive diversity-ecosystem relationships or trait multifunctionality. These two hypotheses were tested by comparing the performance between phenotypically dissimilar and randomly assembled mutant consortia. Our results demonstrate that transposon insertion mutagenesis is an effective way to improve and identify genes underlying plant growth promotion traits in <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic>. Importantly, we show that in vitro phenotyping can be used to optimize inoculant consortia functioning in vivo and that diverse mutant consortia are better at colonizing and protecting tomato plants when they are assembled based on phenotypic dissimilarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of transposon insertions on <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> T-5 mutant traits measured in vitro and in vivo</title><p>We first quantified the phenotypic effects of transposon insertions on <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> T-5 mutant traits across the whole mutant library (1999 mutants in total, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). To make the number of mutants more manageable for in vivo experiment, we randomly selected a subset of 479 mutants for further analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). While we likely lost certain unique mutants in the process, the sampled subset was phenotypically representative of the original collection based on four measured traits (Mantel test; r=0.7591, p=0.04167). Within this subset, most insertions had negative effects on the four measured phenotypic traits, with more than half of the mutants showing reduced swarming (58.7%), biomass production (67.2%), and biofilm formation (60.8%) compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, the median effect of insertions affecting the pathogen suppression was neutral, and 51.1% of the mutants showed only a moderate increase in their suppressiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). In line with this finding, the distribution of effects of insertions on each trait was skewed, where beneficial mutations resulted mainly in a moderate improvement, while harmful mutations often led to severe reductions in measured traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, several insertions caused trade-offs, where improvement in one trait led to a reduction in another trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For example, swarming motility correlated negatively with biomass production, while biomass production led to a trade-off with both biofilm production and pathogen suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results thus suggest that transposon insertions constrained the simultaneous improvement of multiple traits, leading to specialized <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> T-5 mutants, which could be clustered in three phenotypic groups based on K-means clustering (Adonis test: R<sup>2</sup>=0.5283, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

mutant consortia in vitro and in vivo</title><p>As transposon insertions mainly improved the performance of mutants regarding only one phenotypic trait, we tested if <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> T-5 performance could be improved by using mutants as phenotypically diverse consortia. To this end, we chose eight mutants that showed improved performance relative to the wild-type strain regarding one of the plant-beneficial traits measured in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2d</xref>; two representative mutants per each measured trait were included). We first tested if these mutants showed negative effects on each other growth in vitro. Based on agar overlay assays, none of the strains clearly inhibited each other in direct contact in co-cultures. Similarly, only slightly negative (up to 12.7%) or positive (up to 7.1%) effects on strains’ growth were observed in supernatant exposure experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2d</xref>). While direct co-culture experiments are needed to quantify the level of competitiveness between the mutants in the future, this data suggests that transposon insertions made mutants only slightly more inhibitory to each other. Mutants were then used to assemble a total of 37 consortia that varied in their richness level (1, 2, 4, or 8 mutants) and community composition, following a substitutive design where each mutant was equally often present at each richness level (see left panel key of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> for detailed composition of consortia). We hypothesized that consortia could show improved performance due to phenotypic complementarity or multifunctionality, where different mutants would ‘specialize’ respective to one of the four phenotypic traits, overcoming trade-offs and potential antagonistic pleiotropy experienced at the individual strain level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We first tested the consortia performance regarding the four traits measured in vitro. We found that relative to wild-type strain, only a few consortia showed improved performance regarding swarming motility (8 of 37), biomass production (2 of 37), biofilm formation (4 of 37), or pathogen suppression (15 of 37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Moreover, consortia performance did not show clear relationship with increasing richness regarding to any of the measured traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We further tested if the consortia performance could be predicted based on the trait averages of individually grown mutants, assuming that mutant performance is not affected by interactions between the consortia members. Only one significant positive relationship was found between the predicted pathogen suppressiveness, and the size of the inhibition halo observed in vitro lab measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). This suggest that individually measured mutant traits poorly predicted observed consortia performance in vitro except for the pathogen suppression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The relationships between predicted and observed consortia performance measured in vitro and correlations between plant performance, consortia richness, and consortia average performance measured in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) show correlations between predicted and observed consortia performance regarding swarming motility, biomass production, biofilm formation, pathogen suppression, root colonization, and plant protection, respectively (blue dashed lines show 1:1 theoretical fit and solid black lines show the fitted regression between predicted and observed values).

While root colonization or plant protection could not be predicted based on the consortia performance measured in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>), increasing consortia richness improved both root colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, F<sub>1,35</sub> = 6.52, R<sup>2</sup>=0.1330, p=0.0152) and plant protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, F<sub>1,35</sub> = 18.64, R<sup>2</sup>=0.3289, p&lt;0.001), which were also positively correlated with the consortia average performance measured in vitro (root colonization: F<sub>1,35</sub> = 6.47, R<sup>2</sup>=0.1319, p=0.0156; plant protection: F<sub>1,35</sub> = 8.82, R<sup>2</sup>=0.1786, p=0.0053; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>). We also analyzed the significance of mutant identity effect on the consortia performance in vivo by excluding each strain from the dataset and comparing model fit and significance of explanatory variables.

Crucially, the effect of consortia richness remained significant after sequential removal of each mutant and refitting of the model, which demonstrates that the diversity effect was robust and relatively more important in explaining root colonization and plant protection compared to mutant identity effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2f</xref>).

We found that the ‘optimized’ consortium was more effective at both plant root colonization and plant protection compared to ‘unoptimized’ 8-mutant consortia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We also correlated the relative performance of all 8-mutant consortia with both in vivo traits and found that both root colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, F<sub>1,7</sub> = 26.56, R<sup>2</sup>=0.7616, p=0.0013) and plant protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, F<sub>1,7</sub> = 6.39, R<sup>2</sup>=0.4026, p=0.0394) improved along with the increase in the relative performance of consortia.

Our results show that mutations that improved bacterial performance regarding one trait often led to specialism and reduced performance regarding other traits. Such trait trade-offs experienced at the individual genotype level could be overcome by assembling consortia of phenotypically distinct mutants, that showed increase in average trait performance. Crucially, the consortia richness and average trait performance correlated positively with increased root colonization and plant protection, indicative of increased consortia multifunctionality and improved plant health. Especially, diverse 8-mutant consortium that consisted of phenotypically distinct mutants performed better compared to randomly assembled 8-mutant consortia consisting of phenotypically similar mutants. Together, these findings suggest that increasing intra-species functional diversity could offer an easy solution for improving the performance of bacterial consortia.</p><p>We specifically focused on four <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> traits that have previously been linked to plant growth promotion: swarming motility, biomass production, biofilm formation, and direct pathogen suppression via antibiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreno-Velandia et al., 2019</xref>). While most transposon insertions reduced the strains’ performance, some of them improved at least one measured trait. However, all trait improvements were costly and reduced mutants’ performance regarding other traits, indicative of trade-offs and antagonistic pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2007</xref>). Such costs of adaptation are common with microbes and have previously been linked to a wide range of functions, including metabolism, antibiotic production, motility, and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferenci, 2016</xref>). Overall, transposon insertions were identified in several genes associated with broad range of functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). With eight phenotypically distinct mutants that were used for consortia assembly experiment, increased swarming motility was associated with insertions in <italic>parE</italic> (DNA topoisomerase IV subunit B) and <italic>DeoR</italic> (DNA-binding transcriptional repressor) genes, which has previously been linked to antibiotic resistance and bacterial deoxyribonucleoside and deoxyribose utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saxild et al., 1996</xref>), respectively. While it remains unclear how these genes were linked with swarming motility, their disruption also affected other traits as evidenced by reduced biofilm formation. Increased biomass production was linked to disruption of <italic>comQ</italic> (competence protein) and <italic>hutI</italic> (imidazolonepropionase) genes and trade-offs with the other three measured traits. <italic>ComQ</italic> gene controls the production of ComX pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacon Schneider et al., 2002</xref>) and has recently been linked to antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esmaeilishirazifard et al., 2018</xref>), which could explain reduction in the pathogen suppression by this mutant. Insertion in histidine utilization (hut) system gene, <italic>hutI</italic>, could have potentially impaired catabolite and amino acid repression, resulting in improved biomass production with one of the mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bender, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, increased biofilm formation was also linked to insertion in hut system (<italic>hutU</italic>) with one mutant, while the other mutant had insertion in <italic>YsnB</italic> gene, which encodes for a putative metallophosphoesterase. While both insertions were linked to trade-offs with swarming motility and biomass production, they are not commonly associated with biofilm formation in <italic>Bacillus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoš et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prágai et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, moderate improvement in pathogen suppression was observed with two mutants that had insertions in <italic>nhaC</italic> (sodium-proton antiporter) and <italic>dfnG</italic> (difficidin polyketide synthesis) genes. The <italic>nhaC</italic> gene is known to act as repressor for Pho regulon in <italic>Bacillus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prágai et al., 2001</xref>), while mutations in Pho regulon have been linked to increased antibiotics production with several <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Santos-Beneit, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>dfnG</italic> gene controls the production of difficidin antibiotic, which has previously been linked to biocontrol activity against fire blight and <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> rice pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2015</xref>) and could have also suppressed the growth of <italic>R. solanacearum</italic>. Similar to the other phenotypically distinct mutants, insertions associated with increased pathogen suppression led to trade-offs with other measured traits. While more work is required to unequivocally link these mutations with associated traits at the molecular level, our findings show that all above trait improvements achieved via mutagenesis resulted in trade-offs with other traits and that this technique could be used to identify genes underlying plant growth promotion and pathogen suppression.</p><p>To overcome trait trade-offs experienced at the individual mutant level, we tested if we could improve the plant growth promotion by combining phenotypically distinct mutants into multifunctional consortia. We found that mutant performance measured in monocultures was a poor predictor of <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> performance in consortia in vitro, except for the pathogen suppression. This suggest that while the selected mutants did not show direct antagonism toward each other, they likely interacted in other ways leading to unpredictable trait expression when growing together (e.g. via certain emergent effects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldford et al., 2018</xref>). Despite this, we found clear diversity effects, where consortia richness and average performance were positively associated with both plant root colonization and plant protection from <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> pathogen infection. While important mutant identity effects were also observed, omission of these strains did not change the significance of underlying diversity effects, highlighting the importance of interactions between the consortia members in determining the positive effects on the plant health. Together, these results suggest that consortia that performed well regarding all measured traits on average had improved ability to colonize rhizosphere and suppress the pathogen. To test if these effects were driven by diversity per se or underlying trait variation between consortia members, we compared the optimized 8-mutant consortium with eight randomly assembled 8-mutant consortia that were phenotypically more similar. We found that randomly assembled consortia performed less well on average, while consortia functioning improved along with consortia relative performance, suggesting that diverse consortia performed better only when they had been assembled from phenotypically dissimilar mutants. While similar positive diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships have previously been found in more complex <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), leaf bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laforest-Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>) and grass-land soil microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wagg et al., 2019</xref>), we here show that this pattern also holds along with intra-species diversity gradient. While the measured phenotypic traits are considered to be robust to inoculum densities, it will be important to evaluate in the future if the absolute abundances of each mutant play a role in the consortia functioning.</p><p>Positive diversity effects have previously been explained by facilitation, ecological complementarity, and division of labor, which can reduce competition between the consortia members within or between niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoš et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bulleri et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, high diversity could provide stability for consortia functioning via insurance effects by increasing the likelihood of certain consortia members surviving in the soil after the inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yachi and Loreau, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boles et al., 2004</xref>). While our experiments were not designed to disentangle the relative importance of these potential mechanisms, we analyzed which mutant traits could significantly explain the dynamics of root colonization and plant protection at seedling, vegetative, and flowering stages of the tomato growth by focusing on 47 mutants. While the effect of <italic>Bacillus</italic> biomass production was consistently non-significant, both motility and biofilm formation were positively associated with the root colonization. However, motility was significant only at the seedling stage, while biofilm became significant during vegetative and flowering stages. In line with ecological succession often taking place in the rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), high motility might have allowed faster colonization of relatively ‘sterile’ young roots by <italic>Bacillus</italic>, while biofilm formation could have promoted stress tolerance and resource competition in more diverse and mature microbial communities during the later stages of tomato growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bais et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, increase in pathogen suppression, biofilm formation, and motility were positively associated with improved plant protection at the flowering stage, which suggests that all these traits were positively associated with the ecosystem functioning in terms of plant health. It is thus possible that consortia were together able to overcome the trait trade-offs experienced at the individual mutant level, leading to improved and more stable ecosystem functioning for the whole duration of tomato growth cycle. In addition, it is possible that some of the measured plant growth promotion traits might act as public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Driscoll et al., 2011</xref>), which could have been shared between different mutants, leading to overall improvement in the mutant population fitness. Such micro-scale mechanisms could be potentially validated in the future using transcriptomics and barcoded Tn-seq mutants, which would allow estimating activity and changes in mutant frequencies during bioinoculation.</p><p>In conclusion, we here demonstrate that the beneficial effects provided by a single <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> bacterium can be improved by increasing consortia functional diversity using transposon mutagenesis. Our approach highlights the importance of intra-species genetic diversity for the ecosystem functioning and provides a trait-based approach for designing microbial communities for biotechnological applications. Our approach does not require a priori knowledge on specific genes or molecular mechanisms, but instead relies on generation of trait variation which is screened and selected by the experimenter. Our method can also help to identify novel functional roles of previously characterized and uncharacterized genes. While the benefit of this method was here demonstrated in the context of agriculture, it could be applied in other biotechnological contexts, such as biofermentation, waste degradation, and food manufacturing. Future work focusing on the population dynamics, metabolism, and gene expression of different mutants will help to understand the relative importance of ecological complementarity, division of labor, insurance effects, population asynchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blüthgen et al., 2016</xref>), and facilitation for the consortia ecosystem functioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>We used phytopathogenic <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> QL-Rs1115 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wei et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> T-5 biocontrol strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) as our model bacterial species.

Briefly, K-means clustering assigns n observations into k clusters where each observation (in our case mutant) belongs to a cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid). According to the gap statistic method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tibshirani et al., 2001</xref>), three clusters was the optimum number (k) for this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). With this method, each mutant was hence assigned to one of the clusters. Clustering was further visualized using principal component analysis (PCA) based on the first two principal components to show the variety of mutants. We randomly selected approximately 10% of strains from each cluster, resulting in a subset of 47 mutants, which were used for greenhouse experiments (26, 11, and 10 mutants from clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>).

First, 5 μg of genomic DNA isolated from each respective transposon mutant was digested with Taq I and circularized using ‘Rapid Ligation’ kit (Fermentas, Germany). IPCR was carried out with ligated DNA (100 ng), using oIPCR1 and oIPCR2 primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2h</xref>). The cloned sequences were then purified using PCR purification kit (Axygen, UK) and the flanking genomic regions surrounding the transposon insertion sites were sequenced using the primer oIPCR3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2h</xref>).

At each sampling time point, three independent plants per inoculated mutant were randomly selected and sampled destructively by carefully uprooting the plant and gently removing the soil from the root system by shaking.

To test the effect of transposon insertions on potential antagonism between the mutants, we conducted two types of assays: direct growth inhibition by (1) spotting each strain on top of the others using agar overlays and(2) growing each strain in the supernatant of the other strains. With agar overlay assays, 2 μL of each mutant with density OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5 (∼10<sup>7</sup> cells mL<sup>–1</sup>) was spotted on the soft agar overlay of the other mutants and direct antagonistic effect was measured as the size of the inhibition halo observed on the soft agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fields et al., 2022</xref>). For the supernatant assay, we first cultured each mutant in liquid LB for 2 days and collected supernatants by using 0.22 μm filters.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Engineering ecologically complementary rhizosphere probiotics using consortia of specialized bacterial mutants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jacob D Palmer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. Note that while we cannot publish the current study, we remain in principle interested in the work. If you are able to seriously revise the work and respond to the concerns, we would be prepared to review the work again, although we would treat it as a new submission.</p><p>As you will see, although the reviewers see the work as novel and with the potential to design probiotic consortia, they have also raised a number of issues that will require new experiments, new analyses and important reformatting of the manuscript. After internal discussions with the reviewers, we remain in principle interested in the work but we felt that it is important to give you more time if you wish to thoroughly address the concerns. Particularly, performing pairwise interactions among mutants, testing random sets of 8-member consortia, and reorganizing the manuscript appears to be critical to corroborate the claims and improve clarity, respectively. Furthermore, the reviewers think that the experiments were not designed to test ecological theories regarding ecosystem functioning and stability but rather as a method to design probiotic consortia in agriculture. Many concepts mentioned in the introduction and discussion might not be relevant here and might distract rather than inform.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the concept/methodology is interesting and the results open novel insights towards the engineering of microbial consortia that promote disease resistance. Furthermore, the statistical analyses seem to be conducted and represented adequately. The text is well written and methods are nicely detailed. Despite the novelty, the manuscript has some, yet important weaknesses that will need to be addressed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Multi-species inoculants often fail to promote plant health under natural conditions because microbe-microbe interactions are not often considered when consortia are designed and assembled. Therefore, the idea of promoting intra-species multi-functionality through the assembly of bacterial mutants derived from a single strain is exciting. This is because it could promote functional diversity whilst at the same time minimizing the risk of competition between strains. The research question is therefore interesting and novel, the combination of methods, which include strain engineering (Tn5 mutant library), large-scale phenotypic screening and assembly of synthetic microbial consortia is adequate to test the relevance of functional complementary and multi-functionality between mutant strains.</p><p>The greenhouse experiment using a natural soil is also relevant to test the effects of the inoculants under semi-natural conditions.</p><p>The statistical analysis is adequate, the manuscript well written and the figures have been nicely crafted.</p><p>The conclusions are largely supported by experimental evidence, although it remains difficult to unambiguously conclude that the method actually works.</p><p>Weaknesses: There are some weaknesses.</p><p>First, the authors used an initial random pool of 479 mutants for in vitro trait phenotyping. It remains unclear why more mutants have not been tested given the fact that these are high-throughput in vitro screens. The authors did not use a saturated mutant library and might have overlooked many important genes.</p><p>Second, the structure of the manuscript is confusing. It remains unclear how the three clusters in Figure 1 have been defined and why they were not considered for the rational selection of the consortia shown in Figure 2. The most confusing part comes from the last paragraph and Figure 3 which shows data based on individual strains and not consortia. This is redundant with the data shown in Figure 1 and this part provides very limited information regarding the &quot;underlying mechanisms between consortia diversity and improved performance&quot;. As it is presented this part distracts rather than informs. I do not think that this is the rights way to test the &quot;insurance hypothesis&quot;. this hypothesis makes sense if tested in a community context with consortia of different complexities (as in Figure 2).</p><p>It remains also unclear whether complementarity between specialized bacterial mutants is really needed for improving plant performance (as stated in the title). The authors showed that the rational selection based on Figure 1 has some limits to predicting community behavior in vitro and in planta. Therefore, a key question is whether microbial consortia composed of random pools of 8 mutants (i.e. not pre-selected based on in vitro phenotypes) would provide similar fitness benefits as the mutant pool selected in Figure 2. In other words, is the first part of the paper really required or could one simply inoculate a pool of Tn5 mutants and observe the same protective effect? Testing the effects of several independent mutant consortia would be needed to draw general conclusions.</p><p>Finally, the paper is mechanistically weak. That being said, this is not the core of the manuscript and therefore it is not an issue. Although requesting complementation lines for the 8 mutants used for consortia establishment is beyond the scope of the manuscript, it is important to keep in mind that it is difficult to conclude anything regarding the bacteria genetic determinants identified here without proper functional validations.</p><p>To strengthen the conclusions shown in Figure 2, it would be important to test other independent consortia of 8 mutants and validate directionality in their effects depending on whether they were selected randomly or based on rational criteria. The concern is that part 1 and part 2 of the manuscripts might not be connected and it would be important to validate that the rational selection based on in vitro phenotypes is actually required and important.</p><p>The results presented in Figure 3 (individual strains) are insufficient to test the insurance effect. One would need to inspect this in the context of the various consortia shown in Figure 2. Here, it would be important to assess 1. total Bacillus load (e.g. using colony counts), 2. disease suppression and 3. &quot;community structure&quot; of the bacilli mutants. The latter can likely easily be conducted using PCRs with pairs of Tn5 transposon specific and random primers similar to classical TnSeq approaches. If the insurance hypothesis holds true, one would expect, that throughout the whole growth cycle, the complex community always performs better than the individual mutants (based on colony counts and disease suppressiveness) and also that relative abundances of Bacilli mutants change across the growth cycle. Such experiments could further reinforce the conclusion regarding insurance effects. Alternatively, authors should consider including this section as Figure 2 and tone-down their claim regarding these insurance effects that are not corroborated by experimental evidence.</p><p>Agar overlay data not shown?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study provides a novel, potentially high-throughput method for identifying beneficial microbial consortia towards plant growth and health, which may be applicable towards other biotechnological applications. This study has the potential to be of great interest to all those working in host-microbe interactions. However, it is my opinion that there is an overemphasis on microbial ecology and the inherent value of intraspecies diversity towards ecosystem health, where I think the data of this study does not meet their intended aims.</p><p>Strengths: This study provides a novel and unique approach for studying the impact of intraspecies diversity on microbial consortia and understanding host (plant)-microbe interactions. There is a very good introductory section highlighting the field of microbial ecology. The methods used seem applicable to many different potential environments, as highlighted by the authors, and might be of great interest to those working on both applied and fundamental areas of microbiology and/or host-microbe interactions. The justification of the study, the introduction, and the methods used are all very high quality. The stated expectations by the authors are also well-supported by the theoretical literature and clearly explained. The focus on intraspecies interactions and diversity is also very welcomed and appears to me to be a novel approach.</p><p>Weaknesses: It is my opinion that the narrative in the results and discussion is overly focused on the impact of intraspecies diversity in microbial ecology, and how this diversity improves ecosystem functioning. I do not think the study provides support for these claims. Instead, the study does provide excellent support for high-performing consortia of mutants, which outperform the WT monoculture across varying metrics, which has both applied and fundamental value regarding agriculture and host-microbe interactions at both the strain and molecular levels. The data provided as apart of this work provides many new avenues of research and I think is an excellent step towards developing beneficial probiotic consortia. Unfortunately, these advances are sometimes overshadowed by claims of ecosystem stability and ecosystem functioning that lack support in the data. In multiple places in the text, it is suggested that intraspecies consortia are not subject to intra-species conflict. I find this to be potentially misleading, as it implies that these genotypes now have neutral (or positive) interactions, which is not appropriately measured nor expected from the data.</p><p>Line 44-47 – I am unsure of the support that antagonistic traits often increase invasion success of probiotic bacteria, or what this statement really means. I think it could benefit by being more explicit.</p><p>The introduction may benefit from a more thorough explanation of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory (line 84), to match the excellent introduction of microbial ecology from lines 50-75.</p><p>Line 95: 'benefits' to 'beneficial</p><p>Line 96: Expected advances. It does not appear that expectations 2 or 3 are tested. Expectation 3 is also rather unclear. Please consider rewriting this section to better set the reader's expectations for the data and results in the paper.</p><p>Line 162 – Please clarify how it is known that OD600 = 0.05 equals ~10^5 cells/mL for B. amyloliquifaciens. Or omit the ~10^5 cells/mL. Additionally, I wonder if OD600 is an appropriate proxy for biomass production in a B. amyloliquifaciens mutant library? Plating and counting CFU/mL would be the much more reliable measurement. Considering the method used for biomass production measurement, did you perform these measurements in a plate reader and have additional time series data beyond the 24hr timepoint? Perhaps maximum growth rate or other factors of the growth curve may also be good indicators of beneficial phenotypes for plant health.</p><p>General Methods Comments: Given the more applied aims of this study, maintaining a constant inoculum size and measuring the outputs of the consortium is a very reasonable strategy. However, performing experiments in this way ignores the intraspecies competition that likely defines the system. This makes claims of facilitation, exploitation, or cooperation moot, as they are not being appropriately measured. The authors would need to measure monoculture densities of individual mutants, then add mutants at the same inoculum into the consortia experiments (now doubling the total bacterial inoculum of the monoculture experiments), and then measure individual strain abundance and/or total biomass to accurately test for facilitation or cooperation (the consortia biomass must exceed the sum of the 2 monoculture biomasses, and then it still might be either exploitation, facilitation, or cooperation, based on the strength of the interactions). I am still very impressed and intrigued by this study and the data obtained, but I do think it needs to focus more on the applied aspects: High performing mutant library consortia to improve agricultural yields. The experiments performed, however, don't tell us much about microbial ecology.</p><p>I am quite confused by the clusters. I don't understand the methods of this PCA plot and how mutants are assigned into the various clusters. Perhaps isolates that did not fall within the bounds, or intersected multiple groups should be excluded. The K-means clustering needs significantly more explanation in the methods. As a key aspect of the data being provided, the written methods section should make it very clear how this clustering is being performed and why it is a valid method.</p><p>Is there precedent for this type of phenotypic clustering for a transposon library? I think there is tremendous value of having a transposon library of this sort. But I don't really understand the purpose of the clustering.</p><p>Line 307-315 – Data are provided for the clusters and compared to the WT. However, statistical tests included in Figures 1E, F measure differences between clusters, rather than each cluster compared to the WT. I see that the WT is provided as the solid black line, but I think adding an additional box plot for the WT would be more appropriate.</p><p>Line 321 – I worry that a term like 'specialist mutants' could cause confusion, and perhaps imply that these mutants have niche separation relative to the WT, which hasn't been measured. I think simply 'mutants' would be more appropriate.</p><p>Line 332 – It is unclear to me how the predictive performance values were calculated. Please be explicit. When you sum the trait values of monocultures, are you first dividing that trait value according to the reduction in biomass added to the inoculum. ie when you do a 2 species consortium and add each species at 50% of their inoculum as compared to the WT, are you halving the expected trait value? Is there an existing precedent for this?</p><p>Line 363 – Stability has a specific definition in ecology that I don't think is intended here. Consider not using this term.</p><p>Line 366 – I don't understand the difference between high swarming and swarming motility. These are not differentiated in the methods.</p><p>Line 356 – 383 – I'm having a hard time following the data and logic provided here.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>Line 387 – Did your results show this? Which data/Figure? I think it would be appropriate to remind the reader where to find the evidence for this claim.</p><p>Line 392 – The intra-species diversity also introduces conflict. There is likely more inter-genotype competition in the communities assembled for this study as compared to one involved multi-species communities. The competition/conflict just hasn't been measured here.</p><p>The discussion seems overly focused on the individual mutations identified and their resulting phenotypes. Perhaps this level of depth provided for these mutants is more suited for the Results section.</p><p>Line 462 – &quot;It is thus possible that consortia were together able to overcome the trait trade-offs experienced at the individual mutant level, leading to improved and more stable ecosystem functioning in time.&quot; This language is too vague and has the potential to mislead readers. What is meant by improved ecosystem functioning? Regarding stability, this study does not measure the ecological interactions between different bacterial genotypes. The levels of intraspecific competition between microbes is likely very high, which may lead to increased stability. It may also lead to extinction of the weaker strain.</p><p>Line 468 – Is a transposon library really an example of synthetic biology? This is not how I understand the limits of the field, but I apologise if I'm uninformed.</p><p>Line 469 – I do not agree that this study highlights the importance of intraspecies diversity in ecosystem functioning. Instead, this study does highlight how intraspecies diversity libraries can be an effective mechanism for identifying traits and consortia which can rapidly improve desired measurables within a defined ecosystem. I think an overall refocusing on the applied potential of the study would be appropriate.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Yang et al. assembled a set of synthetic consortia using functionally specialized mutants generated from a rhizosphere probiotic, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and tested whether the consortia can promote the growth of the plant. Because the mutants are derived from the same strain, they should not antagonize their kins. Accordingly, this design potentially reduces within-community antagonism, overcoming a limitation occurring in the previous multi-species consortia.</p><p>Although the idea of this paper is of interest to readers in the field of microbiome and plant-microbe interactions, the manuscript is not well-organized. The Introduction section did not adequately discuss the strengths of this design compared to the previous studies. Instead, the author proposed several scientific questions that were not addressed/focused on by this study. In the Results section, several important data are missing, and some claims are not well-supported by the data. The specific comments are listed below.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The author claims that &quot;inoculant design should aim to minimize negative interactions within consortia&quot; (line 46) and the author claimed that three ways (concepts) can be used to achieve this aim: ecological complementarity, division of labor or facilitation between consortia members.</p><p>Firstly, the discussion on these concepts (lines 50-75) makes me feel that the author thinks they are three totally segregated concepts (For example, in lines 65-66: &quot;In addition to occupying different niches or performing specialized tasks&quot;). However, there are many overlaps among these three concepts. For example, if different species exploit different niches and such diversification benefits all the individuals, it can be also defined as a &quot;division of labor&quot; (based on definitions in ref. 26). Moreover, many cases of facilitation can be defined as the division of labor (see this ref: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.06.023). I would suggest that the author use more specific/distinguishable terms throughout the paper, for example, niche complementarity/ specialization within a single niche/ leaky section. In addition, the direct description of how such engineering works (e.g., engineering species to occupy different niches) may be clearer to readers than just giving terms.</p><p>Secondly, the authors discussed theories but did not state how the design in this study can benefit from these theories to overcome the proposed limitation. This makes it unclear why constructing such mutant-based synthetic consortia can &quot;minimize negative interactions within consortia&quot;. The author proposed a main scientific question &quot;whether this should be based on ecological complementarity, division of labor or facilitation between consortia members. (Lines 74-75)&quot; but this study did not address this question.</p><p>Thirdly, following the above point, a logical connection is missing between the last two paragraphs of the Introduction. In other words, does increasing intra-species diversity benefit the ecological complementarity, division of labor, or facilitation, so reduce the within-community antagonism? In addition, I would expect the authors to explain more about why increasing the intra-species diversity of a single bacterium could prevent conflicts between the consortia members. I think this is the main novelty of this study different from the previous design constructing consortia using different species. I saw some reasons were listed in lines 101-103 but expect more explanations/discussions.</p><p>In sum, the author could do a better job linking theory and experimental design.</p><p>Results</p><p>Line 320-322: I think this &quot;antagonism&quot; experiment is very important for the novelty of this study. Because the mutants are derived from the same strain, they should show less competition/antagonism within consortia, which is different from the situation in the previous multi-species consortia. Therefore, (1) the data of the &quot;agar overlay assays&quot; should be provided in the main text of the paper; (2) It will be beneficial to add more evidence (e.g., liquid co-culture); (3) It is also very important to examine if the mutants within a consortium stable coexist during the community assembly. Accordingly, the structure of the consortium during/after the assays (swarming, biofilm formation, root colonization) should be measured.</p><p>Design/analyses of the consortia experiment: in lines 324-326, the authors hypothesized that &quot;consortia could show improved performance due to ecological complementarity where different mutants 'specialize' respective to different traits, overcoming trade-offs experienced at individual strain level (Figure 1B).&quot; However, the experiments were concluded with &quot;mutant consortia diversity was positively linked with consortia performance in vivo, which was associated with consortia mean performance and pathogen suppression measured in vitro. (Lines 354-355)&quot; Obviously, the hypothesis was not well examined using the current design and analyses. For a direct test of the hypothesis, the authors should compare the performance of the consortia with niche specialization (e.g., consortium no.29) with that of the others.</p><p>Line 383: I think the conclusion here is less evident. To prove the improvement of the consortia functioning is due to the insurance effects, the performance of the 47-member consortium should be compared to the consortium with fewer members. A more rational design is to build consortia according to the four testing functions. Some consortia contain one mutant specializing in one specific function, while the others contain more mutants for the function (that is, add redundancy). Then compare the root colonization and plant protection ability of the two groups.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Engineering multifunctional rhizosphere probiotics using consortia of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens transposon insertion mutants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

All referees would – in principle – support publication of the work in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, we felt that there is still one important issue that must be carefully considered and addressed. This is regarding the new supernatant experiment, which might not be the best way to infer ecological interactions (please see comments from ref#3) and might lead to misleading interpretations. We agreed that this issue should be clarified before final acceptance of the work. We see two potential options to do so:</p><p>1) If you wish to firmly conclude that reduced competition among consortia members exists, please include single strain vs. pairwise co-culture experiments followed by colony counts (see the suggestions below for how to overcome the difficulty that the strains are nearly identical). This might actually require a limited amount of work and would be most appropriate to infer potentially neutral interactions among consortia members.</p><p>2) Alternatively, you should remove the supernatant data from the manuscript and adopt a more tempered tone for all assertions linked to how &quot;this study&quot; enhances our understanding of function by mitigating competition between the consortia members.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work is significant because it reports that intra-species phenotypic diversity in bacteria could be an effective way to improve probiotic consortia in agriculture. Authors now provide compelling evidence indicating that near-clonal bacteria assembled into consortia based on diverse functional traits perform better than randomly-assembled consortia. Two solid conclusions emerging from this work are that (1) Communities of near-clonal bacteria can be optimized based on functional traits to promote functional diversity and reduce bacterial competition (2) consortium multifunctionality – but not richness – is key to promoting bacterial colonization in roots and to protect against a plant pathogen.</p><p>In my opinion, authors have seriously and thoroughly addressed the previous concerns raised by me and other reviewers. I acknowledge the fact that they have performed additional experiments that have strengthened their conclusions. Particularly, they performed supernatant experiments testing pairwise interactions between the mutants included in their phenotypically-optimized 8-member consortium and performed validation experiments with randomly assembled 8-member consortia. These two novel experiments revealed that:</p><p>1. Limited negative or positive interactions were observed in supernatant exposure experiments, indicating that bacterial-bacterial interactions are not extensively contributing to the observed phenotypes.</p><p>2. Importantly, they used random, 8-member mutant consortia, and demonstrate that the phenotypically-optimized consortium indeed performs better than what is expected by chance. This experiment convinced me that the strategy used in the manuscript has relevance for optimizing synthetic communities based on (multi)-functional traits.</p><p>They have also reorganized the structure of the manuscript and rewrote the introduction and Discussion sections to focus more on the methodological novelty of the work and less on ecological theories.<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I only have a small suggestion optional to the authors. It might be intriguing to discuss the microscale-level mechanisms behind why the consortium outperforms a single strain. Could the four plant growth-promotion traits act as public goods? For instance, could biofilm formation specialists aid pathogen suppression specialists in better colonizing plants? It may be interesting to add some discussions to the paragraph in lines 497-516.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Collectively, I am excited to see this manuscript again, as I've been keeping an eye out to see if it had been published in another journal since my first review. It is an intriguing work and I think that many readers in the community will be interested to read it. My primary criticism remains the same as the first review, where ecological interactions are not appropriately measured. I give a detailed explanation of this in Response to R13 (below), along with references that I believe do perform appropriate experiments to measure ecological interactions between strains/genotypes. That said, my other comments appear to be appropriately addressed.</p><p>Additionally, because much of the narrative of the discussion has been rewritten to avoid direct claims about ecological interactions between the genotypes throughout the text, I no longer believe that an experiment demonstrating ecological interactions is necessary. Figure S5 should be removed, as this is not an appropriate measure of ecological interactions. The data gathered as part of Figure S5 are likely sufficient to still represent these experiments appropriately. If presented appropriately, I strongly suspect that negative interactions will be the predominant interaction type, so it would be up to the authors if they would like to present this data or not.</p><p>So long as reference to ecological interactions (whether neutral or otherwise) and Figure S5 are removed from the text (or ecological interactions are measured according to a method similar to those detailed below), the remainder of this work appears to hold together well, with the text supported by the data.</p><p>Response to R13:</p><p>Regarding Figure S5. While supernatant assays are not the preferred method to measure ecological interactions, I appreciate the authors performing an experiment to address this major comment from my first review. However, this is not the appropriate experiment and it does not support the claim that interactions between the different genotypes are neutral.</p><p>The ideal experiment would be to grow each strain in monoculture and count cfu/mL, then grow each strain in pairwise combination and count cfu/mL of each strain. If it is not possible to selectively plate in order to identify the different genotypes, one could also grow each strain in monoculture and count cfu/mL. Then again repeat growing strains in pairwise co-culture, and count the total cfu/mL. If the interactions are neutral, the prediction is that the total cfu/mL will be the sum of the two strains monoculture cell densities (cfu/mL). One could interpret this as clear niche differentiation, with no interference or exploitative competition. If you are committed to the growth supernatant assay and measuring OD600, you could grow each strain in monoculture, measure final OD600 and then filter the supernatant just as you've done. You can then grow them again in the spend media and measure the final OD600. If the interactions are neutral, then prediction is that growth in monoculture with spent media = growth in monoculture with fresh media. For any strain combination, if growth in monoculture of spent media &lt; growth in monoculture of fresh media, this is a negative interaction.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not satisfactory to infer ecological interactions as a measure of growth in supernatant relative to growth in one's own supernatant. There is full niche overlap when a strain grows in its own supernatant. Using this metric, you could have two different strains with identical nutrient requirements, that will compete with each other for these nutrients, and you would likely measure it as a neutral interaction. It is also challenging when measuring ecological interactions in liquid LB and trying to extrapolate this to interactions in vivo where the host is also present. An experiment like this in liquid LB is probably a good proxy for gauging interactions, but an experiment that is close to the environment of interest would be the most desirable. However, I understand that this can present additional challenges. I also understand that a specific aim of this study is to use in vitro phenotyping in order to optimize consortia functioning. So in that regard, an LB experiment is perhaps appropriate.</p><p>I hope that this criticism is clear. For a more comprehensive description of methods in this regard, I suggest Foster and Bell, 2012. DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2012.08.005. Additionally, Weiss et al. ISME 2022 DOI: 10.1038/s41396-021-01153-z performs nice experiments in this regard, using both monoculture vs coculture experiments (quantifying strain abundances with qPCR) as well as spent supernatant assays.</p><p>And yet, after all of this, after reading the revised discussion, I no longer think that this experiment is essential. Because the authors have removed much of the narrative regarding ecological significance and focused more on the applied aspects of this work, I do not think that these ecologically-focussed experiments are completely necessary. So long as the authors avoid claims of the interactions between genotypes (as I would argue these have still not been appropriately measured), then I don't think this experiment is necessary for this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90726.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

After internal discussions with the reviewers, we remain in principle interested in the work but we felt that it is important to give you more time if you wish to thoroughly address the concerns. Particularly, performing pairwise interactions among mutants, testing random sets of 8-member consortia, and reorganizing the manuscript appears to be critical to corroborate the claims and improve clarity, respectively. Furthermore, the reviewers think that the experiments were not designed to test ecological theories regarding ecosystem functioning and stability but rather as a method to design probiotic consortia in agriculture.

Furthermore, the statistical analyses seem to be conducted and represented adequately. The text is well written and methods are nicely detailed. Despite the novelty, the manuscript has some, yet important weaknesses that will need to be addressed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Multi-species inoculants often fail to promote plant health under natural conditions because microbe-microbe interactions are not often considered when consortia are designed and assembled. Therefore, the idea of promoting intra-species multi-functionality through the assembly of bacterial mutants derived from a single strain is exciting. This is because it could promote functional diversity whilst at the same time minimizing the risk of competition between strains. The research question is therefore interesting and novel, the combination of methods, which include strain engineering (Tn5 mutant library), large-scale phenotypic screening and assembly of synthetic microbial consortia is adequate to test the relevance of functional complementary and multi-functionality between mutant strains.</p><p>The greenhouse experiment using a natural soil is also relevant to test the effects of the inoculants under semi-natural conditions.</p><p>The statistical analysis is adequate, the manuscript well written and the figures have been nicely crafted.</p><p>The conclusions are largely supported by experimental evidence, although it remains difficult to unambiguously conclude that the method actually works.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses: There are some weaknesses.</p><p>1. First, the authors used an initial random pool of 479 mutants for in vitro trait phenotyping. It remains unclear why more mutants have not been tested given the fact that these are high-throughput in vitro screens. The authors did not use a saturated mutant library and might have overlooked many important genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included more in vitro phenotyping data to the manuscript. The full dataset now includes phenotypic data for 1999 mutants. Of these, we selected 479 phenotypically representative mutants for more detailed analysis and probiotic bioinoculant design. While we likely missed certain mutants with this method, our analysis similarity suggests that this method captured a representative and phenotypically diverse sample of mutants from the original collection. We have now justified this in the manuscript on lines 149-153.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Second, the structure of the manuscript is confusing. It remains unclear how the three clusters in Figure 1 have been defined and why they were not considered for the rational selection of the consortia shown in Figure 2. The most confusing part comes from the last paragraph and Figure 3 which shows data based on individual strains and not consortia. This is redundant with the data shown in Figure 1 and this part provides very limited information regarding the &quot;underlying mechanisms between consortia diversity and improved performance&quot;. As it is presented this part distracts rather than informs. I do not think that this is the rights way to test the &quot;insurance hypothesis&quot;. this hypothesis makes sense if tested in a community context with consortia of different complexities (as in Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now restructured and clarified these sections. Specifically, we now present all individual strain-based results before the pairwise and consortia data (including new additional data on the effects of randomly assembled 8-mutant consortia). Moreover, we have made the selection of subset of strains from the larger mutant collection clearer (the link between Figures 1 and 2; see also our response to point 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It remains also unclear whether complementarity between specialized bacterial mutants is really needed for improving plant performance (as stated in the title). The authors showed that the rational selection based on Figure 1 has some limits to predicting community behavior in vitro and in planta. Therefore, a key question is whether microbial consortia composed of random pools of 8 mutants (i.e. not pre-selected based on in vitro phenotypes) would provide similar fitness benefits as the mutant pool selected in Figure 2. In other words, is the first part of the paper really required or could one simply inoculate a pool of Tn5 mutants and observe the same protective effect? Testing the effects of several independent mutant consortia would be needed to draw general conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point. As a result, we have conducted additional experiments where we test the plant protection by randomly assembled 8-mutant consortia that vary in their phenotypic dissimilarity and predicted relative performance. These results confirm that randomly constructed mutant consortia perform worse compared to phenotypically ‘optimized’ consortium, suggesting that improvement was unlikely driven by consortium richness <italic>per se</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Finally, the paper is mechanistically weak. That being said, this is not the core of the manuscript and therefore it is not an issue. Although requesting complementation lines for the 8 mutants used for consortia establishment is beyond the scope of the manuscript, it is important to keep in mind that it is difficult to conclude anything regarding the bacteria genetic determinants identified here without proper functional validations.</p></disp-quote><p>We clearly admit these limitations in the discussion and suggest future work to uncover mechanistic aspects of our approach at the genetic level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. To strengthen the conclusions shown in Figure 2, it would be important to test other independent consortia of 8 mutants and validate directionality in their effects depending on whether they were selected randomly or based on rational criteria. The concern is that part 1 and part 2 of the manuscripts might not be connected and it would be important to validate that the rational selection based on in vitro phenotypes is actually required and important.</p></disp-quote><p>New data has now been included to strengthen these conclusions; please, also see our response to point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The results presented in Figure 3 (individual strains) are insufficient to test the insurance effect. One would need to inspect this in the context of the various consortia shown in Figure 2. Here, it would be important to assess 1. total Bacillus load (e.g. using colony counts), 2. disease suppression and 3. &quot;community structure&quot; of the bacilli mutants. The latter can likely easily be conducted using PCRs with pairs of Tn5 transposon specific and random primers similar to classical TnSeq approaches. If the insurance hypothesis holds true, one would expect, that throughout the whole growth cycle, the complex community always performs better than the individual mutants (based on colony counts and disease suppressiveness) and also that relative abundances of Bacilli mutants change across the growth cycle. Such experiments could further reinforce the conclusion regarding insurance effects. Alternatively, authors should consider including this section as Figure 2 and tone-down their claim regarding these insurance effects that are not corroborated by experimental evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that more detailed measurements and quantification of each mutant frequency would be required to support our conclusions on the insurance hypothesis. As the Tn insertions did not include unique barcodes, quantifying mutant frequencies was not possible (now mentioned in the discussion). We have hence toned down our conclusions on the role of insurance hypothesis and have removed it from the introduction as our hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Agar overlay data not shown?</p></disp-quote><p>Agar overlay data is now included. We have also added new data on the lack of pairwise inhibitory effects between the strains based on supernatant growth assays (see revised methods on lines 375-378).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study provides a novel, potentially high-throughput method for identifying beneficial microbial consortia towards plant growth and health, which may be applicable towards other biotechnological applications. This study has the potential to be of great interest to all those working in host-microbe interactions. However, it is my opinion that there is an overemphasis on microbial ecology and the inherent value of intraspecies diversity towards ecosystem health, where I think the data of this study does not meet their intended aims.</p><p>Strengths: This study provides a novel and unique approach for studying the impact of intraspecies diversity on microbial consortia and understanding host (plant)-microbe interactions. There is a very good introductory section highlighting the field of microbial ecology. The methods used seem applicable to many different potential environments, as highlighted by the authors, and might be of great interest to those working on both applied and fundamental areas of microbiology and/or host-microbe interactions. The justification of the study, the introduction, and the methods used are all very high quality. The stated expectations by the authors are also well-supported by the theoretical literature and clearly explained. The focus on intraspecies interactions and diversity is also very welcomed and appears to me to be a novel approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses: It is my opinion that the narrative in the results and discussion is overly focused on the impact of intraspecies diversity in microbial ecology, and how this diversity improves ecosystem functioning. I do not think the study provides support for these claims. Instead, the study does provide excellent support for high-performing consortia of mutants, which outperform the WT monoculture across varying metrics, which has both applied and fundamental value regarding agriculture and host-microbe interactions at both the strain and molecular levels. The data provided as apart of this work provides many new avenues of research and I think is an excellent step towards developing beneficial probiotic consortia. Unfortunately, these advances are sometimes overshadowed by claims of ecosystem stability and ecosystem functioning that lack support in the data. In multiple places in the text, it is suggested that intraspecies consortia are not subject to intra-species conflict. I find this to be potentially misleading, as it implies that these genotypes now have neutral (or positive) interactions, which is not appropriately measured nor expected from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now toned down our conclusions on the effects of intra-species diversity for the ecosystem functioning and stability. To provide more support for the lack of inhibitory effects between mutants, we have included new data based on supernatant growth assays, which demonstrates that most of the pairwise interactions were neutral or mildly positive or negative (see updated Figure S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 44-47 – I am unsure of the support that antagonistic traits often increase invasion success of probiotic bacteria, or what this statement really means. I think it could benefit by being more explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replaced ‘invasiveness’ with ‘competitiveness’ and have expanded the example to be more specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction may benefit from a more thorough explanation of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory (line 84), to match the excellent introduction of microbial ecology from lines 50-75.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning approaches earlier during the introduction to make the key idea clearer (on lines 55-83).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 95: 'benefits' to 'beneficial</p></disp-quote><p>Revised as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 96: Expected advances. It does not appear that expectations 2 or 3 are tested. Expectation 3 is also rather unclear. Please consider rewriting this section to better set the reader's expectations for the data and results in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has now been simplified and completely rewritten.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 162 – Please clarify how it is known that OD600 = 0.05 equals ~10^5 cells/mL for B. amyloliquifaciens. Or omit the ~10^5 cells/mL. Additionally, I wonder if OD600 is an appropriate proxy for biomass production in a B. amyloliquifaciens mutant library? Plating and counting CFU/mL would be the much more reliable measurement. Considering the method used for biomass production measurement, did you perform these measurements in a plate reader and have additional time series data beyond the 24hr timepoint? Perhaps maximum growth rate or other factors of the growth curve may also be good indicators of beneficial phenotypes for plant health.</p></disp-quote><p>The relationship between the OD and cell numbers is based on a calibration curves, which we now present for the wild-type, and low and high biomass producing mutants in Figure S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General Methods Comments: Given the more applied aims of this study, maintaining a constant inoculum size and measuring the outputs of the consortium is a very reasonable strategy. However, performing experiments in this way ignores the intraspecies competition that likely defines the system. This makes claims of facilitation, exploitation, or cooperation moot, as they are not being appropriately measured. The authors would need to measure monoculture densities of individual mutants, then add mutants at the same inoculum into the consortia experiments (now doubling the total bacterial inoculum of the monoculture experiments), and then measure individual strain abundance and/or total biomass to accurately test for facilitation or cooperation (the consortia biomass must exceed the sum of the 2 monoculture biomasses, and then it still might be either exploitation, facilitation, or cooperation, based on the strength of the interactions). I am still very impressed and intrigued by this study and the data obtained, but I do think it needs to focus more on the applied aspects: High performing mutant library consortia to improve agricultural yields. The experiments performed, however, don't tell us much about microbial ecology.</p></disp-quote><p>As we were interested in separating richness and species identity effects in mutant consortia, we employed substitutive experimental design, which assumes that the biomass of the consortia is kept constant (increasing individual strain density in consortia would make it impossible to disentangle diversity versus abundance effects). We now acknowledge in the discussion that our method also affected the mutant abundances relative to monoculture controls, which could have affected the observed patterns. We have now included additional data for analyzing interactions between a subset of mutants used in the diversity-ecosystem functioning experiment (see response to point 7). The applied aspect of the study has now been emphasized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am quite confused by the clusters. I don't understand the methods of this PCA plot and how mutants are assigned into the various clusters. Perhaps isolates that did not fall within the bounds, or intersected multiple groups should be excluded. The K-means clustering needs significantly more explanation in the methods. As a key aspect of the data being provided, the written methods section should make it very clear how this clustering is being performed and why it is a valid method.</p><p>Is there precedent for this type of phenotypic clustering for a transposon library? I think there is tremendous value of having a transposon library of this sort. But I don't really understand the purpose of the clustering.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified the K-means clustering in the methods (lines 186-189). Briefly, K-means clustering assigns <italic>n</italic> observations into <italic>k</italic> clusters where each observation (in our case mutant) belongs to a cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid). PCA analysis was then used to visualize the phenotypic clustering where the bounds of the clusters indicate 95% confidence intervals. Each mutant was hence assigned to one of the clusters even though mutants varied in their distance to cluster centroid means. This method is widely used in ecological studies with microbes and other taxa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 307-315 – Data are provided for the clusters and compared to the WT. However, statistical tests included in Figures 1E, F measure differences between clusters, rather than each cluster compared to the WT. I see that the WT is provided as the solid black line, but I think adding an additional box plot for the WT would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified in panels Figure 1E-F and results text that WT was assigned in the cluster 1. As the WT is only one clone, variation between technical replicates is very small. We hence feel that presenting WT performance as solid black line offers better visualization of the WT baseline. We have now included shaded area around WT mean to show variation between technical replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 321 – I worry that a term like 'specialist mutants' could cause confusion, and perhaps imply that these mutants have niche separation relative to the WT, which hasn't been measured. I think simply 'mutants' would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now simplified the text as suggested and only use the term ‘Specialist mutant’ when it is related to ecological specialism or generalism.

Please be explicit. When you sum the trait values of monocultures, are you first dividing that trait value according to the reduction in biomass added to the inoculum. ie when you do a 2 species consortium and add each species at 50% of their inoculum as compared to the WT, are you halving the expected trait value? Is there an existing precedent for this?</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been clarified in the methods; predicted value equals to the sum of trait values of each member divided by the richness of given consortium based on additive model. As a result, we are not halving the trait values as the chosen growth-based traits.

The levels of intraspecific competition between microbes is likely very high, which may lead to increased stability. It may also lead to extinction of the weaker strain.</p></disp-quote><p>Revised to add clarity; with “ecosystem functioning” we refer to “plant protection” in this occasion.

Because the mutants are derived from the same strain, they should not antagonize their kins. Accordingly, this design potentially reduces within-community antagonism, overcoming a limitation occurring in the previous multi-species consortia.</p><p>Although the idea of this paper is of interest to readers in the field of microbiome and plant-microbe interactions, the manuscript is not well-organized. The Introduction section did not adequately discuss the strengths of this design compared to the previous studies. Instead, the author proposed several scientific questions that were not addressed/focused on by this study. In the Results section, several important data are missing, and some claims are not well-supported by the data. The specific comments are listed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #3 for highly useful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>The author claims that &quot;inoculant design should aim to minimize negative interactions within consortia&quot; (line 46) and the author claimed that three ways (concepts) can be used to achieve this aim: ecological complementarity, division of labor or facilitation between consortia members.</p><p>Firstly, the discussion on these concepts (lines 50-75) makes me feel that the author thinks they are three totally segregated concepts (For example, in lines 65-66: &quot;In addition to occupying different niches or performing specialized tasks&quot;). However, there are many overlaps among these three concepts. For example, if different species exploit different niches and such diversification benefits all the individuals, it can be also defined as a &quot;division of labor&quot; (based on definitions in ref. 26). Moreover, many cases of facilitation can be defined as the division of labor (see this ref: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.06.023). I would suggest that the author use more specific/distinguishable terms throughout the paper, for example, niche complementarity/ specialization within a single niche/ leaky section. In addition, the direct description of how such engineering works (e.g., engineering species to occupy different niches) may be clearer to readers than just giving terms.</p></disp-quote><p>These are very good points, and we have now made it clearer in the introduction that these processes are not mutually exclusive. We have also clarified the terminology and rewritten the whole introduction and reduced the emphasis on division of labor and complementarity, which we did not directly quantify in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the authors discussed theories but did not state how the design in this study can benefit from these theories to overcome the proposed limitation. This makes it unclear why constructing such mutant-based synthetic consortia can &quot;minimize negative interactions within consortia&quot;. The author proposed a main scientific question &quot;whether this should be based on ecological complementarity, division of labor or facilitation between consortia members. (Lines 74-75)&quot; but this study did not address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now made our research questions clearer at the end of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thirdly, following the above point, a logical connection is missing between the last two paragraphs of the Introduction. In other words, does increasing intra-species diversity benefit the ecological complementarity, division of labor, or facilitation, so reduce the within-community antagonism? In addition, I would expect the authors to explain more about why increasing the intra-species diversity of a single bacterium could prevent conflicts between the consortia members. I think this is the main novelty of this study different from the previous design constructing consortia using different species. I saw some reasons were listed in lines 101-103 but expect more explanations/discussions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rewritten this section of the introduction and give a better justification why we would expect more closely related communities to be less competitive based on kin selection theory (with appropriate references).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, the author could do a better job linking theory and experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point, and we hope that our revised version makes this link more obvious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>Line 320-322: I think this &quot;antagonism&quot; experiment is very important for the novelty of this study. Because the mutants are derived from the same strain, they should show less competition/antagonism within consortia, which is different from the situation in the previous multi-species consortia. Therefore, (1) the data of the &quot;agar overlay assays&quot; should be provided in the main text of the paper; (2) It will be beneficial to add more evidence (e.g., liquid co-culture); (3) It is also very important to examine if the mutants within a consortium stable coexist during the community assembly. Accordingly, the structure of the consortium during/after the assays (swarming, biofilm formation, root colonization) should be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>More data has now been included (agar overlay and liquid supernatant assays; see response to point 7). Unfortunately, we were not able to quantify changes in mutant frequencies during the experiments as transposon insertions did not include barcodes. We have now made this limitation clear in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Design/analyses of the consortia experiment: in lines 324-326, the authors hypothesized that &quot;consortia could show improved performance due to ecological complementarity where different mutants 'specialize' respective to different traits, overcoming trade-offs experienced at individual strain level (Figure 1B).&quot; However, the experiments were concluded with &quot;mutant consortia diversity was positively linked with consortia performance in vivo, which was associated with consortia mean performance and pathogen suppression measured in vitro. (Lines 354-355)&quot; Obviously, the hypothesis was not well examined using the current design and analyses. For a direct test of the hypothesis, the authors should compare the performance of the consortia with niche specialization (e.g., consortium no.29) with that of the others.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see our response to point 3. Briefly, we have now conducted additional experiments where we test the plant protection by randomly assembled 8-mutant consortia. These results confirm that randomly constructed mutant consortia perform worse compared to phenotypically ‘optimized’ consortium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 383: I think the conclusion here is less evident. To prove the improvement of the consortia functioning is due to the insurance effects, the performance of the 47-member consortium should be compared to the consortium with fewer members. A more rational design is to build consortia according to the four testing functions. Some consortia contain one mutant specializing in one specific function, while the others contain more mutants for the function (that is, add redundancy). Then compare the root colonization and plant protection ability of the two groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see our response to point 3 and above.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We had substantial internal discussion of the revised manuscript, and we agree that the revisions have been substantial.</p><p>However, we felt that there is still one important issue that must be carefully considered and addressed.

It might be intriguing to discuss the microscale-level mechanisms behind why the consortium outperforms a single strain. Could the four plant growth-promotion traits act as public goods? For instance, could biofilm formation specialists aid pathogen suppression specialists in better colonizing plants? It may be interesting to add some discussions to the paragraph in lines 497-516.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for positive and very helpful comments. The production of public goods could indeed play a role here and we now mention this on lines 524-529.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Collectively, I am excited to see this manuscript again, as I've been keeping an eye out to see if it had been published in another journal since my first review. It is an intriguing work and I think that many readers in the community will be interested to read it. My primary criticism remains the same as the first review, where ecological interactions are not appropriately measured. I give a detailed explanation of this in Response to R13 (below), along with references that I believe do perform appropriate experiments to measure ecological interactions between strains/genotypes. That said, my other comments appear to be appropriately addressed.</p><p>Additionally, because much of the narrative of the discussion has been rewritten to avoid direct claims about ecological interactions between the genotypes throughout the text, I no longer believe that an experiment demonstrating ecological interactions is necessary. Figure S5 should be removed, as this is not an appropriate measure of ecological interactions. The data gathered as part of Figure S5 are likely sufficient to still represent these experiments appropriately. If presented appropriately, I strongly suspect that negative interactions will be the predominant interaction type, so it would be up to the authors if they would like to present this data or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for positive and very helpful comments. We have now replaced the Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 with a revised one, where we use 50% LB as the baseline control to calculate the relative growth as following formula:</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>OD</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>600</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>OD</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>600</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>OD</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>600</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>;</p><p>OD<sub>600 sup</sub> and OD<sub>600 LB</sub> denote for mutants’ growth in other mutants’ supernatant or in 50% LB after 24h of growth (on lines 691-694).</p><p>The results show that the biomass production of most strains decreased in the supernatant compared to their growth in 50% LB. While most of these effects were negative (up to 12.7% in magnitude), also some positive effects were observed (up to 7.1% in magnitude). This data has been kept in the manuscript to simply test if insertions affected how mutants shape each other’s growth and references to competition have been removed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So long as reference to ecological interactions (whether neutral or otherwise) and Figure S5 are removed from the text (or ecological interactions are measured according to a method similar to those detailed below), the remainder of this work appears to hold together well, with the text supported by the data.</p><p>Response to R13:</p><p>Regarding Figure S5. While supernatant assays are not the preferred method to measure ecological interactions, I appreciate the authors performing an experiment to address this major comment from my first review. However, this is not the appropriate experiment and it does not support the claim that interactions between the different genotypes are neutral.</p><p>The ideal experiment would be to grow each strain in monoculture and count cfu/mL, then grow each strain in pairwise combination and count cfu/mL of each strain. If it is not possible to selectively plate in order to identify the different genotypes, one could also grow each strain in monoculture and count cfu/mL. Then again repeat growing strains in pairwise co-culture, and count the total cfu/mL. If the interactions are neutral, the prediction is that the total cfu/mL will be the sum of the two strains monoculture cell densities (cfu/mL). One could interpret this as clear niche differentiation, with no interference or exploitative competition. If you are committed to the growth supernatant assay and measuring OD600, you could grow each strain in monoculture, measure final OD600 and then filter the supernatant just as you've done. You can then grow them again in the spend media and measure the final OD600. If the interactions are neutral, then prediction is that growth in monoculture with spent media = growth in monoculture with fresh media. For any strain combination, if growth in monoculture of spent media &lt; growth in monoculture of fresh media, this is a negative interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used 50% LB as the baseline control to determine how mutants’ supernatants affect each other’s growth in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, it is not satisfactory to infer ecological interactions as a measure of growth in supernatant relative to growth in one's own supernatant. There is full niche overlap when a strain grows in its own supernatant. Using this metric, you could have two different strains with identical nutrient requirements, that will compete with each other for these nutrients, and you would likely measure it as a neutral interaction. It is also challenging when measuring ecological interactions in liquid LB and trying to extrapolate this to interactions in vivo where the host is also present. An experiment like this in liquid LB is probably a good proxy for gauging interactions, but an experiment that is close to the environment of interest would be the most desirable. However, I understand that this can present additional challenges. I also understand that a specific aim of this study is to use in vitro phenotyping in order to optimize consortia functioning. So in that regard, an LB experiment is perhaps appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that in vivo environment would be the most appropriate way to test the effect of competition between mutants. Hence, we have toned down our interpretation on the competition between consortia members throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I hope that this criticism is clear. For a more comprehensive description of methods in this regard, I suggest Foster and Bell, 2012. DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2012.08.005. Additionally, Weiss et al. ISME 2022 DOI: 10.1038/s41396-021-01153-z performs nice experiments in this regard, using both monoculture vs coculture experiments (quantifying strain abundances with qPCR) as well as spent supernatant assays.</p><p>And yet, after all of this, after reading the revised discussion, I no longer think that this experiment is essential. Because the authors have removed much of the narrative regarding ecological significance and focused more on the applied aspects of this work, I do not think that these ecologically-focussed experiments are completely necessary. So long as the authors avoid claims of the interactions between genotypes (as I would argue these have still not been appropriately measured), then I don't think this experiment is necessary for this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that our revisions have now resolved this final outstanding issue. We also want to thank the reviewer for raising this important point and taking time to thoroughly revise our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
