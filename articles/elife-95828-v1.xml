We previously found evidence that human colorectal cancer cells in vivo release large multivesicular body-like structures en bloc. Here, we tested whether this large EV type is unique to colorectal cancer cells. We found that all cell types we studied (including different cell lines and cells in their original tissue environment) released multivesicular large EVs (MV-lEVs). We also demonstrated that upon spontaneous rupture of the limiting membrane of the MV-lEVs, their intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) escaped to the extracellular environment by a ‘torn bag mechanism’. We proved that the MV-lEVs were released by ectocytosis of amphisomes (hence, we termed them amphiectosomes). Both ILVs of amphiectosomes and small EVs separated from conditioned media were either exclusively CD63 or LC3B positive. According to our model, upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with autophagosomes, fragments of the autophagosomal inner membrane curl up to form LC3B positive ILVs of amphisomes, while CD63 positive small EVs are of multivesicular body origin. Our data suggest a novel common release mechanism for small EVs, distinct from the exocytosis of multivesicular bodies or amphisomes, as well as the small ectosome release pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>amphisome</kwd><kwd>extracellular

cellular homeostasis and intercellular communication. Exosomes have been defined as small (~50–200 nm) EVs (sEVs) of endosomal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buzas, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Théry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Welsh et al., 2024</xref>). Although autophagy is a major cellular homeostatic mechanism and is implicated in a broad spectrum of human diseases, the intersection of autophagy and exosome secretion remains poorly understood. Recently, regulatory interactions have been shown between autophagy-related molecules and EV biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murrow et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the LC3-conjugation machinery was demonstrated to specify the cargo packaged into EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leidal et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, both others and we reported the secretion of LC3-carrying exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leidal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minakaki et al., 2018</xref>). Particularly relevant to the findings presented here is the implication of amphisomes hybrid organelles formed by the fusion of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fader et al., 2008</xref>) in EV biogenesis. It was suggested that fusion of the limiting membrane of amphisomes with the plasma membrane of cells results in a subsequent release of exosomes by exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buzas, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Théry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jeppesen et al., 2019</xref>). The current study was prompted by our recent data showing the in vivo en bloc release of large, MVB-like sEV clusters by human colorectal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Valcz et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we investigated if this was a colorectal cancer cell-specific phenomenon. Unexpectedly, we found that it was a general mechanism of sEV release that we designated as ‘torn bag mechanism’.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In this study, we analyzed in situ fixed, cultured cells with the released EVs preserved in their original microenvironment on a surface coated by gelatin and fibronectin. We detected large multivesicular EVs (MV-lEVs) in sections of different immersion fixed organs. We tested tumorous HT29, HepG2, and non-tumorous HEK293, HEK293T-PalmGFP, HL1 cell lines, as well as primary suspension-type bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs).

First, we analyzed the microenvironment of in situ fixed HEK293T-PalmGFP cells by confocal microscopy.

Normalized fluorescence intensities were calculated to determine the relative localization of the limiting membrane (PalmGFP), the conventional sEV markers, and the LC3B signal (<bold>G–L</bold>). Fluorescence intensity peaks of sEV markers were largely overlapping with each other, while the LC3B signal and the sEV markers showed separation.

The limiting membrane of amphisomes was LC3B negative, and the internal membranous structures were either LC3B or CD63 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6M</xref>). The same immunoreactivity was also observed in the ILVs of the released amphiectosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6N</xref>).

The diameters of ILVs within MVBs, amphisomes, and amphiectosomes were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6Q</xref>), and the differences were likely due to the different membrane composition, pH, and osmotic conditions within these structures. In agreement with our observations with separated sEVs, LC3B positive ILVs had a significantly larger diameter than the LC3B negative ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6R</xref>) possibly indicating difference in membrane composition and their different intracellular origin. Based on all the above findings, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>): autophagosomes and MVBs fuse to form amphisomes, and the inner, LC3 positive membrane of autophagosomes undergoes fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klionsky, 2021</xref>). Membrane fragments curl up and form LC3 positive ILVs. Therefore, amphisomes contain both MVB-derived CD63 positive/LC3 negative and autophagosome-derived, CD63 negative/LC3 positive ILVs. The amphisome is next released from the cell by ectocytosis. Finally, the plasma membrane-derived outer membrane ruptures enabling the ILVs escape to the extracellular space by a ‘torn bag mechanism’. By using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we documented the intracellular phases of our proposed model: MVB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), autophagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), the fusion of MVB and autophagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), fragmentation of the LC3 positive membrane and ILV formation from the membrane fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and mature amphisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The plasma membrane origin of the external membrane of amphiectosome was further supported by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-based live-cell labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Amphiectosome release and its modulation.</title><p>Based on our data, a model of amphiectosome release was generated (<bold>A</bold>). Panel A was created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/n26h756">BioRender.com</ext-link>. According to this model, the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and autophagosomes forms amphisomes. The LC3B positive membrane layer (indicated in cyan) undergoes disintegration and forms LC3B positive intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) inside the amphisome. Later, the amphisome is released into the extracellular space by ectocytosis and can be identified extracellularly as an amphiectosome. Finally, the limiting membrane(s) of the amphiectosome is ruptured and the ILVs are released as small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) into the extracellular space by a ‘torn bag mechanism’. Steps of amphisome formation including LC3 positive ILV formation in 30 µM Chloroquine-treated HEK293T-PalmGFP cells was followed by super-resolution (stimulated emission depletion [STED]) microscopy (<bold>B–F</bold>). The super-resolution STED channels were LC3B (cyan) and CD63 (magenta), while yellow indicates the confocal PalmGFP signal. Intracellular vesicular structures (such as endosomes, MVBs, and amphisomes) may receive PalmGFP from the plasma membrane. An MVB (<bold>B</bold>), an autophagosome with PalmGFP negative membrane (<bold>D</bold>), fusion of an autophagosome and an MVB (<bold>C</bold>), formation of LC3B positive ILVs in an amphisome (<bold>F</bold>), and a mature amphisome (<bold>E</bold>) were detected. To confirm the origin of the external membrane layer of amphiectosomes, fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was applied. The plasma membrane of the living non-fluorescent HEK293 cells was labeled. As the external membrane of the budding amphiectosome was WGA positive, its plasma membrane origin is confirmed (<bold>G</bold>). To further support our model on amphiectosome release and ‘torn bag’ EV secretion, different in vitro treatments were applied. Cytochalasin B, Colchicine, Chloroquine, Bafilomycin A1, and Rapamycin were used to modulate amphiectosome release. Targeted molecular processes are summarized (<bold>H</bold>). Panel H was created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/x03d522">BioRender.com</ext-link>. While Cytochalasin B inhibits actin-dependent membrane budding and cell migration, Colchicine blocks the microtubule-dependent intracellular trafficking. While Chloroquine and Bafilomycin have similar, Rapamycin has opposite effect on lysosome-autophagosome or lysosome-amphisome fusion. Chloroquine and Bafilomycin inhibit lysosomal degradation while Rapamycin accelerates it. Based on confocal microscopy, Cytochalasin B (CytoB) did not alter the dynamics of amphiectosome release (<bold>I</bold>). In contrast, both Colchicine (Colch) and Rapamycin (Rapa) significantly inhibited the release of amphiectosomes, while Chloroquine (Chloro) and Bafilomycin (Bafilo) increased the release frequency. There was no difference between the effect of Chloroquine and Bafilomycin (<bold>I</bold>).

The release of MV-lEVs was monitored by confocal microscopy of in situ fixed cell cultures. Optimal test conditions were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>) and the results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>. Original LASX files which served as a basis of our quantification are publicly available (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6019/S-BIAD1456">10.6019/S-BIAD1456</ext-link>). An example for our approach to count the MV-lEVs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>. Cytochalasin B did not have any effect on the discharge of MV-lEVs suggesting that the release did not involve a major actin-dependent mechanism. In contrast, there was a significant reduction of the MV-lEV secretion upon exposure of the cells to Colchicine indicating a role of microtubules in the release of the MV-lEVs. While Rapamycin significantly reduced the discharge of MV-lEVs, Chloroquine and Bafilomycin induced an enhanced MV-lEV secretion. Rapamycin activates autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xie et al., 2021</xref>), therefore, it induces a shift toward degradation as opposed to secretion. The lysosomotropic agents Chloroquine and Bafilomycin are known to interfere with the acidification of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). By blocking the degradation pathway of MVBs/amphisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), an enhanced sEV secretion is observed. This effect is well known for exosome secretion from MVBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edgar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>). The diameters of the released MV-lEVs were determined based on confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Metabolic activity of the cells was determined by a Resazurin assay, and a significant reduction was detected upon exposure of the cells to Rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) in line with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). LC3II is the membrane-associated, lipidated autophagic form of LC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tanida et al., 2008</xref>) and it is the hallmark of autophagy-related membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klionsky, 2021</xref>). Importantly, by western blot, we not only showed the presence of the membrane-bound LC3II in serum-free, lEV-depleted (sEV containing) conditioned medium of both HEK293T-PalmGFP and HEK293T-PalmGFP-LC3RFP cells, but the amount of LC3II substantially increased upon Chloroquine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Raw data of western blots are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>.</p><p>Recent advances in the EV field shed light on migrasomes, a special type of MV-lEVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). With their pomegranate-like ultrastructure, migrasomes resemble amphiectosomes. Therefore, we tested the presence of TSPAN4, a migrasome limiting membrane marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2015</xref>), in amphiectosomes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B, G, and H</xref> shows that although TSPAN4 was present intraluminally in the HEK293T-PalmGFP-derived MV-lEVs, it was clearly absent from their external membrane. Surprisingly, we identified two different HT29 cell-derived MV-lEV populations: one in which TSPAN4 was only located intraluminally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E, I, and K</xref>), and another one with a TSPAN4 positive external membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, F, J, and L</xref>). This raised the possibility that the latter population corresponded to migrasomes. Our co-localization analysis also confirmed the existence of two distinct MV-lEV populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Next, we carried out live-cell imaging on HEK293T-PalmGFP-LC3RFP cells. The released MV-lEVs were either LC3 positive or negative intraluminally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N and O</xref>). Our TEM images confirmed that certain cell types can release both migrasome-like structures and amphiectosomes. MV-lEVs with typical migrasome-associated retraction fiber(s) were detected in the case of HL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>), HEK293T-PalmGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>), and BMMC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>). Of note, it cannot be excluded that the elongated structures observed in the above cases may correspond to tunnelling nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Drab et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, the same cell lines also released amphiectosomes by budding from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S–U</xref>). Taken together, based on the absence of TSPAN4 in their external membrane, and their lack of association with retraction fibers, amphiectosomes appear to be distinct from migrasomes. Besides migrasomes, another MV-lEV type was described in the case of gastrointestinal tumors and low-grade glioblastoma cells referred to as spheresome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baselga et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Junquera et al., 2016</xref>). However, there is no data on a relationship of spheresome release and autophagy. Recently, endothelial cell-derived, multicompartmented microvesicles (MCMVs) were shown to protrude and pinch off from the cell surface releasing ILVs by a mechanism similar to exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petersen et al., 2023</xref>). The absence of protrusion clusters described for MCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petersen et al., 2023</xref>) distinguishes amphiectosomes from MCMVs. In addition, the previously described so-called ‘nodal vesicular parcels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>) might be special examples of amphiectosomes. Finally, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the release autophagy and stress-related large EVs (lEVs) (exophers) has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2024</xref>). They contain damaged organelles and do not have an MV-lEV-like ultrastructure. In contrast, the amphiectosomes we described here have multivesicular structure without recognizable damaged organelles.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of amphiectosomes and migrasomes.</title><p>Commonly used small extracellular vesicle (sEV) markers (CD63, CD81) and TSPAN4, a suggested migrasome marker, were tested in in situ fixed intact multivesicular large EVs (MV-lEVs) of HEK293T-PalmGFP (<bold>A, B</bold>) and HT29 (<bold>C–F</bold>) cells by confocal microscopy. Normalized fluorescence intensities were calculated to determine the relative localization of the limiting membrane (with PalmGFP or lactadherin labeling) and the CD63/TSPAN4 and CD81/TSPAN4 markers (<bold>G–L</bold>). In the case of HEK293T-PalmGFP-derived EVs, we did not find migrasomes with TSPAN4 in their limiting membrane. The TSPAN4 signal was only detected intraluminally in the MV-lEVs. The limiting membranes of HT29-derived MV-lEVs were either TSPAN4 positive or negative. The co-localization rate between the limiting membrane and TSPAN4 was low in case of HEK293T-PalmGFP-derived EVs. In the case of HT29 cells, two MV-lEV populations were identified: one with low and one with high co-localization rates (<bold>M</bold>). Live-cell imaging of HEK293T-PalmGFP-LC3RFP cells showed retraction fiber-associated MV-lEVs with or without intraluminal LC3 positivity (<bold>N, O</bold>). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we could identify structures with retraction fiber-associated morphology in the case of HL1 cells (<bold>P</bold>), HEK293T-PalmGFP cells (<bold>Q</bold>), and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) (<bold>R</bold>). For comparison, budding of amphiectosomes of the same HL1 cells (<bold>S</bold>), HEK293TPalmGFP cells (<bold>T</bold>), and BMMCs (<bold>U</bold>) are shown (without being associated with long retractions fibers).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95828-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our approach, involving in situ fixation of cultures and tissues, made it possible to recognize sEV release from amphiectosomes by the ‘torn bag mechanism’. We propose that this mechanism could be easily missed earlier if conditioned medium was subjected to centrifugation, SEC purification, or even to simple pipetting, which may rupture the limiting membrane of amphiectosomes. This aligns with our observation that the spontaneous escape of ILVs from untouched amphiectosomes can be completed as early as 5 min after amphiectosome release. Based on our data presented here, and considering that the exocytosis of MVBs/amphisomes under steady-state conditions is rarely documented in the scientific literature, we suggest that amphiectosome secretion and the ‘torn bag mechanism’ may have a significant, yet previously unrecognized, role in sEV biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

As serum starvation significantly affects autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2023</xref>), and EV-depleted FBS in the cell culture medium may influence cellular physiology and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lehrich et al., 2021</xref>), FBS was not removed before fixation. Our study focuses on lEVs with diameter &gt;350–500 nm. EVs in this size range are negligible in FBS because of sterile filtration and heat inactivation of the serum. Unlike the majority of the studies in the field of EVs, here we analyzed untouched, in situ fixed and cultured cells together with their microenvironment. Since centrifugation may disrupt the limiting membrane of amphiectosomes, the in situ fixation made it possible to observe them in their intact form. The culture medium was gently removed by pipetting from above the cells leaving a thin medium layer only (approximately 150 µL of liquid on the cells). Without any further washing, cells were in situ fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature (RT). The released lEVs were either fixed and captured during the release or were preserved on the gelatin/fibronectin surface coating. After fixation, 3×5 min washes with 50 mM glycine in PBS were carried out. In the case of the non-fluorescent HepG2 and HT29 cells, a lactadherin-based plasma membrane staining was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kovács et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vukman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Németh et al., 2023</xref>). Lactadherin (Haematologic Technologies) was conjugated to ATTO488 fluorophore (abcam) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The lactadherin-ATTO488 conjugate was added to the fixed cells in 1:100 dilution in PBS (for 1 hr, RT) before permeabilization. The unbound lactadherin was removed by washing with PBS (three times, 5 min, RT) and post-fixation was carried out by 4% PFA (20 min, RT). PFA was removed by washes with 50 mM glycine in PBS (three times, 5 min, RT). Blocking and permeabilization of the cells were performed by 10% FBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS (1 hr, RT). In general, primary antibodies were applied in 1:200 dilution O/N at 4°C in the above blocking and permeabilization solution. Excess primary antibodies were eliminated by washing with the blocking and permeabilization solution (three times, 5 min, RT). The secondary antibodies were applied in 1:1000 dilution in 1% FBS in PBS (1 hr, RT). Unbound secondary antibodies were eliminated by washing (1% FBS, in PBS, two times, 5 min; PBS two times, 5 min; water two times, 5 min) and the samples were mounted in ProLong Diamond with DAPI (Invitrogen).</p><p>In order to provide evidence for the plasma membrane origin of the outer membrane layer of amphiectosomes, HEK293 were cultured on glass coverslips (VWR). Reaching 60% confluency, the cells were incubated in expansion medium with 5 µg/mL CF488A-conjugated WGA for 30 min at 37°C. After labeling the surface of the plasma membrane by WGA, cells were washed three times by expansion medium and were cultured for an additional 3 hr. Next, they were fixed by 4% PFA (20 min, RT). LC3B and CD63 labeling were performed as described above.</p><p>Microscopic slides were examined by Leica SP8 Lightning confocal microscope with adaptive lightning mode using an HC PL APO CS2 ×63/1.40 OIL objective with hybrid detector. Where we showed released MV-lEVs, they were not joined to cells in another detected Z-plane. The applied lookup tables (LUT) were linear during this study. For image analysis and co-localization studies, we applied Leica LASX software using unprocessed raw images. In case of co-localization studies, a 20% threshold and 10% background settings were applied.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Multi-channel STED super-resolution imaging</title><p>Immunofluorescent labeling for multi-channel STED nanoscopy was performed as in the case of confocal microscopy. The primary antibodies used were: LC3B (rabbit) and CD63 (mouse). Abberior Star 635P Goat anti Mouse and Abberior Star 580 Goat anti Rabbit secondary antibodies for STED microscopy have been obtained from Abberior GmbH. Samples were mounted with SlowFade Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo). Immunofluorescence was analyzed using an Abberior Instruments Facility Line STED Microscope system built on an Olympus IX83 fully motorized inverted microscope base (Olympus), equipped with a ZDC-830 TrueFocus Z-drift compensator system, an IX3-SSU ultrasonic stage, a QUADScan Beam Scanner scanning head, APD detectors, and an UPLXAPO60XO ×60 oil immersion objective (NA 1.42). We used the 488, 561, and 640 nm solid-state lasers for imaging, and a 775 nm solid-state laser for STED depletion.

Maturation and fusion of endosomes and lysosomes were inhibited by 30 μM Chloroquine (Invitrogen) or 10 nM BafilomycinA1 (Sigma). Actin polymerization was inhibited by 125 ng/mL Cytochalasin B (Sigma). Tubulin polymerization and function were inhibited by 250 pg/mL Colchicine, while an autophagy-related degradation was induced by 50 ng/mL Rapamycin. The selected concentrations were determined based on both literature data and our preliminary experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Previous studies had suggested that intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) inside endosomal multivesicular bodies and amphisomes can be secreted by fusion of the compartment with the plasma membrane. The 'torn bag mechanism' considered in this manuscript is distinctly different, because it involves initial budding off of a plasma membrane-enclosed compartment (called the amphiectosome in this manuscript, or MV-lEV). The authors successfully set out to investigate whether this mechanism is common to many cell types and to determine some of the subcellular processes involved.</p><p>The strengths of the study are:</p><p>(1) The high-quality imaging approaches used, including live-cell imaging and EN, which seem to show good examples of the proposed mechanism.</p><p>(2) They screen several cell lines for these structures, also search for similar structures in vivo, and show the tearing process by real-time imaging.</p><p>(3) Regarding the intracellular mechanisms of ILV production, the authors also try to demonstrate the different stages of amphiectosome production and differently labelled ILVs using immuno-EM.</p><p>Several of the techniques employed are technically challenging to do well, and so these are critical strengths of the manuscript.</p><p>Overall, I think the authors have been successful in identifying amphiectosomes secreted from multiple cell lines and cells in vivo, and in demonstrating that the ILVs inside them have at least two origins (autophagosome membrane and late endosomal multivesicular body) based on the markers that they carry. Inevitably, it remains unclear how universal this mechanism is in vivo and its overall contribution to EV function.</p><p>I think there could be a significant impact on the EV field and consequently on our understanding of cell-cell signalling based on these findings. It will flag the importance of investigating the release of amphiectosomes in other studies, especially as the molecular mechanisms involved in this type of 'ectosomal-style' release will be different from multivesicular compartment fusion to the plasma membrane and should be possible to be manipulated independently.</p><p>In general, the EV field has struggled to link up analysis of the subcellular biology of sEV secretion and the biochemical/physical analysis of the sEVs themselves, so from that perspective, the manuscript provides a novel angle on this problem.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95828.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

authors' research group had previously demonstrated the release of large multivesicular body-like structures by human colorectal cancer cells. This manuscript expands on their findings, revealing that this phenomenon is not exclusive to colorectal cancer cells but is also observed in various other cell types, including different cultured cell lines, as well as cells in the mouse kidney and liver.

The reported observations are intriguing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is essential to note that the manuscript has issues with experimental designs and lacks consistency in the presented data. Here is a list of the major concerns:</p><p>(1) The authors culture the cells in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the culture medium. Given that FBS contains a substantial amount of EVs, this raises a significant issue, as it becomes challenging to differentiate between EVs derived from FBS and those released by the cells. This concern extends to all transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1, 2P-S, S5, Figure 4 P-U) and the quantification of EV numbers in Figure 3. The authors need to use an FBS-free cell culture medium.</p></disp-quote><p>Although FBS indeed contains bovine EVs, however, the presence of very large multivesicular EVs (amphiectosomes) that our manuscript focuses on has never been observed and reported. For reported size distributions of EVs in FBS, please find a few relevant references below:</p><p>PMID: 29410778, PMID: 33532042, PMID: 30940830 and PMID: 37298194</p><p>All the above publications show that the number of lEVs &gt; 350-500 nm is negligible in FBS. The average diameter of MV-lEVs (amphiectosomes) described in our manuscript is around 1.00-1.50 micrometer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold> These papers evaluated the effectiveness of various methods to eliminate EVs from FBS, emphasizing the challenges associated with the presence of EVs in FBS. They also caution against using FBS in EV studies due to these issues. However, I did not find a clear indication regarding the size distributions of EVs in FBS in these papers.</p><p>Please provide accurate reference supporting the claim that 'lEVs &gt; 350-500 nm are negligible in FBS.' The papers cited by the authors do not address this specific point.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we addressed the point that due to sterile filtering of FBS, it cannot contain large &gt;0.22 µm EVs</p><p><bold>Our response to Reviewer #1 point 2.</bold> When we demonstrated the TEM of isolated EVs, we consistently used serum- free conditioned medium (Fig2 P-S, Fig2S5 J, O) as described previously (Németh et al 2021, PMID: 34665280).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold>: This is an important point that is not mentioned in the original main text, figure legend or method. Please address.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we apologize for it. We added this information to the revised manuscript.</p><p><bold>Our response to Reviewer #1 point 3</bold>. Our TEM images show cells captured in the process of budding and scission of large multivesicular EVs excluding the possibility that these structures could have originated from FBS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold> These images may also depict the engulfment of EVs in FBS. Hence, it is crucial to utilize EV-free or EV-depleted FBS.</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned earlier, we added the information to the revised manuscript that sterile filtering of the FBS presumably removed particles &gt;0.22 µm EVs</p><p><bold>Our response to Reviewer #1 point</bold> 4. In addition, in our confocal analysis, we studied Palm-GFP positive, cell-line derived MV-lEVs. Importantly, in these experiments, FBS-derived EVs are non-fluorescent, therefore, the distinction between GFP positive MV-lEVs and FBS-derived EVs was evident.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold> I agree that these fluorescent-labeled assays conclusively indicate that the MV-lEVs are originating from the cells. However, the images of concerns are the non- fluorescent-labeled images in (Figure 1, 2P-S, S5, Figure 4 P-U and Figure 3).

Previous studies have suggested that intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) inside endosomal multivesicular bodies and amphisomes can be secreted by the fusion of the compartment with the plasma membrane. The 'torn bag mechanism' considered in this manuscript is distinctly different because it involves initial budding off of a plasma membrane-enclosed compartment (called the amphiectosome in this manuscript, or MV-lEV). The authors successfully set out to investigate whether this mechanism is common to many cell types and to determine some of the subcellular processes involved.</p><p>The strengths of the study are:</p><p>(1) The high-quality imaging approaches used, seem to show good examples of the proposed mechanism.</p><p>(2) They screen several cell lines for these structures, also search for similar structures in vivo, and show the tearing process by real-time imaging.</p><p>(3) Regarding the intracellular mechanisms of ILV production, the authors also try to demonstrate the different stages of amphiectosome production and differently labelled ILVs using immuno-EM.</p><p>Several of these techniques are technically challenging to do well, and so these are critical strengths of the manuscript.</p><p>The weaknesses are:</p><p>(1) Most of the analysis is undertaken with cell lines. In fact, all of the analysis involving the assessment of specific proteins associated with amphiectosomes and ILVs are performed in vitro, so it is unclear whether these processes are really mirrored in vivo. The images shown in vivo only demonstrate putative amphiectosomes in the circulation, which is perhaps surprising if they normally have a short half-life and would need to pass through an endothelium to reach the vessel lumen unless they were secreted by the endothelial cells themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous results analyzing PFA-fixed, paraffin embedded sections of colorectal cancer patients provided direct evidence that MV-lEV secretion also occurs in humans in vivo (PMID: 31007874). Regarding your comment on the presence of amphiectosomes in the circulation despite their short half-lives, we would like to point out that Fig1.X shows a circulating lymphocyte which releases MV-lEV within the vessel lumen. Furthermore, in the revised manuscript, an additional Fig.1-S1 is provided. Here, we show the release of MV-lEVs both by an endothelial and a sub-endothelial cell (Fig.1-S1G). In addition, these images show the simultaneous presence of MV-lEVs and sEVs in the circulation (Fig.1-S1.A,C,D,H and I). The transmission electron micrographs of mouse kidney and liver sections provide additional evidence that the MV-lEVs are released by different types of cells, and the “torn bag release” also takes place in vivo (Fig.1.V).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The analysis of the intracellular formation of compartments involved in the secretion process (Figure 2-S5) relies on immuno-EM, which is generally less convincing than high-/super-resolution fluorescence microscopy because the immuno-labelling is inevitably very sporadic and patchy. High-quality EM is challenging for many labs (and seems to be done very well here), but high-/super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques are more commonly employed, and the study already shows that these techniques should be applicable to studying the intracellular trafficking processes.</p></disp-quote><p>As you suggested, in the revised manuscript, we present additional super-resolution microscopy (STED) data. The intracellular formation of amphisomes, the fragmentation of LC3B-positive membranes and the formation of LC3B-positive ILVs were captured (Fig. 3B-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) One aspect of the mechanism, which needs some consideration, is what happens to the amphisome membrane, once it has budded off inside the amphiectosome. In the fluorescence images, it seems to be disrupted, but presumably, this must happen after separation from the cell to avoid the release of ILVs inside the cell. There is an additional part of Figure 1 (Figure 1Y onwards), which does not seem to be discussed in the text (and should be), that alludes to amphiectosomes often having a double membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your comment regarding the amphisome membrane and we added a sentence to the Discussion of the revised manuscript. Fig1Y onwards is now discussed in the manuscript. In addition, we labelled the surface of living HEK293 cells with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which binds to sialic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. After removing the unbound WGA by washes, the cells were cultured for an additional 3 hours, and the release of amphiectosomes was studied. The budding amphiectosome had WGA positive membrane providing evidence that the external limiting membrane had a plasma membrane origin (Fig.3G)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The real-time analysis of the amphiectosome tearing mechanism seemed relatively slow to me (over three minutes), and if this has been observed multiple times, it would be helpful to know if this is typical or whether there is considerable variation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. In the revised manuscript, we highlight that the first released LC3 positive ILV was detected as early as within 40 sec.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I think the authors have been successful in identifying amphiectosomes secreted from multiple cell lines and demonstrating that the ILVs inside them have at least two origins (autophagosome membrane and late endosomal multivesicular body) based on the markers that they carry. The analysis of intracellular compartments producing these structures is rather less convincing and it remains unclear what cells release these structures in vivo.</p><p>I think there could be a significant impact on the EV field and consequently on our understanding of cell-cell signalling based on these findings. It will flag the importance of investigating the release of amphiectosomes in other studies, and although the authors do not discuss it, the molecular mechanisms involved in this type of 'ectosomal-style' release will be different from multivesicular compartment fusion to the plasma membrane and should be possible to be manipulated independently. Any experiments that demonstrate this would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments of the reviewer. Experiments are on their way to elucidate the mechanism of the “ectosomal style” exosome release and will be the topic of our next publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the EV field has struggled to link up analysis of the subcellular biology of sEV secretion and the biochemical/physical analysis of the sEVs themselves, so from that perspective, the manuscript provides a novel angle on this problem.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe a novel mode of release of small extracellular vesicles. These small EVs are released via the rupture of the membrane of so-called amphiectosomes that resemble &quot;morphologically&quot; Multivesicular Bodies.</p><p>These structures have been initially described by the authors as released by colorectal cancer cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2019.1596668">https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2019.1596668</ext-link>). In this manuscript, they provide experiments that allow us to generalize this process to other cells. In brief, amphiectosomes are likely released by ectocytosis of amphisomes that are formed by the fusion of multivesicular endosomes with autophagosomes. The authors propose that their model puts forward the hypothesis that LC3 positive vesicles are formed by &quot;curling&quot; of the autophagosomal membrane which then gives rise to an organelle where both CD63 and LC3 positive small EVs co-exist and would be released then by a budding mechanism at the cell surface that appears similar to the budding of microvesicles /ectosomes. Very correctly the authors make the distinction from migrasomes because these structures appear very similar in morphology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The findings are interesting despite that it is unclear what would be the functional relevance of such a process and even how it could be induced. It points to a novel mode of release of extracellular vesicles.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This reviewer has comments and concerns concerning the interpretation of the data and the proposed model.

This should label the different compartments before and after fusion with specific markers that highlight the protein signature of the different limiting and ILV membranes much more clearly than immuno-EM. It will also help in characterising the double-membrane structure of amphiectosomes at the point of budding and reveal whether the patchy labelling of the inner membrane emerges after amphiectosome release (the schematic model currently suggests that it happens before).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. STED microscopy was applied and results are shown in new Fig3 and the schematic model was modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The implications of the manuscript would be more wide-ranging if the authors could test genetic manipulations that are believed to block exosome or ectosome release, eg. Rab27a or Arrdc1 knockdown. This may allow them to determine whether MV-lEVs can be released independently of the classical exosome release mechanism because they use a different route to be released from the plasma membrane. This experiment is not essential, but I think it would start to address the core regulatory mechanisms involved, and if successful, would easily allow the authors to determine the ratio of CD63-positive sEVs being secreted via classical versus amphiectosome routes.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion is very valuable for us and these studies are being performed in a separate project.</p><p>I think there are several other ways in which the manuscript could be improved to better explain some of the approaches, findings and interpretation:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Include some explanation in the text of certain key tools, particularly:</p><p>a. Palm-GFP and whether its expression might alter the properties of the plasma membrane since this is used in a lot of experiments and is the only marker that seems to uniformly label the outer membrane of amphiectosomes. One concern might be that its expression drives amphiectosome secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>We found evidence for amphiectosome release also in the case of several different cells not expressing Palm-GFP. We believe, this excludes the possibility that Palm-GFP expression is the inducer of the amphiectosome release. Both by fluorescent and electron microscopy, the Palm-GFP non expressing cells showed very similar MV-lEVs. In addition, in the case of non-transduced HEK293 and fluorescent WGA-binding, we made similar observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Lactadherin - does this label the amphiectosomes after their release or does the wash-off step mean that it only labels cells, which subsequently release amphiectosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Lactadherin labels the amphiectosomes after their release and fixation.

Without analyzing serial ultrathin sections, determination of the relative ratio of MV-lEVs and sEVs would depend on the actual section plane. In future projects, we will determine the ratio of LC3 positive and negative sEVs by single EV analysis techniques (such as SP-IRIS).
