non-coding RNAs. Many of these terminate early and are then rapidly degraded, but how their transcription is restricted is poorly understood. In a screen for protein-coding gene transcriptional termination factors, we identified ZC3H4. Its depletion causes upregulation and extension of hundreds of unstable transcripts, particularly antisense RNAs and those transcribed from so-called super-enhancers. These loci are occupied by ZC3H4, suggesting that it directly functions in their transcription. Consistently, engineered tethering of ZC3H4 to reporter RNA promotes its degradation by the exosome. ZC3H4 is predominantly metazoan –interesting when considering its impact on enhancer RNAs that are less prominent in single-celled organisms. Finally, ZC3H4 loss causes a substantial reduction in cell proliferation, highlighting its overall importance. In summary, we identify ZC3H4 as playing an important role in restricting non-coding transcription in multicellular organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription termination</kwd><kwd>non-coding transcription</kwd><kwd>integrator</kwd><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT107791/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Estell</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Lee</given-names></name><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lister Institute of Preventative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URF\R1\180537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monier</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unbiased proteomics approach in human cells identifies ZC3H4 and shows that it is important for controlling the transcription of unstable RNA synthesized upstream of promoters and over enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most of the human genome can be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Among these transcripts are thousands of long non-coding RNAs, broadly classified as greater than ~200 nucleotides in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kopp and Mendell, 2018</xref>). They share some structural features with coding transcripts, but most of them are rapidly degraded by the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Preker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schlackow et al., 2017</xref>). Their degradation is coincident with or shortly after transcriptional termination, which often occurs within a few kilobases (kb). The mechanisms for terminating non-coding transcription are poorly understood, especially by comparison with those operating at protein-coding genes.</p><p>Termination of protein-coding transcription is coupled to 3’ end processing of pre-mRNA via cleavage at the polyadenylation signal (PAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eaton and West, 2020</xref>). A PAS consists of an AAUAAA hexamer followed by a U/GU-rich region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>). After assembly of a multi-protein processing complex, CPSF73 cleaves the nascent RNA and the Pol II-associated product is degraded 5’→3’ by XRN2 to promote termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fong et al., 2015</xref>). The Pol II elongation complex is modified as it crosses the PAS, which facilitates its termination by XRN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cortazar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2020</xref>). Depletion of XRN2 or CPSF73 causes read-through downstream of some long non-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2020</xref>). However, a substantial fraction of non-coding transcription is less sensitive to their depletion suggesting the use of alternative mechanisms.</p><p>The Integrator complex aids termination of many non-coding transcripts, with the archetypal example being snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baillat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Reilly et al., 2014</xref>). Integrator is also implicated in the termination of promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beckedorff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nojima et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanism is analogous to that at protein-coding genes, driven by endonucleolytic cleavage by INTS11. However, INTS11 activity does not precede XRN2 degradation at snRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, while CPSF73 is indispensable for termination at protein-coding genes, there is evidence of redundant pathways at snRNA loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, CPSF and the cap binding complex-associated factor, ARS2, are both implicated in the termination of promoter-proximal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iasillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nojima et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A variety of processes attenuate transcription at protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamieniarz-Gdula and Proudfoot, 2019</xref>). Frequently, this is via premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) that can be controlled by U1 snRNA, CDK12, SCAF4/8, or PCF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubbury et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregersen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamieniarz-Gdula et al., 2019</xref>). PCPA is common on many genes since acute depletion of the exosome stabilises its predicted products in otherwise unmodified cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). Integrator activity also attenuates transcription at hundreds of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A less-studied termination pathway at some intragenic non-coding regions is controlled by WDR82 and its associated factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austenaa et al., 2015</xref>). In mammals, WDR82 forms at least two complexes: one with the SETD1 histone methyl-transferase and another composed of protein-phosphatase 1 and its nuclear targeting subunit PNUTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Nuland et al., 2013</xref>). A version of the latter promotes transcriptional termination in trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kieft et al., 2020</xref>) and the budding yeast homologue of WDR82, Swd2, forms part of the APT (associated with Pta1) termination complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nedea et al., 2003</xref>). In murine cells, depletion of either WDR82, PNUTS, or SET1 causes non-coding transcriptional termination defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austenaa et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, PNUTS/PP1 is also implicated in the canonical termination pathway at protein-coding genes where its dephosphorylation of SPT5 causes deceleration of Pol II beyond the PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cortazar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we performed a proteomic screen for new termination factors by searching for proteins that bind to Pol II complexes in a manner that depends on PAS recognition by CPSF30. This uncovered ZC3H4, a metazoan zinc finger-containing factor without a characterised function in transcription. Because of the nature of our screen, we anticipated a role for ZC3H4 in 3’ end formation; however, its effects on this process are mild and apply to a small number of genes. Its main function is to restrict non-coding transcription, especially of PROMPT and eRNA transcripts, which can be extended by hundreds of kb when ZC3H4 is depleted. ZC3H4 interacts with WDR82, the depletion of which causes similar defects. Tethered function assays show that ZC3H4 recruitment is sufficient to restrict transcription and cause RNA degradation by the exosome. In sum, we reveal ZC3H4 as a hitherto unknown terminator of promoter-proximal transcription with particular relevance at non-coding loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The effect of CPSF30 depletion on the Pol II-proximal proteome</title><p>The first step of PAS recognition involves the binding of CPSF30 to the AAUAAA signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2018</xref>).

This occurs within minutes of biotin addition to culture media, which is advantageous for analysing dynamic proteins such as Pol II. We chose this approach rather than immunoprecipitation (IP) because it allows isolation of weak/transient interactions (potentially disrupted during conventional IP) and may identify relevant proximal proteins that do not interact with Pol II directly. Importantly, CPSF30-mAID depletion still induced strong read-through in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>CPSF30-mAID:RPB1-mTurbo</italic> cells were exposed to biotin before western blotting with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP). This revealed multiple bands with a prominent one corresponding in size to Rpb1-mTurbo and indicating the biotinylation of its proximal proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A small number of endogenously biotinylated factors were observed in the absence of biotin. Biotin-exposed samples were subject to tandem mass tagging (TMT) with mass spectrometry. We focused on proteins with reduced abundance after auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The factor most depleted was CPSF30, confirming that its auxin-dependent depletion is reflected in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As expected, Rpb1 was the most abundant factor in all samples consistent with its self-biotinylation seen by western blotting. After CPSF30, the most depleted factors were Fip1, CPSF100, and WDR33, which are in the CPSF complex. Otherwise, surprisingly few proteins showed reduced signal following auxin treatment. This implies that the major effect of CPSF30 depletion on the Pol II-proximal interactome is to prevent the recruitment/assembly of the CPSF complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ZC3H4 is a candidate transcription termination factor that is metazoan-enriched</title><p>Two poorly characterised factors, ZC3H4 and ZC3H6, were the next most depleted.

ZC3H4 is also co-regulated with mRNA processing factors suggesting a role in RNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kustatscher et al., 2019</xref>). Although little is reported on ZC3H4, two independent studies uncovered it as an interaction partner of WDR82 using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Nuland et al., 2013</xref>). WDR82 plays a key role in transcriptional termination in yeast, trypanosomes, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austenaa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kieft et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nedea et al., 2003</xref>). To verify this interaction, we tagged ZC3H4 with GFP and performed a ‘GFP trap’ whereby ZC3H4-GFP is captured from whole cell lysates using GFP nanobody-coupled beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). WDR82 robustly co-precipitated with ZC3H4-GFP, confirming them as interacting partners. Although WDR82 is conserved between human and budding yeast, our phylogenetic analysis suggested that ZC3H4 and ZC3H6 are largely restricted to metazoans and are paralogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ZC3H4 restricts non-coding transcription events</title><p>To assess any function of ZC3H4 and/or ZC3H6 in RNA biogenesis, we depleted either or both from HCT116 cells using RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), then deep sequenced nuclear transcripts. Comparison of these datasets shows that ZC3H4 loss has a more noticeable impact than ZC3H6 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Specifically, ZC3H6 depleted samples are more similar to control than those deriving from ZC3H4 loss and ZC3H4/ZC3H6 co-depletion resembles a knockdown of just ZC3H4. This was also evident from closer inspection of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), supporting the phylogenetic prediction of their separate functions. Accordingly, subsequent analyses focus on ZC3H4.</p><p>Due to its links with CPSF30 and WDR82, we anticipated that ZC3H4 might affect transcriptional termination. We first checked protein-coding genes and found a small number with longer read-through beyond the PAS when ZC3H4 is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, broader analysis suggests that this is not widespread and far fewer genes exhibit increased read-through following ZC3H4 loss compared to when CPSF30 is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Interestingly, the metagene in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> revealed slightly more signal antisense of promoters when ZC3H4 is depleted. This indicates an effect on non-coding RNA, which is interesting in light of a previously described function for WDR82 in restricting intragenic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austenaa et al., 2015</xref>). These PROMPT transcripts are normally rapidly degraded 3’→5’ by the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Preker et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows an example PROMPT, upstream of <italic>MYC</italic>, which is undetectable in control siRNA-treated cells, but abundant following ZC3H4 depletion. Loss of ZC3H4 also leads to the extension of this transcript by more than 100 kilobases. This is made clearer by comparing the loss of ZC3H4 to AID-mediated depletion of the catalytic exosome (DIS3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). DIS3 depletion stabilises the usual extent of PROMPT RNA, which is much shorter than when ZC3H4 is absent. Importantly, meta-analysis reveals similar effects at many other PROMPTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data strongly suggest that PROMPT transcripts are stabilised and extended in the absence of ZC3H4, presumably because its normal function restricts their transcription.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ZC3H4 depletion stabilises unproductive transcripts.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) track of the transcription read-through defect at <italic>PTPN11</italic> following CPSF30 or ZC3H4 depletion.

We therefore extended our search for potential ZC3H4 regulated transcription to enhancer regions since they also produce short RNAs that are degraded by the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2014</xref>). eRNAs can be found in isolation and in clusters called super-enhancers (SEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pott and Lieb, 2015</xref>). SEs are thought to be important for controlling key developmental genes with strong relevance to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>). ZC3H4 depletion has a clear effect over SE regions exemplified by the <italic>MYC</italic> SE where upregulation and extension of eRNAs is obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Acute depletion of DIS3 illustrates the normally restricted range of individual eRNAs within the cluster. This effect is general for other SEs as demonstrated by the metaplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. We also checked the effect of CPSF30 depletion on example PROMPT and SE transcription, which are very modest and consistent with the lack of antisense effect seen by metagene in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Consistently, PROMPTs susceptible to ZC3H4 were not enriched in PASs compared to those unaffected by it and harbour a slightly lower density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Overall, these data strongly suggest that ZC3H4 is important for regulating transcription across many PROMPTs and SEs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Comparison of ZC3H4 and Integrator effects</title><p>ZC3H4 has some functions in common with the Integrator complex.

Metagene analysis of this data at protein-coding genes shows a mild effect of Integrator depletion over PROMPT regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It also reveals an accumulation of promoter-proximal RNAs in the coding direction consistent with a recent report on its function as an attenuator of protein-coding transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lykke-Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). Because of this function, Integrator depletion can lead to increased expression of a subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lykke-Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>HAP1</italic> is an example of a gene where this is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, we saw evidence for increased mRNA expression on some genes when ZC3H4 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, these two genes are selectively effected by Integrator or ZC3H4, respectively, and additional examples of this are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>.

The western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> illustrates this by showing that TMP withdrawal depletes ZC3H4-DHFR, which re-appears following 4 hr TMP addition. To ask whether ZC3H4 effects are an immediate consequence of its loss and if they are reversed following its re-appearance, RNA was isolated from the three conditions shown in the western blot. This was analysed by quantitative reverse transcription and PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess the levels of extended PROMPT (<italic>HMGA2, ITPRID2</italic>) and SE (<italic>MSRB3, DLGAP1</italic>) RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). All were increased following ZC3H4 loss, suggesting that the effects that we observed by RNAi are not due to compensatory pathways. Although 4 hr TMP re-administration does not restore ZC3H4 to full levels, it was sufficient to reverse the effects of its depletion at all tested amplicons. The timescale over which the effect can be reversed suggests that transcripts induced by ZC3H4 loss remain relatively unstable. Rapid ZC3H4 depletion also confirmed the prediction, from our RNA-seq, that the extended PROMPT transcripts result from the aberrant transcription of these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Another key observation from our nuclear RNA-seq was the potential for ZC3H4 to restrict the levels of a subset of protein-coding transcripts. The long-term nature of RNAi and its detection via nuclear RNA-seq means that it could be an indirect or post-transcriptional effect, respectively. To test whether mRNA upregulation is an immediate and transcriptional response to ZC3H4 loss, we isolated chromatin-associated RNA from <italic>ZC3H4-DHFR</italic> cells grown with or without TMP for 4 hr. To additionally confirm their specificity to ZC3H4 (vs. Integrator), we also depleted the catalytic Integrator subunit utilising our previously engineered cell line in which INTS11 is tagged with a small molecule assisted shut-off module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>). qRT-PCR was used to detect three transcripts (NWD1, ENO3, and PJVK) that were upregulated by ZC3H4 loss but not Integrator depletion. Spliced versions of all three were increased after 4 hr of ZC3H4 depletion, but unaffected by loss of the catalytic Integrator subunit INTS11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The effectiveness of INTS11 depletion is illustrated by the substantial increase in U1 snRNA read-through RNA in its absence. This demonstrates that some mRNAs are immediately and selectively upregulated following ZC3H4 loss.</p><p>We next asked whether the ZC3H4 interactor, WDR82, impacts the levels of PROMPT and SE transcripts. Accordingly, <italic>ZC3H4-DHFR</italic> cells were treated with control or WDR82-specific siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We also co-depleted ZC3H4 and WDR82 by removing TMP from cells first transfected with WDR82 siRNAs. WDR82 depletion enhanced the level of all tested transcripts suggesting that it functionally overlaps with ZC3H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). There was no synergistic effect of their co-depletion, implying that WDR82 and ZC3H4 do not act redundantly at the tested loci. WDR82 is found in complexes containing protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and the SETD1A/B methyl transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Nuland et al., 2013</xref>). We found that the former but not the latter is implicated in the stability of the non-coding transcripts selected for this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ZC3H4 occupies a broad region at a subset of promoters</title><p>We have demonstrated that depletion of ZC3H4 causes widespread defects in non-coding transcription and supresses a subset of protein-coding RNAs. As these effects are seen following rapid ZC3H4 depletion, we hypothesised that they may be directly mediated by its recruitment to relevant loci. Consistently, its capture in our mTurbo experiment supports its proximity to chromatin, and the presence of CCCH zinc finger domains predicts nucleic acid binding capability. Therefore, its genomic occupancy was globally investigated by performing ZC3H4 chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) alongside that of Pol II.</p><p>ZC3H4 occupies genes with binding broadly resembling that of Pol II and showing the greatest enrichment over promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, many genes that are occupied by Pol II do not recruit ZC3H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This might result from low affinity of the ZC3H4 antibody or that its recruitment to chromatin is bridged since ZC3H4 also directly crosslinks to RNA in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The differential occupancy of genes by ZC3H4 is consistent with the selective effects of its depletion. Interestingly, ZC3H4 occupies a broader promoter region than Pol II, suggesting that its function is not restricted to the precise transcriptional start site. The width of this peak often corresponds to the normal extent of PROMPT and eRNA transcription, which is elongated in its absence. <italic>RPL13</italic> is shown as an example of recruitment of ZC3H4 upstream of the promoter, where its loss causes stabilisation and extension of the antisense transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). ZC3H4 is also strongly recruited to SEs consistent with the RNA effects observed on them following its loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This is exemplified by the <italic>MSRB3</italic> region and generalised by metaplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>.

One mentioned caveat is the low ChIP efficiency of the ZC3H4 antibody; however, a ZC3H4 ChIP-seq experiment was recently made available by the ENCODE consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Partridge et al., 2020</xref>). This used a flag-tagged construct and was performed in HEPG2 cells allowing a comparison of our data to that obtained with a high-affinity antibody and in different cells. Consistent with our findings, flag-ZC3H4 occupies a subset of Pol II-bound regions and shows broader distribution than Pol II around promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Although HEPG2 cells express fewer SEs than HCT116 cells, the transcribed <italic>DLGAP1</italic> example confirms its occupancy of these regions in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>MYC</italic> SE is only expressed in HCT116 cells and is not occupied by ZC3H4 in HEPG2 cells.

To test whether ZC3H4 recruitment can promote these effects, we established a tethered function assay. ZC3H4 was tagged with bacteriophage MS2 coat protein to engineer its recruitment to a reporter containing MS2 hairpin binding sites (MS2hp-IRES-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, RNA from this reporter is unaffected by endogenous ZC3H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

ZC3H4-MS2 expression does not affect the same reporter lacking MS2 hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The reporter experiments above are on total RNA so whether ZC3H4-MS2 exerted its effect at the gene (plasmid) or following its release was uncertain. Therefore, we purified chromatin-associated RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wuarin and Schibler, 1994</xref>). As mentioned previously, this fractionation enriches nascent endogenous RNAs. However, nascent RNAs associated with transfected plasmids also co-purify within this fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dye et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, cells were transfected with MS2hp-IRES-GFP and either ZC3H4-MS2 or MS2-GFP. We included an additional primer set to detect RNA uncleaved at the bovine growth hormone (BGH) poly(A) site. Because poly(A) site cleavage is co-transcriptional, this primer set should robustly detect Pol II-associated transcripts. This amplicon and that upstream of the MS2 hairpins were reduced in this chromatin fraction, strongly suggesting that tethered ZC3H4 acts on nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>The exosome degrades released PROMPT and eRNA transcripts, which could be enabled by ZC3H4. The results we present for endogenous loci are consistent with this since PROMPTs and eRNAs are upregulated and elongated when ZC3H4 is depleted. To test whether recruited ZC3H4 leads to exosome degradation of RNA, we transfected MS2hp-IRES-GFP, together with either MS2-GFP or ZC3H4-MS2, into <italic>DIS3-AID</italic> cells that were then treated or not with auxin to eliminate the catalytic exosome. RNA upstream and downstream of the MS2 hairpins was detected by qRT-PCR and their ratio plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Enhanced levels of upstream versus downstream amplicon were associated with transfection of ZC3H4-MS2 and is more prominent after depletion of DIS3. This is consistent with the hypothesis that recruited ZC3H4 promotes the release of RNA that is a DIS3 substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Results presented above show that ZC3H4 functions in transcriptional regulation and it may enable the release of RNA by promoting termination. ZC3H4 may also regulate the stability of its targets; however, to our knowledge, it has not been found to prominently co-purify with the exosome.</p><p>Finally, we were interested to determine the overall relevance of ZC3H4 to cell health/growth. This is made simpler by the <italic>ZC3H4-DHFR</italic> cell line, which allows permanent depletion of ZC3H4 by culturing cells without TMP. Accordingly, we performed colony formation assays on these cells grown in the presence or absence of TMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Loss of ZC3H4 was associated with smaller colonies, which demonstrates the importance of ZC3H4 for growth/proliferation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have discovered that ZC3H4 controls unproductive transcription, especially at non-coding loci. This conclusion is based on its recruitment to loci that give rise to transcripts that are stabilised and elongated when it is depleted. Moreover, tethering ZC3H4 to a heterologous reporter RNA is sufficient to promote degradation of the transcript by the exosome. We propose that ZC3H4 recruitment drives some of the early transcriptional termination that is characteristic of many non-coding RNAs, particularly PROMPT and eRNA transcripts. The function of ZC3H4 in restraining their transcription may at least partly explain why PROMPT and eRNA transcripts accumulate as short species when the exosome is depleted.</p><p>Our discovery of ZC3H4 adds to an increasing number of termination pathways. Most of these are more relevant during the initial stages of transcription, rather than the more intensively studied process that occurs at the end of protein-coding genes. This is evident from comparing the general requirement for CPSF30 at the 3’ end of protein-coding genes with the more selective impact of ZC3H4 that is focused more promoter-proximally. The effects of ZC3H4 depletion are reminiscent of recent findings on the Integrator complex, which also controls the early termination of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lykke-Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>). Our initial comparison of transcripts sensitive to either Integrator or ZC3H4 suggests that they can act on separate RNA targets. An exciting possibility is that multiple early termination pathways may contribute to conditional gene regulation. It will be important to establish whether ZC3H4 and/or Integrator are naturally utilised to regulate transcription in this manner. Their predominance in metazoans may enable gene regulation, for example across cell types or during development.</p><p>ZC3H4 has been proposed as an equivalent to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Suppressor of Sable (Su(s)), which negatively regulates transcription via promoter-proximal termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brewer-Jensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuan et al., 2004</xref>). ZC3H4 and Su(s) share little sequence homology, but they have similar structural makeup with zinc fingers flanked by largely disordered regions. Su(s) depletion stabilises selected RNAs and causes their aberrant elongation and stability, mirroring what we see globally following ZC3H4 depletion. There is no known catalytic activity for ZC3H4 or Su(s), but they are related to CPSF30 which shows endonuclease activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addepalli and Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai and Tolias, 1996</xref>). It remains to be seen whether ZC3H4 possesses any catalytic activity or mediates its effects through interaction partners. Interestingly, IP and mass spectrometry indicate that WDR82 may be the only interacting partner of Su(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brewer-Jensen et al., 2016</xref>). WDR82 has been shown to bind to Pol II phosphorylated on Serine 5 of its C-terminal domain, which may provide a means to recruit ZC3H4 to promoter-proximal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and Skalnik, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The recruitment of ZC3H4 to promoters is consistent with our observation that promoter-proximal transcription is most affected by its absence. Since depletion of ZC3H4 causes extended transcription of its targets, it is reasonable to suppose that it normally restricts their transcription in some fashion. This might be by controlling the escape of promoter-proximally paused polymerases or by acting closer to the 3’ end of its target transcripts. The fact that ZC3H4 acts somewhat selectively (e.g. not all PROMPTs and mRNAs are its targets) suggests that elements of specificity are required to explain its mechanism. Most obviously, this could be sequences within DNA or RNA, to which ZC3H4 (and Su(s)) binds via ChIP and XRNAX, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While our paper was under revision, another report identified ZC3H4 as affecting the transcription of intragenic loci in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austenaa et al., 2021</xref>). In agreement with our findings, non-coding transcripts were affected by ZC3H4 depletion. ZC3H4 was proposed to terminate some non-coding transcripts as a result of spurious/weak splicing. Similarly, Su(s) regulation of transcription was linked to the presence of a cryptic 5’ splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuan et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests involvement with U1 snRNA, which recognises this sequence. While U1 snRNA inhibition does cause some stabilisation of PROMPTs, it does not generally result in their longer extension and so other <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences and processes may additionally contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oh et al., 2017</xref>). Our evidence that ZC3H4 binds RNA in cells suggests that it may directly interact with some of its target transcripts and it will be important to delineate any sequence determinants.</p><p>Beyond transcriptional regulation, ZC3H4 occupancy of SEs is interesting. Other notable SE-associated factors (e.g. BRD4 and MED1) are much more generally implicated in Pol II transcription than ZC3H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, they are transcriptional activators whereas ZC3H4 appears to suppress transcription (or, at least, its RNA output). Many SE-bound factors are found to have phase separation properties explaining why large clusters of factors accumulate at these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 2018</xref>). While we do not know whether ZC3H4 can phase separate, it contains large regions of intrinsic disorder, which can promote this property (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In general, ZC3H4 may offer a new way to study enhancer clusters, particularly the importance of restricting transcription across these regions.</p><p>In conclusion, we have uncovered ZC3H4 as a factor with a function in restricting transcription. Its most notable effects are at non-coding loci where transcriptional termination mechanisms are less understood than at protein-coding genes. Further dissection of ZC3H4 and its targeting should reveal additional important insights into how the unstable portion of the transcriptome is controlled. The non-overlapping effects of Integrator and ZC3H4 at protein-coding genes indicate the possibility that multiple factors may control gene output via premature transcriptional termination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

For each experiment, bedtools was used to establish common peaks from individual reps (Intersect Intervals), creating a bed file of high confidence peaks. For ZC3H4, peaks called in the INPUT sample were subtracted via bedtools.

A log2 ratio of experiment vs. input was prepared using BamCompare of DeepTools – for RNAseq metaplots, BAM files were split by strand. A score file for the regions in the amended SE bed file was generated via the computematrix function of DeepTools using the log2 BamCompare output file.

Transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated for each gene and genes with an expression &lt;5 were filtered out to give a list of expressed genes. Next, divergent promoters, or genes with neighbours within 5 kb of their promoter, were excluded to minimise background. Finally, this gene list was converted to a bed file, then computematrix (DeepTools) used to generate a score file from log2 siCont Vs condition bigwigs; results were plotted in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Differential gene expression</title><p>FeatureCounts was used to count mapped reads over exons and differential expression was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Love et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>PROMPT poly-A site detection</title><p>For PROMPT analysis, we used a catalogue of 961 PROMPTs generated by de novo assembly following acute DIS3 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). Due to the variable length of each PROMPT, we searched for the two consensus poly-A site motifs (AWTAAA) across the full transcript sequence using FIMO (online). We then calculated the total occurrence of poly-A sites across each PROMPT transcript per kb and separated them into two groups: those that show upregulation (log2FC ≥ 1) in the absence of ZC3H4 and those with no change of downregulated expression.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor.

The authors first perform a screen aiming at the identification of factors involved in transcription termination, by identifying proteins in the vicinity of Pol II in a WT context compared to the rapid depletion of the Cpsf30 subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex. The poorly characterised paraloguous proteins ZC3H4 and ZC3H6 display reduced signal upon Cpsf30 depletion. These proteins are then depleted, demonstrating that ZC3H4 depletion gives rise to clear alterations in RNA expression profiles. Based on this, and additional bioinformatics analysis, the authors focus on the impact of ZC3H4 on RNA levels at protein coding genes, PROMPTs and enhancers. It is concluded that ZC3H4 acts as a terminator of transcription for the latter two categories of transcription units. The observed effects are then compared to those of the Integrator complex, that also acts as an early transcription terminator at such loci, which leads to the suggestion that these proteins act on different substrates. Moreover, it is determined that ZC3H4 binds chromatin at regions corresponding to the targeted RNAs. Finally, using a reporter system, the authors further show that ZC3H4 targeting to a transcript reduces its expression level.</p><p>The identification of a previously uncharacterized factor involved in transcription regulation is interesting. However, the reported results lack in-depth analysis. Most statements are quite general and would benefit from further analyses.</p><p>1. ZC3H4 binds to Pol II in a CPSF30-dependent manner. Moreover, ZC3H4 appears to share similar functions with the Integrator complex. Therefore, the relationship between ZC3H4 and CPSF30 on the one hand and ZC3H4 and Integrator on the other would benefit from further elucidation and exploration. For example:</p><p>i. Analyze the connection between ZC3H4 and pA sites e.g by measuring whether ZC3H4-sensitive transcripts are enriched for PASs.</p><p>ii. What's the exact number of protein-coding genes demonstrating increased downstream transcription upon depletion of ZC3H4, and how are these distinguished from non-sensitive genes? What is the overlap between CPSF30 and ZC3H4-dependent protein-coding genes?</p><p>iii. What are the genes included in the metagene analysis comparing the effects of CPSF30 and ZC3H4 in Figure 3B? Are genes that are read-through in the absence of either CPSF30 or ZC3H4 plotted in the Figure? Or is this a metaplot of the 1795 protein-coding genes demonstrating read-through upon CPSF30 depletion as in Figure 1C?</p><p>iv. Comparison of INTS1 and/or ZC3H4-dependent protein-coding genes (related to Figure 4G). Are there any characteristics (e.g. GO processes, gene length, PAS/intron density, expression levels, etc) of the genes upregulated upon depletion of INTS1 or ZC3H4 or both?</p><p>v. What is the overlap between the non-coding loci (PROMPTs and SEs) affected by depletion of INTS1 or ZC3H4?</p><p>vi. Because the performed screen is related to transcription termination and pA site RNA processing, the described effects of ZC3H4 are predicted to be at the level of transcription termination. However, the possibility that ZC3H4 acts on transcription or RNA stability is not addressed. The usage of the DIS3 depleted samples only serves the purpose of mapping exosome sensitive locations.</p><p>2. ZC3H4 versus ZC3H6: Providing a sequence alignment of ZC3H4 and ZC3H6 (or the statistics from such an alignment; %identity/similarity) would yield a better appreciation of the similarity between the two proteins. Overall, this whole panel would be more fitting as a supplementary figure.</p><p>3. Figure 4: The comparison of RNA-seq and chromatin-seq is not optimal. This is exemplified in panel E where the two controls display different profiles, leading to a strong effect of Ints1 depletion and no effect of ZC3H4 depletion.</p><p>4. Figure 5: While affirming the phenotype also upon rapid depletion of ZC3H4 represents an important control, these data do not bring any new information and should probably be considered supplementary.</p><p>5. Figure 6: Considering the weak affinity of the ZC3H4 antibody in ChIP, displaying an input track would help estimate the specificity of the signal. In the same vein: To ensure that the peaks presented in the IGV tracks are not background, one could normalize ChIP-seq data to input DNA and plot the tracks as the ratio of ChIP/Input.</p><p>6. Figure 7: While the tethering assay nicely demonstrates that recruitment of ZC3H4 negatively regulates the reporter RNA, additional explanation or experiment is warranted. In their discussion of chromatin-associated RNA, it is unclear how the reporter RNA is found in the chromatin fraction? Do the authors mean chromatin formed on the plasmid or the host chromatin? If the latter, how does the reporter associate with the chromatin? Is detection of uncleaved RNA at the BGH poly A site a faithful readout of nascent RNA? ZC3H4 also affects read-through. Can other methods be used to quantify nascent RNA? The tethering experiment should be performed on at least one endogenous target of ZC3H4 (that was upregulated upon its depletion). Does ZC3H4 over-expression rescue the effect of its depletion or is this not sufficient?</p><p>7. Clarification of Figures and Figure legends: Despite presenting interesting experiments, the figures require thorough revision to ensure clarity.</p><p>a.

Discussion: Several paragraphs in the discussion feel disconnected to the findings presented in the manuscript and how they tie in with the current knowledge regarding transcription termination (eg.

Below, you will find our detailed responses to each point raised. We would like to point out that while we were revising our paper, another group published some complementary findings (Austenaa et al., 2021 NSMB). They also identify ZC3H4 as a WDR82 interactor and find some defects in intragenic transcription. Our respective independent findings synergise and make a compelling case for the function of ZC3H4 in mammalian non-coding RNA transcription and metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. ZC3H4 binds to Pol II in a CPSF30-dependent manner. Moreover, ZC3H4 appears to share similar functions with the Integrator complex. Therefore, the relationship between ZC3H4 and CPSF30 on the one hand and ZC3H4 and Integrator on the other would benefit from further elucidation and exploration. For example:</p><p>i. Analyze the connection between ZC3H4 and pA sites e.g by measuring whether ZC3H4-sensitive transcripts are enriched for PASs.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we identified ZC3H4 via a screen involving CPSF30 depletion, we reported that it did not often affect transcription beyond pA sites of protein-coding genes. This suggests that its transcriptional functions are unlikely to universally require pA sites. As requested, we provide more analyses to support this claim that can be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 2F. We looked at this using PROMPTs since they are easily identified and many are sensitive to ZC3H4 depletion. We took a list of PROMPT transcripts that we previously annotated in HCT116 cells based on their acute sensitivity to exosome (DIS3) loss (Davidson et al., 2019). Of this 961, 438 are upregulated by 2-fold or more following ZC3H4 RNAi. When we compared the pA density in the affected vs unaffected set we found no link between pA density and susceptibility to ZC3H4. In fact, affected PROMPTs tended to have a slightly lower density of pA sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. What's the exact number of protein-coding genes demonstrating increased downstream transcription upon depletion of ZC3H4, and how are these distinguished from non-sensitive genes? What is the overlap between CPSF30 and ZC3H4-dependent protein-coding genes?</p></disp-quote><p>As we stated in the original manuscript, only a small number of protein-coding genes are affected by ZC3H4 compared to CPSF30 loss. As requested, we now present a bioinformatics analysis (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-C). To approximate read-through, we looked at a region 1kb downstream of the poly(A) signal and compared the read density to a region 500bp upstream. This was to maximise the number of genes in the dataset. From over 7000 genes, most show some read-through in the absence of CPSF30 and 4343 have a 2-fold or more increase. By contrast, only 583 have over a 2-fold increase upon ZC3H4 depletion. The majority overlap with those affected by CPSF30 (369/583). In general, the effects of ZC3H4 beyond pA sites are also smaller than for CPSF30. This is illustrated by the fact that the proportion of genes with larger fold effects Log2FC&gt;2 is even lower than those with Log2FC&gt;1 (67 vs 1907 and 583 vs 4343, respectively). Manual inspection of ZC3H4 effects also reveals some read-through examples as having low read coverage beyond the pA site, which may lead to the inclusion of some false positives. However, our analysis provides valuable unbiased support for the generality of CPSF30 effects versus those associated with ZC3H4 loss.</p><p>We looked at characteristics of protein-coding genes that show evidence of read-through after ZC3H4 loss. There was no clear effect of length or intron density and only a slight tendency for affected genes to be expressed at lower levels. We have not included these analyses but can do so if necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. What are the genes included in the metagene analysis comparing the effects of CPSF30 and ZC3H4 in Figure 3B? Are genes that are read-through in the absence of either CPSF30 or ZC3H4 plotted in the Figure? Or is this a metaplot of the 1795 protein-coding genes demonstrating read-through upon CPSF30 depletion as in Figure 1C?</p></disp-quote><p>Genes for these metaplots were not selected based on their sensitivity to ZC3H4 or CPSF30 and were intended to provide unbiased analysis. We selected expressed genes separated from any annotated neighbour by 3kb upstream and 5kb downstream to eliminate closely spaced/overlapping transcription units. The conclusion drawn from them (large/general effect of CPSF30 and small/more selective effect of ZC3H4) is supported by the broader analysis provided in response to the above point (ii) and our extensive manual inspection of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv. Comparison of INTS1 and/or ZC3H4-dependent protein-coding genes (related to Figure 4G). Are there any characteristics (e.g. GO processes, gene length, PAS/intron density, expression levels, etc) of the genes upregulated upon depletion of INTS1 or ZC3H4 or both?</p></disp-quote><p>We looked for enriched GO processes but found nothing striking/obvious in terms of over-represented functions that could link the effects of either factor to large sets of genes with a common function. We can provide tables for this if necessary. Of the other facets, we found that genes affected by INTS1 and ZC3H4 have lower steady-state expression under normal circumstances than those that are unaffected. This is interesting and supports the notion that there are mechanisms (i.e. Integrator and ZC3H4) that restrict their expression. This new data is in Figure 3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v. What is the overlap between the non-coding loci (PROMPTs and SEs) affected by depletion of INTS1 or ZC3H4?</p></disp-quote><p>The requested analyses are now provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D. We used our annotated list of 961 PROMPTs, described above for point i), and found that 438 show 2-fold or more upregulation in the absence of ZC3H4 while fewer (222) have this effect without INTS1. 153 of these 222 overlap with those affected by ZC3H4. We had noted in the original manuscript that ZC3H4 effects at PROMPTs were typically greater in magnitude than those associated with INTS1 RNAi. Our new bioinformatics analyses support this. For example, we find that only 26 PROMPTs have a change of 4-fold or more in the absence of INTS1, whereas the figure is 154 for those affected by ZC3H4 depletion. For SEs the effects of INTS1 are much less robust than those of ZC3H4 as can be seen by comparing the metaplots in Figures 2F and 3H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi. Because the performed screen is related to transcription termination and pA site RNA processing, the described effects of ZC3H4 are predicted to be at the level of transcription termination. However, the possibility that ZC3H4 acts on transcription or RNA stability is not addressed. The usage of the DIS3 depleted samples only serves the purpose of mapping exosome sensitive locations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ZC3H4 effects are predicted to be at the level of transcription (termination). In our view, this is indicated by the long extensions to non-coding RNA caused by its loss. The most credible reason for such distal RNA signal is aberrant transcription caused by ZC3H4 depletion. We say this for two main reasons. First, there is normally no Pol II over these regions indicating that they are not transcribed in unmodified cells. Second, there is no DIS3 effect at these extended regions (only promoter-proximally) arguing against the presence of low level unstable RNA at these positions. To confirm this, we performed Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in the presence and absence of ZC3H4 and analysed two loci affected by its loss in our RNA-seq (<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>ITPRID2</italic> PROMPT regions). This new experiment (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A) shows increased Pol II occupancy upstream of both PROMPTs following rapid (4 hours) depletion of ZC3H4 and provides important additional support for a transcriptional effect. In addition, we looked at extended transcripts from both PROMPTs via the isolation of chromatin-associated RNA which is enriched in nascent transcripts. This confirmed the ChIP result by demonstrating substantially more (~30 fold) extended RNA following the rapid loss of ZC3H4 (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). It is important to note that ZC3H4 may additionally play roles in RNA stability alongside or as part of its function in controlling non-coding transcription. However, to our knowledge, it has never been recovered as an interactor of the exosome complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. ZC3H4 versus ZC3H6: Providing a sequence alignment of ZC3H4 and ZC3H6 (or the statistics from such an alignment; %identity/similarity) would yield a better appreciation of the similarity between the two proteins. Overall, this whole panel would be more fitting as a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided the requested alignment and moved the updated figure concerning phylogenetic analyses to the supplement (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4: The comparison of RNA-seq and chromatin-seq is not optimal. This is exemplified in panel E where the two controls display different profiles, leading to a strong effect of Ints1 depletion and no effect of ZC3H4 depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>A reason for the two controls looking different is because chromatin-associated RNA (INTS1) is enriched in nascent transcripts whereas the nuclear RNA (ZC3H4) will contain an accumulation of completed mRNA transcripts – hence the higher control level of TM7SF2 versus in the chromatin. We would like to note that not all comparisons look like TM7SF2 with respect to the control profiles. Many examples are not like this because ZC3H4 and Integrator often act on genes that normally show low expression (as we discovered when addressing point 1 iv) above). To better illustrate this, we have provided more IGV snapshots in addition to retaining the TM7SF2 example (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). We have also provided new data in the revision to further demonstrate that ZC3H4 and Integrator depletion affect different mRNAs and that the ZC3H4 effect is rapid and at chromatin.</p><p>To demonstrate that the limited overlap of ZC3H4 and Integrator targets is not due to our comparison of two slightly different sequencing methodologies, we compared recently published datasets that used 4sU to sequence nascent RNA in HeLa cells depleted of the catalytic Integrator subunit (Lykke-Andersen et al., 2020) or ZC3H4 (Austenaa et al., 2021). Similar to our data this revealed several hundred protein-coding transcripts upregulated by either depletion with very little overlap (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). This orthologous and independent approach, performed in a different cell line, provides strong support for the idea that ZC3H4 and Integrator affect different subsets of mRNAs.</p><p>To test the rapidity, and confirm the selectivity, of the ZC3H4 effect in our system, we performed qRT-PCR on chromatin-associated RNA after depletion of ZC3H4-DHFR. We selected three transcripts (NWD1, ENO3 and PJVK) that are affected by ZC3H4 via our nuclear RNA-seq. All three are enhanced in the chromatin-associated fraction after just 4 hours of ZC3H4 depletion (see Figure 4E). The same three transcripts were unaffected by Integrator according to our chromatin-associated RNA-seq – a result that we confirmed by qRT-PCR of chromatin-associated RNA isolated from cells depleted of the catalytic Integrator subunit, INTS11. This experiment demonstrates that at least some transcripts are rapidly and specifically (versus Integrator) upregulated by ZC3H4 loss.</p><p>In all, we feel that these new analyses and experiments more convincingly highlight some separate transcriptional functions of ZC3H4 and Integrator at different mRNA subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5: While affirming the phenotype also upon rapid depletion of ZC3H4 represents an important control, these data do not bring any new information and should probably be considered supplementary.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with this assessment in the context of the original manuscript. However, as part of the revision process we have made more use of the ZC3H4-DHFR cells to address some of the important points raised by the reviewers. E.g. to show that ZC3H4 acts quickly on transcription of mRNA targets and, importantly, that the effects of its depletion are rapidly reversed when its levels are allowed to recover. We have incorporated some of these new data into an expanded version of Figure 5 (now Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 6: Considering the weak affinity of the ZC3H4 antibody in ChIP, displaying an input track would help estimate the specificity of the signal. In the same vein: To ensure that the peaks presented in the IGV tracks are not background, one could normalize ChIP-seq data to input DNA and plot the tracks as the ratio of ChIP/Input.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have included an input track for these experiments. This makes clear that the presented peaks are not background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 7: While the tethering assay nicely demonstrates that recruitment of ZC3H4 negatively regulates the reporter RNA, additional explanation or experiment is warranted.

As mentioned, chromatin-associated RNA is enriched in nascent transcripts. Importantly, previous reports (e.g. Dye et al., Mol Cell 2006) demonstrated that this method also effectively enriches nascent RNAs transcribed from plasmids. This likely reflects the co-sedimentation of transcribed plasmids with chromatin during this isolation procedure and shows that this method is effective in enriching nascent RNA from exogenous DNA plasmids. Our analysis of RNAs uncleaved at the BGH poly(A) was designed to support this. Because poly(A) site cleavage is co-transcriptional, these transcripts are very likely nascent.</p><p>The reviewers also put forward the reasonable opinion that ZC3H4 affects read-through at some protein-coding genes and may therefore influence the BGH pA site to account for some of the tethering effect. We have considered this carefully and are confident that this is not a confounding issue for the following reasons. In response to 1 ii), we show that ZC3H4 rarely affects read-through at pA sites and we have provided (see below) a new experiment that its depletion does not affect the BGH pA site in this reporter. One might posit a scenario in which tethering ZC3H4 to the reporter improves BGH pA processing, thereby accounting for the lower levels of this uncleaved species when ZC3H4-MS2 is used. However, this hypothetical is not supported by our evidence. Such enhanced pA processing would almost certainly result in more reporter mRNA whereas what we observe is much less (i.e. tethered ZC3H4 reduces the recovery of gene body amplicons). Finally, our exosome depletion experiment in this tethering system argues for an effect exerted at, or close to, its site of recruitment (i.e. the MS2 hairpins) and not at the downstream BGH pA. We say this because exosome depletion has a greater effect on the stability of RNA upstream of the MS2 hairpins rather than in the vicinity of the BGH pA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The tethering experiment should be performed on at least one endogenous target of ZC3H4 (that was upregulated upon its depletion).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity here and have provided some more explanation in the revision as requested.

This is advantageous to over-expression because re-expression of ZC3H4-DHFR is achieved more quickly than typically required for protein over-expression by transfection. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by a new Western blot in Figure 4C. This re-expression is sufficient to rescue the level of every ZC3H4 target that we tested (see Figure 4D). By supporting our other depletions, the MS2 tethering result and the ChIP showing ZC3H4 occupancy of affected loci, this result provides additional evidence that ZC3H4 is responsible for the effects that we observe in its absence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Discussion: Several paragraphs in the discussion feel disconnected to the findings presented in the manuscript and how they tie in with the current knowledge regarding transcription termination (eg.
