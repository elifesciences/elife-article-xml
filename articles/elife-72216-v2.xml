mutations that cause disease. In its most precise form, genome editing can use cellular homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways to insert information from an exogenously supplied DNA-repair template (donor) directly into a targeted genomic location. Unfortunately, particularly for long insertions, toxicity and delivery considerations associated with repair template DNA can limit HDR efficacy. Here, we explore chemical modifications to both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA-repair templates. We describe 5′-terminal modifications, including in its simplest form the incorporation of triethylene glycol (TEG) moieties, that consistently increase the frequency of precision editing in the germlines of three animal models (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, zebrafish, mice) and in cultured human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>HDR</kwd><kwd>modified donors</kwd><kwd>chemical modifications</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Craig C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006955</institution-id><institution>Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 GM058800-23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Craig C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007920</institution-id><institution>University of Massachusetts Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sontheimer</surname><given-names>Erik J</given-names></name><name><surname>Watts</surname><given-names>Jonathan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UG3 TR002668</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sontheimer</surname><given-names>Erik J</given-names></name><name><surname>Watts</surname><given-names>Jonathan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 HL140017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawson</surname><given-names>Nathan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 OD030004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawson</surname><given-names>Nathan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chemically modifying the 5´ends of donor DNA improves the efficiency of homology-directed repair and suppresses end-joining reactions, which will facilitate precise gene editing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precision genome editing by homology-directed repair (HDR) often requires cells to use exogenously supplied DNA templates (donors) to repair targeted double-strand breaks (DSBs). Maximizing precision genome editing, therefore, requires understanding how cells respond both to DSBs and to exogenous donors. These responses can be influenced by many variables, including cell-intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, cell type, and cell cycle stage) and cell-extrinsic factors (e.g., donor length, strandedness, and chemistry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wienert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nambiar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renaud et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rees et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jayathilaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pinder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riesenberg and Maricic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canny et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robert et al., 2015</xref>). Each of these variables can influence the relative efficiency of HDR compared to competing DSB repair pathways, such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank-Vaillant and Marcand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maruyama et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In many organisms and cell types, high HDR efficiencies are readily achieved using short single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor templates that permit single base changes or short insertions or deletions. However, HDR is frequently less efficient when longer double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates are used as donors. It is not known why longer DNA donors yield lower rates of HDR. In many cell types, high concentrations of dsDNA cause cytotoxicity, limiting the number of long donor molecules that can be safely delivered into cells. In addition, due to their size, long donor molecules may not transit the nuclear envelope as efficiently, reducing the effective concentration at the site of repair, or requiring cell division to gain access to the target locus. Moreover, end-joining ligation reactions assemble linear dsDNA molecules into concatemers in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Perucho et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Folger et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mello et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stuart et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lacy et al., 1983</xref>), further limiting the number of individual donor molecules and their ability to diffuse to their DSB target sites.</p><p>In an effort to improve nuclear delivery and HDR efficacy, we incorporated 5′-modifications into the donor molecules, including a simple triethylene glycol (TEG) moiety, a 2′<italic>-O</italic>-methyl (2′OMe) RNA::TEG modification, and a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) comprising the SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brandén et al., 1999</xref>). These 5′-modified donors increased the efficiency of templated repair by 2- to 5-fold in cultured mammalian cells as well as germline editing of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). The modified donors exhibited a striking reduction in DNA ligation reactions including reduced self-ligation into concatemers and reduced sequence-independent ligation into cellular DSBs, suggesting that the 5′-modifications reduce the availability of 5′-ends for competing NHEJ reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>End-modified DNA donors increase the efficiencies of HDR in mammalian cells</title><p>To examine the effects of donor end modifications on HDR in cultured mammalian cells, we took advantage of a modified traffic light reporter (TLR) comprising a ‘broken’ GFP coding region followed by a frameshifted mCherry coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Certo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iyer, 2019</xref>). Cas9 targets the ‘broken’ GFP, which can only be made functional if precisely repaired by HDR, resulting in green fluorescence. If Cas9-mediated DSBs are imprecisely repaired by NHEJ, approximately one-third of the imprecise repair events will restore the reading frame of mCherry, resulting in red fluorescence. Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression vectors and dsDNA donors with or without 5′-modifications were electroporated into HEK293T TLR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), followed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of cells expressing either GFP or mCherry.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>5′-End-modified donors promote homology-directed repair (HDR) in traffic light reporter (TLR) cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the TLR assay to quantify HDR efficiencies using unmodified or end-modified double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donors.

Annealing these PNA oligos was well tolerated and did not diminish HDR, however neither did they enhance HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).

Precise editing converts a functional GFP sequence to BFP sequence, producing cells that are GFP(-) and BFP(+).

The V5 tag was precisely inserted into the <italic>Sox2</italic> locus in only 5.7% (n = 35) of F0 animals from the injection with unmodified donor.

We reasoned that 5′-modifications to the donor might suppress the formation of concatemers, thereby making linear donors more available for HDR. To test this idea, we nucleofected 566 bp dsDNA donors into HEK293T cells, harvested cells over a course of 3 days, and assessed the formation of concatemers by Southern blot analysis. We found that the unmodified dsDNA formed concatemers within 1 hr after nucleofection. These concatemers were composed of two to several copies of the DNA, inferred from the presence of a ladder of bands on the Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Concatemers of up to 10 copies were present within 3 hr after nucleofection and peaked in abundance by 12 hr. Concatemer levels declined over the next 12 hr but persisted at low levels until at least 72 hr after nucleofection. By contrast, the TEG-modified DNA showed a marked delay in the formation and levels of multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). Dimers and trimers gradually formed over the first 12–24 hr but were present at much lower levels than those formed by unmodified DNA. At late time points—24, 48, and 72 hr after transfection—we observed a greater fraction of TEG-modified DNA monomers than unmodified monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

In mammalian cells<italic>,</italic> donors containing simple modifications such as TEG or 2′OMe-RNA::TEG on their 5′-ends improved HDR efficacy. These modifications increased the potency of ssDNA and dsDNA (long and short) donors, allowing efficient editing at significantly lower amounts. Modifying the ends of the donors suppressed concatemer formation and reduced random integration of short dsDNA at chromosomal DSBs.</p><p>End modifications affected long and short donors differently in mammalian cells. On long donors end modification caused a ~2- to 5-fold increase in HDR frequency (total efficacy) compared to unmodified donors and did so without changing the donor concentration where efficacy reached its plateau. In contrast, on short donors end modifications did not increase the maximal efficacy of HDR, but instead dramatically reduced the amount of donor required to reach that maximal level. Put another way, long DNA donors exhibited both increased potency and maximal efficacy when modified, while short ssODN and dsDNA donors exhibited increased potency but no increase in maximal efficacy. This difference requires further study but could be explained if shorter donors and longer DNA donors experience different dose-limiting barriers. For example, the dose-limiting toxicity of ssODNs could be driven by total number of free DNA ends per cell, while longer molecules could encounter dose-limiting toxicity driven by total DNA mass. Consistent with this idea, unmodified long dsDNA donors begin to plateau in efficacy at nearly 4-fold more mass, but ~10-fold lower molar amounts than ssODNs. When end-modified, both types of donor exhibit similar maximal efficacy in the 1–2 pmol range.</p><p>RNA::TEG-modified donors significantly increased the levels of precision editing in three different model organisms (<italic>C. elegans</italic>, zebrafish, and mice). In all three animals, high HDR efficiencies were achieved using end-modified dsDNA donors, which in some cases approached efficiencies previously observed for ssODN donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dokshin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, precise insertions were obtained with relatively short homology arms. For example, in mouse zygote injections, we used donors with homology arms of less than 90 bp, similar to typical arm lengths used for ssODN donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quadros et al., 2017</xref>) and at relatively low concentrations (1 ng/µl).</p><p>How do end modifications help increase the efficacy of the donors? Our findings suggest that they do so, in part, by suppressing non-homologous end-joining reactions. In several systems dsDNA donors have been shown to quickly form extrachromosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Perucho et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Folger et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mello et al., 1991</xref>) and may do so directly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forbes et al., 1983</xref>). For example, DNA delivered into the cytoplasm of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonadal syncytium gains entry into oocytes over a 24 hr period in a manner more consistent with cytoplasmic flow than with direct nuclear uptake by germ nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghanta and Mello, 2020</xref>), and transformants established in this way have been shown to contain concatenated arrays of injected DNA, several hundred kilobases in length, which then partition to progeny in a non-Mendelian fashion as extrachromosomal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mello et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stinchcomb et al., 1985</xref>). Integration of similar extrachromosomal arrays into the host genome have been reported in zebrafish and mouse zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stuart et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lacy et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costantini and Lacy, 1981</xref>). Thus, the suppression of donor concatemer formation by 5′-modified donors could increase the effective molar amounts of donor available for precise repair of the target DSB. Similarly, once in the nucleus, the suppression of direct ligation to chromosomal DNA through end-joining reactions could further increase precision repair. Perhaps consistent with suppression of concatenation as a major mechanism of action, it is intriguing that modification of a single end was nearly as effective as modifications to both ends of the donor. In principle, a single end modification would limit concatenation to dimer formation. Similarly, modification of a single end could prevent donors from ligating into circles which might then concatenate further through HDR.</p><p>In addition to increasing the amount of available donor molecules, another possible benefit of suppressing end-joining reactions is that the free ends of the donor might then be available to participate in the HDR mechanism (e.g., by assembling elements of the DSB repair machinery directly on the free 3′-end of the donor). We found that a free unmodified 3′-end was required for efficient HDR. Thus, by suppressing ligation, the 5′-modification in effect maintains available 3′-ends, perhaps to prime repair synthesis.</p><p>In previous studies, fluorescent and amine modifications to the 5′- and 3′-termini of ssODN donors did not improve HDR efficacy over unmodified donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, PS linkages were shown to improve HDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renaud et al., 2016</xref>). However, these studies were performed using much higher concentrations than the optimal concentrations for modified donors determined here. In our study, ssODNs with PS linkages did not improve HDR at doses where RNA::TEG- and TEG-modified donors were most efficacious. While our study was in preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghanta, 2018</xref>), three studies explored donors with 5′-end modifications. One study showed that the addition of biotin improved HDR and favored single copy insertion in the rice fish medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>). The biotin moiety was attached to the donor via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker, but the study did not explore donors with PEG alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2020</xref>, showed that PEG10 with a 6-carbon linker boosted precise GFP insertions in vertebrate cells similar to those reported here for TEG- and RNA::TEG-modified donors, and at similar concentrations to those we employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). The third study describes the suppression of NHEJ-mediated insertions using donors with 5′-biotin::PEG or 5′-ssDNA::PEG moieties in non-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Canaj, 2019</xref>). Our studies are in agreement with these findings and extend them to additional modifications and to in vivo genome-editing applications in three animal systems.</p><p>Explorations of how modifications to the donor, both chemical and physical in nature, might alter HDR efficacy are far from complete. For example, a physical pre-treatment to the donor that enhanced HDR was discovered serendipitously when attempting to anneal oligonucleotides to the ends of a PCR donor. The act of simply melting and cooling long dsDNA PCR donors (~1 kb in length) improved HDR efficacy in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghanta and Mello, 2020</xref>). Preliminary findings suggest that melting an 800 bp donor did not improve HDR efficiency in human cells (data not shown) but further studies are required to more rigorously test the impact of melting donors of greater length, and directed at more target sites, and of course to explore other physical perturbations.</p><p>The chemistry space for donor modification is also vast and remains largely unexplored. We do not know why donors modified with TEG and RNA::TEG performed similarly in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while RNA::TEG was consistently superior to TEG alone in zebrafish and human cells. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> system is unique in that it targets meiotic pachytene nuclei. Perhaps TEG alone is sufficient to stabilize donor molecules for HDR in meiotic cells that are actively engaged in DNA recombination, while increased stability is required to enable donors to persist longer and thus to engage a much less active HDR repair machinery in mitotic cells. The RNA::TEG modification might therefore facilitate editing in mitotic cells by providing this measure of improved protection from nuclease activity compared to TEG alone. PS linkages are known to protect against nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renaud et al., 2016</xref>), and it will therefore be interesting to explore whether a combination of internal (e.g., PS linkages) and terminal (e.g., 5′-RNA::TEG or 5′-TEG) modifications can further increase HDR efficacy. Indeed, our results should incite the search for additional chemistries that could boost donor stability while still allowing the donor to serve as a template for repair polymerases; some such studies are underway in our laboratories. Future studies will also need to explore whether the incorporation of donor chemistries will synergize with other methods that stimulate HDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wienert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maruyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutschner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ling et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Synthesis of PNA-NLS peptide</title><p>PNA oligomers were synthesized at 2 µmol scale on Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS solid support (Applied Biosystems) using an Expedite 8909 synthesizer.

Using alkaline transfer buffer, DNA was then transferred for 3 hr with upward capillary action onto positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Hybond N+, RPN303B). After transfer, membrane was soaked in 5×SSC for 10 min and UV crosslinked. Blots were then processed using DIG Wash and Block buffer set (Sigma Aldrich #11585762001) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, membrane was blocked in 1× blocking solution with maleic acid for 30 min, incubated with 1:20,000 Anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments (Sigma Aldrich #11093274910) in 1× blocking solution for 1 hr, washed twice with 1× wash buffer, incubated in 1× detection buffer and developed using CDP-star (Sigma Aldrich #12041677001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> microinjection and HDR screening</title><p>Microinjections were performed using Cas9 RNPs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghanta and Mello, 2020</xref>). dsDNA donors were generated by PCR; 25 ng/µl of unmodified or end-modified dsDNA donors were used in each injection mixture.

The authors convincingly demonstrate that 5' TEG modifications dramatically boost knock-in efficiency, prevent concatemer formation, and reduce imprecise editing. In the case of short donors, end modification did not affect the maximal level of repair, but reduced the amount of donor required to reach that maximal level. In zebrafish and human cells an additional methylated RNA modification (2'OMe-RNA::TEG) at the 5' end of the donor resulted in improved editing efficiency compared to TEG alone, whereas in <italic>C. elegans</italic> these two modifications performed equivalently. The authors also demonstrate that a free 3'OH in donors is necessary for efficient genome editing, providing insight into the repair mechanism. The key conclusions are rigorously tested and are convincing. The data and the methods are presented clearly, which will facilitate reproducibility and the experimental replicates and statistics were appropriate.</p><p>I have two major suggestions that would further improve this work and help the wider community adopt it:</p><p>1. One major limitation to this study is that the TEG and 2'OMe-RNA::TEG oligonucleotides are produced in house with an ABI 394 synthesizer followed by chemical coupling. While these methods may be routine for some labs, a large number of labs will be unable to generate these reagents which will limit the impact of this study. Indeed, these modifications were originally described in a 2018 pre-print and have not yet been widely adopted by the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community. I suggest that the authors repeat a few critical experiments using dsDNA donors generated with commercially produced oligos. Good candidates for such an experiment would be the Traffic Light edit from Figure 1 and csr-1 edit from Figure 4. This information could be included as a supplemental figure and should compare the performance of more widely available commercially produced, TEG and 2'OMe-RNA::TEG oligos with their in house made oligos. Information should be provided in the methods about how the oligos were ordered (scale, purity, etc.). This experiment would lower the bar and provide a benchmark for many labs to try using these modifications in their genome editing donors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions to guide the community towards commercial sources of modified donors. Indeed, most of the experiments using TEG modifications were performed with commercially sourced oligos. All the TEG donors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments were purchased from IDT. However, all the 2′OMe-RNA:TEG modified oligos were synthesized in-house to reduce the cost burden while testing numerous different modifications at many loci. Researchers who do not have the capabilities to synthesize oligos in-house can purchase 2′OMe-RNA:TEG modified oligos from IDT. We apologize for not making this clear in the text. We have now added the details of the source, scale and purity of the commercial oligos to the supplemental methods sections.</p><p>Line 24-25: of supplemental methods “PEGylated oligos can also be purchased from commercial sources such as Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) at 100nmol scale with simple desalting.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. One major difference between the <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments and the experiments in other systems was that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> work used the heating-cooling treatment of templates that the authors recently described (Ghanta et al., 2020). As far as I can tell this heating-cooling was not done for the other organisms/cells. Have the authors tried this heating/cooling in other cells/organisms? It would be worth discussing. If not, it would be valuable to try this method with the Traffic Light edit. I don't view this experiment as essential, though it would be valuable for the community.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have added text to the Discussion section to address this concern.</p><p>Line 343 “Explorations of how modifications to the donor, both chemical and physical in nature, might alter HDR efficacy are far from complete. […] Preliminary findings suggest that melting an 800bp donor did not improve HDR efficiency in human cells (data not shown) but further studies are required to more rigorously test the impact of melting donors of greater length, and directed at more target sites, and of course to explore other physical perturbations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The described donor modifications improve editing efficiency and accuracy which will significantly advance genome editing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, zebrafish, mice, and human cell lines. This work builds on a 2018 pre-print from the authors and also complements and sheds light on some recent papers demonstrating that 5' biotin or ssDNA modifications boost editing efficiency (Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018; Canaj et al., 2019). Notably these modifications also included TEG modifications, which could account for the boost in editing efficiency. This work will be of interest to any lab attempting to perform knock-ins with genome editing.</p><p>Referee Cross-commenting</p><p>I think that Reviewer 3's major comment is a good point and that testing the performance of the end-modified repair templates in primary cells would add a lot of value to this work.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to reviewer 3’s comment below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):Non-viral whole-gene knock-in remains a challenge for CRISPR in many important cell types. Furthermore, the manufacture of bespoke donors at scale and of consistent quality further complicates things, and may contribute to difficulties with reproducibility that seem to be an issue in this sub-field.</p><p>Here, authors utilize PCR to generate end-modified dsDNA donors that can drive efficient knock-in to immortalized cell lines and worm embryos delivered via co-electroporation with CRISPR reagents. A few corresponding studies of ssDNA donors (ssODNs) are also presented, with similar results.</p><p>The experiments are well-controlled and well-conceived, particularly the use of dose-response to establish donor potency. The paper is clear and well-written. The methods are clear and appear to be readily reproduced. By targeting multiple loci and multiple cell types they provide good evidence for the robustness of the method. The results are excellent and compare favorably to other papers in a similar vein (i.e. those cited in the Discussion). In particular, they report &gt;50% knock-in using dsDNA donors at concentrations ~30-fold less than used for short ssODNs (~0.12 µM vs. ~3 µM) which would be a significant advance in this area.</p><p>The intended audience of this work are CRISPR engineers of all sorts who could use this technique to generate model cell lines, or edited model organisms. Those in cell therapy, immunology, or stem cell biology should also be interested, but data is lacking in those cell types (see below).</p><p>Comment – Major</p><p>The principal weakness of the work is over-reliance on immortalized cell lines (when electroporating), which tend to be more resilient to transfection of HDR donors than the primary (somatic) cells used for cell therapy. For example, it would be nice to know whether the increased potency of the end-modified donors also leads to declines in viability after electroporation (if the stabilized donor is more persistent), but this trade-off may only become apparent if more sensitive cells are used. This could be a limited set of in vitro experiments targeted to an endogenous locus as in Figure 2B/C/D.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to test end-modified donors in non-immortalized cells. We would argue that our abundant successes in vivo in multiple model organisms address the concern about limited benefits beyond transformed cells, and we are aware of no reason why primary cells in vitro should differ. As we note in line 340, Results from Canaj., et al. 2019 in non-transformed (iPSC) cells support our conclusions. We are indeed very interested in applying our system to primary human T cells, and our work in this area is already underway. However, this T cell work will require many distinct sets of tests and analyses, and we are therefore deferring that work to a separate manuscript in the future.</p><p>Line 339: “The third study describes the suppression of NHEJ-mediated insertions using donors with 5′-Biotin::PEG or 5′-ssDNA::PEG moieties in non-transformed cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments – Minor</p><p>– Figure 1 and elsewhere: Suggesting using &quot;µM&quot; of donor in the cuvette instead of &quot;pmol&quot; so results can be ported to other systems with different volumes (Lonza, MaxCyte, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion this may have caused.

Use of PNA-RNA annealing is a good clean test of this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Indeed, our experiments were performed by annealing PNA to RNA tails. We have modified the figure legend to convey this message and avoid any confusion.</p><p>“PNA::NLS and 2′OMe::TEG modified donors were mixed at 4:1 molar ratio, heated to 94°C and cooled to anneal PNA to 2′OMe-RNA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2: Baseline (unmod) donor HDR rates vary from locus to locus, as does the enhancement with the 5' mods. Interesting! Can authors comment further on why rates may vary from one site to another?

We added the following text to the Results section to address this comment.</p><p>Line 142-145: “HDR efficiencies obtained with unmodified donors vary from locus to locus. […] These factors may also influence the fold change increase by end-modified donors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6A: A bit more explanation (in results or in legend) might be appropriate. How does HDR allow a protected donor to concatenate at all? This is important because at first the presence of concatemers when using the protected donors might be confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We realized that the DNA cartoon in figure 6A can be misunderstood as end-modified DNA. We showed unmodified donors with head and tail representation. We modified the drawing to avoid confusion and explained in the figure legend that the unmodified donors are shown in the figure.</p><p>Figure legend has been modified to reflect the changes as, “(A) Model for mechanisms of concatemer formation for unmodified donors is shown”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6B: Authors note a &quot;significant&quot; difference in concatenation in situ with the modified donors. I agree this seems clear from the figure but some quantification (densitometry) might help bolster their case.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree the difference is clear but the use of the word “significant” is not appropriate. The affect is obvious without densitometry and so we have simply removed the word “significant” from lines 258 and 280.</p><p>Line 258: “These results suggest that the 5′-TEG modification suppresses concatemer formation.”</p><p>Line 280” “Modifying the ends of the donors suppressed concatemer formation and reduced random integration of short dsDNA at chromosomal DSBs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figures 6C + 6D (GUIDE-seq): I appreciate the clever use of the GUIDE-seq method. It seems authors are using the published probe sequence as dsDNA, and then comparing modified dsDNA to unmodified, but this is not clear enough in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have added the following text to make it clear that we used the published probe sequence.</p><p>Line 263-265 “ Using the previously described dsDNA probe either with or without the TEG modifications, we targeted the <italic>ARHGEF9</italic> locus that was previously characterized for off-target editing”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion: Authors introduce the important concept of &quot;dose-limiting&quot; toxicity but don't present any viability data (nor data from primary cells wherein this is important, see above). I suggest authors focus on the data actually present, or include more toxicity data in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that dose-limiting tox is an important concept. We noted in the text that increased cell death was correlated with the plateau in efficacy. We feel that the possibility that efficacy and toxicity of the modified donor are both increased is too important to leave from the discussion. Therefore, we have opted to leave in the manuscript this one sentence, prefaced with the condition that further study is needed, that addresses dose-limiting toxicity:</p><p>Line 289 “This difference requires further study but could be explained if shorter donors and longer DNA donors experience different dose-limiting barriers. For example, the dose-limiting toxicity of ssODNs could be driven by total number of free DNA ends per cell, while longer molecules could encounter dose-limiting toxicity driven by total DNA mass.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion line 322: Confirm whether &quot;dose&quot; here means &quot;concentration of donor in cuvette&quot; (see first comment).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clarifying this. As explained in response to the first comment we have added text to the methods section to clarify µM and Pmol conversion. We modified the text to avoid confusion.</p><p>Line 328: “In previous studies, fluorescent and amine modifications to the 5′ and 3′ termini of ssODN donors did not improve HDR efficacy over unmodified donors. [,,,] However, these studies were performed using much higher concentrations than the optimal concentrations for modified donors determined here.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This represents an excellent start to tacking a large problem: achieving efficient non-viral knock-in with CRISPR. More work will be needed to prove that it works in systems not utilized here.</p><p>This work is line with earlier work in this area, most of which is cited and discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>The intended audience of this work are CRISPR engineers of all sorts who could use this technique to generate model cell lines, or edited model organisms. Those in cell therapy, immunology, or stem cell biology should also be interested, but data is lacking in those cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for insightful comments and suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
