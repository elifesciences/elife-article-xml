which requires active cell rearrangements driven by Myosin II planar polarisation. Here, we develop novel computational methods to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of Myosin II during GBE, at the scale of the tissue. We show that initial Myosin II bipolar cell polarization gives way to unipolar enrichment at parasegmental boundaries and two further boundaries within each parasegment, concomitant with a doubling of cell number as the tissue elongates. These boundaries are the primary sites of cell intercalation, behaving as mechanical barriers and providing a mechanism for how cells remain ordered during GBE. Enrichment at parasegment boundaries during GBE is independent of Wingless signaling, suggesting pair-rule gene control. Our results are consistent with recent work showing that a combinatorial code of Toll-like receptors downstream of pair-rule genes contributes to Myosin II polarization via local cell-cell interactions. We propose an updated cell-cell interaction model for Myosin II polarization that we tested in a vertex-based simulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12094.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12094.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12094.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Early in development, a growing embryo elongates to form its main body (head–tail) axis. This elongation is driven by a process called cell intercalation – when cells insert between each other. The mechanism that controls this coordinated cell movement is well understood on a small scale. However, it is not known how hundreds of cells rapidly intercalate across a whole tissue without deforming a tissue or inappropriately mixing.</p><p>During fruit fly development, an embryo divides into repeated segments of tissue while elongating. While this happens, cells redistribute an essential structure called the actomyosin cytoskeleton so that it is found more commonly along certain sides of the cell. This structure, which can be thought of as the cell’s “muscle”, is a contractile web made of proteins called actin and myosin. It is closely associated with the cell’s membrane and causes cells to contract and push past each other. The enrichment of the actomyosin cytoskeleton on certain sides of a cell is determined by signaling systems, which are controlled by the segmentation genes in the fruit fly and by the so-called planar cell polarity pathway in vertebrates.</p><p>Tetley, Blanchard et al. have now investigated cell intercalation across a whole tissue by filming live fruit fly embryos in which both actomyosin and cell membranes were made visible with fluorescent markers. Computational tools were then used to quantify how much actomyosin is enriched in the sides of thousands of cells in the embryo at particular points in time while the embryos elongated. This revealed reproducible patterns of actomyosin enrichment. As embryos elongated, the actomyosin cytoskeleton redistributed itself inside the cells: whereas at the start two opposite sides of each cell were enriched in actomyosin (a bipolar distribution), at later times the enrichment occurred on just one side (a unipolar distribution).</p><p>Incorporating these patterns into a model of tissue-wide cell intercalation showed that cells along the head–tail axis acquire a specific identity depending on their position. Interactions between the cells then allow the cells to compare their identities with each other and modify their pattern of actomyosin enrichment accordingly. Where the identities of neighbouring cells are different, the cells enrich actomyosin along their shared sides, creating boundaries between stripes of cells that share the same identity.</p><p>These findings show that actomyosin-rich boundaries drive the elongation of the head–tail axis while limiting cell intermixing. Future work will investigate how the patterns of actomyosin enrichment are altered in fly mutants in which the identities of the cells along the head–tail axis are disrupted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12094.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12094.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust Graduate Studentship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>089614/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tetley</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Standard Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J010278/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchard</surname><given-names>Guy B</given-names></name><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanson</surname><given-names>Bénédicte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust Investigator Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099234/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanson</surname><given-names>Bénédicte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysing Myosin II unipolar planar polarisation with high spatial and temporal resolution during <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis extension reveals how tissue boundaries drive polarized cell intercalation while limiting cell mixing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polarised cell rearrangements drive the simultaneous elongation and narrowing of cell sheets (convergence and extension) during development. These collective cell behaviours have been mostly studied in the context of axis elongation that accompanies gastrulation in bilaterian animals, but are also found in organogenesis, for example underlying kidney tubule elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tada and Heisenberg, 2012</xref>). Understanding convergence and extension movements is important as their failure is associated with congenital diseases, including neural tube defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wallingford et al., 2013</xref>). The first molecular mechanism for convergence and extension was found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where planar polarisation of actomyosin was shown to underlie the polarised cell rearrangements of germband extension (GBE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>). This discovery paved the way for in-depth studies of how the planar polarisation of actomyosin and other components such as Bazooka (Par-3) and E-Cadherin drives the selective shortening of cell-cell junctions during active intercalation of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004;﻿</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levayer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levayer and Lecuit, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simões et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamada et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, actomyosin planar polarisation was also found to be required during convergence and extension in vertebrate tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lienkamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The upstream signals that pattern these polarities in the plane of the converging and extending tissues are starting to be deciphered. In vertebrates, the conserved planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway controls planar cell rearrangements during axis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). In the <italic>Xenopus</italic> model, this pathway was recently shown to do so by biasing the polarisation of actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the PCP pathway is not required for polarisation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>), which instead depends on the segmentation cascade, the most downstream cues being the striped expression of pair-rule transcription factors such as Eve or Runt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>). Misexpression of these pair-rule transcription factors causes a local reorientation of polarity, which led to the hypothesis that local cell-cell interactions generate planar polarity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germband, rather than more global cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>). Recent work has provided molecular evidence for this; three Toll-like receptors are expressed in overlapping stripes in the early embryo under the control of the pair-rule genes <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>runt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic disruption of these receptors leads to defects in GBE and a corresponding loss of the planar polarisation of Myosin II and Bazooka in the tissue. A model was proposed in which the germband is planar polarised through the preferential enrichment of Myosin II at sites of heterophilic Toll-like receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). The overlapping expression domains of Toll-like receptors would therefore establish a combinatorial code where every cell along the antero-posterior (AP) axis has a different 'identity', resulting in the bipolar distribution of Myosin II in every cell.</p><p>These findings open new questions. One is what becomes of the combinatorial code and the planar polarisation of Myosin II once the cells have started intercalating and the number of cells increases along AP? Specifically, if the cell identity stripes defined by the Toll-like receptor code are one cell wide to start with as hypothesised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>), then these would increase to two cells wide on average after one round of cell intercalation. Heterophilic interactions between Toll receptors would no longer be expected at the interfaces between pairs of cells of the same 'identity'. Therefore one possibility is that these interfaces are not enriched in Myosin II at later stages of GBE. Alternatively, a secondary mechanism might be required to polarise the germband in later GBE, for example relying on a global polarising signal, more akin to PCP pathway-reliant polarisation in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devenport, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another unsolved question is how the AP patterns established early in development are maintained during the cell movements of convergent extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vroomans et al., 2015</xref>). Cell rearrangements by intercalation are sufficient to cause mixing of adjacent cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Umetsu et al., 2014</xref>), therefore it is likely that a mechanism exists to maintain order along the AP axis of the germband. At later stages of embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, an enrichment of actomyosin at parasegmental boundary (PSB) cell-cell interfaces is required to prevent cell intermingling caused by cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>). The actomyosin enrichment in this case is thought to act as a mechanical barrier, since the enriched PSB cell-cell interfaces align, indicating line tension. Supporting this notion, laser ablation experiments have demonstrated an increase in interfacial tension at compartmental boundaries in the wing disc and abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Umetsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>). Since parasegmental boundaries are defined genetically by pair-rule gene expression before gastrulation starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrence and Johnston, 1989</xref>), an unexplored possibility is that actomyosin enrichments at PSBs could form early, during GBE, and limit intermingling of cells during the large-scale cell rearrangements of convergence and extension.</p><p>Here we take a systems biology approach to answer these questions by investigating the relationship between segmentation, the planar distribution of the motor Myosin II and the cell behaviours contributing to axis extension. We aimed to develop an analysis of these at the scale of the tissue, in living wild-type embryos. In particular, we asked what the relationship is between the described bipolar distribution of Myosin II at AP interfaces early in GBE and the later formation of parasegmental boundaries that stop mixing between anterior and posterior compartments. We show that Myosin II has a bipolar distribution in early embryos, which then transitions to a unipolar distribution as a direct consequence of polarised cell intercalation in the germband. Such an observation strongly supports that a cell identity mechanism polarises Myosin II throughout the whole of GBE. We show that the boundaries defined by the unipolar patterns, which include the PSBs, are the sites of the cell intercalation events driving GBE. We demonstrate that the PSB is a distinct mechanical structure from very early in GBE. These findings suggest that the boundaries we identify have a dual role, driving axis extension while ensuring that cell mixing remains limited. Finally, we propose an updated differential cell identity model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bidirectional polarity of Myosin II is short-lived during axis extension and unidirectional polarity patterns soon dominate</title><p>We reasoned that analysing the spatiotemporal modulations of actomyosin enrichment during GBE might answer the above questions by revealing undiscovered patterns.

Because <italic>sqh-GFP</italic> was expressed in a <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup></italic> null mutant background, all Myosin II molecules were tagged with GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Royou et al., 2004</xref>).

Movie frames corresponding to 0 and 50 min are shown on the left. At time 0, the mesoderm is invaginating through the ventral furrow (VF, white streak in the middle of the image). Mesoderm and mesectoderm cells on either side of the VF are not included in the analysis, nor are the germband cells at the posterior, because these move out of the field of view with the convergence extension of the tissue. Germband cells included in the analysis are labelled in magenta on both frames. At 50 min, most of the cells in the field of view are included in the analysis, except the mesectoderm cells at the midline (VML) and very dorsal germband cells coming in the field of view (bottom). The amplitude of Myosin II bipolarity is expressed as a proportion (Abbreviated as pp in all figures) of the mean Myosin II intensity around the perimeter of each cell.

Myosin II fluorescence intensities (f.i., y-axis) are plotted along the unwrapped cell perimeter from 0 to 360 degrees (x-axis), starting from the East side of the cell and going anti-clockwise. (<bold>B-D’</bold>) We used two different methods, 'Fourier' and 'Gaussian', to identify one (unidirectional polarity) or two (bidirectional polarity) peaks in the Myosin II fluorescence signal around the perimeter of each cell.

In the first method (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>), Fourier decomposition gave period 1 (unidirectional polarity) and period 2 (bidirectional polarity) amplitude estimates. In the second method (<bold>B’</bold>, <bold>C’</bold>, <bold>D’</bold>), two Gaussians curves with their means 180 degrees apart were fitted to Myosin II fluorescence intensities through minimisation, varying the amplitude of each Gaussian curve and a standard deviation common to both.

(<bold>C</bold>, <bold>C’</bold>) Example cell with unidirectional polarity. The Fourier method fits a unidirectional peak at the correct position, but because the Myosin II signal is discrete, or castellated, there is also a strong period 2 harmonic in phase with the unidirectional signal. Thus with the Fourier method, the quantification of uni- and bi- directional polarities is not completely independent: specifically the period 2 estimate used for estimating bidirectional polarity will also describe some of the unidirectional polarity signal (<bold>C</bold>). Gaussian fitting finds the correct unidirectional peak (<bold>C’</bold>). (<bold>D</bold>, <bold>D’</bold>) Example cell with a combination of uni- and bidirectional polarity. Similar to (<bold>C</bold>), the period 2 amplitude is augmented by the castellated signal in the Fourier method (<bold>D</bold>), whereas the Gaussian fitting correctly identifies two independent peaks of different amplitude: the smallest amplitude identified by the West peak (blue) corresponds to the bidirectional polarity, whereas the higher East peak correspond to the unidirectional polarity (<bold>D’</bold>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12094.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12094.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12094-fig1-figsupp2-v3"/></fig><fig id="fig1s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12094.008</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal maps for all <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> movies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatiotemporal maps for the representative <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> movie SG_4 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>.

Bidirectional polarity of Myosin II (an enrichment at both anterior and posterior cell-cell interfaces for a given cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C’</xref>) was detectable just before the onset of extension and then peaked very early (at 10 min) before declining gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C”</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, unidirectional polarity (an enrichment in Myosin II at either anterior or posterior cell-cell interfaces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D’</xref>) increased progressively for most of GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D”</xref>). This suggests that there is a transition from bidirectional to unidirectional Myosin II polarisation over the course of GBE.</p><p>To ask whether actomyosin polarities are patterned across the AP axis, we generated spatiotemporal heat maps for both types of polarity for the 6 embryos, as a function of time and position along the AP axis (maps for a representative embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>; see other embryos in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Note that in these maps, the data for all cells along the dorsoventral (DV) axis, within an AP bin of defined width, are averaged. Myosin II bidirectional enrichment is strong across the whole AP axis from just before the start of extension until about 20 min, then fades away (green signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In the unidirectional polarity maps, cells with posterior interfaces enriched in Myosin II (positive values, magenta signal) are distinguished from those where the enrichment is at anterior interfaces (negative values, green signal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A juxtaposition of opposing unidirectional polarities along the AP axis (magenta next to green signal) thus indicates that shared interfaces between neighbouring cells are enriched in Myosin II. Although the signal is noisy for single embryos, many such juxtapositions are found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These motifs follow the movement of the tissue as it extends towards the posterior (white guide lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The most prominent ones occur at a regular spacing (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We hypothesised that those correspond to early cable-like enrichments of Myosin II at parasegmental boundaries (PSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Parasegment boundaries become mechanically active soon after GBE onset</title><p>To test this, we tracked PSBs using two different approaches. First, we identified PSBs from clear cable-like enrichments of Myosin II at the end of the 6 movies analysed above, 60 min after the start of GBE (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using these boundaries, we manually assigned a parasegment identity to each tracked cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which could be followed back to the beginning of each movie. This identified PSB cell-cell interfaces at each time point (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). We also identified the cell-cell interfaces one-cell diameter anterior and posterior to each PSB (named ‘-1’ and ‘+1’ interfaces, respectively) over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We then quantified the amount of Myosin II found at these three columns of interfaces over time for 3 to 4 parasegments per embryo, for all 6 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We found that the enrichment in Myosin II at PSB interfaces becomes stronger than in the flanking columns of interfaces by 10–15 min of extension. If these cell-cell interfaces enriched in Myosin II were interconnected, they would be expected to straighten, a signature of line tension as shown for other tissue boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Umetsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fagotto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calzolari et al., 2014</xref>). To test this, we quantified the proportion of interfaces oriented between 60 and 90 degrees relative to the AP axis (thus DV-oriented), for each class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,J</xref>). We find that PSB interfaces are more DV-oriented compared to flanking -1 and +1 interfaces, throughout most of GBE (note that all interfaces become briefly very DV-oriented at the beginning of GBE, which is caused by mesoderm invagination transiently stretching the germband cells along DV, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lye et al., 2015</xref>). We interpret this as evidence that PSB interfaces align more than flanking interfaces. Together with the preferential enrichment in Myosin II at PSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), this suggests that PSB interfaces are under higher tension than flanking interfaces during GBE.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-12094-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12094.014</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Representative <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; gap43-Cherry</italic> movie (SG_4) showing the green channel (<italic>sqh-GFP</italic>) with identification of the different parasegments and the parasegmental boundary interfaces.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,D</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12094.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12094.014</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>To confirm this, we performed laser ablations to probe tension at specific cell-cell interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farhadifar et al., 2007</xref>). We ablated interfaces located at the PSBs at 40 min (identified by their enrichment in Myosin II, see Materials and methods) and compared them with the ablation of +1 interfaces (one cell diameter posterior to PSB). We checked that PSB and +1 interfaces selected for ablation did not have significantly different lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). PSB interfaces had more Myosin II than +1 interfaces, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

This allowed us as before to assign parasegment identities to cells and to track the PSB and flanking -1 and +1 interfaces at odd-numbered PSBs through time, for 3 <italic>eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</italic> movies. We confirmed that interface orientation differences between PSB and flanking interfaces were replicated in these movies, where PSBs are labelled without relying on their enrichment in Myosin II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Together, these results show that PSB interfaces are mechanically active by 15–20 min at the latest after GBE onset, much earlier than their previously known role at stage 10 when they segregate dividing boundary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>). Since cell division in the germ-band ectoderm does not commence until 40 min after GBE onset in our movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), this suggested that PSBs have an early mechanical role during polarised cell intercalation.</p><p>Because later in development, Myosin II enrichment at PSBs depends upon Wingless (Wnt-1 homologue, expressed in one row of cells immediately anterior to the PSB interfaces; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanson, 2001</xref>), we asked if this signalling pathway was also required for the mechanical activity of the PSBs during GBE. To test this, we generated 3 movies expressing <italic>eve-GFP</italic> and <italic>GAP43-mCherry</italic> in a <italic>wingless</italic> null mutant background (<italic>wg<sup>CX4</sup>; eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</italic> embryos).

We also quantified Myosin II enrichment at PSBs (relative to +1 interfaces) in fixed embryos at stages 8 to 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M–M”’</xref>). Although Myosin II is significantly decreased in <italic>wingless</italic> mutants at PSBs once the germband has finished extending (stages 9, 10 and 11), confirming our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>), we found no difference during GBE (stage 8). We conclude that the selective enrichment in Myosin II at PSB interfaces and their straightening during GBE is not controlled by Wingless, suggesting that it is under pair-rule gene control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Unidirectional polarity patterns are a consequence of polarized cell intercalation</title><p>There were more unidirectional polarity patterns in our spatiotemporal maps than just those corresponding to PSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To characterise those, we increased the resolution of our maps by averaging the data collected for each of the 6 <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> movies. We used our identification of PSB interfaces to attribute a within-parasegment coordinate value to each cell from 0 (anterior-most) to 1 (posterior-most) over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Using this coordinate system, we averaged data from 3 to 4 parasegments per movie for our 6 movies. We replotted bidirectional and unidirectional polarity patterns at this parasegmental scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Confirming individual movie maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), we found that AP-oriented bidirectional Myosin II polarisation is strong across parasegmental domains until about 15 min after extension, decreasing thereafter (bright to dark green signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; statistics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B,D</xref>). In contrast, unidirectional polarity emerges gradually from the start of GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; statistics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,C,E</xref>). First, as expected, anterior and posterior interfaces at PSBs have strong Myosin II enrichments of opposite sign, from as early as 10 min after GBE onset (green and magenta respectively at each edge of the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Second, the increase in resolution reveals two more positions along the AP axis where anterior and posterior unidirectional polarities alternate (magenta/green boundaries highlighted with arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; statistics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that there are columns of interfaces in at least two stereotypical locations within each parasegment that become enriched in Myosin II. This gradual transition from global bidirectional polarities to precisely located unidirectional polarities suggested that new DV-oriented junctions not enriched in Myosin II form as a consequence of cell rearrangements. To monitor the progress of cell rearrangements, we quantified the number of cells across the parasegmental domains over time. The average number of cells per parasegment width (along AP) almost exactly doubles, from 3.6 cells at the start of axis extension to 7.3 after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

There is more Myosin II enrichment at PSBs compared to other boundaries, indicated as thicker green lines. We postulate that the third stripe, S3 as defined by unidirectional polarity data above (panel <bold>C</bold>), is composed of a mixture of two identities, named 3 and 4 here, whose boundary is more variable. In support of this, S3 is wider than S1 and S2, but not wide enough for 4 cells across (2+2) (see also cell numbers per stripe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Because of the precision of the segmentation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tkačik et al., 2015</xref>), it is conceivable that there are as many cell identities as there are cells per parasegment width (3–4 on average, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). At the start of GBE, actomyosin enrichment would occur at each cell-cell interface based on these differences in identity along the AP axis. When cells intercalate and make new contacts, this would bring cells of the same identity adjacent to each other along AP. Because their identities are the same, their new shared interfaces would not enrich in Myosin II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, interfaces between stripes of cells of different identity would continue to enrich in Myosin II, driving the emergence of persistent unidirectional polarity. A corollary of this model is that Myosin II polarisation is a consequence of local cell-cell interactions rather than global signals. If a global mechanism was at play, actomyosin would be expected to be enriched at all new DV-oriented interfaces, maintaining bidirectional polarisation, which is not what we find (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>S1/2 and S2/3 boundaries in each parasegment enrich Myosin II and straighten during axis extension</title><p>This model generates specific predictions that we can test. In particular, the two new columns of interfaces identified as having strong unidirectional polarity within each parasegment should have more Myosin II and straighten more than the intervening cell-cell interfaces, after they emerge through cell intercalation. We tracked these, by manually identifying junctions enriched in Myosin II at the end of each movie (as previously done for the PSBs), at the AP locations mapped in our spatiotemporal plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This initial analysis defined 3 stripes per parasegment (S1, S2 and S3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>) and identified cell-cell interfaces separating stripes 1 and 2 (S1/2B) and stripes 2 and 3 (S2/3B) (boundary interfaces), from cell-cell interfaces within each stripe (non-boundary interfaces) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>). We checked that the S1/2B and S2/3B interfaces identified at the end of GBE had AP positions consistent with their expected boundary positions throughout the movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we checked that cell numbers for each stripe matched those expected from the model, with S1 and S2 increasing approximately from 1 to 2 cells wide, and S3 from 1.5 to 3 cells wide, from start to end of GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The larger width of S3 is explained in our model: S3 would be composed of a mixture of cell identities 3 and 4, because there are not enough cells in a parasegment (3.6 cells on average rather than 4 at the onset of GBE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) to make a two-cell stripe for either identities 3 or 4 at the end of GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12094.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Behaviour of S1/2 and S2/3 boundaries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The image is taken from a <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> movie 60 min after the start of GBE, where cells have been manually allocated to putative within-parasegment stripes S1 (red centroids), S2 (green centroids) and S3 (blue centroids), based on Myosin II enrichment and position along AP.

As predicted, interfaces belonging to the boundaries S1/2B and S2/3B become more enriched in Myosin II than interfaces immediately anterior (-1) or posterior (+1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). We then examined the orientation of the different classes of interfaces over time. As predicted, S1/2B and S2/3B are more DV-oriented than +1 or -1 control interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–J</xref>). Note that as expected from the unipolarity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), S1/2B and S2/3B are less enriched in Myosin II and less DV-oriented than the PSBs (see PSB curves shown for comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>), but overall these three boundaries have comparable behaviours. Based on our analysis of cell number, Myosin II enrichment and interface orientation, we conclude that we have identified two new columns of interfaces enriched in Myosin II within parasegments, with the behaviour predicted by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Boundary and non-boundary interfaces have distinct behaviours during axis extension</title><p>A further prediction of our model is that Myosin II enrichment should respond to the juxtaposition of different cell identities rather than to the orientation of the cell-cell interfaces relative to the main embryonic axes. To test this prediction, we examined Myosin II enrichment at boundary interfaces (PSBs, S1/2B and S2/3B) relative to non-boundary interfaces, as a function of interface orientation relative to the AP axis. Before 25 min of GBE, boundary interfaces have more Myosin II than non-boundary interfaces for all orientations except those parallel to AP (0 to about 20 degrees) (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C’</xref>). For both types of interface, there is some dependency upon orientation, with higher enrichment for interfaces closer to 90 degrees relative to AP (DV-oriented interfaces), consistent with previous studies (see for example Figure 4D in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>). This dependency upon orientation is lost after 25 min, with boundary interfaces strongly enriched compared to non-boundary interfaces, irrespective of orientation (right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C’</xref>).

(<bold>G</bold>) S1 and S2 interfaces behaviours fall into four main types: interfaces that remain boundary throughout GBE and do not go through a T1 transition (black); interfaces that remain boundary throughout but go through a T1 transition (grey); boundary interfaces that go through a T1 transition and become non-boundary (orange); interfaces that remain non-boundary interfaces throughout (purple). The percentage of each interface type is shown. Within each type, interfaces are sorted according to the time of T1 transition (white lines). Black arrows indicate two infrequent subtypes. In the orange class, a subtype of boundary interfaces corresponds to interfaces between either cell identities 1 and 3 (cell identity 2 is missing) or 3 and 2 (cell identity 1 is missing). We call these interfaces 'super-boundaries' (abbreviated to superB) (see main text). We have inferred that identity 1 or 2 are skipped because for this subtype the tracking data shows that either stripe S1 or stripe S2 has a local width of zero. The other subtype is in the purple class (arrow) and corresponds to rare non-boundary interfaces that do go through a T1 transition. (<bold>G’</bold>) Comparison of the timings of T1 transitions in the different interface types. The two infrequent subtypes have opposite behaviours: the super-boundary T1 transitions (dashed orange curve) are earliest, while non-boundary T1 transitions are latest (purple curve) compared to boundary T1 transitions (orange and grey).

We have already shown that PSBs, S1/2Bs and S2/3Bs become straighter than intervening interfaces, which is evidence that they are more contractile. To ask if they participate more in cell rearrangements, we developed a method to capture the cell neighbour exchanges called T1 transitions (see Materials and methods). T1 transitions are identified by following the shrinkage of a given interface and linking it to the growth of a new interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Using this method, we identified every T1 transition occurring in stripes S1 and S2 for all tracked parasegments in our 6 <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> movies. We did not analyse stripe S3 as we cannot unambiguously identify boundary interfaces separating the putative cell identities 3 and 4 in that stripe. For each T1 transition identified, we have information on how much Myosin II is found at shortening and elongating interfaces. Pooling all the T1 transitions in S1 and S2 together, we find that Myosin II increases with interface shortening prior to the interface swap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with prior studies (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,i</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>). To distinguish between the interfaces that are shortening actively from those that may shorten passively, we developed another method to probe geometric stress (see Materials and methods). We assume that a Voronoi tessellation based on cell centroid locations represents a mechanically neutral configuration for the cell-cell interfaces. We measured the deviation in interface length from this tessellation for boundary and non-boundary interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref> and Materials and methods). We find that boundary interfaces are shorter than predicted by a Voronoi tessellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), particularly so in the 15 min prior to a T1 transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), indicating that they actively shorten during GBE. We conclude that the boundary interfaces that we have identified drive convergence of the germ-band.</p><p>Next, we examined the behaviour of all interfaces during GBE for S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–K</xref>). We identify four main interface behaviours. About a quarter of interfaces are boundary interfaces which are not involved in any T1 transitions and remain boundary interfaces throughout GBE (black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–K</xref>). At the start of GBE, these interfaces are oriented on average about 50 degrees relative to the AP axis, then rotate to become oriented closer to DV, around 70 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Another quarter of interfaces are boundary interfaces involved in T1 transitions, with two distinct behaviours: some remain boundary interfaces after the T1 swap, while others become non-boundary interfaces (grey and orange, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, the rest of the interfaces are non-boundary interfaces which, for their large majority, are not involved in T1 transitions as expected (purple, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This confirms that boundary interfaces are those involved in cell neighbour exchange. Each interface behaviour occurs at the expected AP locations within each stripe, giving further support to our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, examining now the whole data set (considering all three stripes S1, S2 and S3), we find that the number of T1 transitions consistently peaks at the expected locations for PSBs, S1/2B and S2/3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Interestingly, we also find a T1 transition peak in the middle of S3 (blue curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,F’</xref>), which would correspond in our model to an incomplete or variably located boundary between cell identities 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This is corroborated by a peak in Myosin II in the middle of stripe S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Using an independent measure of cell intercalation (intercalation strain rate, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref>) and Materials and methods), we find that the rate of intercalation is higher in stripe S3, compared to stripe S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We think that this higher rate of intercalation in stripe S3 is caused by missing cells of identity 3 or 4 in this stripe. We postulate that when a cell identity is missing in the AP parasegmental sequence, such as cell identity 3 or 4, the resulting interface enriches more Myosin II and consequently intercalates faster and earlier that other interfaces. We expect these 'superboundary' interfaces (behaving as 'superintercalators') to be most prevalent in stripe S3 because of insufficient cells there, but our data suggest that these can be found also (but rarely) in stripe S1 and S2 (SuperB subtype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–G”</xref>). We conclude that the variable number of cells per parasegment along AP causes a faster intercalation rate in the posterior part of the parasegment compared to the anterior part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Modelling the minimum number of receptors required for the planar polarisation of Myosin II during axis extension</title><p>The current molecular explanation for the planar polarization of Myosin II during GBE is that pair-rule genes control the expression in stripes of three Toll-like receptors that provide a heterotypic code for the enrichment of Myosin II at AP cell-cell interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). The code is thought to be incomplete because it currently does not explain interface enrichment at PSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). Here we asked what is the minimum number of receptors that could explain all of the Myosin II patterns that we have uncovered in this study. We first considered a scenario recapitulating as closely as possible the expression of the three Toll-like receptors (Toll-2, Toll-6 and Toll-8) identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al. (2014)</xref>. We noted that Toll-6 and Toll-8 were largely interchangeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore our first scenario has a receptor A and a receptor B respectively expressed in pair-rule patterns broadly similar to Toll-2 and Toll-6/8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Assuming initially 4 cells per parasegment, we counted by how many receptors adjacent cells differed along the AP axis. For example, if a cell expresses a receptor and the adjacent cell does not, then we recorded a difference of 1 for the corresponding AP interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We postulate that a difference of one receptor or more triggers Myosin II enrichment at the corresponding interface. In this first scenario, all interfaces along AP differ by one receptor, except at the PSBs where there are no differences, consistent with the conclusion that the Toll-like receptor patterns currently do not explain Myosin II enrichment at PSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12094.027</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Finding the smallest number of receptors explaining Myosin II planar polarization during axis extension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression patterns of two putative receptors <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> repeated every double parasegment (corresponding to the expression patterns of, respectively, Toll-2 and Toll-8 as described in Figure 1p in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). PSBs are shown as solid black lines. Summing the number of receptor differences at each boundary, this combination lacks a difference at the PSBs. For cell pairs brought together when single cells are missing (second line), the number of cell receptor differences increases only when cell identity 2 or cell identity 3 is missing (grey boxes highlight an increase in receptor differences). There is no increase in receptor differences, hence no robustness, built in if two contiguous cells are missing at any location (third line). We calculate a 'robustness' score by adding the number of instances, for two parasegments, where there is an increase in receptor differences in the event of 1 or 2 cells missing: the score for this scenario is 10 (number of grey boxes for a double parasegment unit) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) When considering 0, 1 or 2 missing cells, the most robust solution with three receptors is achieved with an additional receptor C spanning one parasegment out of two (either odd or even). This provides a receptor difference at the PSBs (grey boxes in first line) and systematically increases receptor differences when one cell is missing at a given location (grey boxes in second line). When 2 cells are missing, the number of receptor differences increases at a subset of locations, notably in the case where cell identities 3 and 4 are missing (grey boxes in third line). The robustness score for this solution is 20 (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We know this has to be frequently the case since we find an average of 3.6 cells per parasegment at the start of GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We counted again the number of receptors at interfaces, when a cell is missing at a given position. For example, if cell identity 2 is missing, cell identities 1 and 3 become adjacent; since cell identity 1 is expressing receptor A and cell identity 3, receptor B, we scored a difference of two receptors for this particular interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Remarkably, we find that the number of receptor differences increases by one in many locations when a cell identity is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We predict that the number of receptor differences is likely to be proportional to the amount of Myosin II recruited. In other words, we propose that the receptor identity system is quantitative. If the amount of Myosin II enriched is indeed proportional to the number of receptor differences, then more rapid cell intercalation would be expected to occur where cells are missing in the AP sequence (see 'superboundaries' and 'superintercalators' introduced earlier). Increased cell intercalation would fill the gaps in cell identity during GBE and maintain the cell order along AP. From our data, the cell identities that are most likely to be missing are 3 and 4, since we find that there are not enough cells to make two columns of two cells at the end of GBE in stripe 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). For example, according to the scenario in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, if cell identity 3 is missing, the receptor numbers at adjacent interfaces 2/4 increases from 1 to 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This in turn should translate into an increase in Myosin II at those interfaces, which then would increase the rate of intercalation. This notion is supported by our data, since we find that the cell intercalation rate is higher in stripe 3 containing identities 3 and 4, than in stripes 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>From the above, we propose that the receptor system is robust to missing cells because gaps in the pattern will be 'repaired' by speeding up intercalation at cell-cell interfaces most different in their receptor composition. Building on this hypothesis, we looked for the most likely expression pattern for a third putative receptor that would both explain the enrichment at the PSBs but also confer enhanced robustness to missing cells. To do this, we explored all possible permutations of three receptors, where each is expressed in a putative pair-rule pattern (four cell-stripes out of eight, in a given double parasegment unit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We scored each permutation by summing both the number of immediate neighbour receptor differences, and also the <italic>increase</italic> in receptor differences at each interface if one or two cell identities are missing in a given row of cells. The permutation that scored highest (20, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) expresses two receptors in the same exact pattern as our first scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and a third receptor in every other parasegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). With this solution, the number of receptors at cell-cell interfaces increases systematically from one to two when a cell identity is missing anywhere in a double parasegment unit, therefore showing robustness. When two cells are missing, this number increases to three receptors at a subset of locations. Interestingly, one of these locations corresponds to the case where cell identities 3 and 4 are both missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since our data suggest that identities 3 and/or 4 are those most likely to be absent (1 and 2 being more systematically specified), this solution confers adequate robustness, taking into account the observed polarity of the parasegment. Note that a solution with 4 receptors instead of 3 does show a better robustness throughout the double parasegment unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), but since cell identities 1 and 2 are less likely to be missing according to our data, we conclude that the three-receptor solution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is the most parsimonious.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A vertex model based on cell-cell interactions replicates the interface behaviours during axis extension</title><p>To test our cell identity model more formally, we implemented a vertex model with a starting configuration of 20 rows and 14 columns of regular hexagonal cells, organised into 4 parasegments, with each parasegment comprising 3 to 4 cell identities along AP (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).

Cells fail to undergo neighbour exchange in this simulation. In simulation 2, the linearity of line tension energy is replaced at boundary interfaces by a non-linear relationship, where the line tension energy decreases at an ever-faster rate as the interface shortens. This models a positive feedback between interface shortening and Myosin II enrichment, supported by our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In this simulation 2, cells do now undergo neighbour exchanges, but become stuck in a four-cell junction topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D’</xref>). In simulation 3, we allow vertices to slide independently on either side of a column of interfaces that makes a boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). We implement this (for boundary interfaces only) by applying our non-linear dependence of line tension to <italic>all</italic> interfaces present at a given boundary for a given cell (combined length <italic>L</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>), rather than to individual interfaces (length <italic>l</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D’</xref>). The cells are now able to intercalate and the simulated tissue undergoes convergent extension, elongating in AP while shortening in DV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). As a consequence, single columns of cell identities 1 and 2 become double columns of cells at the end of the simulation, as predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. However, because of their insufficient number, cells of identities 3 and 4 end up clumping together according to their identity, thereby disrupting the AP order of the starting pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>To address this, we implemented a fourth simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) that incorporates our hypothesised ‘supercontractility’, where interactions between cells of non-adjacent identities in the parasegmental sequence generate more contractile interfaces than cells of adjacent identities. For example, contractility would be higher at interfaces between identities 2 and 4, than between 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Implementing this, simulation 4 solves the clumping problem and maintains the AP order of cell identities throughout axis extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), as postulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. So simulation 4 recapitulates the intercalary cell behaviours that we hypothesise based on our data. Finally, we analysed interface behaviours as for the real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). We find that boundary and non-boundary interfaces in simulation 4 have behaviours qualitatively similar to real data (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), demonstrating that this simulation successfully models the cell interface behaviours of GBE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have developed new computational methods to quantify and analyse patterns of Myosin II planar polarisation and cell behaviours in the extending <italic>Drosophila</italic> germband in both time and space. In previous studies, the analysis of Myosin II planar polarity has focused on bipolarity, often comparing the enrichment in Myosin II at the DV-oriented sides (also called vertical sides) of germband cells relative to their AP-oriented sides (also called horizontal sides) (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simões et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>). Here, in addition to using a measure of bidirectional polarity, we have developed a measure of unidirectional polarity, to identify when one side of a cell is enriched relative to all other sides. By distinguishing between bi- and unidirectional polarities, we have been able to identify novel patterns that inform how Myosin II planar polarisation arises and drives cell and tissue behaviours. Furthermore, by taking a live-imaging approach, we have been able to observe how these polarities evolve with unprecedented temporal resolution.</p><p>Our study provides further experimental evidence that differential cell identity generates the planar polarity of Myosin II in the germband and extends existing models. A long-standing hypothesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation is that the cascade of genes from maternal determinants, gap genes and then pair-rule genes is able to establish differential 'identities' with single-cell precision along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tkačik et al., 2015</xref>). The discovery of a role for Toll-like receptors, under the control of pair-rule genes in GBE, has provided compelling molecular evidence for this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). One question arising from this work is what happens to Myosin II planar bipolarity once polarized cell intercalation proceeds. Indeed, polarized cell intercalation will increase the cell number along AP, thus bringing cells with the same identity next to each other along this axis. If differential cell identity via heterotypic interactions drives Myosin II polarisation throughout GBE, then some cells should find themselves in homotypic interaction with either an anterior or posterior neighbour, which would not lead to Myosin II enrichment (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The unipolarity patterns that we find are consistent with this hypothesis, identifying alternating domains of enriched and not enriched cell-cell interfaces along AP, which emerge during the course of axis extension. These correspond to Myosin II-enriched boundaries between parasegmental domains (PSBs) and to at least two more locations within each parasegment from early in GBE. The AP position of these enrichments is consistent with these being the consequence of the doubling of cell numbers along AP via polarized cell intercalation. Therefore the differential identity model predicts a transition between bidirectional and unidirectional polarities over the course of GBE, which is validated by our data.</p><p>Another prediction of the differential identity model is that Myosin II enrichment should be dependent upon the type of cell-cell interface (homotypic versus heterotypic) rather than interface orientation (DV versus AP-oriented). We were able to test this by comparing the orientation of enriched boundary interfaces (heterotypic in our model) versus non-boundary interfaces (homotypic). Early GBE (0–25 min) is characterised by two features. First, as predicted by a cell-cell interaction model, boundary interfaces are significantly more enriched than non-boundary interfaces for most orientations. However, overlaid on this, DV-oriented interfaces are also more enriched in Myosin II, irrespective of their boundary/non-boundary identity. This relationship between interface orientation and Myosin II enrichment in early GBE is at odds with a model based solely on cell-cell interactions. It is unclear what the cause of this relationship might be. Some planar polarity and cell intercalary behaviours remain in mutants for all three Toll-like receptors identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). A possibility is that the remaining polarity is due to a more distant polarising signal operating in early embryos, which would direct Myosin II to all DV-oriented interfaces. Later in GBE (25–50 min), our analysis shows that Myosin II enrichment becomes independent of interface orientation, indicating that distant polarising signals are not acting on the germband at this stage and that local cell-cell interactions dominate.</p><p>The Toll receptor model proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al. (2014)</xref> relies on each parasegment being four cells wide. Our quantification shows that parasegments are in fact on average only 3.6 cells wide at the onset of GBE (sampling parasegments 4 to 7, see Materials and methods). The widths of the stripes containing cell identities 1 and 2 are consistent with single-cell wide columns increasing to two-cell wide columns and therefore behave as expected from the differential cell identity model. However, the distinction between the stripes containing cell identities 3 and 4 as predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al. (2014)</xref> was less clear. Instead we observe a third stripe, which is 1.5 cells wide in AP on average at the start of GBE, increasing to 3 after 60 min. We think it likely that the cell types 3 and 4 do exist as postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al. (2014)</xref>, since there are detectable peaks of Myosin II and neighbour exchanges in the middle of our third stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">G</xref>). But because parasegments are less than 4 cells across at GBE onset, some rows would have only cell types 1,2,3 or 1,2,4, while others have the full complement of cell types 1,2,3,4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). After 60 min of GBE, stripes 3 and 4 would then give a mixture of arrangements, such as 3,3,4 and 3,4,4. As a result, the expected enrichment of Myosin II at heterotypic interfaces between cells of identity 3 and 4 would not align well, explaining why we cannot resolve a stripe 3/4 boundary in our data. If our reasoning is correct, this implies that there is an inherent polarity within each parasegment, with the anterior half made of cell types 1 and 2 being robustly specified, while in the posterior half, specification of cell identities 3 and 4 is more variable. This polarity might be important for the tissue to cope with the variation of cell number across parasegments and to repair the AP patterns during cell intercalation. Indeed, at the start of axis extension, although parasegments are usually 3 or 4 cells across, they occasionally have rows that are fewer or more cells across (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrence and Johnston, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busturia and Lawrence, 1994</xref>). We conclude that the mechanism of active convergence of the germ-band must be robust to variable cell number within each parasegmental unit.</p><p>Our modeling suggests a mechanism by which the embryo copes with this variable cell number during axis extension. We postulate that the cell-cell interaction mechanism that triggers Myosin II enrichment at interfaces along AP is quantitative. It has been proposed that the stripy expression of Toll-2, 6 and 8 receptors generate heterotypic interactions that result in Myosin II enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). We further propose that these receptors, in addition to at least another receptor at the PSB, produce Myosin II enrichment which is proportional to the strength of the heterotypy. In other words, the more adjacent cells differ in the number of receptors they express, the more Myosin II will accumulate at their shared interfaces. We find that three receptors expressed in a pair-rule pattern is sufficient in theory to explain the planar polarization of Myosin II at every interface along AP in the germband, including the PSB interfaces which were not accounted for by the Toll-2,6,8 combinatorial code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>). Two of the receptor patterns we identify correspond to the patterns of Toll-2 and Toll-6/8 (Toll-6 has a pattern similar to Toll-8) and the third provides heterotypy at the PSB. The remarkable finding with this minimal combination of receptors is that heterotypy increases when one cell is missing in any position along AP. Moreover, heterotypy increases further when two cells are missing at half of the positions along AP. This is true in particular when identities 3 and 4 are both missing, which are the identities we think are most likely to be absent, based on our data. So when cells are missing, heterotypy would increase, triggering more Myosin II enrichment. This would increase the intercalation rate at the most mismatched interfaces and lead to pattern repair. In support of this, we do find an increased rate of cell intercalation in the posterior part of the parasegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>), where we predict more mismatches because of too few cells of identities 3 and 4.</p><p>We tested these hypotheses in a vertex model and recapitulated qualitatively the tissue-scale behaviours in the data. We had to implement specific interface behaviours in the model to have successful convergence-extension of the <italic>in silico</italic> tissue. These are based on plausible behaviours in vivo. In particular, one limitation of vertex models is that apposed cortices are modeled as a single interface. The changes between Simulation 2 and 3 attempt to go round this limitation: what we tried to model is a situation where cells behave independently on either side of a boundary. For example, junctions could slide independently of each other on either side of the boundary. This is possible in vivo because a boundary is made of two cell cortices, and each cell cortex at the boundary interface could elongate or shorten independently. This could conceivably happen if the two cell cortices on either side of a boundary have different contractile forces. In addition to junctional sliding, cell-cell sliding could occur along the boundary, for example if adhesion is decreased there. Further work is required to determine if these processes are happening during GBE. Another point of note, we have implemented ratios of 1:2:8 for the line tension energies between non-boundary, boundary and 'supercontractile' boundary interfaces in Simulation 4. The 1:2 ratio is quantitatively consistent with observed ratios of tension between PSB boundary and non-boundary interfaces obtained by laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We do not know what to expect as a ratio between boundary and supercontractile boundary interfaces, but 8 seems high. A discrepancy between the ratios of tension needed for a successful simulation of boundary behaviour and the ratios estimated in vivo by laser ablation has been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landsberg et al. (2009)</xref> and so the relationship between line tension energies in vertex models and tension measured by laser ablation might not be simple/linear. For this paper, the key point is that the model qualitatively supports the idea that some boundary interfaces are more contractile than others.</p><p>In combination with the two other receptor patterns which would correspond to those of Toll-2 (receptor A in our model) and Toll-6/8 (receptor B), our parsimonious three-receptor combination is in theory sufficient to explain all of the Myosin II polarity patterns we identify in our study. By identifying PSB interfaces at late stages by their strong myosin enrichment and backtracking to earlier in development, we have further demonstrated that the PSB dominates over the two intra-parasegmental boundaries in terms of myosin enrichment. The predominance of the PSB is detectable from very close to the start of GBE. At the onset of GBE, PSBs are already demarcated genetically by the expression of the pair-rule genes such as <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> and the gradually increasing expression of segment polarity genes <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>en</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>). However, this is the first time that a cellular (rather than genetic) characteristic has been identified for PSBs this early. After the end of germband extension, later in development when epidermal cells are actively dividing, the movement of dividing cells across PSBs is prevented because the boundary interfaces enrich in Myosin II relative to non-boundary interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>), as for other compartmental boundaries in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Umetsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Major and Irvine, 2006</xref>) and for tissue boundaries in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calzolari et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fagotto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fagotto et al., 2013</xref>). In all these cases, the enrichment in Myosin II has been proposed to increase interfacial tension and promote tissue segregation. A possibility is that the PSBs fulfill a similar role during GBE, to prevent mixing between adjacent parasegments that cell intercalation might cause otherwise. Our interface orientation analyses and our laser ablation experiments demonstrate that there is indeed an increase in interfacial tension at PSBs early in GBE. We propose that elevated line tension at PSBs and also, to a lesser extent, at the two intra-parasegmental boundaries that we have identified, contribute to maintain the AP sequence of cell identities while cell rearrangements are occurring.</p><p>It is unclear why the PSB boundaries are enriching Myosin II more than the other two intraparasegmental boundaries we have identified. This could be explained if the heterotypy between cell identity 1 on the posterior side of the PSB is strongest in combination with cell identities 3 or 4 on the anterior side of the PSB. We predict that a not yet identified receptor, with a pattern of expression corresponding to receptor C in our most parsimonious model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), directs myosin II recruitment at the PSB interfaces. It could be that this putative receptor triggers a stronger response at the PSBs compared to the Toll-like 2,6,8 receptors at the other boundaries. Alternatively, more than one receptor might be contributing heterotypy at the PSBs. Our data suggest that we can rule out an early role for Wingless signaling in contributing to a PSB-specific response. Indeed, while Wingless is required to maintain Myosin II enrichment at the PSB later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>), it is not required for the enrichment <italic>during</italic> germ-band extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>), which is corroborated by the fact that PSBs straighten in <italic>wingless</italic> mutants as in wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Thus it is likely that the pathway directing strong enrichment of Myosin II specifically at PSBs is under pair-rule control.</p><p>Finally, our analysis shows that cell interface behaviour associated with active intercalation predominantly occurs at the boundary interfaces that we identify. Thus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> GBE, intraparasegmental boundaries and PSBs enriched in actomyosin appear to drive GBE. Supracellular Myosin II cables are already known to drive tissue elongation through the formation of multicellular rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>). These have not been linked to specific positions along the AP axis, but it is likely that rosettes form exclusively at PSBs or intraparasegmental boundaries, where our analysis suggests that Myosin II is enriched in continuous cable-like structures.</p><p>In conclusion, we think that we have identified segmentally repeated boundaries, which enrich in Myosin II and simultaneously drive cell intercalation while keeping cells ordered along the AP axis. Our findings contribute to the growing evidence that cell fate heterogeneities are translated into differential interface contractility to govern morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>). Extending the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paré et al. (2014)</xref>, we propose an updated differential cell identity model that is robust to missing cells, postulating a third receptor expressed in every other parasegment as the most parsimonious solution. In <italic>Xenopus,</italic> the antero-posterior patterning of the mesoderm also drives convergent extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ninomiya et al., 2004</xref>), and thus similar ordering mechanisms might operate in vertebrate systems.

The difference between the local tissue strain rates (calculated above) and the average cell shape strain rate of cells in the same spatio-temporal domain was attributed to cell intercalation.

We first expressed interface fluorescence intensity around each cell perimeter as a function of angle, from the embryonic posterior (zero) anti-clockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Treating this intensity signal from 0 – 360 degrees as a periodic repeating signal, we calculated its Fourier decomposition, extracting the amplitude of the period 2 component as the strength of Myosin II bipolarity (equivalent to planar cell polarity), with its phase representing the orientation of cell bipolarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>, red lines). We also extracted the period 1 component as a Myosin unipolarity measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>, cyan lines). The orientations of both uni- and bipolarity distributions for our dataset were strongly and consistently biased towards the AP-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C’, D’</xref>). However, there was some pollution of the unipolarity signal in the bipolarity signal, with the latter enhanced because of the castellated (discontinuous) nature of the average interface intensity signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>, black lines). We therefore explored further methods to calculate independent uni- and bipolarity quantities. Based on the consistent AP bias to both kinds of polarity, we measured the polarity in the AP axis only. We found that fitting two Gaussians independently, centred on the anterior and posterior sides of each cell works well, and is able to separate combinations of uni- and bipolarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B’-D’</xref>).</p><p>We fitted the amplitudes and variances of anterior and posterior Gaussians through minimising the discrepancy between the combined Gaussian signal and the Myosin II signal. The bipolarity signal was taken as two peaks of the amplitude of the smaller of the two Gaussians. Subtracting the bipolarity signal from the combined Gaussians, the remainder is the unipolarity signal. Because overall Myosin II intensity differed between embryos, we normalised the strength of both polarities by dividing the allocated Gaussian amplitude area by the cell’s mean perimeter Myosin II signal, so that they would be consistent across embryos.</p><p>Finally, we made an adjustment to account for an imaging artefact that results in a domed intensity of Myosin II in all images, with corners less bright than the image centres. The differences in brightness are not an issue per se, since we express polarity amplitudes as a proportion of mean cell perimeter fluorescence, but an artefactual gradient in intensity across a cell will introduce a unipolarity signal. We therefore fitted a smooth to the Myosin II intensity across each image separately (with a kernel size of 1/20<sup>th</sup> of the image width), calculated the local gradient of this smooth for each cell, and rebalanced the local gradient effect while keeping the mean cell perimeter fluorescence the same.</p><p>Using the above methods we produced uni- and bipolarity measures projected along the AP axis for each cell at each time point, that are independent of each other and normalised to control for variation in Myosin II fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Contoured heat maps</title><p>Heat maps show time on the y-axis plotted against some measure of AP location on the x-axis, with heat colour representing a third variable.

We therefore constructed a measure to quantify the degree of difference from a putative relaxed geometry, both at the scale of cell perimeters and of individual cell-cell interfaces. We first defined relaxed geometries. We chose a Voronoi tessellation, based on cell centroid locations, as a simple first approximation to relaxed geometries. A Voronoi tessellation identifies cell-cell interfaces as the set of points equidistant from two neighbouring cell centroids. Vertices are located where these interfaces from local pairs of cell centroids intersect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The tessellation will stretch with tissue (cell centroid) stretch, so we expected our comparisons to be robust to cell elongation per se.</p><p>Using existing cell centroids (centres of mass), we used a Voronoi tessellation to obtain expected vertex locations, cell-cell interface lengths and cell perimeters. We quantified the difference between actual cell perimeters and those based on Voronoi predictions. By definition, as cell shapes become geometrically stressed, cell perimeters will on average become longer than those predicted by the Voronoi tessellation. We subtracted tessellated interface lengths from observed interface lengths to get a measure of geometric stress. A value near zero indicated a relaxed geometry, with increasing deviation from zero indicating increasingly stressed geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We expected relaxed cell geometries twenty min before the start of GBE, when cells have finished cellularisation but before gastrulation and before polarised Myosin II expression. Indeed, perimeter stress was low and stable until the start of GBE, when it rose sharply then remained high throughout GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, black line). Mesoderm invagination no doubt introduces some stress from -5 to 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lye et al., 2015</xref>), but the fact that the geometric stress index remained high thereafter shows that this stress is likely to be actively maintained in the germ-band.</p><p>Boundary interfaces behaved differently from non-boundary interfaces, with the latter longer than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We investigated further, aligning interfaces in time to zero at the point of neighbour exchange. The deviation of boundary interface length increased prior to exchange events, coinciding with a similarly increase in interfacial myosin prior to exchange as interfaces shortened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study investigates the cellular basis of convergence extension in the fly embryo. It describes with unprecedented resolution the stereotyped changes in the planar distribution of non-muscular Myosin II (MyoII) in wild-type embryos. To do so, the authors combined live imaging with computational methods to precisely quantify the dynamics and the spatial patterns of MyoII planar polarization. The authors showed that the initial bipolar distribution of MyoII is most pronounced at parasegmental boundaries and that this initial bipolar distribution is rapidly followed by its unipolar accumulation at stereotyped positions relative to parasegmental boundaries. This shift from bipolar to unipolar correlates temporally with cell intercalation. Moreover, the authors show that MyoII accumulation better correlated with the juxtaposition of cells of different identities than with the orientation of the cell-cell interfaces relative to the body axis. These findings led the authors to revise the current Toll receptor model to explain how different cell identities generate the planar polarization of MyoII, hence germ-band extension.</p><p>The paper is very well-written and the quantifications are extremely well-done and precise. The consistent quantification of the process over 80 minutes of development is in itself a significant achievement and provides with a nice picture of how myosin redistributes during germ-band elongation. Taken together, the paper is a step forward in our understanding of the very subtle mechanisms that control convergent-extension in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>However, several points need to be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors have performed an extensive analysis of 6 embryos during GBE. However, the quantitative analysis is difficult to follow. For example, it is not clear what is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and G. How is &quot;pp&quot; defined? What defines the position along the AP axis? Cell center of mass? Is it a projection of all cells along the DV axis?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the authors plot the average Myosin 2 intensity over time for different junctions within a parasegment. The differences in myosin levels between the S1/2B and +1/-1 interfaces are relatively small. Particularly between 20 minutes and 30 minutes, where at the same time <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> show a clear transition. This suggests that the effect quantified on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> are rather small, and additional evidence for its mechanical influence should be added. Estimation of tension in these different junctions (e.g. by laser ablation) would bring additional support to a differential behavior of these junctions.</p><p>The quantification of T1 transitions, and in particular the data presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 4I, are not entirely convincing (are these data pooled from several embryos? why not present means with error bars?); could the authors reinforce these data, e.g. by investigating correlations between myosin enrichment and T1 transitions?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests the authors are proposing a mechanism that would simultaneously explain myosin accumulation at parasegments boundaries and give robustness to variation in the number of cells across the AP direction in each parasegment, but the latter is unclear to me. Is it clear that the rows 3 and 4 stay separated at the end of germ-band elongation? And if so, can the authors clarify the mechanism they envision that would provide with this robustness?</p><p>Finally, the entire study is performed on WT embryos and the conclusions are based on correlations. The presented data support a model of local cell-cell interactions driving inhomogeneity in tissue mechanics that will drive GBE. Performing the same quantitative analysis on a perturbed case (e.g. Toll receptor mutant) would significantly strengthen the study. We are aware that such an investigation might be beyond the scope of the current paper, but such data would strongly increase the impact of the mechanism proposed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Unipolar distributions of junctional Myosin II identify cell stripe boundaries that drive cell intercalation throughout <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis extension&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been very much improved but a few remaining issues raised by two of the reviewers need to be addressed before acceptance. These are mostly clarifications concerning the model, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have added vertex model simulations which are interesting. They have introduced a term for the line tension that depends on the total interfacial length at the boundary, which appears to be required to avoid the system being stuck in 4-fold vertices. It seems to me that it is a bit unclear why this term has such an effect – the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>' is supposed to illustrate this but it is hard to understand. Also, can the authors briefly discuss which biological process could give rise to such a term?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and its legend there is a confusing denomination of the term <italic>f(l<sub>ij</sub>)</italic> in the energy as being called &quot;line tension&quot;. Strictly speaking the line tension is the derivative of the energy with respect to the interface length, Λ<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>. In the main text and Methods the authors are referring to this term as a &quot;line tension energy&quot;, which sounds more appropriate. This also implies than when f is a linear function of Λ<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>, this correspond to a condition where the line tension is constant.</p><p>In the model, the parameter Λ<italic><sub>bdy</sub></italic> is defined with a different dimension in Eqs. 5-6 and in the second equation in the subsection “Simulation 1 (no feedback or supercontractility)” (there is a length scale of difference). I assume that the authors take as a reference length scale the square root of the cell target area, but I think this should be clarified.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref> showing vertex model simulations, there appear to be edges that randomly appear and disappear in some frames – is that an artefact of the simulation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>1) The authors have added a vertex model to support their analysis. I appreciate the add on of this model. Even if the different description of the line tension in the boundaries and supercontractile junctions seems adhoc to me, this is fine as a first description. However, the parameters used for the line tension indicate a factor 2 and 8 respectively between non boundary, boundary and &quot;supercontractile boundary&quot;. The authors should discuss whether these parameters seem reasonable. To me, the factor 2 could be consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, but the factor 8 seems exaggerated.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, for clarity I would add a drawing of the corresponding segments when 1 cell and 2 cells are missing in the supplementary information.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> could be placed in supplementary information and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-G</xref> scale bars are missing as well as a scale for the time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12094.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have performed an extensive analysis of 6 embryos during GBE. However, the quantitative analysis is difficult to follow. For example, it is not clear what is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and G. How is &quot;pp&quot; defined? What defines the position along the AP axis? Cell center of mass? Is it a projection of all cells along the DV axis?</italic> </p><p>To improve clarity, we have extensively revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and associated figure supplements. We have brought elements from the supplement figures to explain more step by step our quantification methods. Note that we have used two distinct methods for Myosin II polarity quantification, called “Fourier” and “Gaussian”, which we explain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, in addition to in the Methods. Specifically:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we have added the new panels C, C’ and D, D’. C and D show an example of how Myosin II bipolarity (C) and unipolarity (D) is calculated for each cell, using our first Fourier method; we show two movie frames where bipolar and unipolar vectors are drawn from every cell centroid and point towards either the two sides (bipolar) or one side (unipolar) of the cells which are/is most enriched in Myosin II. We then show in C’ and D’ how these vectors are well oriented along the AP axis, averaging for the 6 videos (we use the ventral midline, VML, of the embryo as our reference for AP axis orientation in the videos). This strong AP orientation of the Myosin II bidirectional and unidirectional polarities justifies our use of a second Gaussian fitting method, with which we quantify the strength of polarity only along the AP axis (C’’ and D’’ and E and F and other similar data).</p><p>We have added a couple of movie frames again in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, to explain better the spatiotemporal maps. One movie frame corresponds to the start of GBE (time zero) and shows all of the tracked cells that are considered in the analysis. It clarifies for example, that the mesoderm and mesectoderm cells present on either side of the invaginating ventral furrow (VF) at this stage are excluded from the analysis. Also, the germband cells on the posterior side of the field of view are not analysed, because these disappear from the field of view as the tissue extends. A second movie frame shows the embryo at 50 minutes. Most of the cells that were excluded from the analysis at time zero are now gone (mesoderm cells have invaginated and posterior germband cells have moved out of the field of view). The only remaining cells that do not make it in the analysis are the mesectoderm cells at the ventral midline (VML) and the dorsal ectoderm cells, which are just starting to appear in the field of view.</p><p>The spatiotemporal maps in Figure E and F show the data as a function of GBE time (y-axis) and position along AP in microns from the anterior edge of the field of view (x-axis). The data is averaged along DV for every position (bin) along AP. The video frames now help to represent this data averaging in DV and we have also added a sentence in the Results to clarify this point: “Note that in these maps, the data for all cells along the dorsoventral (DV) axis, within an AP bin of defined width, are averaged.”</p><p>The unitless values we use for our quantification of Myosin II bi- and unidirectional polarities are defined in the legends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: “The amplitude of Myosin II bipolarity is expressed as a proportion (Abbreviated as pp in all figures) of the mean Myosin II intensity around the perimeter of each cell.” The amplitude calculations are explained visually in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, in addition to in the Methods.</p><p>To improve clarity, we have also made changes in the figure supplements for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We now parcel the information in three distinct supplements:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> gives information about how we synchronized the 6 <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> movies. We have also added a new panel (C) giving the total number of cells analysed as a function of GBE time, for the 6 synchronised videos. At time zero, we analyse about 800 cells, and this increases to about 2000 cells per time point between 25 to 40 minutes of GBE.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figuresupplement 2</xref> explains visually the two distinct methods we used for calculating Myosin II polarities. We have improved the clarity of the figure and legends, and added two new panels A and A’ to explain how Myosin II enrichments are measured for each cell analysed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figuresupplement 3</xref> shows the individual spatiotemporal plots for all 6 <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> movies analysed. Note that all plots used the Gaussian method for calculating polarities, except for panel A, where we show an example of a plot done using the “Fourier” method for <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> (The corresponding Gaussian plots for this movie are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>).</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the authors plot the average Myosin 2 intensity over time for different junctions within a parasegment. The differences in myosin levels between the S1/2B and +1/-1 interfaces are relatively small. Particularly between 20 minutes and 30 minutes, where at the same time <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> show a clear transition. This suggests that the effect quantified on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> are rather small, and additional evidence for its mechanical influence should be added. Estimation of tension in these different junctions (e.g. by laser ablation) would bring additional support to a differential behavior of these junctions.</italic> </p><p>We did provide an estimation of tension for all boundaries in the submitted manuscript, based on the assumption that if interfacial tension is high along a line of connected interfaces, these interfaces should straighten. In a previous study, we used a basic “index of straightness” to quantify this (Monier et al. (2010). Nature Cell Biology, 12: 60–65. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncb2005">http://doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncb2005</ext-link>). In the present study, we calculated instead how clustered the cell-cell interface orientations were relative to the DV axis (perpendicular to the AP-oriented ventral midline) for a given boundary, using -1 (one cell diameter away to the anterior) and +1 (posterior) interfaces controls. If the boundaries are straight, the orientations should be clustered around the orientation of the DV axis (90 degrees relative to AP). We compared the degree of clustering using circular statistics with highest kappa values indicating strongest clustering of interface orientations. These graphs were given in the previous version of the manuscript and showed that PSBs, S1/2B and S2/3B boundaries have a higher kappa than flanking (+1, -1) interfaces.</p><p>To make these data more accessible, we are now providing a slightly more intuitive measure. In addition, we provide a laser ablation experiment to validate this analysis and to provide additional evidence (see below). Instead of providing kappa values, we now provide graphs where we plot the proportion (pp) of interfaces oriented between 60 to 90 degrees relative to the AP axis (so DV-oriented) as a function of time, for all boundaries and the control flanking interfaces. These graphs are now provided in new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K, L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>. We have grouped the graphs to make them easier to compare. Note that this includes a new fifth graph, examining PSB interface alignment in a <italic>wingless</italic> mutant (see response to major point 5 below). A statistical comparison is made at 40 minutes for each graph, and the cumulative interface orientations at this time point is shown in 5 new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J-L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, J</xref>. Together, these data show that boundary interfaces at PSBs, S1/2B and S2/3B align more than flanking interfaces. The curves are very similar to those with the kappa values (which we don’t show anymore, but see initial submission), and a brief description of both measures is given in the Methods.</p><p>We think that the above measures give a very robust assessment of boundary straightness, sampling hundreds of cell-cell interfaces for each boundary class and indicating higher tension at our 3 boundaries per parasegment. In addition, to respond to the reviewers’ point, we have performed laser ablations on the PSBs and control +1 interfaces to validate that our alignment measure is indeed an indication of interfacial tension. In <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> embryos, we identified PSB interfaces by their enrichment in Myosin II at about 40 minutes after GBE onset and ablated these interfaces and +1 interfaces as a control (N=19 for each class). We measured the distance between recoiling cell vertices as a function of time and found that PSBs interfaces recoil faster than +1 interfaces. The estimated recoil velocity differs by a factor of about 2 between experiment and control. This shows that PSB interfaces have higher interfacial tensions than +1 interfaces and corroborates our alignment analysis. We infer from this validation that S1/2 and S2/3 boundaries have also higher interfacial tension than flanking interfaces. Note that we attempted initially to perform the ablations in <italic>eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</italic> embryos, where PSBs would have been labelled without relying on visual inspection of Myosin II enrichment. However, it proved impossible to do these ablations, as not only GAP43-Cherry gave a low signal with the two-photon we were using, but also caused sample overheating. We also considered performing ablations of S1/2B and S2/3B interfaces, in addition to the PSBs (using <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> embryos), but renounced because of the number of ablations we would have to perform to have a conclusive result, which would have taken us beyond a reasonable revision time. We feel that the laser ablation experiment we provide on the PSB validates adequately our more sensitive measures of interface alignment (which consider hundreds of interfaces for a given class) that we have performed on all three classes of boundaries.</p><p><italic>The quantification of T1 transitions, and in particular the data presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 4I, are not entirely convincing (are these data pooled from several embryos? why not present means with error bars?); could the authors reinforce these data, e.g. by investigating correlations between myosin enrichment and T1 transitions?</italic> </p><p>We have revised extensively the quantifications of interface behaviours (performed on pooled data for the 6 <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> embryos). Now, these analyses have their own new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>’ investigates the relationship between Myosin II enrichment, interface orientation and interface class (either boundary or non-boundary). This shows that the strongest relationship is between Myosin II enrichment and the boundary class of interfaces, rather than orientation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref> validates our method for tracking T1 transitions by showing that Myosin II enrichment increases during interface shortening prior to a T1 swap, as found in previous studies.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref> compare interface length with a theoretical length given by a Voronoi tessellation. This shows that boundary interfaces are on average shorter than this theoretical length, whereas non-boundary interfaces are on average longer. We infer from this that boundary interfaces are under greater relative tension than non-boundary interfaces, suggesting that the boundary interfaces are those actively shortening. Consistent with this, boundary interfaces are shorter in average compared to the Voronoi theoretical length, 15 mins prior to T1 swaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>We developed a new analysis to examine the fate of all interfaces in the course of the movies, provided in the new panels G-K in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>. We identify 4 main classes of interface behaviours, which is described in the following paragraph in the Results:</p><p>“Next, we examined the behaviour of all interfaces during GBE for S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G-K</xref>). We identify four main interface behaviours. […] We conclude that the variable number of cells per parasegment along AP causes a faster intercalation rate in the posterior part of the parasegment compared to the anterior part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>).”</p><p>The original graph in Figure 4—figure supplement 4I has been replaced by a new one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref> (see F’ for statistics). We confirm that this is for data pooled from the 6 <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> embryos. This graph shows that the number of T1 transitions correlates with the position of the three main boundaries identified as being enriched in Myosin II; PSBs, S1/2B and S2/3B. We can also find a lesser peak within stripe 3, which we interpret as corresponding to a less prominent or more variably located boundary between cell identities 3 and 4.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests the authors are proposing a mechanism that would simultaneously explain myosin accumulation at parasegments boundaries and give robustness to variation in the number of cells across the AP direction in each parasegment, but the latter is unclear to me. Is it clear that the rows 3 and 4 stay separated at the end of germ-band elongation? And if so, can the authors clarify the mechanism they envision that would provide with this robustness?</italic> </p><p>The fact that peaks in both the number of T1 transitions and Myosin II fluorescence intensity are found in the middle of stripe 3 (see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F-G</xref>) provides evidence that cell identities 3 and 4 remain separated during GBE. We also find that the rate of intercalation convergence along the DV axis (calculated as in our previous studies Blanchard et al. (2009).

These two independent analyses corroborate each other and suggest that stripe 3 does in fact contain two separate stripes. The variable initial width of stripe 3 makes the location of the cell identities 3/4 boundary variable in space and time, which is why this boundary does not emerge from the Myosin II unipolarity analysis, and why we cannot reliably locate it manually.</p><p>We now test the mechanisms that could generate our observed patterns formally in a new vertex model provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. We show in simulation 4 that cell identities 3 and 4 remain separated during axis extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>Finally, the entire study is performed on WT embryos and the conclusions are based on correlations. The presented data support a model of local cell-cell interactions driving inhomogeneity in tissue mechanics that will drive GBE. Performing the same quantitative analysis on a perturbed case (e.g. Toll receptor mutant) would significantly strengthen the study. We are aware that such an investigation might be beyond the scope of the current paper, but such data would strongly increase the impact of the mechanism proposed.</italic></p><p>We are planning to repeat these analyses in Toll-like receptor mutants, although this is a significant investment in time and will require its own study. One challenge with doing this is that we have to combine a mutant background with our <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> strain. Making a new fly strain containing these 3 components (<italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>, sqh-GFP</italic> and <italic>GAP43-mCherry</italic>) along with a mutant is time-consuming and might not necessarily be viable (we have had problems establishing these combinations with segmentation mutants). A more promising avenue is to inject dsRNA against the gene of interest directly in the <italic>sqh<sup>AX3</sup>; sqh-GFP; GAP43-mCherry</italic> strain. This however will mean dealing with variation in the degree of gene inactivation inherent to RNA interference and will probably require sampling more movies, which is again very time consuming. Because of all this, we feel we cannot provide this experiment within a reasonable timeframe for a revision.</p><p>Nevertheless, to take into account the reviewers’ comment, we provide two new sets of data, which test our hypotheses. One is a perturbation using a <italic>wingless</italic> mutant, the second a series of simulations using a vertex-based model.</p><p>We first examine the interface alignment and Myosin II enrichment at PSBs in a <italic>wingless</italic> mutant. This experiment was motivated by the fact that we found in a previous study that Wingless signalling is required for Myosin II enrichment and boundary straightening after the end of germband extension, at stage 10 (Monier et al. (2010) Nature Cell Biology, 12(1), 60–65. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncb2005">http://doi.org/doi:10.1038/ncb2005</ext-link>). Wingless is expressed in a stripe of cells just anterior to the PSB. Because Wingless expression is detectable from gastrulation onwards, we wondered if it was also required for PSB function during germband extension. Our new data shows that it is not required, suggesting, remarkably, that all aspects of PSB behaviour during GBE is under pair-rule control. We provide two distinct experiments:</p><p>We measured interface alignment at PSB interfaces and flanking interfaces in <italic>wg<sup>CX4</sup>; eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</italic> embryos (data pooled for 3 movies, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1L</xref>). In these embryos the PSBs interfaces align strongly along DV compared to control interfaces, in a similar manner to our wildtype control embryos (<italic>eve-EGFP, GAP43-mCherry</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>).</p><p>We quantified Myosin II in fixed <italic>wingless</italic> mutant and wildtype embryos, during germband extension (stage 8) and later (stage 9-11). Consistent with the above experiments and with the results from Monier et al. (2010), we find that whereas Myosin II enrichment decreases in <italic>wingless</italic> mutants after the end of GBE, it is not significantly changed during GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M-M</xref>”’).</p><p>The second test of the hypotheses put forward in our paper is a new vertex-based model. This is described in a new section at the end of the Results and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. We find that we can recapitulate in silico the cell behaviours that we postulate happen in vivo based on our analysis of Myosin II enrichment and interface behaviour.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been very much improved but a few remaining issues raised by two of the reviewers need to be addressed before acceptance. These are mostly clarifications concerning the model, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors have added vertex model simulations which are interesting. They have introduced a term for the line tension that depends on the total interfacial length at the boundary, which appears to be required to avoid the system being stuck in 4-fold vertices. It seems to me that it is a bit unclear why this term has such an effect – the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>' is supposed to illustrate this but it is hard to understand. Also, can the authors briefly discuss which biological process could give rise to such a term?</italic></p><p>To clarify this, we have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>’ by new panels 7D-E” showing what happens with and without the use of ‘contiguous boundary interfaces’. 7D-D’ shows that in Simulation 2, a subset of interfaces shorten rapidly, but because these are trapped at the boundary, they cannot elongate and this generates stable 4-fold vertices. 7E-E’’ shows how Simulation 3 solves this by considering for a given cell, all boundary interfaces as a contiguous interface. The subset of boundary interfaces that shorten can now become non-boundary interfaces and elongate (7E”). Along with changes to the legend and to the accompanying text, we hope this has clarified why Simulation 2 fails and how the contiguous interface tension rescues this in Simulation 3.</p><p>One limitation of vertex models is that apposed cortexes are modeled as a single membrane, and in essence the change between Simulation 2 and 3 attempts to go round this limitation. So we think that in biological terms, what we are attempting to model is a situation where cells behave independently on either side of a boundary. For example, junctions could slide independently of each other on either side of the boundary. This is possible in vivo because a boundary is made of two cell-cell interfaces, and each of these cell interfaces could elongate or shorten independently. This could conceivably happen if the two cell cortices on either side of a boundary have different contractile forces. In addition to junctional sliding, cell-cell sliding could occur along the boundary (simple shear), for example if adhesion is decreased there.</p><p>We have added a short paragraph to the Discussion to summarise our model findings and the biological implications.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and its legend there is a confusing denomination of the term f(l<sub>ij</sub>) in the energy as being called &quot;line tension&quot;. Strictly speaking the line tension is the derivative of the energy with respect to the interface length, Λ<sub>ij</sub>. In the main text and Methods the authors are referring to this term as a &quot;line tension energy&quot;, which sounds more appropriate. This also implies than when f is a linear function of Λ<sub>ij</sub>, this correspond to a condition where the line tension is constant.</italic></p><p>We agree, and have changed &quot;line tension&quot; to &quot;line tension energy&quot;.</p><p><italic>In the model, the parameter Λ<sub>bdy</sub> is defined with a different dimension in Eqs. 5-6 and in the second equation in the subsection “Simulation 1 (no feedback or supercontractility)” (there is a length scale of difference). I assume that the authors take as a reference length scale the square root of the cell target area, but I think this should be clarified.</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing out this lack of clarity. Prior to numerical simulation, we have implicitly non-dimensionalized the vertex model in a similar manner to Farhadifar et al., (2007) and Kursawe et al. (2015), by rescaling all lengths by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf63"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the target cell area, and rescaling all times with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf64"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the drag coefficient and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the elastic coefficient. Thus, all presented model results are non-dimensional. We have clarified this point with an additional sentence in the subsection “Governing equations”.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref> showing vertex model simulations, there appear to be edges that randomly appear and disappear in some frames – is that an artefact of the simulation?</italic> </p><p>This is a known artefact of the visualization tool (Paraview) only, and is not present in the output of our model. We are currently looking into regenerating <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref> using an alternative visualization tool, and will upload the movie once this is done, but in the meantime we would prefer not to hold up progress with the manuscript and release of the manuscript PDF.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors have added a vertex model to support their analysis. I appreciate the add on of this model. Even if the different description of the line tension in the boundaries and supercontractile junctions seems adhoc to me, this is fine as a first description. However, the parameters used for the line tension indicate a factor 2 and 8 respectively between non boundary, boundary and &quot;supercontractile boundary&quot;. The authors should discuss whether these parameters seem reasonable. To me, the factor 2 could be consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, but the factor 8 seems exaggerated.</italic></p><p>Our vertex-based model is a first exploration of our hypothesized mechanisms of germ-band extension, based on the new data we present. We did not set out expecting to mimic the real data quantitatively. The simulation approach is therefore still phenomenological, with care needed when attempting to map a particular parameter in the model to a particular biological mechanism. In this context therefore, we do not think that a factor of 8 is problematic – the important point is that these supercontractile interfaces have stronger contraction than other boundary interfaces. A discrepancy between the ratios of tension needed for a successful simulation of boundary behaviour and the ratios estimated in vivo by laser ablation has been noted by (Landsberg, K. P., Farhadifar, R., Ranft, J., Umetsu, D., Widmann, T. J., Bittig, T., et al. (2009).
