Although observed across species, the neural and endocrine mechanisms that regulate the nutritional needs of mated females are not well understood. Here, we find that mated <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females increase sugar intake, which is regulated by the activity of sexually dimorphic insulin receptor (Lgr3) neurons. In virgins, Lgr3+ cells have reduced activity as they receive inhibitory input from active, female-specific pCd-2 cells, restricting sugar intake. During copulation, males deposit sex peptide into the female reproductive tract, which silences a three-tier mating status circuit and initiates the female postmating response. We show that pCd-2 neurons also become silenced after mating due to the direct synaptic input from the mating status circuit. Thus, in mated females pCd-2 inhibition is attenuated, activating downstream Lgr3+ neurons and promoting sugar intake. Together, this circuit transforms the mated signal into a long-term hunger signal. Our results demonstrate that the mating circuit alters nutrient sensing centers to increase feeding in mated females, providing a mechanism to increase intake in anticipation of the energetic costs associated with reproduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>mating status</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>circuits</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>neuroendocrine pathways</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Kristin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Postmated increases in sucrose consumption in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females is executed by a female specific circuit that alters neuroendocrine centers to promote hunger.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals choose what to eat. Their choices are reflections of their physiological demands as they seek out and consume food to meet their metabolic needs. Beyond food deprivation, other states can impose new nutritional requirements, shifting nutrient intake to maintain homeostasis. Female mating status, for example, impacts feeding decisions across species. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mated females increase egg production while also escalating nutrient consumption. Observed diet-related changes include an increase in total food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>) and the development of appetites for protein and salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). These two nutrients have been linked to reproduction as dietary protein and salt are likely processed and used during egg assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, mated females seek out food rich in specific nutrients to couple feeding behavior with metabolic demand.</p><p>Another nutrient, sugar, may also be a vital postcopulatory diet component. Sugar is the fly’s main energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>). Females use sugar during egg production when dietary carbohydrates are synthesized into lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2022</xref>) and packed into the developing ova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sieber and Spradling, 2015</xref>). Mated females also increase their locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isaac et al., 2010</xref>), resulting in elevated metabolic rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2022</xref>) and driving the need for additional calories. Together, this predicts that mated females require significantly more sugar than virgins. However, as excessive sugar negatively impacts fly health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baenas and Wagner, 2022</xref>), sugar intake must be tightly regulated. Although the sugar-to-protein ratio influences reproductive output and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>), the absolute levels of sugar intake of mated females remain untested. Moreover, how the mated state impinges upon neural and/or endocrine systems to modify feeding in mated females is not yet known.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mated-related changes in female behavior and physiology are orchestrated by sex peptide (SP). SP is a 36-amino acid peptide that is produced in the male seminal fluid and transferred to females during copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Kubli, 2003</xref>). SP binds to its receptor (SPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>) which is expressed in sensory neurons (sex peptide sensory neurons, SPSNs) in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Häsemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). SPSNs convey mating status to sex peptide abdominal ganglia (SAG) neurons that ascend to the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>) and synapse onto pC1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This female-specific SPSN-SAG-pC1 circuit is active in virgin females and silenced after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Reception of SP and the consequential silencing of this circuit initiates the long-term postmating response, an umbrella term used to describe the shift in many behaviors after mating including reduced sexual receptivity and increased egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Although the three-tier SPSN-SAG-pC1 circuit appears to coordinate postmating state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), different neurons downstream of pC1 independently adjust individual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Similar to other postmated behaviors, mated-related changes in feeding are also regulated by SP and the activity of this circuit. The reception of SP during mating or the artificial silencing of the first-order SPSNs and second-order SAG neurons causes an increase in the consumption of both salt and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). This demonstrates that the mating status circuit alters food consumption in mated females to couple nutritional intake with internal needs. But how mating status is integrated into circuits that modulate feeding is unclear. For example, with the use of whole brain imaging, researchers have identified the ‘borboleta’ region as a modulator of yeast-based feeding in mated females. However, if and how this region is regulated by the SPSNs, SAG, or pC1 remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Münch et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, it is not yet determined if the mating status circuit also regulates the intake of other nutrients such as sugar that may be of vital use to mated females. Thus, how mating influences nutritional state circuits or feeding circuits remains a central question.</p><p>Here, we investigated how mating status influences sucrose intake. We used automated behavioral assays, powerful genetic tools, connectomics, and functional imaging approaches to examine neural mechanisms for appetite changes in mated females.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Females increase sugar intake after mating via changes in feeding microstructure</title><p>To investigate the impact of female mating status on sugar intake, we monitored individual feeding bouts over time using a high-throughput, automated feeding platform (FLIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We compared the consumption of virgins and two types of mated females (1 hr or 72 hr postmated). We found that 72 hr postmated females consumed for a significantly longer duration on sucrose solution than virgins or 1 hr postmated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further evaluate the onset of increased sucrose consumption, we monitored the consumption of virgin, 24 hr postmated females, and 72 hr postmated females and established a postmated phenotype in both mated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These studies demonstrate that mated females consume more sugar than virgins and that changes in sucrose consumption manifest 6–24 hr after copulation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mated females consume more sucrose than virgins by elongating feeding events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of fly feeding behavior (left) and the fly liquid interaction counter (FLIC) signal that monitors food contact over time (right).

Mated females consumed for longer durations than virgins for all sucrose concentrations below 500 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Investigation into the microstructure of feeding revealed that the postmated increase in sucrose consumption is due to an elongation in feeding bout duration rather than an increased number of bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Thus, mated females consume more by engaging in longer feeding times rather than by initiating more feeding events.</p><p>We tested two predictions suggested by the mating-induced changes in sugar-feeding dynamics. First, longer overall feeding durations suggest that a greater amount of sugar is consumed. We directly tested this using a capillary feeder (CAFE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and found that mated females consume significantly more sucrose than virgins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Second, virgin and mated females execute a similar number of feeding bouts, suggesting that females do not differ in the probability of initiating a feeding event. To directly test this, we monitored proboscis extension upon sugar taste detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and found that virgin and mated females have similar feeding initiation propensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). These results further corroborate that increased sugar consumption in mated females is due to longer meal duration rather than more frequent feeding bouts.</p><p>Hunger increases the sensitivity of gustatory neurons to sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether changes in sugar sensory sensitivity underlie increased sucrose consumption in mated females, we monitored taste-induced neural activity in sugar gustatory neurons in mated and virgin females with the GCaMP6s calcium indicator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Stimulation of the fly proboscis with sugar elicited similar responses in gustatory axons regardless of mating status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>), demonstrating that gustatory sensitivity is not altered by mating and not likely to contribute to changes in feeding.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mated and virgin females do not differ in taste-induced sugar gustatory sensory neuronal activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of in vivo calcium imaging experiment monitoring taste-induced activity in gustatory axons.

As animals’ nutritional requirements shift in a state-dependent manner, they must adapt their feeding behavior accordingly, necessitating mechanisms that couple dynamic physiological demands with nutritional consumption. After mating, females experience a new metabolic requirement related to increased offspring production. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, like many insect species, this is demonstrated through the significant increase in egg production and egg laying, two energetically expensive tasks. We predicted that mated females require more calories than virgins and, therefore, exhibit increased consumption of sugar, their main energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we characterized the sucrose consumption of virgin and mated females and found that mated females demonstrate increased sucrose intake. Although mated females are predicted to need more sugar to support increased reproductive output, we find that the mechanism that regulates postmating sugar intake is independent of the caloric deficiencies caused by egg production and is anticipatory in nature. This allows females to increase caloric intake prior to experiencing a deficiency in internal sugar levels. The postmated increase in sugar feeding is due primarily to an elongation of feeding bouts rather than an increased likelihood of initiating a feeding event or an increase in the appetitive nature of sugar. This is supported by data that demonstrates no change in response of the sucrose-sensing gustatory sensory neurons across mating states. Instead, we find that the female’s mating status impinges on an endocrine center of the brain, where it may associate the mated state with elevated hunger levels.</p><p>In virgins, elevated activity of SAG and pC1 potentiates pCd-2-mediated inhibition of Lgr3+ cells, resulting in low sugar intake. After mating, the activity of SAG and pC1 is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), decreasing the activity of pCd-2 and alleviating the inhibition from <italic>Lgr3+</italic> cells, increasing sucrose intake. Lgr3 is a leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor, which binds Dilp8 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptide 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vallejo et al., 2015</xref>) to regulate feeding in flies. Expression levels of Lgr3 and Dilp8 rise in fed flies and mutations in either gene increase feeding, arguing that Dilp8 and Lgr3 are satiety factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yeom et al., 2021</xref>). Our calcium imaging and behavioral studies of Lgr3+ mBNs indicate that they are more active in a mated state and activation of these neurons promotes sucrose consumption. Importantly, it has not been established how Dilp8 influences the activity of Lgr3+ mBNs. Regardless, together these data suggest a proposed model for how Lgr3+ mBN neurons integrate signals from the mating status and hunger/satiety systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In virgin or satiated female flies, pCd-2 activity and circulating DILP8, respectively, inhibit Lgr3+ mBNs, reducing sugar feeding. Conversely, in mated or hungry flies, Lgr3+ mBNs lack the inhibitory signal from pCd-2 neurons or circulating Dilp8, respectively, resulting in increased sugar consumption. Hence, the mated state may be viewed mechanistically as an additional ‘hunger’ signal within this system.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model summarizing neuroendocrine Lgr3-dependent feeding modulation.</title><p>Schematic of neural connectivity of mating status circuit (SPSN-SAG-pC1), mating status output neurons (pCd-2), and downstream Lgr3 cells.

Just as the silencing of first-order SPSNs and second-order SAG neurons drive changes in salt and protein appetites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2015</xref>), we also find that artificially silencing any part of the SPSN-SAG-pC1 circuit drives increased sugar feeding, recapitulating the mated phenotype. Moreover, the neural regulation of postmating sucrose consumption, like other postmated behaviors, is also regulated by an independent pathway postsynaptic to the mating status circuit. Although the three-tier circuit appears to be a master regulator, the network splits into dedicated neural pathways modulating specific postmating behaviors such as egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), or sucrose consumption. Interestingly, although increased sugar intake may indeed support egg production, the neural mechanisms regulating the two behaviors are independent downstream of pC1.</p><p>Our findings provide insight into not only the mechanisms that couple dynamic state-dependent physiological demands with nutritional consumption but also how these mechanisms are distinguishable from food deprivation-induced nutrient need. Sugar and yeast are both vital nutrients for flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>). Female <italic>Drosophila</italic> increase feeding of both sugar and yeast after nutrient deprivation and after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>). Upon nutrient deprivation, the sensitivity of gustatory neurons change, promoting the detection of the deprived nutrient, for both sugar and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steck et al., 2018</xref>). However, we found that mated-related changes in sucrose were not due to changes in sensory neuron sensitivity. Similarly, mated-related changes in gustatory neuron sensitivity to yeast have not been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steck et al., 2018</xref>). It should be noted that after mating females display a transient modulation in chemosensory neurons that respond to polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hussain et al., 2016</xref>). However, these changes are not associated with polyamine consumption but instead oviposition behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hussain et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that changes in postmated feeding behavior result from the mating status circuit (or its output neurons) modulating nutrient-sensing or feeding circuits, rather than directly tuning sensory neurons to promote feeding.</p><p>Although mating status impinges on circuits that either process nutrient-sensing signals or regulate feeding circuits, there is no shared circuit yet identified for elevated nutrient intake of sugar and yeast in mated females. Beyond the three-tier mating status circuit, no overlap between areas of the brain modulating postmated increases in protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Münch et al., 2022</xref>) and sugar consumption (this manuscript) has been found. It remains to be elucidated whether the circuit described here specifically modulates post-mating changes in sucrose consumption or whether it impacts the intake of other nutrients, including protein and salt.</p><p>Overall, our findings show that an elevated appetite for sucrose is an important behavioral subprogram elicited by mating and executed by female-specific circuitry, shifting the physiology of a mated female. The activation of hunger centers by the mating status circuit provides a neural mechanism that anticipates the large energetic demands associated with offspring production and increases caloric intake, promoting reproductive success.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rearing conditions and strains</title><p>Flies were reared on standard cornmeal-agar-molasses medium, at 25 °C, 65% humidity on a 12-hr-light-dark cycle.

For two- and three-group comparisons, data were first tested for normality with the KS normality test (alpha = 0.05). If all groups passed then groups would be compared with a parametric test (t-test or one-way ANOVA, respectively). If at least one group did not pass, groups were compared with a non-parametric version (Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively). For all multi-factorial designs, a two-way ANOVA was performed with a Bonferroni post-hoc test. All statistical tests, significance levels, and the number of data points (N) are specified in the figure legend.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Normalized datasets</title><p>Most datasets from optogenetic assays were normalized within each genotype. To generate this normalized dataset, data from females within the no-light condition were averaged, creating a ‘no-light mean’ for each genotype. This value was subtracted from each individual female within the light condition of the corresponding genotype. This dataset was then graphed and statistical analysis was performed as outlined above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Data availability</title><p>Detailed information about R code used to extract feeding behavior using our modified parameters for each experimental set-up is found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mlaturney/FLIC_automated_group_assignment">https://github.com/mlaturney/FLIC_automated_group_assignment</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laturney, 2023</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Fly genotypes in figures.</title><p>Table including the short and full genotypes of flies in the indicated figure.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85117-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85117-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated and analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p><p>The following previously published dataset was used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Lauritzen</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Perlman</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Milkie</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Torrens</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Price</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharifi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Calle-Schuler</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kmecova</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>IJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Karsh</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Trautman</surname><given-names>ET</given-names></name><name><surname>Bogovic</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanslovsky</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jefferies</surname><given-names>GSXE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kazhdan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Khairy</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Saalfeld</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fetter</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Bock</surname><given-names>DD</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2018">2018</year><data-title>A Complete Electron Microscopy Volume of the Brain of Adult Drosophila melanogaster</data-title><source>Adult Brain</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://catmaid-fafb.virtualflybrain.org/">catmaid</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Members of the Scott lab provided contributions to experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. Salil Bidaye assisted with the analyses of locomotor data. This work was supported by NIH R01DC013280 (KS). Neuronal reconstruction for this project took place in a collaborative CATMAID environment in which 27 labs are participating to build connectomes for specific circuits. Therefore, work done for published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and ongoing projects has proved useful to us. Development and administration of the FAFB tracing environment and analysis tools were funded in part by National Institutes of Health BRAIN Initiative grant 1RF1MH120679-01 to Davi Bock and Greg Jefferis, with software development effort and administrative support provided by Tom Kazimiers (Kazmos GmbH) and Eric Perlman (Yikes LLC). We thank Peter Li for sharing his automatic segmentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/605634">https://doi.org/10.1101/605634</ext-link>). Tracing in Cambridge was supported by Wellcome Trust (203261/Z/16/Z) and ERC (649111) awards to G Jefferis. We thank the Princeton FlyWire team and members of the Murthy and Seung labs for the development and maintenance of FlyWire (supported by BRAIN initiative grant MH117815 to Murthy and Seung). We found the partial tracing of SAG and pC1 in CATMAID useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to our tracing efforts, we are appreciative of the tracing accomplished by other labs. For help with tracing of pC1a in FlyWire, we thank the Murthy and Seung labs (77%) and the Jefferis lab (7%). For help with tracing pCd-2 cells we would like to thank the Dickson lab (CATMAID: 76% of pCd-2a, 44% of pCd-2b, 28% of pCd-2c), the Jefferis lab (CATMAID: 20% of pCd-2a, 6% of pCd-2b, 3% of pCd-2c; FlyWire: 32% of pCd-2a, 8% of pCd-2b, 13% of pCd-2c), the Murthy and Seung lab (FlyWire: 15% of pCd-2a, 11% of pCd-2b, 6% of pCd-2c), and Janelia tracers (FlyWire: 52% of pCd-2a, 14% of pCd-2b). We would like to thank the Jefferis labs (46%) and the Murthy and Seung labs (50%) for their contribution to tracing the t-shape Lgr3 + cells.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kenta Asahina (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We appreciate the overall rigour and importance of this manuscript. We have a few suggestions for the authors that we think will strengthen their claims.</p><p>1. The writing:</p><p>a. We note that the manuscript only briefly refers to the extensive literature on protein feeding and its modulation in response to mating. We suggest that the authors explicitly refer to this body of literature in the introduction and discuss their findings in its context.</p><p>b. We also suggest that the authors tone down the claim that the Lgr3+ neurons are a hub that integrates mating and hunger status to modulate feeding since this integration per se hasn't been tested.</p><p>2. The role of pCd2 and/or Lgr3+ in sugar and protein feeding. Our suggestion to the authors is to recapitulate the virgin circuit state in the mated females by activating pCd2 and/or silencing Lgr3+. Perhaps the authors have already done these manipulations, which should result in the suppression of sugar feeding – do they?</p><p>3. The role of mating: One of the main claims of the manuscript is that mating increases sugar appetite. We felt that the circuit's requirement in a mating-dependent manner has not been convincingly demonstrated. The authors have performed manipulations that, in the virgin, drive the circuit to a mated state (silenced pCd2 and activated Lgr3+ ) and demonstrated an increase in sugar consumption. We felt that interpretations from these manipulations would be more valuable in the context of similar manipulations in the mated state. If their model is correct, we anticipate that these manipulations should not result in changes in sugar feeding. (If they do, it might just suggest that optogenetics does not recapitulate SP-mediated activation of the circuit.)</p><p>3. Verification of the R40F04-LexA line. Since this is a new and potentially valuable reagent, it will be nice to describe its expression pattern thoroughly.</p><p>In addition to this, there are several more detailed comments in the reviews below and we urge the authors to address them wherever possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>We very much enjoyed reading the manuscript for its clarity of data and its presentation.</p><p>1. Given the vast amount of literature on the increase in protein preference post-mating, it is important to discuss these data in the context of those findings. In those data, flies are presented with a choice of sugars and proteins and seem to prefer proteins. But the data in this manuscript, and Carvalho et al. 2006, suggest that this might be a general increase in hunger overall. I would urge the authors to discuss this explicitly.</p><p>2. In the circuit dissection experiments, one would expect that activating pCds or inactivating the Lgr3+ neurons in the mated condition should attenuate the sugar appetite. Does it?</p><p>3. I liked the authors' interpretation of their circuit mapping – that the mated state is essentially a heightened hunger state. If this is true, these manipulations should also influence protein hunger. Can the authors show this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have 3 recommendations on the current manuscript, 2 on an experiment, and 1 on the discussion.</p><p>Regarding the experiment:</p><p>1) any evidence that functions of pCd-2 and Lgr3 neurons are under influence of mating status will greatly strengthen the authors' conclusion that their role is to promote sucrose consumption after mating. Since direct measurement of baseline neuronal activities in pCd-2 and Lgr3 neurons is likely difficult in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, one possible experiment is to test both the function (Figure 5I, J; Figure 6G) and/or the strength of the neural connection (Figure 5G, H; Figure 6D, E) is mating status-dependent. Currently, these experiments were performed only in virgin females. If the authors' model is correct (which I think is very likely), activation of pCd-2 (or their upstreams) should suppress sucrose consumption in mated females, but (at least) less so in virgin females (in which pCd-2 neurons are expected to be already active). In contrast, the inhibition of pCd-2 neurons may not change the sucrose consumption in mated females (in which pCd-2 neurons are already silenced). Moreover, stronger stimulation of pC1 and pC2-d may be required to excite pCd-2 and Lgr3, respectively, in mated females. Such mating status-dependent change in neural function can provide strong support for their hypothesis. No difference between mated and virgin females, in contrast, suggests that the levels of post-mating inhibition are likely much weaker than the optogenetic manipulation, suggesting nuanced modulation by the Sex Peptide. Either result would be valuable for follow-up studies.</p><p>2) Provide evidence that R40F04-LexA indeed labels pC1a neurons, ideally by the overlap of expression with known pC1a split GAL4 lines. While the authors' argument that pC1a and pC2-a/b (labeled by the split GAL4s) are synaptically connected is convincing, the functional imaging experiment in Figure 5G, H is confounded by potential side effect by the activation of non-pC1 neurons (which are many, according to the image sample on FlyLight database). Since R40F04-LexA has not been previously used as a proxy of pC1a, a basic characterization of its expression pattern will help readers better interpret the data (along with its caveat).</p><p>In the discussion, I would like to suggest that authors better incorporate previous publications regarding the mating status-dependent changes in female feeding behaviors. For instance, Walker et al., Curr. Biol. (2015) showed that the SPSN-SAG axis controls both yeast and salt preference among mated females. This result is consistent with data in Steck et al., <italic>eLife</italic> (2018), which showed that the sensitivity of yeast-sensing GRNs remains unchanged after mating (similar to the sugar-sensing GRNs in this study). Discussions on whether pCd-2 also controls increased intake of these compounds can inspire readers in the field. Also, Hussain et al., PLoS Biol. (2016) showed that GRNs' sensitivity to polyamine is increased after mating, in contrast to the relatively stable sensitivity of sensory neurons shown in both this manuscript and Steck et al. Mating may exert its effect on different behaviors or sensory modalities in a distinct manner, which is worth mentioning given the Sex Peptide has received intense (and potentially outsized) attention in the context of mating-dependent behavioral changes. Without due discussion of these previous studies, the authors' assertion that the current study &quot;examine(d) neural mechanisms for appetitive changed in mated females&quot; (line 52) may appear premature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the major claims of this paper are interesting, important, and well-supported by the data. I would just note a few caveats:</p><p>1. The authors do not perform silencing of Lgr3+ mBNs to show that they're required for increased feeding in mated females. This would be important to demonstrate whether these cells really have a key role in this post-mating change. Similarly, the role of pCd-2 neurons was shown through silencing in virgins to mimic mating; their role could be strengthened by activating them in mated females and showing a decrease in feeding.</p><p>2. It has not been shown that the function of Lgr3/Dilp8 in regulating feeding occurs in the same median bundle cells that are affected by mating. This could be tested by knocking down Lgr3 specifically in these cells. Without this data, the major claims of the paper are still supported but the notion that the same cells integrate hunger and mating signals is somewhat speculative.</p><p>3. Since a major implication of this paper is that mating and hunger signals converge on the same cells and may thus interact, it is important for the authors to be clear about whether virgin and mated females are being compared in the fed or starved state. Does mating affect feeding in just one of these states, or in both states? The authors may have the data to answer this question (e.g. I think the FLIC assays were performed in starved flies and the CAFE assays were performed in fed flies), but it is not discussed in the paper.</p><p>4. A critical piece of this story is to know that the &quot;Lgr3+&quot; mBNs that are being manipulated actually express Lgr3. This is not obvious or explicitly discussed, but it seems that co-expression of the driver lines used here with an Lgr3 line may have been performed in a previous study (Meissner et al., 2016). The authors should clarify this and be explicit about what proportion of Lgr3+ mBNs they think they are targeting, and also what proportion of neurons they are targeting likely express Lgr3.</p><p>5. The picture of the &quot;off-target&quot; SAGb neuron in Figure 3 – —figure supplement 3A doesn't really look like its pictures in panel B of the same figure, where it is labeled by different driver lines; in fact the additional lines look more like SAG than SAGb. I am not sure how the authors know that these other driver lines are labeling the same neuron as the &quot;off-target&quot; neuron in the SAG-SS3 line.</p><p>6. The authors describe Lgr3 as a hunger signal and imply that it is independent of mating, but, interestingly, Lgr3 is only expressed in females. This implies that it is not a generic hunger signal but has some specialized role. (One of the cited papers, Yeom et al., mentions that Dilp8 is highly expressed in the female ovary.) The authors may want to speculate about why Lgr3 is sex-specific and not simply frame Lgr3 as a generic hunger signal.</p><p>In addition to the above comments there are some additional comments that should be addressed but, for the most part, are not central to the major claims of the paper.</p><p>1. Several comments related to the feeding assays:</p><p>a) It seems like the flies in your CAFE assay are consuming much less than in previous studies, which reported that female flies consume something on the order of 1 µl/day (e.g. Ja et al., 2007; Farhadian et al., 2012). Is there any explanation for why your flies are consuming much less? I know you're using 50 mM sucrose which is less than most other studies, but your FLIC data (Figure 1D) suggests that total consumption isn't highly dependent on concentration.</p><p>b) It seems strange that cumulative consumption over 6 hours is a straight line (Figure 1B). Given that these flies were starved, I would expect to see high consumption in the first hour that then decreases substantially. Also, feeding bouts are typically clustered in the morning and evening, and not distributed equally throughout the day. Any thoughts on this?</p><p>c) It seems strange that changing the sugar concentration more than 10-fold results in hardly any difference in feeding (Figure 1D-F). I might expect no difference if measuring over an entire day when homeostatic processes dominate over taste, but this is a 20 min assay. Also, the authors use the lack of difference in bout number between mated and virgin females as a justification for why feeding initiation (PER) is unlikely to be different. However, the bout number is also similar across sugar concentrations whereas PER is very different (at least for fed flies), which casts doubt on that logic.</p><p>2. The text states: &quot;Thus, like hungry flies (Itskov et al., 2014), mated females consume more by engaging in longer feeding times rather than by initiating more feeding events.&quot; This seems misleading since the paper by Itskov et al. shows a huge difference in the number of sips for fed and starved flies, whereas the sip duration did not differ (Figure 5C and 6E).</p><p>3. What was the rationale for focusing on pCd-2a and pCd-2b rather than pCd-2c?</p><p>4. In Figure 5 – Figure supplement 1, the driver lines seem to label a few cells other than pCd-2 (e.g. in the optic lobe, abdominal ganglion, or along the surface of the brain), so it seems strange that in most cases the male brains completely lack any expression, even of the non-pCd-2 neurons.</p><p>5. As noted in Point # 2 of the Public Review, I think that the data show a possible convergence of mating and hunger signals in the same cells, but it hasn't been shown definitively. Given this, I think the title is a bit speculative. I also think this sentence in the abstract is not really supported by the data: &quot;Together, this circuit transforms the mated signal into a long-term hunger signal.&quot;</p><p>6. A functional connection between SAG and pCd-2 neurons was not tested here. This is not critical, but it would be interesting to not only confirm this connection but to test how the co-activation of pC1 and SAG affects the pCd-2 neurons. This might hint at why the circuit evolved to have both pC1 and SAG connected to pCd-2 rather than just one or the other. If the authors have ideas on this they could speculate in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85117.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We appreciate the overall rigour and importance of this manuscript.

Our suggestion to the authors is to recapitulate the virgin circuit state in the mated females by activating pCd2 and/or silencing Lgr3+. Perhaps the authors have already done these manipulations, which should result in the suppression of sugar feeding – do they?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments presented in the manuscript show evidence that manipulating the activity of the mating status circuit (SPSNs-SAG-pC1), a mating status output neuron cell type (pCd2), and Lgr3+ MBNs in virgin females to mimic the mated state was sufficient to recapitulate the postmated behavior of increased sucrose consumption. However, an additional question of necessity was not originally investigated: are pCd-2 or Lgr3+ neurons necessary for this postmating response? We addressed this in two ways.</p><p>First, we activated pCd-2a and pCd-2b in mated females, mimicking the virgin state, and found that activating pCd-2a (but not pCd-2b) significantly reduces sugar intake recapitulating the virgin phenotype in a mated female (Figure 5 figure supplement 4). This line was added to the manuscript (Line 209-217):</p><p>“Next, we activated pCd-2a or pCd-2b in a mated female to mimic the virgin state to test if this cell type is necessary for the postmated increase in sugar intake. We found that mated females with pCd-2a artificially activated significantly reduced sugar intake compared to controls, recapitulating the virgin phenotype in mated females (Figure 5 —figure supplement 4). However, mated females with pCd-2b artificially activated did not differ from controls (Figure 5 —figure supplement 4), which may be a reflection of the few number of synapses from SAG and pC1 (Figure 5A).”</p><p>Second, we set out to silence Lgr3+ MBNs in mated females, mimicking the virgin state. We were not able to acutely silence via optogenetics for 2 reasons. First, we are not aware that the line UAS&gt;stop&gt;GtACR1 exists. Second, we were not able to use R19B09-gal4 (the line we used to access Lgr3 MBNs) with UAS-GtACR1 as this GAL4 line also labels neurons in the SEZ (Liao and Nässel, Front Endocrinol, 2020), which would make interpretation of these results impossible. We then used a constitutive silencer with an intersectional method (UAS&gt;stop&gt;KIR with R19B09-gal4 and Fru-gal4). We found that virgin and mated females with Lgr3+ MBNs silenced did not differ in sucrose consumption suggesting that the mating status circuit activates these neurons after mating to induce sucrose feeding. However, one of the control lines also failed to show this increase making these results difficult to interpret.

We include a paragraph in the discussion on this topic: “Although mating status impinges on circuits that either process nutrient sensing signals or regulate feeding circuits, there is no shared circuit yet identified for elevated nutrient intake of sugar and yeast in mated females. Beyond the three-tier mating status circuit, no overlap between areas of the brain modulating postmated increases in protein (Liu et al. 2017, Münch et al. 2022) and sugar consumption (this manuscript) have been found. It remains to be elucidated whether the circuit described here specifically modulates post-mating changes in sucrose consumption or whether it impacts the intake of other nutrients, including protein and salt.” (Line 315-321).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have 3 recommendations on the current manuscript, 2 on an experiment, and 1 on the discussion.</p><p>Regarding the experiment:</p><p>1) any evidence that functions of pCd-2 and Lgr3 neurons are under influence of mating status will greatly strengthen the authors' conclusion that their role is to promote sucrose consumption after mating. Since direct measurement of baseline neuronal activities in pCd-2 and Lgr3 neurons is likely difficult in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, one possible experiment is to test both the function (Figure 5I, J; Figure 6G) and/or the strength of the neural connection (Figure 5G, H; Figure 6D, E) is mating status-dependent. Currently, these experiments were performed only in virgin females. If the authors' model is correct (which I think is very likely), activation of pCd-2 (or their upstreams) should suppress sucrose consumption in mated females, but (at least) less so in virgin females (in which pCd-2 neurons are expected to be already active). In contrast, the inhibition of pCd-2 neurons may not change the sucrose consumption in mated females (in which pCd-2 neurons are already silenced). Moreover, stronger stimulation of pC1 and pC2-d may be required to excite pCd-2 and Lgr3, respectively, in mated females. Such mating status-dependent change in neural function can provide strong support for their hypothesis. No difference between mated and virgin females, in contrast, suggests that the levels of post-mating inhibition are likely much weaker than the optogenetic manipulation, suggesting nuanced modulation by the Sex Peptide. Either result would be valuable for follow-up studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up two points addressed in the Essential Revisions (#2 and #3).</p><p>Wwe activated pCd-2a and pCd-2b in mated females, mimicking the virgin state, and found that activating pCd-2a (but not pCd-2b) significantly reduces sugar intake recapitulating the virgin phenotype in a mated female (Figure 5 figure supplement 4).

For instance, Walker et al., Curr. Biol. (2015) showed that the SPSN-SAG axis controls both yeast and salt preference among mated females. This result is consistent with data in Steck et al., eLife (2018), which showed that the sensitivity of yeast-sensing GRNs remains unchanged after mating (similar to the sugar-sensing GRNs in this study). Discussions on whether pCd-2 also controls increased intake of these compounds can inspire readers in the field. Also, Hussain et al., PLoS Biol. (2016) showed that GRNs' sensitivity to polyamine is increased after mating, in contrast to the relatively stable sensitivity of sensory neurons shown in both this manuscript and Steck et al. Mating may exert its effect on different behaviors or sensory modalities in a distinct manner, which is worth mentioning given the Sex Peptide has received intense (and potentially outsized) attention in the context of mating-dependent behavioral changes. Without due discussion of these previous studies, the authors' assertion that the current study &quot;examine(d) neural mechanisms for appetitive changed in mated females&quot; (line 52) may appear premature.</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed in Essential Revisions #1, we agree with the reviewers that our findings should be discussed in more detail within the context of what is already established in the field.

It has not been shown that the function of Lgr3/Dilp8 in regulating feeding occurs in the same median bundle cells that are affected by mating.

Since a major implication of this paper is that mating and hunger signals converge on the same cells and may thus interact, it is important for the authors to be clear about whether virgin and mated females are being compared in the fed or starved state. Does mating affect feeding in just one of these states, or in both states? The authors may have the data to answer this question (e.g. I think the FLIC assays were performed in starved flies and the CAFE assays were performed in fed flies), but it is not discussed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>FLIC assays were performed on starved flies as they are shorter in length (20 minutes or 4 hours) compared to CAFE assays which are 24 hours. Starvation is done with shorter assays to encourage the flies to consume and is not required in longer assays as they have more time to exhibit feeding behavior. The behavioral assays are described in the Methods (Line 343-375).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A critical piece of this story is to know that the &quot;Lgr3+&quot; mBNs that are being manipulated actually express Lgr3. This is not obvious or explicitly discussed, but it seems that co-expression of the driver lines used here with an Lgr3 line may have been performed in a previous study (Meissner et al., 2016). The authors should clarify this and be explicit about what proportion of Lgr3+ mBNs they think they are targeting, and also what proportion of neurons they are targeting likely express Lgr3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that transparency regarding the rationale for using R19B09 driver lines to label the Lgr3+ neurons is important.

The picture of the &quot;off-target&quot; SAGb neuron in Figure 3 – —figure supplement 3A doesn't really look like its pictures in panel B of the same figure, where it is labeled by different driver lines; in fact the additional lines look more like SAG than SAGb.

And we modified Figure 3 —figure supplement 3 to showcase these morphological characteristics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors describe Lgr3 as a hunger signal and imply that it is independent of mating, but, interestingly, Lgr3 is only expressed in females. This implies that it is not a generic hunger signal but has some specialized role. (One of the cited papers, Yeom et al., mentions that Dilp8 is highly expressed in the female ovary.) The authors may want to speculate about why Lgr3 is sex-specific and not simply frame Lgr3 as a generic hunger signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the text to better represent that Lgr3 is not female specific but sexually dimorphic and expressed in fruitless expressing neurons, poised be involved in female specific behavior. The text now reads: “Lgr3 expression is sexually dimorphic, with a greater number of cells in the central brain and abdominal ganglia of females (Meissner et al. 2016), consistent with a role in female behavior” (LINE 227-229).</p><p>Lgr3 is not exclusively expressed females. Instead, there are more Lgr3+ neurons in females than in males (Meissner et al. 2016). Moreover, Dilp8 and Lgr3 influence feeding regulation in males (Yeom et al. 2021). Together, this indicates that there is not likely a sexually dimorphic function of this system. However, it is likely that the additional Lgr3+ fru+ MBNs in the female function to modulate feeding behavior via mating status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the above comments there are some additional comments that should be addressed but, for the most part, are not central to the major claims of the paper.</p><p>1. Several comments related to the feeding assays:</p><p>a) It seems like the flies in your CAFE assay are consuming much less than in previous studies, which reported that female flies consume something on the order of 1 µl/day (e.g. Ja et al., 2007; Farhadian et al., 2012). Is there any explanation for why your flies are consuming much less? I know you're using 50 mM sucrose which is less than most other studies, but your FLIC data (Figure 1D) suggests that total consumption isn't highly dependent on concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that flies consumed more in Ja et al. 2007. There were multiple differences between our methods: they used only males, they included yeast in their liquid food, and their flies were habituated to the assay for 24 hours before the measurements started. Any one of these could have contributed to the differences in total amount consumed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It seems strange that cumulative consumption over 6 hours is a straight line (Figure 1B). Given that these flies were starved, I would expect to see high consumption in the first hour that then decreases substantially. Also, feeding bouts are typically clustered in the morning and evening, and not distributed equally throughout the day. Any thoughts on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that normal feeding behavior occurs at dawn and dusk. However, these flies were starved and then placed into a new environment (FLIC assay). We believe that given 24 hours, they would have habituated to the environment and likely would have settled back into their typical circadian rhythm of feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It seems strange that changing the sugar concentration more than 10-fold results in hardly any difference in feeding (Figure 1D-F). I might expect no difference if measuring over an entire day when homeostatic processes dominate over taste, but this is a 20 min assay. Also, the authors use the lack of difference in bout number between mated and virgin females as a justification for why feeding initiation (PER) is unlikely to be different. However, the bout number is also similar across sugar concentrations whereas PER is very different (at least for fed flies), which casts doubt on that logic.</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that 20 minutes is not enough time capture the differences between concentrations given the amount of noise in the data. With longer assay duration and higher n, it is possible that we would see a more homeostatic process where flies consume less when exposed to the higher concentrations of sugar compared to those exposed to the lower concentrations.</p><p>What is clear and consistent from the data is that mated females consume more than virgins and that they do so via longer drinking bouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The text states: &quot;Thus, like hungry flies (Itskov et al., 2014), mated females consume more by engaging in longer feeding times rather than by initiating more feeding events.&quot; This seems misleading since the paper by Itskov et al. shows a huge difference in the number of sips for fed and starved flies, whereas the sip duration did not differ (Figure 5C and 6E).</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence was modified: “Thus, mated females consume more by engaging in longer feeding times rather than by initiating more feeding events.” (LINE 96-98).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. What was the rationale for focusing on pCd-2a and pCd-2b rather than pCd-2c?</p></disp-quote><p>We prioritized making split-GAL4 lines for pCd2-a and pCd-2b since they have a greater number of synaptic connections with upstream SAG and pC1 and well as downstream (see Figure 5A and Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 5 – Figure supplement 1, the driver lines seem to label a few cells other than pCd-2 (e.g. in the optic lobe, abdominal ganglion, or along the surface of the brain), so it seems strange that in most cases the male brains completely lack any expression, even of the non-pCd-2 neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>The labeling on the optic lobe and the surface of the brain is not to neurons but nonspecific binding to retinal tissue.

As noted in Point # 2 of the Public Review, I think that the data show a possible convergence of mating and hunger signals in the same cells, but it hasn't been shown definitively.

This is not critical, but it would be interesting to not only confirm this connection but to test how the co-activation of pC1 and SAG affects the pCd-2 neurons.
