Here, using single-molecule localization microscopy, we show that disease-inducing Huntingtin (mHtt) protein fragments display three distinct dynamic states in living cells – 1) fast diffusion, 2) dynamic clustering and 3) stable aggregation. Large, stable aggregates of mHtt exclude chromatin and form 'sticky' decoy traps that impede target search processes of key regulators involved in neurological disorders. Functional domain mapping based on super-resolution imaging reveals an unexpected role of aromatic amino acids in promoting protein-mHtt aggregate interactions. Genome-wide expression analysis and numerical simulation experiments suggest mHtt aggregates reduce transcription factor target site sampling frequency and impair critical gene expression programs in striatal neurons. Together, our results provide insights into how mHtt dynamically forms aggregates and disrupts the finely-balanced gene control mechanisms in neuronal cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17056.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17056.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17056.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Huntington's disease belongs to a group of human genetic disorders in which faulty proteins cause nerve cells to progressively die. All proteins are made from building blocks called amino acids, and these diseases are collectively called PolyQ expansion diseases because the faulty proteins usually have an abnormally long stretch that contains many repeats of an amino acid called glutamine. The stretches of glutamines make these mutant proteins stick to each other, which means that they aggregate in the diseased cells.</p><p>Researchers have proposed several mechanisms to explain how aggregates of one such mutant protein, called mutant Huntingtin (mHtt), might contribute to Huntington's disease. One possibility is that mHtt accumulates in the nucleus of the cell – which houses most of the cell’s DNA – and interferes with the proteins that are required to switch genes on or off. Preventing these gene regulatory proteins from carrying out their role could disrupt the normal pattern of gene activity. However, working out if this is the case would require researchers being able to follow how mHtt forms aggregates and interferes with normal processes in living cells.</p><p>Li et al. have now used high-resolution, high-speed microscopy to directly track the movement of individual mHtt proteins in living mouse cells in real time. The analysis showed that PolyQ protein fragments of mHtt behaved in three distinct ways – they diffused, briefly clustered or stably aggregated. Large stable aggregates of mHtt created decoy-like traps that interfered with the behavior of the gene regulatory proteins. Using computer-aided simulations, Li et al. then showed that that these molecular traps make the proteins take much longer to find their true target genes. Further studies in nerve cells suggested that this phenomenon disrupted the normal pattern of gene activity.</p><p>Next, Li et al. also used the live cell imaging system to look at which gene regulatory proteins were sequestered in the mHtt aggregates. This approach identified proteins that are important regulators involved in a number of neurological disorders. These proteins included some with long stretches of glutamines and unexpectedly others in which the glutamines were interspersed with other amino acids. Aggregates of mHtt therefore appear to affect a much broader range of proteins than previously thought. Together, the results provide insight into how mHtt forms aggregates and disrupts the finely balanced mechanisms that control gene activity in nerve cells. Future studies could explore the general principles that determine which proteins interact with mHtt aggregates. This could help reveal the faulty processes that underlie Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17056.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17056.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>huntingtin aggregates</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dong</given-names></name><name><surname>Legant</surname><given-names>Wesley R</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimm</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavis</surname><given-names>Luke D</given-names></name><name><surname>Betzig</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live imaging captures dynamics of Huntingtin aggregates plaguing the genome and waylaying target search.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Poly-glutamine (PolyQ) expansion in proteins is associated with multiple neuro- and muscle- degenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease (HD), X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and various spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mohan et al., 2014</xref>]). In HD, a single mutant <italic>Huntingtin</italic> allele with PolyQ tracts greater than 37 glutamines leads to selective cell death in the striatum and certain regions of the cortex, causing muscle coordination and cognitive defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Group, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>). It has been widely observed that extended PolyQ tracts facilitate the formation of protein aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus of diseased cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiFiglia et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Previous FRAP, FCS and in vitro super-resolution imaging provides significant insights into mHtt aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sahl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wustner et al., 2012</xref>). However, the dynamics of aggregate formation or how the resulting 'plaques' might influence essential molecular transactions that disrupt gene expression programs have not been investigated at the single-molecule level in living cells.</p><p>Since the original discovery of mHtt aggregates in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HD cells, the relevance of these aggregates or plaques to disease pathology has been under vigorous debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiFiglia et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scherzinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woerner et al., 2016</xref>). Currently, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how mHtt aggregates might contribute to disease states. Interestingly, it was shown that the formation of PolyQ aggregates can in some instances, protect cells from apoptosis in short-term cell culture experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saudou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). Specifically, it was proposed that soluble fragments or oligomers of mHtt are more toxic than mHtt aggregates. Stable self-aggregation of mHtt monomers was postulated to neutralize prion protein interacting surfaces and protect cells from prion induced damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrasate et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saudou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Slow et al., 2005</xref>). However, this model does not address the long-term effect of mhtt aggregates in striatal cells nor does it exonerate mHtt aggregates from potentially contributing to the disease state. For example, myriad studies have reported the toxicity of aggregates in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michalik and Van Broeckhoven, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Williams and Paulson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woerner et al., 2016</xref>). Without methods to directly observe and measure biochemical reactions and molecular interactions in living cells, it is challenging to gain mechanistic insights that may help resolve these controversies.</p><p>With recent advances in imaging and chemical dye development (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2015</xref>]), it has become possible to detect and track individual protein molecules in single living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gebhardt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hager et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mazza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). Decoding the complex behavior of single molecules enables us to measure molecular kinetics at a fundamental level that is often obscured in ensemble experiments. Specifically, the rapidly emerging high-resolution fast image acquisition platforms provide a means for visualizing and measuring the in vivo behavior of dynamically regulated molecular binding events. It also becomes possible to generate 3D molecular interaction maps in living mammalian cells and elucidate local diffusion patterns in the highly heterogeneous sub-cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, using HD as the model, we devised a molecular imaging system to quantify the formation of protein structures and measure the real-time dynamics and behavior of PolyQ-rich proteins. First, with live-cell PALM and FRAP experiments, we compared gross structures and diffusion dynamics of wild-type (Htt-25Q) versus disease-inducing mutant (mHtt-94Q) Htt protein fragments. Interestingly, soluble fractions of wild-type Htt-25Q and mutant Htt-94Q display similar rapid diffusion kinetics. Strikingly, both Htt-25Q and mHtt-94Q protein fragments also form small, diffraction-limited clusters in live cells. These clusters are highly dynamic and resolve quickly (mean lifetime &lt; 10~20 s). However, the mutant Htt-94Q protein also forms much larger highly stable aggregates (FRAP recovery lifetime &gt; 45 min). Two-color super resolution imaging reveals that mHtt aggregates exclude chromatin and selectively interact with a set of neurological disease-related factors (Foxp2, TBP, Sp1 <italic>and</italic> wild-type Huntingtin). Fine domain mapping experiments suggest that continuous PolyQ tracts contribute to but are not necessary for binding to mHtt aggregates. Notably, we found that aromatic amino acids enabled proteins with sparse glutamines to bind mHtt aggregates. Single-molecule tracking and numerical simulation experiments suggest that mHtt aggregates act as large decoy traps in the cell, efficiently slowing down target search kinetics and decreasing target site sampling frequencies. Consistent with this model, unbiased genomic screens showed that elevating Sp1 levels in HD-affected striatal cells partially restored the expression of Sp1 dependent target genes. Sp1 target site occupancies are also significantly decreased in HD-affected cells. These findings provide new insights into potential Huntington’s disease mechanisms and reveal the role of mHtt aggregates in disrupting key dynamic biological processes in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Live-cell Htt dynamics</title><p>To establish a cellular imaging system for HD and evaluate the effects of PolyQ expansion on Htt protein dynamics, we fused disease-inducing Huntingtin protein exon 1 fragment (mHtt-94Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rubinsztein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>) and its wild-type counterpart (Htt-25Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krobitsch and Lindquist, 2000</xref>) to a monomeric photo-switchable protein (mEOS3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); w/o nuclear localization signal - NLS). We stably expressed each fragment in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells or STH<italic>dh</italic> striatal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trettel et al., 2000</xref>). Epi-fluorescence live imaging revealed that 8~15% of the mHtt-94Q cells (27 of 234 cells) contain large visible sub-cellular aggregates while the majority (123 of 125 cells) of Htt-25Q cells show a relatively homogeneous intracellular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To measure Htt protein dynamics, we next performed live-cell imaging experiments by stochastically switching the mEOS3.2 moiety to the red-shifted state and tracking single-molecule movement of the activated molecules (sptPALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manley et al., 2008</xref>). This technique allowed us to generate high-density single-molecule trajectories separated by stochastic activation times. As expected, ensemble whole-cell diffusion and velocity analysis reveals that a much larger fraction of mHtt-94Q molecules show slower and more compact diffusion kinetics compared to Htt-25Q controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), suggesting that mHtt-94Q is on average significantly less mobile. High-density trajectories generated with sptPALM also allows reconstruction of high-resolution sub-cellular diffusion maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle and bottom panels). Interestingly, both mean square displacement (MSD) and Bayesian inference-based diffusion maps show that the slow mHtt-94Q species were mainly concentrated around aggregates, while mHtt-94Q molecules in other regions remain fast moving. Consistent with these observations, fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) experiments within non-aggregate containing regions show full recoveries within 1 <italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>), confirming that a portion of mHtt-94Q molecules can remain in a mobile, dynamic, and soluble state. These results are consistent with previous FRAP and FCS experiments showing fast diffusing and aggregate states of mHtt protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wustner et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17056.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>mHtt protein displays three distinct states in living cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, localization map of live-cell PALM data set for the indicated Htt fragment.

These very small clusters are below the diffraction-limit (50~100 nm) and cannot be adequately resolved by conventional imaging methods. Temporal localization history and sliding window analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref> ) suggest that protein molecules in these clusters display relatively fast association/dissociation dynamics. Specifically, time-counting PALM analysis (tcPALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cisse et al., 2013</xref>) reveal that these small clusters form in temporal bursts (~10–20 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while localization detections in control regions with similar molecular densities show no such apparent bursting behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Localization maps for mHtt-94Q cells are more complex. Both small clusters and large aggregates can be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Interestingly, localization detections in small mHtt-94Q clusters display similar bursting kinetics as Htt-25Q clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). By contrast, the localizations of large mHtt-94Q aggregates distribute relatively evenly over time, suggesting a much greater structural stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). Consistent with this observation, FRAP experiments over longer time-scales found little molecular exchange occurring at large mHtt-94Q aggregates (FRAP recovery lifetime &gt; 45 min, See Materials and methods for calculation details) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that there are likely at least three distinct states for Htt proteins in living cells: 1) rapidly diffusing, 2) short-lived dynamic clustering and 3) very stable aggregates formed only by the Gln-expanded mutant protein but not the wild-type Htt. It is likely that PolyQ expansion tilts the kinetic balance of mHtt from a dynamic clustering state to an aggregated state, akin to recently described protein dynamic polymer/phase transitions associated with ALS/FTD neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>).

Although altered chromatin structures have been reported in diseased cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia et al., 2011</xref>), ultra-fine chromatin structure and genome organization have not been extensively investigated. To address this, we labeled chromatin by stably expressing H2B-HaloTag in the mHtt-94Q cells. To avoid biases introduced by individual imaging techniques, we imaged the samples with two-color 3D live-cell structured illumination imaging, Airyscan imaging and single-molecule localization microscopy. All these experiments showed consistent results that intensities of H2B staining were dramatically depleted in regions of mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>), suggesting that these 'inclusion bodies' likely exclude chromatin. We note here that the size and shape of mHtt aggregates varies significantly in the cell. Thus, to quantify exclusion or recruitment by mHtt aggregates in an unbiased manner, we used a size-normalized, averaging based analysis method. Briefly, we rescale each mHtt-aggregate containing region to have a diameter of 100 pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Then, an intensity map was generated by averaging multiple mHtt aggregate regions obtained across different cells. The center-to-peripheral radial grayscale intensity curve is then calculated by each circular pixel increment for both channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). For molecular structures (such as H2B) that are excluded by mHtt aggregates, the intensity curve resembles the mirror-image of the curve for for mHtt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">supplement 1B and C</xref>).

Since Htt is widely expressed in different tissues in the body, it remains largely unclear how mutant Htt causes selective cell death in striatal neuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strong et al., 1993</xref>). Interestingly, it was shown that long PolyQ tract containing proteins such as wild-type Htt and TATA box binding protein (TBP) are trapped in the mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). To test whether we could recapitulate these results in our live cell imaging system, we expressed WT Htt-25Q-HaloTag exon 1 fragment in cells with mHtt aggregates. Indeed, Htt-25Q protein becomes significantly sequestered in the mHtt aggregates in both ES cells and STH striatal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most interestingly, Foxp2 is a striatum-specific transcription factor shown to be important for speech evolution, motor learning and neural system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Groszer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>).

Intriguingly, in humanized Foxp2 mice, the medium spiny neurons in the striatum display increased dendrite lengths and increased synaptic plasticity, suggesting that Foxp2 is important for the development of cortico-basal ganglia circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enard et al., 2009</xref>). These neural circuits are specifically affected in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrante et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Slow et al., 2003</xref>). We found that for the full length Foxp2, the N-terminal PolyQ containing fragment but not the C-terminal DNA binding domain strongly interacts with mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that recruitment of these factors to mHtt aggregates likely involve PolyQ containing domains and thus, cellular functions mediated by these important transcription factors are also likely affected by the presence of mHtt aggregates. Because of the critical role of Foxp2 in HD-affected brain region and function, our findings also pose an intriguing possibility that Foxp2 might be one of the essential effectors responsible for the selective effects of HD on striatal neural circuits (See <italic>DISCUSSION</italic> for details).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Aromatic amino acids are required for Sp1:mHtt aggregate interactions</title><p>Although our recent unbiased screen for long continuous PolyQ tract containing transcription factors did not identify the sparsely Q-rich human TF Sp1, multiple studies had previously implicated the importance of this regulatory protein in HD. Interestingly, early studies showed that over expression of Sp1 and TAF4 (one of its co-activators) can partly rescue mutant Htt induced gene expression defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunah et al., 2002</xref>), and polyQ mHtt fragments inhibit Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhai et al., 2005</xref>). These results suggested that Sp1 might also interact with mHtt protein aggregates in living cells. To test this directly, we performed live-cell 3D Structured Illumination imaging experiments. Interestingly, we observed substantial Sp1 binding even to cytoplasmic mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Live-cell single-molecule tracking revealed that Sp1 directly binds to mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>) and that full length Sp1 is selectively enriched in mHtt aggregate regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results are somewhat surprising, because although Sp1 is enriched for Q’s, there are no obvious continuous PolyQ tracts in the Sp1 protein sequence. To probe the amino acid sequences of Sp1 responsible for this interaction, we first separated the N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) (1–615aa) from the C-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) (616–781aa). The Sp1 N-terminal TAD showed strong interactions with mHtt aggregates while the C-terminal DBD was excluded from mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). To further narrow down the interaction domain, we performed a series of truncation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and identified a 50aa Sp1 fragment (166–215) with 14Q’s that retained the interaction with mHtt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Tethering this fragment to HaloTag allowed us to monitor its selective recruitment to mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). Surprisingly, a control fragment from Sp1 (363 - 412aa) also enriched for glutamines (18Q’s) failed to interact with mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Sequence gazing revealed that the only apparent difference between these two Q-rich fragments is the presence of three aromatic amino acids interspersed among the 14Qs of Sp1 (166–215aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Mutation of these three aromatic amino acids (Y, F, F) to A or even Q severely impaired the ability of the fragment to interact with mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). More interestingly, converting three amino acids in the non-interacting Q-rich Sp1 (363 - 412aa) fragment to phenylalanine (F) animated this fragment to bind mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). These results suggest that interspersed aromatic amino acids are likely critical for Sp1 to interact with mHtt aggregates while stretches of PolyQ rich regions are not sufficient and long contiguous PolyQ tracts may not be necessary for mHtt aggregate interactions. Our results indicate that mHtt aggregates display a remarkable degree of sequence or structural specificity as many protein fragments, even some with Q-rich patches fail to interact and become trapped by the large rafts of mHtt protein, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajan et al., 2001</xref>). Instead, only certain proteins with specific Q-rich properties such as the presence of interspersed aromatic moieties were found to be retained in the live cell context. Nevertheless, we expect that more complicated and perhaps even some more promiscuous protein features may govern protein:mHtt aggregate interactions. We also anticipate that a broader spectrum of proteins than we have sampled can become trapped and thus affected by mHtt aggregates in different cell-types or cellular contexts. Indeed, previous studies suggest that other transcription factors without long continuous PolyQ stretches such as CBP and TAF4 are likely also sequestered in mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunah et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nucifora et al., 2001</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17056.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Single-molecule imaging of Sp1 binding to mHtt aggregates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-molecule imaging of cytoplasmic Sp1-mHtt aggregate interaction Top, Epi-fluorescence images of JF549-HaloTag-Sp1 (red) and mHtt-94Q-CFP (green) before single-molecule imaging Middle, 2D molecular interaction map of Sp1 binding to mHtt aggregates.

Previously, we demonstrated that key transcription factor (TF) target search processes in the cell are dominated by non-specific highly transient transactions with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). One model for HD to affect gene regulation is to imagine that mHtt aggregates form large molecular traps in certain cells. Such a scenario would dramatically increase non-specific trial-and-error sampling by TFs before they reach cognate target sites. To quantitatively evaluate how various parameters (volume, number and size) of mHtt aggregates might affect the target search process, we next performed numerical simulation experiments (See Materials and methods for details). Briefly, we inject a TF into a random position in the nucleus in silico. We assumed that TFs navigate the nucleus via 3D random walk and that the nucleus contains both <italic>bona fide</italic> target sites and mHtt aggregates of various sizes and numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>, See Details in Materials and methods). In the simulation, TF movement is slowed down within the mHtt aggregates as suggested by our SPT experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Next, we recorded the average search time for the TF to reach a target site for the first time and found that the search time inversely correlated with the volume ratio of aggregates to the nucleus (VR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Strikingly, merely adding aggregates equivalent to ~5% of the total nuclear volume slows down the TF target search process by ~20 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, with a fixed total volume, smaller aggregates more efficiently slow down the target search process, suggesting that merging small aggregates to larger ones might reduce the detrimental effects on target search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with the previous report on the protective effects of larger aggregates in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saudou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the target search process of transcription factors and wild-type Htt protein are actually influenced by mHtt aggregates in live cells, we perform SPT experiments on Sp1, Foxp2 and Wt Htt protein. For these three factors, we were able to directly visualize the trapping effects of mHtt aggregates at the single molecule level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref>). Specifically, diffusion coefficients of these factors become dramatically reduced within mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating binding and longer residence times in these areas. The fraction of slowly diffusing molecules of Sp1, Foxp2 and Wt Htt all become substantially elevated in cells containing mHtt aggregates compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>), consistent with an increased number of non-productive binding events due to greater numbers of decoy non-specific binding sites in the cell. Thus, these direct SMT results support the model that mHtt aggregates form large sticky traps, waylaying the target search process and reducing the cognate target site sampling frequency (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equations 1–7</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17056.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>mHtt aggregates effectively slow down target search processes in living cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-molecule tracking of Foxp2 in mHtt aggregate positive (upper) and negative cells (lower).The resulting single-molecule trajectories are color-coded using the diffusion coefficient calculated by the linear regression of the MSD curve with a <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> &gt; 0.9. 6000 trajectories are shown for the Htt aggregate positive cells (upper). 2000 trajectories for the mHtt aggregate negative cell (lower).

To do so, we first performed differential gene expression (mRNA-seq) experiments on STH<italic>dh</italic> striatal cell lines derived from Wt (Q7/Q7), heterozygous (Q7/Q111) and homozygous (Q111/Q111) HD mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trettel et al., 2000</xref>).

To map Sp1 binding sites in the striatal cells, we generated an antigen-purified polyclonal Sp1 antibody for western blot, immuno-precipitation and cell staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, See Materials and methods for details of antibody generation and purification).

Most of these binding sites are tightly associated with transcription start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Strikingly, Sp1 binding sites are significantly enriched around Q111 dose-dependent down-regulated but not up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), suggesting that mHtt mostly likely influences Sp1 transcriptional activation of target genes. It’s likely that the Sp1 target site sampling frequency is reduced in HD affected cells and this could eventually lead to down regulation of the Sp1 target genes expression. Previously, we showed that tuning-up TF concentrations can increase target site sampling frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>) and thus, potentially counteract the Sp1 trapping effects caused by mHtt aggregates. To test this, we over-expressed HaloTag-Sp1 in STH<italic>dh</italic> Q111/Q111 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) and performed mRNA-seq experiments. A modest elevation (~ 2x) of Sp1 levels partly rescued 50 dose-dependent down-regulated Sp1 target genes, including Rnd1, Phlda1, Ier3 and Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

To further validate whether the Sp1 target sampling frequencies are reduced in Q111/Q111 cells, we performed Sp1 ChIP-qPCR experiments on Ier3 and Rnd1 promoter regions in Q7/Q7 and Q111/Q111 cells. Indeed, the enrichment of Sp1 ChIP-signals were dramatically reduced in Q111/Q111 cells compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Taken together, functional genomic and ChIP studies on the striatal cell culture system further reinforced the concept that mHtt aggregates likely slow down TF target search processes and reduce the target sampling frequencies that can subsequently lead to altered gene expression programs in diseased cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17056.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of Htt aggregates affecting TF dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sp1 target site occupancies in Q7/Q7 and Q111/Q111 cells assayed by ChIP-qPCR.

With an abundance of these decoy sites snagging TFs in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, target searching by transcription factors must undergo many more trials and nonproductive collisions before reaching their designated cognate binding sites to activate the expression of essential genes. Our simulation experiments determined that these large molecular traps greatly increased target search times and reduced target site sampling. In addition, if TF molecules become permanently incorporated into mHtt aggregates, this would effectively lead to the reduction in copy number of actively searching TF molecules in the nucleus. Both mechanisms would inevitably reduce the effective concentration of TFs in the cells and thus impair molecular kinetics associated with these factors (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equations 1–8</xref>). Consistent with this model, elevating concentrations of TFs such as Sp1 counteracts the Q111 induced gene expression changes in Htt mutant striatal cells. Our SMT experiments suggest that the biochemical reactions associated with Foxp2 and wild type Htt-25Q also become impaired by the same mechanism.</p><p>The observation that Foxp2 is recruited to mHtt aggregates via its TAD is particularly interesting, as Foxp2 is a critical factor for the cortical-basal ganglia circuits, which is the most affected brain region in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enard et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic studies suggest that disruption of Foxp2 function results in speech and language impairment, which is a common HD symptom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, it was also shown that cerebellar defects were observed in Foxp2 null mice, with Purkinje cells particularly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shu et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this observation, extensive studies suggest reduced Purkinje cell density in patients with HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jeste et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rees et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rub et al., 2013</xref>). Together, our findings strongly suggest that Foxp2 might be one of the essential effectors responsible for the selective disruption of specific neuronal cell populations in patients with HD.</p><p>Wild-type Htt has been reported to be involved with axon trafficking in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gauthier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strehlow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trushina et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic studies show that knockout of Htt induces certain HD phenotypes and overexpression of wild-type Htt rescues these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattaneo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gauthier et al., 2004</xref>), implying that dominant negative effects of mHtt on the wild type protein might contribute to the disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasir et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zeitlin et al., 1995</xref>). Here, we provided direct evidence to support this model, as the wild-type Htt-25Q fragment also becomes selectively trapped in mHtt aggregates. Together, our data suggest that disrupting the finely tuned molecular kinetics of key regulatory proteins by mHtt aggregates may represent an important common mechanism underlying HD and we speculate that other protein aggregate forming diseases may share a similar disease mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Links between transcriptional activation and mhtt aggregates</title><p>Early studies of classical enhancer binding proteins suggested that low-complexity peptides such as Q-rich domains are important for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courey et al., 1989</xref>). Detailed mutagenesis experiments revealed that in addition to Qs, hydrophobic amino acids within these Q-rich sequences are also critical for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gill et al., 1994</xref>). Remarkably here, our domain mapping and mutagenesis experiments found that the sequence motif in Sp1 responsible for mHtt aggregate binding is the exact same Sp1 TAD region A required for transcriptional activation. Consistent with our results, recent studies suggest that aromatic residues are essential for the formation of amyloid-like structures by low-complexity domains in RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in the future, it would be interesting to study how aromatic amino acids affect protein structure of low-complexity sequences. Do aromatic residues promote formation of beta-sheets and position sparse Qs in the right orientation to interact with Poly-Q aggregates? Another important message derived from this study is that continuous PolyQ tracts are not necessary for mHtt aggregate binding. Likely, a much broader spectrum of proteins with low-complexity sequences than we have studied are affected by the presence of mHtt aggregates in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Live-cell mHtt aggregate formation dynamics and low-complexity domain RNP aggregation</title><p>How PolyQ expansion affects the dynamic behavior of proteins with low-complexity domains in living cells has been difficult to study. Our live-cell, single-molecule PALM imaging experiments suggest that Htt proteins have at least 3 distinct states under physiological conditions of living cells. Specifically, wild-type Htt fragments display fast diffusing and dynamic clustering states, while mutant Htt fragments are also able to form more stable large aggregates in the cell. These findings are remarkably reminiscent of recent reports regarding the behavior of the low-complexity domain (LCD) containing RNA granule proteins (such as TDP-43, FUS, hnRNPA1). Most interestingly, low-complexity domains of TDP-43 and FUS are able to form reversible liquid droplet/polymer-like hydrogels in vitro and in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). As revealed by FRAP experiments, the protein in the droplet states is still quite dynamic (recovery time &lt; 1 min). However, ALS/FTD associated mutations make LCDs of TDP-43 and FUS prone to undergo phase transition to form irreversible hydrogels, impairing the RNP granule function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). Spatiotemporal information-rich live-cell PALM experiments allows us to investigate the temporal dynamics of different Htt states. The dynamic clustering phase of Htt protein has a lifetime of 10~20 s, forming clusters of sub-diffractive sizes. The clusters don’t grow further and they quickly disassemble, suggesting that the clustering phase is rapidly reversible and thus analogous to the reversible droplet/hydrogel phase of LCDs in RNPs.</p><p>In contrast, mHtt aggregates are much more stable with little dynamic exchange of molecules as seen in our long-term FRAP experiments, suggesting that mHtt aggregates may be more akin to irreversible polymeric-hydrogel states. It seems likely that PolyQ expansion in certain proteins promote the formation of irreversible phase transitions to the aggregated state overcoming the reversible dynamic clustering state. Although the underlying protein sequence requirements of various LCDs such as the Q-rich ones studied here may be quite different from other LCDs, our studies revealed a remarkable resemblance in protein dynamics associated with LCDs in RNPs and PolyQ expansion proteins. Mutations in both classes of LCDs cause severe neurodegenerative diseases. Recent structural studies suggest that beta-sheets are likely structural motifs underlying the formation of liquid droplets and hydrogel polymers for LCDs in RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). It would be interesting in future studies to determine whether similar structural motifs form the basis for PolyQ expansion induced protein aggregation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culturing</title><p>Mouse D3 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) ES cells were maintained on 0.1% gelatin coated plates in the absence of feeder cells.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Li et al. is quite nicely done and uses extensive intracellular and molecular imaging to track polyQ proteins/aggregates and associating molecules in cells. Additional experiments add lend quantitative mechanistic insight into the effect of polyQ aggregates on the activity of polyQ-binding TFs. The manuscript represents a very important step in that it moves boldly towards live-cell observations of molecular processes with likely high relevance to Huntington's Disease and possibly other misfolding pathologies. Bringing several methods – notably advanced imaging – to bear on the problem, the authors show data that imply that the more stable of the Huntington aggregates have a role in impeding (slowing down) the target search of a discrete palette of disease-related factors, along with quite a few more intriguing findings. This paper does a nice job of bridging several fields and brings together a diverse array of experimental evidence to support the story.</p><p>Although this manuscript contains an impressive amount of different elaborate experiments, it also is a problem that many of the experiments shown do not provide new mechanistic insights, but just add to already published work. The impact of super-resolution imaging is overplayed in places. For example, in Results, &quot;[…]below the diffraction limit (50~100 nm) and cannot be detected by conventional imaging.&quot; Super-resolution imaging helps with localization, not detection, which is a function of signal/noise/background levels. Each claim for the need of specialized imaging techniques in the manuscript should be carefully reviewed and described in the text to make it clear to which aspects of the measurements the special techniques contributed. The strongest part of this manuscript is the characterization of the interaction between mutant Htt and Sp1. While the interaction of mutant Htt and Sp1 and its effect on disrupting transcriptional activity are already known (Dunah et al. Science 2002, Li et al. MCB 2002), it is interesting to revisit these findings using more advanced methods. A stronger focus on this aspect and a more in-depth analysis of the data generated here would make this manuscript a stronger candidate for publication.</p><p>Overall, barring this reservation, the work is an important contribution and the manuscript can be revised to correct this issue and similarly clarify some experimental issues. Specifically, the authors need to revise the manuscript to address the following points. I note that additional experimentation is not expected; it would seem that the authors have the data at hand to address the technical points raised:</p><p>1) The authors need to more clearly identify which findings are entirely novel and which are confirmatory or add quantitative detail about previously studied phenomena. The manuscript should be organized so that initially the authors indicate what is known already (e.g., comparison of their results with the work of Lindquist, Elf, Berg, Kopito, and Moerner and others regarding polyQ interactions) and then they describe how their new methods, especially the super-resolution work adds to that pre-existing knowledge. Two relevant studies that merit mention by Li et al. in the context of their exciting demonstrated trapping effects caused by (nanoscale) mHtt aggregates are:</p><p>Rajan et al. Specificity in intracellular protein aggregation and inclusion body formation. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98(23), 13060-13065 (2001).</p><p>Sahl et al. Delayed emergence of subdiffraction-sized mutant huntingtin fibrils following inclusion body formation. Q. Rev. Biophys. (2015) doi:10.1017/S0033583515000219.</p><p>2) Regarding the biophysical model for TF search and the impact of aggregate-binding. The authors describe this impact in terms of the speed of TF diffusion being &quot;slowed&quot;. Particularly since the aggregates are shown to exclude chromatin, it may be more useful to describe the impact of aggregate-binding as reducing the &quot;copy number&quot; of TF molecules participating in search at any given moment. The &quot;copy number&quot; parameterization would have the further benefit of being more consistent with recent modeling efforts, e.g. the work of Johan Elf, Otto Berg, and colleagues.</p><p>3) Time-counting PALM analysis: The authors state in the third paragraph of the subsection “Live-cell Htt Dynamics” that localizations in so-called &quot;control regions&quot; (not further specified) are free of temporal bunching events which, wherever observed, are then interpreted to be indications of small cluster formation. The argument would be much strengthened by showing data on the signal of individual mEOS3.2 over time in cells, e.g., on the cytosolic-expressed FP mildly fixed so as to make it immobile. The FP presumably also shows blinking (?), and the timings of single-molecule signals (leading to localizations) are therefore a major factor that may confuse the unambiguous detection of any clustering, it would appear. How are (quite possibly sporadic/rare) photophysics/blinking effects (&quot;an FP just happens to give off many bursts in relatively quick succession&quot;, giving more weight to its presence in a particular location) discriminated from true local prolonged dwelling of a molecule? How were the &quot;control regions&quot; selected? What are the bounds/limits of asserting true clustering on the ~10–20 s scale? This section should be expanded.</p><p>4) Along somewhat similar lines, the authors should discuss if the argument of apparent diffusion coefficients (as inferred by MSD or Bayesian schemes) being low in the locations of the aggregates (as seen by epifluorescence or reflected in the localization map, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top row) is not a circular one. The authors write that &quot;the slow mHtt-94Q species were mainly concentrated around aggregates&quot; (subsection “Live-cell Htt Dynamics”, second paragraph). The trajectories in question stem from mHtt (with photoactivated FP) copies that may well be part of the aggregate itself, i.e. be properly incorporated. What is interpreted as the &quot;trajectory&quot; could just represent static localization precision with additional position noise from any not fully corrected cell (or microscope) motion. The authors should discuss this, and possibly weaken their statements if needed.</p><p>5) Some information on how many clear cases of Sp1 binding to large (or smaller) mHtt aggregates were observed (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) would be helpful to feel confident these are not just accidental observations, but specific interactions on the surface of the aggregate. Please add a statement about the frequency of observations of the type shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17056.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Although this manuscript contains an impressive amount of different elaborate experiments, it also is a problem that many of the experiments shown do not provide new mechanistic insights, but just add to already published work.

Following the reviewers’ suggestions, we updated our manuscript in the Results section to briefly discuss the advantage of each imaging techniques and why we choose to use a specific technique. To better justify the need of live-cell PALM, we change the sentence to &quot;…below the diffraction limit (50~100nm) and thus cannot be not adequately resolved by conventional imaging.&quot;</p><p>We agree with reviewers that extensive studies have already been performed to characterize huntingtin protein dynamics in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we aimed to contribute to this field by demonstrating that we can image and analyze the dynamics of huntingtin protein in living cells at the single molecule level. We are excited that some of our results are consistent with previous studies and further reinforce their models with independent methods. These are important control experiments showing the measurements performed by these new imaging tools are accurate and reliable.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is important to note that our integrated studies also reveal new insights into Htt aggregate formation and how the mHtt aggregates dynamically affect delicate gene network in live cells. For examples, here are some of our new findings (See more in the Discussion):</p><p>1) For the first time, we report the existence of a dynamic clustering state for both wild-type and mutant Htt fragment in live cells and at the same we report and the temporal kinetics of this dynamic clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>2) We demonstrate for the first time that Foxp2, a key striatum regulator, is dynamically trapped by mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>3) Sp1 domain mapping experiments reveal unexpected role of aromatic amino acids in promoting protein:mHtt aggregate interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>4) Coupling perturbation with genomic approaches, we systematically characterized how mHtt affects Sp1 mediated transcription programs in neurons. New candidate effector genes have been identified, such as Ier3, Phlda1 and Rnd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>1) The authors need to more clearly identify which findings are entirely novel and which are confirmatory or add quantitative detail about previously studied phenomena.

Specifically, in each Results section, we first cite previous reports and briefly describe what is known. At the end of the section, we summarize new findings. We thank reviewers for pointing out these two important studies. They are now cited in subsections “Aromatic Amino Acids are Required for Sp1:mHtt Aggregate Interactions” and at the end of the subsection “Live-cell Htt Dynamics” respectively.</p><p><italic>2) Regarding the biophysical model for TF search and the impact of aggregate-binding.

The &quot;copy number&quot; parameterization would have the further benefit of being more consistent with recent modeling efforts, e.g. the work of Johan Elf, Otto Berg, and colleagues.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewers that it is important to discuss both the “copy number” effect and the “target search” model. In the “copy number” model, TF molecules are permanently trapped in mHtt aggregates. This would lead to the reduction of concentrations of searching TF molecules (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mo>↓</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) in the nucleus. The effective association rate of TF molecules to DNA target sites (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) is thus decreased, according to the equation below:<disp-formula id="equ9"><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>↓</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mo>↓</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In the target search model, the surface of mHtt aggregates create a large number of non-specific sites in the cells. Thus, presumably even when the copy number of available searching TF (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) remains the same, the number of non-specific trial-and-error collision steps before the TF reach a cognate site will be dramatically increased (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>↓</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). As a result, the association rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) of the TF to specific targets will be decreased, according to the same equation:<disp-formula id="equ10"><mml:math id="m10"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>↓</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>↓</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Although the final come out of these two modes of action is the same, it is still important to note that their mechanistic origins are different. In this case, it is likely that both mechanisms play a role. We have emphasized the distinction between these two in the subsection “Mathematic Links between Number of Non-specific sites and Target Site Sampling Frequencies” as well as in the Discussion (the first paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Time-counting PALM analysis: The authors state in the third paragraph of the subsection “Live-cell Htt Dynamics” that localizations in so-called &quot;control regions&quot; (not further specified) are free of temporal bunching events which, wherever observed, are then interpreted to be indications of small cluster formation. The argument would be much strengthened by showing data on the signal of individual mEOS3.2 over time in cells, e.g., on the cytosolic-expressed FP mildly fixed so as to make it immobile.

How are (quite possibly sporadic/rare) photophysics/blinking effects (&quot;an FP just happens to give off many bursts in relatively quick succession&quot;, giving more weight to its presence in a particular location) discriminated from true local prolonged dwelling of a molecule? How were the &quot;control regions&quot; selected? What are the bounds/limits of asserting true clustering on the ~10-20sec scale? This section should be expanded.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that blinking kinetics of FPs would significantly affect the outcome of the time counting experiment, especially if the fluorophore blinks at similar time scales of imaging acquisition. It is reported that the fluorescent proteins such as mEOS used in PALM may display triplet blinking in the millisecond time range, therefore most often filtered out by a detector integration times larger than 10 ms (Annibale et al., 2011). Here we use a camera integration time of 20 ms to minimize the counting contribution from blinking. On a different note, the control regions were selected based on the criterion that no visible clusters were observed in these regions of the final reconstructed image. We have addressed these questions in detail in the updated Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>4) Along somewhat similar lines, the authors should discuss if the argument of apparent diffusion coefficients (as inferred by MSD or Bayesian schemes) being low in the locations of the aggregates (as seen by epifluorescence or reflected in the localization map, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top row) is not a circular one. The authors write that &quot;the slow mHtt-94Q species were mainly concentrated around aggregates&quot; (subsection “Live-cell Htt Dynamics”, second paragraph). The trajectories in question stem from mHtt (with photoactivated FP) copies that may well be part of the aggregate itself, i.e. be properly incorporated. What is interpreted as the &quot;trajectory&quot; could just represent static localization precision with additional position noise from any not fully corrected cell (or microscope) motion. The authors should discuss this, and possibly weaken their statements if needed.</italic> </p><p>Previously, we have performed single-molecule tracking with relatively immobile chromatin associated molecules such as H2B (Chen et al., 2014). The diffusion coefficients of H2B molecules are generally &lt; 0.1µm<sup>2</sup>/s, similar with what we observed here for mHtt-94Q in the aggregate region. The slow diffusion is likely contributed from cell motion rather than from microscope drift. Based on beads calibration, the xy drift under our imaging condition is &lt;10nm per hour. We have made this clear in the updated manuscript (subsection “Single-molecule Imaging”).</p><p><italic>5) Some information on how many clear cases of Sp1 binding to large (or smaller) mHtt aggregates were observed (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) would be helpful to feel confident these are not just accidental observations, but specific interactions on the surface of the aggregate. Please add a statement about the frequency of observations of the type shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for this helpful suggestion. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, total 215 (trajectories) Sp1 binding events have been detected on the surface of the aggregate. We have updated the information in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend).</p></body></sub-article></article>
