Although this process always involves the active dissociation of post-termination complexes (post-TCs), the molecular mechanism of recycling differs among the three domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Youngman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buskirk and Green, 2017</xref>). These differences are already evident in the termination step: in eukaryotes and archaea, termination is carried out by a complex containing both a release factor and a translational GTPase (eRF1 and eRF3 in eukaryotes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frolova et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkalaeva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saito et al., 2010</xref>). eRF1 remains in the ribosome after the release of the nascent peptide and helps recruit the factor that catalyzes subunit splitting, Rli1 (in yeast) or ABCE1 (in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pisarev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</xref>). The tRNA and small subunit are then released from the mRNA by 40S recycling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skabkin et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, although the bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 share similar names with their eukaryotic counterparts, they are evolutionarily unrelated and act alone to release the nascent peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scolnick et al., 1968</xref>). Removal of these factors by the translational GTPase RF3 clears the way for binding of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freistroffer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peske et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koutmou et al., 2014</xref>). In a mechanism unique to bacteria, RRF works together with the GTPase EFG to promote subunit splitting and release of the large subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janosi et al., 1996</xref>). Binding of IF3 then excludes the deacylated tRNA from the 30S subunit and prevents reassembly of the 70S complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prabhakar et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although the molecular mechanism of ribosome recycling has been worked out in great detail through biochemical and biophysical experiments for both bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirokawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prabhakar et al., 2017</xref>) and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pisarev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</xref>), the physiological role of ribosome recycling has been difficult to study at the global level in vivo. Recent studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> using ribosome profiling to study recycling factors in vivo revealed that depletion of the 80S recycling factor Rli1 results in an accumulation of ribosome density at stop codons, consistent with a build-up of post-TCs that fail to be recycled, and an associated queue of elongating ribosomes that collide with these post-TCs at defined distances upstream of stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young et al., 2015</xref>). These studies also reported abundant ribosome density in the 3′-UTR upon Rli1 knockdown. Some of this density can be attributed to translating ribosomes that re-initiated downstream of the stop codon, although the mechanism of this re-initiation is yet to be elucidated. In a later study, Guydosh and co-workers depleted the 40S recycling factors Tma64/Tma22/Tma20, again observing stacked ribosomes upstream of the stop codon and re-initiation arising from 40S scanning ribosomes in the 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Young et al., 2018</xref>). These reports validate previous biochemical work on these ribosome recycling factors in yeast and reveal that the direct consequence of loss of recycling is unintended re-initiation in untranslated regions.</p><p>A similar ribosome profiling analysis in bacteria has been lacking, but the link between recycling and re-initiation is clearly of interest given the role re-initiation has been proposed to play in the translational coupling of genes in polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schümperli et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baughman and Nomura, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksoy et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petersen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiaruttini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heurgué-Hamard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Karp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tian and Salis, 2015</xref>). Genes encoded in the same mRNA are said to be translationally coupled when the translation of the upstream gene promotes translation of the downstream gene. Coupling was first reported in genetic studies in which nonsense mutations in an upstream gene suppress translation of a downstream gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oppenheim and Yanofsky, 1980</xref>). Such translational coupling is a conserved mechanism, observed in a number of genes across various bacterial species and their phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkhout and van Duin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van de Guchte et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Govantes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabowska et al., 2011</xref>). One of the key features regulating coupling efficiency is the distance between the stop codon of the upstream gene and the start codon of the downstream gene: distances less than 25 nt are optimal for coupling to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Karp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tian and Salis, 2015</xref>). 75% of intergenic regions in polycistronic transcripts are shorter than this distance in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that a high percentage of genes are optimally positioned for translational coupling.</p><p>How then does translational coupling occur? Two main mechanisms have been proposed in the literature: (1) ribosomes translating the upstream gene may unwind secondary structures that otherwise block de novo initiation at the downstream gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baughman and Nomura, 1983</xref>) or (2) following termination at the upstream stop codon and subunit splitting by RRF, 30S subunits may scan along the mRNA and re-initiate on the downstream gene without dissociating from the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhin and van Duin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rex et al., 1994</xref>). More recently, a model involving re-initiation by 70S post-TCs has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>). Given that loss of ribosome recycling should directly impact the level of mRNA-bound ribosomes capable of re-initiation (whether 30S or 70S), several studies inhibited RRF and monitored the efficiency of re-initiation on downstream genes, with mixed results. Part of the challenge is that RRF is encoded by an essential gene, complicating genetic analyses. Using a temperature-sensitive RRF allele, Kaji and co-workers reported higher levels of downstream gene expression on reporter constructs when RRF activity is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janosi et al., 1998</xref>), consistent with models of re-initiation by post-TCs. In contrast, using similar approaches, analysis of several coupled phage genes revealed no evidence that coupling depends on ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inokuchi et al., 2000</xref>). Using a different strategy to deplete RRF (transcriptional shut-off with a ligand-inducible promoter), Nakamura and co-workers studied re-initiation after premature stop codons (i.e. nonsense mutations) within the <italic>phoA</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> and also argued against a role for RRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karamyshev et al., 2004</xref>). No clear picture emerges from these conflicting studies, and to our knowledge, the community has yet to characterize the role that RRF plays in the translational coupling of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> genes in their endogenous context within the genome. Context is critical because local mRNA structure plays such an important role in bacterial translational control.</p><p>Here, we report a genome-wide study of changes in translation that occur upon the loss of RRF in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We used ribosome profiling (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) to determine the position of ribosomes throughout the transcriptome and monitor how ribosome density changes when recycling is inhibited. We established a method to rapidly and conditionally knock down RRF levels and collected samples at several time points after RRF depletion. We observe ribosomes accumulating upstream of stop codons, indicating that post-termination 70S complexes (post-TCs) fail to be recycled at stop codons and block elongating ribosomes at the end of ORFs. We also see a dramatic accumulation of ribosome density in 3′-UTRs. We argue that these are not elongating ribosomes (translation in the 3′-UTR in reporter constructs is not enhanced by RRF depletion) but are post-TCs that have diffused away from the stop codon over time. Additionally, we observe that RRF depletion does not alter the ratio of ribosome density on neighboring genes in polycistronic transcripts, nor does it significantly alter the coupling efficiency in reporter assays of a series of <italic>E. coli</italic> genes previously demonstrated to be translationally coupled. These results argue that re-initiation by ribosomes or ribosome subunits bound to mRNA after recycling is not a widespread mechanism of translational initiation in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Finally, we observe that loss of recycling leads to significant changes in gene expression, including the accumulation of ribosome footprints on tmRNA and dramatic upregulation of ribosome rescue factor ArfA. Our results highlight the many critical roles played by RRF in translation in bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of the conditional RRF knock-down strain</title><p>Because RRF is encoded by an essential gene, previous analyses of the in vivo function of this factor have relied on a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts-RRF) whose abundance drops significantly at elevated temperatures (43°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janosi et al., 1998</xref>). Given that heat shock introduces substantial changes in gene expression, we decided to take a different approach to conditionally deplete RRF to study its role in translation throughout the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To accomplish this, we swapped the promoter in the genome with the <italic>araBAD</italic> promoter so that cells cultured in media with arabinose express RRF, but following the switch to media with glucose, they strongly repress its transcription. In addition, we added a FLAG-epitope to the C-terminus of RRF to facilitate its detection, and the short peptide tag YALAA to target the protein for degradation by ClpXP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr et al., 2012</xref>). In media containing arabinose, expression of RRF is sufficient to maintain viability even though the protein is rapidly turned over. In media containing glucose, the combination of transcriptional shut-off and accelerated protein degradation yield rapid depletion of the RRF protein: 10 min after the media switch, RRF levels are visibly reduced in immunoblots; 15 min following a second transfer to fresh media containing glucose, the protein is nearly undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To measure the levels of total protein synthesis after RRF depletion, we treated cells for 10 min with the methionine analog HPG beginning 5, 15, and 60 min after the second transfer to media containing glucose. We observe that bulk translation drops to about 40% by the first time point and then levels off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even at the 60 min time point, there is still a substantial amount of protein synthesis. These data give us confidence that this approach can capture the effects of RRF depletion on ongoing protein synthesis and translational coupling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strategy for ribosome recycling factor (RRF) depletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the genome, the promoter upstream of <italic>frr</italic> (the gene encoding RRF) was replaced by the ligand-inducible <italic>araBAD</italic> promoter.

In addition to the standard ribosome profiling libraries, we also prepared libraries from the same biological samples with a high-salt lysis buffer containing 1 M NaCl. High-salt conditions are known to dissociate ribosomes into 30S and 50S subunits unless the ribosomes are stabilized by the presence of an intact peptidyl-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zylber and Penman, 1970</xref>). We anticipated that the loss of RRF would increase the number of post-termination 70S complexes (post-TCs). By preparing profiling libraries from the same samples with and without 1 M NaCl in the lysis buffer, we hoped to differentiate between elongating ribosomes and post-TCs following RRF depletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Upon RRF depletion, ribosomes accumulate in the 3′-UTR and queue upstream of stop codons</title><p>Comparison of the ribosome profiling data from the WT and RRF KD strains reveals differences in ribosome density that are readily attributed to a diminution of ribosome recycling. For example, although in the WT strain ribosome protected footprints (RPFs) from the <italic>rpsB</italic> gene map almost exclusively to the coding sequence, after 60 min of RRF depletion, there is a clear accumulation of RPFs in the 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These effects can be seen genome-wide in plots of ribosome density averaged over &gt;1000 genes aligned at stop codons. (In these analyses, we excluded genes with ORFs within 110 nt downstream of the stop codon). Even after only 5 min of RRF depletion, ribosome density is higher in the 3′-UTR in the KD strain than it is in the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The number of RPFs in the 3′-UTR is even higher after 15 min or 60 min of RRF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C&amp;D</xref>). Because the ribosome profiling protocol involves the isolation of 70S monosomes on a sucrose gradient after digestion of unprotected mRNA by nucleases, we are confident that these represent 70S ribosomes and not 30S subunits. These data show that 70S ribosomes accumulate significantly in the 3′-UTR when recycling fails but cannot distinguish between actively translating ribosomes and post-termination complexes (post-TCs).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RRF knockdown creates queues of stalled ribosomes upstream of stop codons and high ribosome density in the 3′-UTR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribosome density (in reads per million mapped reads) on the <italic>rpsB</italic> gene 60 min after the 2nd media change in the wild-type (top) and RRF knock-down strain (bottom).

We expected to see an increase in the height of the stop codon peak upon RRF depletion, due to the accumulation of post-TCs that are not recycled. We were surprised to find that the stop codon peaks are very similar in the WT and RRF KD strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We cannot explain why we do not see the expected increase in stop codon peaks upon RRF depletion, but we can infer that post-TCs accumulate there because we see stacked ribosomes appearing immediately upstream. The distance from the stop codon to the first upstream peak is about 25–30 nt, consistent with the footprint of a single ribosome, and a second peak is observed upstream at the distance of another footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). The density corresponding to these stacked ribosomes is more highly resolved in the ribosome profiling data collected using the high salt lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). These data show that ribosomes stably bound at the stop codon prevent elongating ribosomes from reaching the end of the ORF as observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> upon depletion of Rli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, our data show that RRF plays a critical role in clearing post-termination complexes in vivo, consistent with earlier in vitro biochemical studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ribosomes in the 3′-UTR are not translating</title><p>Prior studies using the ts-RRF allele in <italic>E. coli</italic> suggested that post-TCs can resume translation when recycling is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janosi et al., 1998</xref>). We therefore asked if the ribosomes that accumulate in the 3′-UTR upon RRF knock-down are translating. High-salt concentrations are known to destabilize ribosomes lacking a nascent peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zylber and Penman, 1970</xref>); we expect ribosome density corresponding to post-TCs to be reduced in the samples prepared with 1 M NaCl in the lysis buffer. Indeed, we see that the stop codon peak usually observed in standard RP experiments is lost in the high-salt samples, suggesting that this peak corresponds to post-TCs that are waiting for ribosome recycling. The fact that post-TCs accumulate to high levels at stop codons argues that ribosome recycling is slower than peptidyl-hydrolysis even in wild-type cells, consistent with earlier observations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schuller et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we observe a reduction in the 3′-UTR ribosome density in the high-salt RP samples compared with the standard RP samples (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). The reduction of 3′-UTR ribosome density is quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> comparing the ratio of ribosome density in 3′-UTR and the upstream ORF. For the 5 min time point, for example, the high-salt wash reduces 3′-UTR density by 2.5-fold (p-value from one-sided Mann-Whitney test, 1.1 × 10<sup>−30</sup>). Again, the fact that 3′-UTR ribosomes are reduced by the high-salt lysis buffer argues that most of them are not translating but have moved into the 3′-UTR by diffusion. In contrast, the peaks corresponding to stacked ribosomes are not reduced by the high-salt conditions consistent with the idea that they represent elongating ribosomes whose intact peptidyl-tRNA stabilizes the subunits against dissociation in high salt.</p><p>Given that the high-salt buffer does not completely eliminate the 3′-UTR ribosome density, these profiling data cannot rule out the possibility that a low level of translation occurs in the 3′-UTR. To directly test this possibility, we designed reporters for two genes (<italic>arcA</italic> and <italic>stpA</italic>) that show high levels of ribosome density in the 3′-UTR when RRF is depleted. To detect re-initiation events, we inserted the GFP coding sequence into the 3′-UTR upstream of the first stop codon in every frame, creating three reporters, each in a different reading frame with respect to the upstream ORF (in-frame, +1 or −1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If post-TCs re-initiate in the 3′-UTR, GFP will be translated with a short peptide sequence on its N-terminus, depending on the initiation site and reading frame. Finally, we created a control construct in which the upstream ORF is replaced by the GFP gene (GFP-only), producing protein that can be used as a size marker in immunoblots and that reports on the level of transcription and translation from the native promoter and ribosome-binding sites.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ribosome recycling factor (RRF) depletion does not upregulate translation of GFP in the 3′-UTR of two genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The reporter plasmid encodes an <italic>E. coli</italic> gene with its native promoter, 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR.

Little to no GFP was observed in the RRF+ condition for reporters with GFP in any of the three frames, suggesting that there are normally very low levels of initiation at the site where we inserted GFP into the 3′-UTR. Upon RRF knockdown, even though GFP levels are higher from the GFP-alone construct relative to the CysRS loading control (perhaps indicative of an increase in RNA levels), no relative increase in GFP expression can be detected from the 3′-UTR in any reading frame. These data indicate that re-initiation does not occur at high levels upon RRF depletion. Likewise, for the series of reporters based on <italic>stpA,</italic> there was no increase in GFP expression in any of the reading frames upon RRF depletion. Together with the observation that much of the 3′-UTR ribosome density is lost upon high-salt treatment, these findings argue that re-initiation in the 3′-UTR is not a common event when RRF is depleted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Highly translated genes have more stacked ribosomes and relatively fewer 3’-UTR ribosomes</title><p>As shown above, when RRF is depleted, elongating ribosomes form a queue behind the stop codon (spaced one ribosome footprint apart) because they are sterically blocked by post-TCs that have failed to be recycled. We hypothesized that the number of stacked ribosomes would be particularly high on messages with high ribosome density. Using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq, we can estimate the ribosome occupancy of each transcript in the cell (the number of ribosome footprints per transcript, normalized by length). We selected two sets of genes corresponding to the top 20% and bottom 40% of ribosome occupancy (RO) values in the WT sample. For these two sets of genes, we calculated the average ribosome density aligned at stop codons after RRF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As anticipated, the high RO genes have significantly more stacked ribosomes, even at 5 min, with peaks corresponding to three or even four stacked ribosomes behind the post-TC complex at the stop codon. We quantified these effects by defining a collision score, the ratio of ribosome density in the last 100 nt of ORF to that of the entire ORF (using reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (rpkm) values that are normalized by length) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

At each time point, the 3′-UTR scores are lower in high RO genes than in low RO genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

For translationally coupled genes, translation of a downstream gene in an operon is dependent on the translation of an upstream gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oppenheim and Yanofsky, 1980</xref>). Following termination at the upstream stop codon and subunit splitting by RRF, 30S subunits may scan along the mRNA and re-initiate on the downstream gene without dissociating from the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhin and van Duin, 1990</xref>). The global depletion of RRF and loss of ribosome recycling are expected to strongly impact translational coupling if re-initiation occurs with the same 30S subunit that translated the upstream gene. Without RRF and ribosome recycling, the number of scanning 30S subunits should be markedly reduced.</p><p>To determine what effect RRF may have in translational coupling on polycistronic mRNAs, we selected several gene pairs that have been directly demonstrated to exhibit translational coupling and asked how RRF depletion affects coupling efficiency in a reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We constructed reporters in which the final 120 nt of the upstream ORF were cloned downstream of mCherry, followed by the natural intergenic region and the first 120 nt of the downstream ORF fused to nano-luciferase (nLuc). Two versions of each reporter were constructed: in one, the upstream gene contains a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence (RBS), and in the other, the upstream gene lacks both a Shine-Dalgarno sequence and an AUG start codon (NoRBS). Because translation of the genes is thought to be coupled, the expression of the downstream gene (measured by nLuc activity) is expected to be higher for the RBS reporter than for the NoRBS reporter. As an internal control, we also express firefly luciferase (fLuc) from the reporter plasmid on a separate transcript. In the experiment, transcription of the nLuc reporters is induced at the second media change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and their expression assayed after 60 min.

After 60 min of RRF depletion, we found that the number of ribosome footprints on 16 genes were more than 10-fold higher in the RRF KD strain than in the WT strain, indicating higher levels of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). One of the most prominent changes is in the expression of the ArfA protein (39-fold), a factor known to rescue stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chadani et al., 2012</xref>).

Ribosome stalling at the 3′-end of this truncated <italic>arfA</italic> transcript is resolved by the primary ribosome rescue factor, tmRNA, which tags the truncated ArfA protein to target it for degradation. tmRNA also recruits RNase R so that the <italic>arfA</italic> mRNA is rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richards et al., 2006</xref>).

After only 5 min of RRF depletion, we see a sharp increase in ribosome footprints on the short ORF within tmRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The strongest peak is at the stop codon, suggesting an accumulation of post-TCs that cannot be recycled. 60 min after depletion of RRF, we also see an accumulation of ribosome footprints downstream of the tmRNA ORF, in regions that are normally not translated but play important structural roles. These downstream footprints are reminiscent of the accumulated 3′-UTR ribosomes in all mRNAs and likely represent non-translating 70S ribosomes; consistent with this explanation, there is less ribosome density in tmRNA in the high-salt treated samples where post-TCs are destabilized (data not shown). We speculate that these post-TCs denature key structures in tmRNA, interfering with its ability to rescue stalled ribosomes and thus preventing it from promoting degradation of ArfA at the mRNA and protein levels. These findings reveal how a translation-based feedback pathway which responds to aberrant cellular translation is induced by the loss of ribosome recycling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we provide a global view of the effects of loss of ribosome recycling on protein synthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In contrast to previous studies of RRF function in vivo that utilized a temperature sensitive allele of RRF, we developed a strategy relying on transcriptional shutoff and rapid protein turnover through targeted proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This strategy avoids shifts in temperature that induce global stress responses. There are a couple of caveats, however. First, our approach probably does not lead to total loss of this essential factor; low levels of recycling likely occur in RRF-depleted cells. A second caveat is that RRF depletion may lead to indirect effects. Biological pathways unrelated to recycling may be impacted when the translation of critical proteins is reduced. To minimize the impact of potential indirect effects, we focus our discussion on aspects of ribosome activity that are directly tied to recycling. In addition, most of the phenotypes of RRF depletion described here occur even at the earliest time point (5 min), where indirect effects are most unlikely.</p><p>Given the well-characterized role of RRF in splitting ribosomes following termination, we expected to see a strong accumulation of post-termination complexes (post-TCs) at stop codons across the transcriptome upon depletion of RRF. Although we did not see differences in stop codon peaks, we did observe indirect evidence that post-TCs are in fact present at stop codons. Elongating ribosomes form a queue behind stop codons, spaced one ribosome footprint apart. We infer that post-TCs accumulate at stop codons, blocking elongation and trapping upstream ribosomes in an inactive state that prevents them from completing protein synthesis. We speculate that post-TCs retain some affinity for the site where termination occurred due to base-pairing between the deacyl-tRNA in the P-site and the last sense codon in the ORF. These findings are consistent with prior observations of stacked ribosomes that appear upon knockdown of the yeast 80S recycling factor Rli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young et al., 2015</xref>) and the 40S recycling factors Tma64, Tma22, and Tma20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Young et al., 2018</xref>). These data show that RRF is critical for ribosome recycling at stop codons and that the loss of recycling interferes with robust protein synthesis from an mRNA.</p><p>Our second main observation is the accumulation of non-translating 3′-UTR ribosomes upon RRF depletion. Unlike the stacked ribosomes upstream of stop codons, which contain peptidyl-tRNA, ribosomes in the 3′-UTR are lost in high-salt concentrations, arguing that they are post-TCs and not elongating 70S ribosomes. How did they get into the 3′-UTR? We argue that over time, post-TCs, only weakly retained by codon-anticodon pairing with the tRNA, eventually slide along the mRNA past the stop codon into the 3′ UTR. The dramatic enrichment of ribosome density downstream of stop codons highlights the importance of RRF in maintaining ribosome homeostasis by regenerating ribosome subunits to initiate translation. When RRF is depleted, many ribosomes are trapped in an inactive state in the 3′-UTR, as seen in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mills et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How are post-TCs in the 3′-UTR removed in the absence of the canonical, RRF-mediated recycling pathway? From prior work we have some idea of what happens to empty 80S ribosomes in eukaryotes. The Dom34/Hbs1 complex (normally involved in rescuing stalled ribosomes) delivers Dom34 to the ribosomal A site, where it works together with the canonical recycling factor Rli1 to promote subunit splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, loss of Dom34 leads to the accumulation of non-translating ribosomes in the 3′-UTR, indicating that Dom34 normally helps remove empty 80S ribosomes from 3′-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>). Because the Dom34/Rli1 complex directly splits ribosomal subunits whether there is an intact peptidyl-tRNA linkage or not, it can serve as a backup mechanism to recycle post-TCs that have escaped canonical recycling at the stop codon by eRF1/Rli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the bacterial tmRNA/SmpB and ArfA/RF2 ribosome rescue systems typically catalyze reactions with the peptidyl-tRNA. It may be that bacteria lack an effective backup mechanism for splitting post-TCs. The critical role that RRF plays in ribosome homeostasis likely is the simplest explanation for its essential nature.</p><p>Finally, we return to a fundamental and important difference in the role of recycling revealed by our studies. In yeast, ribosome density in the 3′-UTR upon knockdown of Rli1 or 40S recycling factors at least in part reflects the activity of elongating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Young et al., 2018</xref>). Although the mechanism is poorly understood, translation in the 3′-UTR does arise from re-initiation downstream of the stop codon. In contrast, the 3′-UTR ribosome density in <italic>E. coli</italic> reflects post-TCs that are not translating, as evidenced by their sensitivity to the high-salt buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and our failure to detect an increase in translation of GFP in the 3′-UTR when RRF is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although the reason for these differences between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> are not clear, these findings appear to be consistent with the different initiation strategies used by eukaryotes and bacteria. In general, eukaryotic ribosomes scan from the 5′-end of mRNAs to find start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). Given the importance of short, upstream ORFs in regulating translation in eukaryotes, ribosomes must be able to re-initiate following termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunišová et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, bacterial 30S subunits normally initiate anywhere along a polycistronic mRNA where they are recruited directly based on sequence context and mRNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Campo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkhardt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saito et al., 2020</xref>), without the need for scanning.</p><p>The fact that we do not observe robust re-initiation upon loss of ribosome recycling in <italic>E. coli</italic> has important implications for models of translational coupling. One common mechanistic model argues that following termination and subunit splitting, the 30S subunit remains on the mRNA and slides until it re-initiates at a nearby start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhin and van Duin, 1990</xref>). If this model were correct, we reasoned that recycling defects should reduce the number of such scanning 30S subunits downstream of stop codons, thereby <italic>decreasing</italic> the expression of downstream genes. An alternate re-initiation mechanism involving 70S ribosomes was proposed by Nierhaus and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>). We note that initiation by 70S ribosomes is difficult to reconcile with the well-characterized biochemical activities of fMet-tRNA and initiation factors that initiate translation on 30S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simonetti et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, this model also predicts that recycling defects should <italic>increase</italic> the efficiency of re-initiation upon RRF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Contrary to the predictions of both of these models, however, we observed that the loss of RRF does not affect the relative translational levels of neighboring genes in polycistronic messages. This was true in reporters based on five gene pairs previously shown to be translationally coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) as well as in genome-wide analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We conclude that re-initiation is not the dominant mechanism for translational coupling in <italic>E. coli</italic>, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may occur in specific contexts.</p><p>Instead, our data are most consistent with models of de novo initiation, where free 30S subunits are recruited to start codons directly. In cases where neighboring genes are translationally coupled, it seems likely that melting of mRNA structure near the downstream start site is the mechanism at play. The melting of mRNA structures is a well-documented mechanism for coupling the translation of neighboring genes where it has been explored in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rex et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiaruttini et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, several genome-wide studies of mRNA structure and translation argued that mRNA structure is a major determinant of translational efficiency in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Campo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkhardt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mustoe et al., 2018</xref>), perhaps even more important than well-studied sequence elements such as Shine-Dalgarno motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saito et al., 2020</xref>). The ability to determine secondary structures of mRNA in vivo in a high-throughput fashion will be a powerful method to inform future studies of the mechanism of translational coupling in bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth conditions</title><p>For ribosome profiling and RNA-seq libraries, cells were cultured at 37°C in 500 mL of LB + arabinose (0.2% w/v) to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2.

Polycistrons for analyses of translational coupling are based on the same transcript units. In cases where a gene is assigned to multiple transcription units, we selected the one annotated in RegulonDB as an operon. In addition, we excluded pairs of upstream and downstream genes where their RNA abundances (calculated from RNA-seq) differ by more than 5-fold. 3′-UTR scores were calculated as the RPKM of 3′-UTR divided by RPKM of the upstream CDS. Collision scores were calculated as the RPKM of the last 100 nt of CDS divided by RPKM of the entire CDS. In RPKM calculattions, reads mapped on the last 15 nucleotides of the CDS are excluded. RO is the RPKM of ribosome profiling reads for each gene divided by RPKM of RNA-seq.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank David Mohr at the Genetics Resources Core Facility, Johns Hopkins Institute of Genetic Medicine, for sequencing assistance.

The first assumption is that effects resulting from the absence of RRF protein, which is almost complete at 15' and complete at 60' (subsection “Upon RRF depletion, ribosomes accumulate in the 3’-UTR and queue upstream of stop codons”), can be solely attributed to the loss of RRF protein. Given that rrf is an essential gene, RRF removal could well have pleiotropic effects not considered by the authors. The second, and related, assumption is that ribosome occupancy is a faithful reporter of protein translation rates when RRF is absent.

This might be better placed in the Discussion section.</p><p>3) Figure 7F should be redrawn. At present, it is very reader unfriendly</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Saito et al., explored the role of RRF by examining how mRNA translation responses to RRF knockdown in <italic>E. coli</italic> using ribosome profiling and a series of ad hoc expression reporters. The major (somewhat surprising) findings are that RRF KD has relatively little effect on translational coupling and that RRF KD triggers upregulation of ArfA ribosome rescue pathway via inactivation of tmRNA by unrecycled ribosomes. This work is of an outstanding technical quality and is very important for our understanding of ribosome recycling in bacteria and of the mechanism of translational coupling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the absence of direct evidence, the authors are reasonably cautious not to state that translation re-initiation does not take place in bacteria, instead they cautiously state that it is not a major factor in translation coupling. Indeed, it is likely that some level of recycling occurs in RRF KD even after 60 minutes. The splitting could be spontaneous, assisted by backup pathways or by residual levels of RRF. Therefore, we cannot exclude a possibility that reinitiation makes some contribution to the coupling and still occur in RRF KD. Did author try to estimate what is the level of recycling in RRF KD?</p><p>2) RO differences between WT and KD in Figure 5B seems larger than what would be normally described as &quot;little or no effect&quot;, though it is hard to understand the significance of these differences without a reference for comparison. Assuming that translation initiation should affect expression of downstream cistrons more than upstream, perhaps in addition to the analysis in Figure 6, a comparison of upstream and downstream cistrons should be carried out separately. If RRF KD has no affect on coupling we should expect the correlation between WT and KD for upstream cistrons not significantly exceed that for downstream. Further, the ratios of upstream/downstream cistrons RO vary up to 2 orders of magnitude (Figure 6B). Are they true coupled pairs within the same operons? How the same analysis would look like if done for RNA-seq reads? Would it make sense to do this with footprint densities instead of RO? Perhaps Ribosome Occupancy and Footprint Density (along with collision and 3'UTR scores for consistency) should be explicitly defined with a mathematical formula in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) Presumably for binning mRNAs into highly and lowly translated, RO was calculated using WT, because otherwise collisions in KD would affect RO and collisions would be overrepresented in the high bin resulting in a circular argument. This is not clear. Also, it would be interesting to see a relationship between collision scores and 3'UTR scores to support the statement about their inverse correlation. Could stacking be induced by inability of &quot;unrecycled&quot; ribosomes to progress to 3'UTRs?</p><p>4) The manuscript provides a very good overview of the literature related to translational coupling and reinitiation in bacteria, however, I think one relevant work is missing – Osterman et al., 2013. I think it would be good to add it to the Discussion section since it addresses many related questions and some of their observations are not in agreement with this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a very clearly written manuscript that describes the consequences of depleting ribosome recycling factor (RRF) in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The authors argue that depleting RRF leads to piling up of ribosomes at the ends of ORFs, and association of non-translating ribosomes in 3' UTRs. Depleting RRF has no effect on the translational coupling of closely spaced ORFs, arguing against both of the two major models for this process. Lastly, the authors show that RRF depletion leads to induction of arfA expression, although the evidence for the proposed mechanism involving tmRNA is a little weak. The data are of high quality throughout, and the work is beautifully presented.</p><p>The authors use the piling up of ribosomes upstream of stop codons to infer that a ribosome is stalled at the stop codon in RRF-depleted cells. However, the signal from the ribosome at the stop codon is unchanged. Either the model is wrong, or ribosome profiling data cannot capture this stalled state. In the latter case, there may be other ribosome states that are not being captured, meaning that the ribosome profiling data may give a misleading view of where ribosomes are located in RRF-depleted cells. I think it's important to figure out why the stalled terminating ribosomes are not detected, including the possibility that there are no stalled terminating ribosomes.</p><p>- Figure 7F. The authors speculate that increased ribosome occupancy in tmRNA downstream of the ORF is due to translationally inactive ribosomes. This should be possible to assess using the high salt datasets.</p><p>- Figure 7F. Assuming the ORF within tmRNA is the degradation tag, the ribosome occupancy represents ribosomes translating tagged non-stop mRNAs. A simpler model for arfA induction could be that free tmRNA levels are depleted due to ribosomes getting stuck at the end of the ORF in tmRNAs rescuing non-stop mRNAs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59974.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found the work to be of high quality, and agreed that it represents an important advance in our understanding of both RRF function and translational coupling.

But whether or not the post-TC remains there or slides into the 3’-UTR depends on the ribosome occupancy of the gene (which is at least in part determined by its initiation rate).
