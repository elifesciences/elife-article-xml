NOVA regulates splicing, shuttles to the cytoplasm, and co-localizes with target transcripts in dendrites, suggesting links between splicing and local translation. Here we identified &gt;200 transcripts showing NOVA-dependent changes in abundance, but, surprisingly, HITS-CLIP revealed NOVA binds these RNAs in introns rather than 3′ UTRs. This led us to discover NOVA-regulated splicing of cryptic exons within these introns. These exons triggered nonsense mediated decay (NMD), as UPF1 and protein synthesis were required for NOVA's effect on RNA levels. Their regulation was dynamic and physiologically relevant. The NMD exons were regulated by seizures, which also induced changes in Nova subcellular localization and mediated large changes in synaptic proteins, including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy. Moreover, Nova haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy. The data reveal a hidden means of dynamic RNA regulation linking electrical activity to splicing and protein output, and of mediating homeostatic excitation/inhibition balance in neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00178.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00178.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00178.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>After the DNA in a gene has been transcribed into messenger RNA, portions of the mRNA called introns are removed, and the remaining stretches of mRNA, which are known as exons, are spliced together. Within eukaryotic cells, a process known as alternative splicing allows a single gene to encode for multiple protein variants by ensuring that some exons are included in the final, modified mRNA, while other exons are excluded. This modified mRNA is then translated into proteins.</p><p>Eukaryotic cells also contain proteins that bind to RNA to regulate alternative splicing. These RNA-binding proteins are often found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, and their involvement in splicing may be linked to other processes in the cell such as mRNA localization and translation. It has also become clear over the past two decades that certain types of RNA-binding proteins, including NOVA proteins, are only found in neurons, and that these proteins have been best characterized as alternative splicing regulators. Recent work has also suggested that they also have important roles in regulating neuronal activity and development, and that their actions in neuronal nuclei and cytoplasm might be coordinated.</p><p>Now Eom et al. use the predictive power of a high throughput sequencing and crosslinking method termed HITS-CLIP to show that NOVA proteins can indirectly regulate cytoplasmic mRNA levels by regulating the process of alternative splicing in the nucleus to produce ‘cryptic’ exons in the brains of mice. The presence of these exons in the mRNA leads to the production of premature termination codons in the cytoplasm. These codons trigger a process called nonsense-mediated decay that involves identifying mRNA transcripts that contain nonsense mutations, and then degrading them. These cryptic exons were seen in mice missing the NOVA proteins, where they are expressed in abnormally high levels; in normal mice, these exons have not been seen before, hence they were termed ‘cryptic’.</p><p>Eom et al. also show that these cryptic exons are physiologically relevant by inducing epileptic seizures in mice. Following the seizures, they find that the NOVA proteins up-regulate and down-regulate the levels of different cryptic exons, leading to changes in the levels of the proteins encoded by these mRNAs, including proteins that inhibit further seizures. Overall the results indicate that, by controlling the production of various proteins in neurons, these previously unknown cryptic exons have important roles in the workings of the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00178.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00178.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>HITS-CLIP</kwd><kwd>Nonsense mediated decay</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA regulation</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>neuronal biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS34389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eom</surname><given-names>Taesun</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Chaolin</given-names></name><name><surname>Lay</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name><name><surname>Fak</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD24064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noebels</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS29709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noebels</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS40955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Huidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The HITS-CLIP sequencing method is used to demonstrate that cryptic exons can detect messenger RNA that contains nonsense mutations, and then cause this RNA to decay, which shows that these exons are involved in maintaining the electrical balance of neurons and, possibly, preventing epilepsy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA binding proteins (RNABPs) play critical roles in the brain to regulate neuronal development and activity, as underscored by the finding that dysregulation of RNABP function underlies a growing list of neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poulos et al., 2011</xref>).

For example, NOVA, like many other splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang and Steitz, 2005</xref>), shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>), reflecting the interesting but incompletely understood relationship between the regulation of RNA splicing, transport, stability, localization and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maniatis and Reed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang and Steitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Several well-defined RNA elements mediate RNA stability and localization, such as 3′ UTR adenine/uridine-rich (ARE) elements recognized by the Elavl family of RNABPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levine et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Myer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brennan and Steitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kishore et al., 2010</xref>) and the zipcode recognized by ZBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). NOVA may play coordinate roles in the nucleus and cytoplasm, as HITS-CLIP studies have shown direct binding to introns and 3′ UTRs of <italic>GlyRa2</italic> and <italic>Girk2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>), and evidence of splicing and a role for localization in each. However, the extent and means by which NOVA might mediate actions in both compartments remains uncertain.</p><p>Here we explore the relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic functions of NOVA by undertaking HITS-CLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell, 2010</xref>) on each fraction separately, and comparing results with microarray analysis of RNA in <italic>Nova</italic>-null mice. NOVA crosslinks to many transcripts in both nuclear/intronic and cytoplasmic/3′ UTR clusters, suggesting an ordered set of cis-actions on target RNAs. Surprisingly, however, among 229 transcripts showing significant steady-state changes, NOVA binding was primarily present in intronic rather than cytoplasmic elements. This led us to hypothesize and identify previously unannotated exons or alternative splicing patterns near these intronic elements that introduced premature termination codons (PTC) able to mediate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Thus HITS-CLIP reveals that NOVA regulates otherwise cryptic NMD exons in the nucleus to indirectly regulate steady-state mRNA levels in the cytoplasm. We put this finding in a physiologic context, showing that these exons encode synaptic proteins, they are regulated by seizure activity, and that Nova itself is important in epilepsy, as the protein shifts from the neuronal nucleus to cytoplasm shortly after seizure, and Nova haploinsufficient mice have spontaneous epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a role for Nova in maintaining homeostasis after seizure, in part through the regulation of cryptic NMD exons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in steady-state transcript levels in NOVA DKO brain</title><p>Previous CLIP experiments have identified NOVA binding sites near alternative exons and poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ule et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ule et al., 2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>), but have not fully addressed whether NOVA might also regulate the steady-state level of some transcripts. To assess the degree to which NOVA might regulate this aspect of neuronal mRNA metabolism, we compared steady-state levels of total poly(A)+ mRNAs in four <italic>Nova</italic> WT and four <italic>Nova1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>/<italic>2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (double KO; DKO) brains from P0 littermates (DKO mice die shortly after birth) with Affymetrix exon arrays.

Interestingly, this data indicated that NOVA had a disproportionate action to increase (rather than decrease) steady state levels of brain transcripts. Specifically, 215 of the 229 transcripts showed significant decreases in the absence of NOVA (NOVA-dependent ‘upregulation’ of steady-state mRNA levels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). 22 showed a &gt;1.5-fold change, and 11 of these were validated experimentally by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

HITS-CLIP has proven to be a reliable means of defining sites of direct functional RNA–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>). Analysis of prior CLIP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) demonstrated that many of the 229 transcripts showing NOVA-dependent changes in level had CLIP tags when whole brain extracts were crosslinked (see also below). Such changes could result from nuclear and/or cytoplasmic actions, and we have previously found evidence that NOVA may act in both compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we undertook a systematic comparison of NOVA binding in each compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nuclear and cytoplasmic NOVA HITS-CLIP</title><p>To define NOVA-RNA interactions in the nucleus and cytoplasm separately, we crosslinked mouse brain cortex, ‘freezing’ RNA–protein complexes for analysis, and then subfractionated tissue into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. To assess the integrity of this fractionation, we performed immunoblot analysis with markers known to be specific for each fraction and antibodies to NOVA, demonstrating that each fraction was &gt;90% pure, and that ∼60% of NOVA was nuclear and 40% cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, consistent with and detailed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>)). While this fractionation scheme (based on salt extraction) gave a relatively clean separation between each compartment, we cannot exclude the possibility that some NOVA protein was not extracted from each compartment under these conditions. Nonetheless, these data suggested that highly enriched NOVA-RNA complexes present in subcellular compartments could be purified and analyzed.</p><p>We examined NOVA RNA binding maps to nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs by analyzing HITS-CLIP results from each fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

These clusters were classified according to their locations within protein-coding transcripts, using annotations from cDNA/EST data and RefSeq and UCSC known genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). By focusing on CLIP tags in robust clusters (BC = 4, peak height (PH) ≥ 4), we observed that nuclear HITS-CLIP tags were enriched in introns (90%) and cytoplasmic HITS-CLIP tags in 3′ UTR (63%, including ∼13% within 10 kb downstream of annotated transcripts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>)). NOVA cytoplasmic CLIP data also contained a significant number of intronic clusters, but many of these were derived from abundant non-coding RNA species, such as ribosomal RNAs (also evident in nuclear CLIP data). After we reanalyzed the clusters with repetitive sequences excluded, only 17% clusters were located in introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In addition, when we analyzed the distribution of clusters as a function of peak height (PH), we identified a large proportion of intronic clusters in nuclear CLIP data, while less than 5% of NOVA cytoplasmic CLIP tag clusters were intronic (at PH 12–14).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00178.007</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Summary of CLIP tag mapping data</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00178.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00178.007</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample</th><th>Tag total</th><th>Tag mappable</th><th>Tag unique</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nuclear 1</td><td align="char" char=".">1,504,345</td><td align="char" char=".">1,031,115</td><td align="char" char=".">429,527</td></tr><tr><td>Nuclear 2</td><td align="char" char=".">4,984,997</td><td align="char" char=".">3,161,194</td><td align="char" char=".">363,771</td></tr><tr><td>Nuclear 3</td><td align="char" char=".">7,184,066</td><td align="char" char=".">3,944,912</td><td align="char" char=".">214,982</td></tr><tr><td>Nuclear 4</td><td align="char" char=".">6,656,628</td><td align="char" char=".">3,144,744</td><td align="char" char=".">325,507</td></tr><tr><td>Nuclear sum</td><td/><td/><td align="char" char=".">1,333,787</td></tr><tr><td>Cytoplasm 1</td><td align="char" char=".">1,454,697</td><td align="char" char=".">975,222</td><td align="char" char=".">89,463</td></tr><tr><td>Cytoplasm 2</td><td align="char" char=".">4,751,331</td><td align="char" char=".">2,780,173</td><td align="char" char=".">37,027</td></tr><tr><td>Cytoplasm 3</td><td align="char" char=".">3,653,600</td><td align="char" char=".">2,005,202</td><td align="char" char=".">36,228</td></tr><tr><td>Cytoplasm 4</td><td align="char" char=".">3,813,960</td><td align="char" char=".">2,382,946</td><td align="char" char=".">39,145</td></tr><tr><td>Cytoplasmic sum</td><td/><td/><td align="char" char=".">201,863</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The proportion of apparent cytoplasmic NOVA binding sites in introns was nonetheless an unexpectedly high number, prompting us to repeat the cytoplasmic purification with an independent method (based upon differential centrifugation; data not shown) and then repeat HITS-CLIP analysis on mouse brain. This experiment independently confirmed the presence and position of NOVA2 cytoplasmic (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) and nuclear (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) CLIP tags between experiments. We have not studied the function of the small numbers of reproducible NOVA ‘cytoplasmic’ intronic clusters further, which most likely reflect remaining impurity of the cell fractionation, but could also reflect other processes, including NOVA binding to non-coding RNAs, stable processed introns, or unspliced transcripts. Taken together, our data suggest that NOVA binds predominantly to intronic elements in pre-mRNA in the nucleus and mature mRNA elements in the cytoplasm, but may have an unexpected role in binding intronic non-coding RNA elements in the cytoplasm as well.</p><p>We previously identified RNA transcripts bound by NOVA in the nucleus that also co-localize with (<italic>GlyRa2</italic>) or are localized by (<italic>Girk2</italic>) NOVA in neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>), prompting us to compare the NOVA nuclear and cytoplasmic binding maps. We first compared the frequency and extent to which cytoplasmic NOVA clusters were also present in the same location in nuclear CLIP. There was a significant albeit small correlation between cytoplasmic and nuclear HITS-CLIP tags (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.32, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and robust clusters (BC = 4; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.36, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, when we relaxed the stringency of the nuclear clusters, we found that in most transcripts with robust cytoplasmic clusters, NOVA was already bound to those clusters in the nucleus. Among 504 transcripts with robust cytoplasmic clusters (BC ≥ 4, PH &gt; 10), 235 had robust nuclear clusters (BC ≥ 4, PH &gt; 10), and an additional 251 (46.6%) had weaker nuclear clusters. There were 18 unique cytoplasmic clusters (i.e. clusters not present in nuclear CLIP, but in transcripts which nonetheless had nuclear clusters in other locations), suggesting the possibility of a reassortment of NOVA binding sites in cis on individual transcripts; such a mechanism might allow nuclear and cytoplasmic functions like RNA localization or RNA stability to be linked (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed the relationship between NOVA cytoplasmic and nuclear binding in transcripts whose levels are NOVA-dependent. One common mechanism by which transcript steady-state levels are regulated is through actions on stability elements within the 3′ UTR, either through the actions of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fabian et al., 2010</xref>) or through RNABP-RNA regulatory interactions via actions on conserved elements such as ARE sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brennan and Steitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khabar, 2010</xref>). Surprisingly however, the distribution of NOVA CLIP tags within NOVA-regulated transcripts (specifically, in the 149 of 229 transcripts harboring ≥5 CLIP tags) revealed that the majority of NOVA CLIP tags (∼76%) were not present on the 3′ UTRs of NOVA-regulated transcripts. Instead the predominant location of NOVA CLIP tags on these transcripts was intronic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting the possibility that NOVA action on pre-mRNA might be linked to steady-state levels of NOVA target mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>Dlg3 (SAP102)</italic> mRNA and protein levels are reduced in the absence of NOVA</title><p>To address the mechanism by which NOVA regulates mRNA steady-state levels, we analyzed individual targets in more detail.

Western blots demonstrated that DLG3 protein levels were severely reduced (∼90% reduction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) in DKO brain, closely reflecting the reduction in <italic>Dlg3</italic> mRNA. We also examined DLG3 protein by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-DLG3 antibodies. We co-cultured WT/DKO neurons together and stained for NOVA protein to distinguish WT from DKO neurons, using Neurofilament-M (NF-M) immunoreactivity as a positive control to stain all neurons. These experiments clearly showed that NOVA DKO neurons had very little DLG3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the absence of NOVA protein in neurons is associated with a drastic reduction in <italic>Dlg3</italic> mRNA levels and a concomitant reduction in DLG3 protein levels.</p><p>To address whether NOVA protein might directly regulate <italic>Dlg3</italic> mRNA levels, we examined the specific locations of NOVA HITS CLIP tags along the <italic>Dlg3</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). NOVA binding sites were present in both the 3′ UTR and introns, and in both locations these sites harbored NOVA binding elements (clusters of the sequence YCAY; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>)). To assay the functional outcome of NOVA binding to the 3′ UTR elements, we generated a construct encoding a destabilized d1EGFP fused to either a 214 nt fragment (NOVA binding clusters in 3′ UTR shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) from the wild-type <italic>Dlg3</italic> 3′ UTR or a mutant fragment which would disrupt NOVA binding (YCAY-&gt;YAAY; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). 24 hr after transfection of these constructs into Neuro2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells, actinomycin D was added for 5 hr in order to block transcription, and <italic>Dlg3</italic> mRNA levels were followed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data revealed a relatively small but clear decrease in d1EGFP mRNA containing mutant YAAY NOVA binding sites (∼50% reduction) compared to transcripts harboring WT YCAY elements, indicating that NOVA binding to the 3′ UTR had a small effect on <italic>Dlg3</italic> steady state levels. However, this interaction did not appear to be sufficient to explain the large effect NOVA had on transcript (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and protein levels in neurons, prompting us to examine whether additional NOVA actions on <italic>Dlg3</italic> intronic elements contributed to effects on steady-state RNA levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Dlg3</italic> mRNA level is reduced in NOVA DKO through actions on cryptic NMD transcripts</title><p>The NOVA nuclear HITS-CLIP results demonstrated NOVA intronic and 3′ UTR binding sites that were present only in nuclear and cytoplasmic HITS-CLIP, respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting a hierarchy of NOVA action. To explore whether NOVA intronic binding sites might relate to an action on <italic>Dlg3</italic> steady-state mRNA levels, we empirically searched for cryptic alternative splicing events in regions neighboring the largest intronic HITS-CLIP clusters, given previous observations indicating that NOVA intronic clusters predict alternative splicing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dredge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ule and Darnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). RT-PCR was performed in WT vs. NOVA DKO brain RNA using primers bounding introns harboring NOVA HITS-CLIP clusters (exons 14 (E14) and E18 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In WT mouse brain two isoforms were detected and sequenced, and these were found to correspond to known alternative spliced isoforms, harboring what we refer to as E16, with or without E17, and a trace amount of a larger isoform. Remarkably, RT-PCR analysis of NOVA DKO mouse brain RNA revealed a marked increase of this larger isoform, and the presence of a previously unknown fourth, even larger form. Sequence analysis revealed the latter two isoforms correspond to the inclusion of an exon, E15, just downstream of the main Nova nuclear CLIP cluster, and a new combination of exons undetectable in WT brain, incorporating both E15 and E16 (as well as E17; termed Dlg3.15-16-17). E16 also has a second upstream intronic CLIP cluster, suggesting that the Nova binding sites upstream of E15 and E16 could normally act to suppress their dual inclusion, consistent with their inclusion in the DKO brain and with the Nova position-dependent splicing map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the previously unknown Dlg3 isoform (Dlg3.15-16-17) encoded a transcript harboring a PTC, formed by the inclusion of both E15 and E16 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

First, we added emetine, a translational inhibitor, into primary neuronal cultures of neurons obtained from WT or NOVA DKO mouse brain, since a pioneering round of translation is necessary to activate the NMD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</xref>). After emetine treatment for 10 hr, RNA was isolated and <italic>Dlg3</italic> splicing was assayed by RT-PCR. In WT neurons, emetine had no effect on <italic>Dlg3</italic> splicing. However, in the absence of NOVA, emetine induced a dramatic increase in the NMD isoform Dlg3.15-16-17, and total <italic>Dlg3</italic> mRNA levels increased by 3.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result establishes a link between the ability to detect NOVA-dependent splicing of Dlg3.15-16-17 and active translation, suggesting that this isoform is normally suppressed coordinately both by NOVA and NMD.</p><p>To more directly assess whether <italic>Dlg3.15-16-17</italic> is regulated by NMD, we knocked down a core component of the NMD pathway, Upf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mendell et al., 2002</xref>), with Upf1 siRNA. We first established that Upf1 siRNA was able to reduce UPF1 protein (by ∼90%) in N2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then transfected Upf1 siRNA into cultured primary neurons to readdress the possibility of coordinate regulation by NOVA and NMD. In primary neuronal cultures, transfection efficiency was lower, such that only about half of the cells were transfected, and we detected a concomitant ∼50% decrease in <italic>Upf1</italic> transcript in qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence to directly assess the effects of <italic>Upf1</italic> knock-down on a per-cell basis, we transfected <italic>Upf1</italic> siRNA into WT or DKO primary neuronal cultures, and monitored DLG3 and UPF1 protein levels in individual cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. These experiments revealed a reciprocal relationship between DLG3 protein and UPF1 protein levels in NOVA DKO neurons. DLG3 protein level was very low in untransfected DKO neurons that expressed UPF1 protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2D and 3C</xref>), whereas cells in which UPF1 signals were markedly reduced by <italic>Upf1</italic> siRNA exhibited a markedly increased DLG3 signal. We interpret these results to indicate that when the NMD pathway was inhibited by Upf1 knock-down, mis-spliced <italic>Dlg3.15-16-17</italic> mRNA led to accumulation of DLG3 protein that escape NMD degradation and accumulate at the protein level. This may have included truncated isoforms, as these experiments used an antibody against a Dlg3 N-terminal epitope; (see ‘Materials and methods’). More generally, these results demonstrate that NOVA regulation of a cryptic alternatively spliced exon is necessary to prevent NMD-mediated suppression of Dlg3 expression in the brain, and this can act in concert with 3′ UTR binding to maintain Dlg3 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>Scn9a</italic> mRNA and protein level increases in NOVA DKO through NOVA-dependent splicing-coupled NMD</title><p>We next explored an example of the less common converse situation, in which microarray analysis revealed NOVA-dependent decreases in steady-state mRNA levels.

We found that <italic>Scn9a</italic> did harbor a major tag cluster in an intron upstream of a previously uncharacterized but conserved exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; based on one sequenced transcript; NCBI accession: AM905322). Empirically, we assayed mRNA expression in this region from WT vs DKO brain by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, in WT brain the <italic>Scn9a</italic> transcript had two isoforms, but in NOVA DKO brain the larger isoform was lost. Sequence analysis demonstrated that this larger isoform corresponded to an alternative exon 17, termed E17a, that was not represented in RefSeq (as it corresponded to a partial mRNA sequence only), and that E17a harbored a PTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Again, this data was consistent with the upstream position of the NOVA CLIP tag clusters relative to E17a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) predicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>) that NOVA would normally act to suppress E17a inclusion.</p><p>These findings suggested that in the WT brain, Nova-mediated inclusion of <italic>Scn9a</italic> E17a was normally used to produce transcripts that are likely degraded by NMD, and that E17a exclusion in the absence of NOVA activity could lead to an increase in steady state mRNA and protein level. To test the role of NMD in NOVA-mediated regulation of <italic>Scn9a</italic> levels, we applied emetine to primary WT neurons to inhibit translation and NMD. After 10 hr, RT-PCR was performed using primers bounding E17a. Emetine treatment increased the levels of E17a-included <italic>Scn9a</italic> transcripts compared to non-treated cells (∼75% increase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, we transfected Upf1 siRNA into WT primary neuronal cultures, and observed an increase in <italic>Scn9a</italic> E17a containing mRNA after siRNA KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Since not all alternative exons and splicing patterns are fully annotated, particularly those associated with NMD, we empirically searched for cryptic exons in introns that had robust NOVA orphan clusters in nuclear CLIP experiments. Among 15 transcripts showing significant NOVA-dependent changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), 11 transcripts harbored robust NOVA intronic CLIP tag clusters. We designed RT-PCR primers in exons bounding these orphan intronic NOVA binding sites and assessed whether cryptic NOVA-dependent NMD exons could be identified. We identified and sequenced cryptic NOVA-regulated exons, evident only in NOVA DKO brain RNA, in 9 of these 11 transcripts, as well as in an additional 2 transcripts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), and found PTCs in each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In 7 transcripts splicing was consistent with NOVA-dependent inclusion of an NMD exon, such that these exons were absent in NOVA DKO brain, and in each case these correlated with increased steady-state mRNA levels in NOVA DKO brain. Conversely, in 4 transcripts splicing of these cryptic exons was consistent with NOVA-dependent suppression of an NMD exon and decreased steady-state levels in NOVA DKO brain.</p><p>To assess whether these transcripts were indeed regulated through NMD, we added emetine to primary neuronal cultures and examined the steady-state expression of the putative NMD-exons.

Remarkably, there were very few splicing changes detected in the brain after pilocarpine seizure. Using stringent criteria (|ΔI| &gt; 0.2), only 23 exons showed differential splicing 24 hr after pilocarpine treatment, with more changes (96) evident 4 hr after pilocarpine treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>); by contrast, using the same stringency, 1,239 exons showed differential splicing in brain relative to thymus tissue (|ΔI| &gt; 0.2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ule et al., 2005b</xref>)). These results indicate that the regulation of alternative splicing is not globally perturbed within 24 hr of epileptic seizure in the mouse brain.</p><p>We validated exons that did show seizure-induced splicing changes, and examined their relationship to Nova-regulated exons. We measured the ratio of alternate exon inclusion:exclusion by RT-PCR, validating 35 targets at 4 hr and 24 hr time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). GO analysis revealed that transcripts showing these changes showed a 7.5-fold enrichment of synaptic proteins, and a 5.2-fold enrichment for proteins with serine/threonine kinase activity, including SNAP25 and BDNF, proteins shown to play important roles during synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yoshii and Constantine-Paton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kennedy and Ehlers, 2011</xref>). We have previously found that NOVA regulates ∼800 alternate splicing events, about half of which are cassette exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We examined the 35 alternate exons that showed pilocarpine-dependent changes to see which were present on our list of Nova-dependent exons, and identified only eight as Nova-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data indicate that only a small fraction of potential regulated alternate exons, including those regulated by Nova, are affected by seizure activity, and that pilocarpine does not appear to have a global impact on Nova splicing activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Cortical hyperexcitability and epilepsy in Nova2 heterozygous mice</title><p>To further assess the relationship between Nova and epilepsy, we examined EEGs in Nova-null mice.

A second abnormality observed was the spontaneous occurrence of generalized seizures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

We have previously demonstrated that NOVA shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>), and hence explored the possibility that electrical activity might affect the cellular distribution of the protein. We examined NOVA subcellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy after sham or pilocarpine induced seizures. We consistently observed marked shifts of NOVA from the neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm within 2–4 hr of pilocarpine-induced seizures, and that persisted in some animals for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This finding was evident in cortical neurons, and even more so in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, where quantitation revealed over a 6-fold shift in the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic signal intensity at 4 hr after seizure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with the cortical nature of epilepsy, we did not see this shift in NOVA localization in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These data suggest that there may in part be cell biologic mechanisms whereby pilocarpine affects the ability of NOVA to regulate splicing of some targets, but additional experiments will be required to fully understand their nature and consequences.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00178.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>NOVA subcellular localization after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NOVA and MAP2 protein localization were visualized by immunofluorescence (IF) in mouse brain sections from pilocarpine treated (pilo) or control animals (sham).

For example, the balance of binding to AU-rich elements by AUF1, BRF1, KSRP, TTP or HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meisner and Filipowicz, 2011</xref>), binding to UGUR elements by Pumillio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crittenden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quenault et al., 2011</xref>), or interactions between miRNAs and the Ago–RISC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krol et al., 2010</xref>) all feed into pathways of deadenylation and mRNA decay. Our finding that transcripts showing NOVA-dependent steady-state regulation did not have NOVA binding sites in the 3′ UTR was therefore unexpected, and might have suggested that these were indirect targets of NOVA action. However, HITS-CLIP provides a powerful means of providing unambiguous and unbiased sites of RNA–protein interaction. Directed analysis of unbiased HITS-CLIP targets can reveal cryptic biology, as in the analysis of developmental HITS-CLIP maps to study NOVA interactions with transcripts of the Reelin pathway and thereby identify a previously unknown NOVA-dependent alternative exon necessary for proper neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yano et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we have used the predictive power of HITS-CLIP to identify seemingly irrelevant intronic NOVA binding sites on transcripts showing unexplained NOVA-dependent steady-state changes to predict the presence of cryptic alternative NMD exons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NOVA-regulated splicing controls mRNA levels by NMD</title><p>NMD is an RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades mRNAs harboring premature termination codons (PTC), and is generally thought of as a means to protect cells from inadvertently producing truncated proteins that could be harmful to the cell. Such transcripts harbor downstream exon junction complex (EJC) proteins that, due to upstream PTCs, fail to be removed during an initial round of translation, leading to recruitment of NMD components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</xref>). Recent studies have extended this view, indicating that NMD can function beyond a quality control mechanism, to serve as a mechanism for regulating gene expression disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang and Wilkinson, 2012</xref>). NMD efficiency varies in different tissues, loss-of-function mutations in Upf genes in mice alter expression of a subset of transcripts, and loss-of-function mutations in Upf3b in humans are associated with intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tarpey et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Regulated alternative splicing of NMD exons has also been shown to act as a mechanism to regulate transcript levels, as in the case of autoregulation of splicing factors such as SC35, Ptbp1 and 9G8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>), as well as core components of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saltzman et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, alternative splicing-coupled NMD has been shown to regulate expression levels of Arc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giorgi et al., 2007</xref>), PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>), and spermine acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hyvönen et al., 2006</xref>), a process referred to as regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>). In yeast, a direct role for NMD was statistically inferred in the regulation of hundreds of transcripts involved in chromosomal and telomere maintenance and silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guan et al., 2006</xref>). Cancer cells have been shown to utilize NMD, for example via actions on mutant cadherin transcripts (<italic>Chd1</italic>) that are associated with poor clinical outcome in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. A full understanding of such pathways and means to manipulate them has been challenging because the factors regulating NMD-associated splicing are not generally known. Some well-studied exceptions have provided significant biologic insights, such as the autoregulation of the splicing factor PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wollerton et al., 2004</xref>) and its action on the paralogous transcript PTBP2, which mediates skipping of Ptbp2 exon 10, leading to NMD and suppression of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, Makeyev and co-workers have identified PTBP1-dependent retained introns that suppress expression of neuronal transcripts in non-neuronal cells, allowing their expression as PTBP1 is downregulated during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yap et al., 2012</xref>). We recently found that PTBP2 is expressed in neuronal progenitors, while NOVA is induced in post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>); regulation of cryptic exon splicing may affect transcript levels in neurons and/or prevent spurious expression of transcripts in non-neural cells. Another point of interest will be to assess whether there is cell-type specific regulation of PTC exons in specific neuronal types within the adult brain in a manner analogous to PTBP1 regulation of expression within different tissues of the body.</p><p>Here we show the frequent use of trans-acting control by a single neuronal splicing factor, NOVA, to regulate an array of target transcripts. This mechanism is biologically rich, as it includes both the up- and down-regulation of target RNAs through alternative splicing coupled to NMD in neuron. The regulatory roles of these actions are underscored by our observation that the cryptic NMD exons NOVA acts upon are evolutionarily conserved (Zhang and Darnell, manuscript in preparation), suggesting a regulatory rather than quality-control NOVA function. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which NOVA regulation maintains a balance of transcript levels through NOVA-dependent alternative splicing coupled NMD and, to a lesser degree, through direct interaction with 3′ UTR binding elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00178.027</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model linking electrical activity with Nova-dependent splicing of cryptic NMD exons to maintain the balance of synaptic proteins.</title><p>In WT brain, NOVA represses some cryptic NMD isoforms (small red diamonds on left) while promoting others (large red pentagons on right), thereby maintaining the balance of protein levels. To a lesser degree, NOVA also stabilizes transcripts through 3′ UTR interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In DKO brain, the absence of NOVA disturbs this balance of protein in expression, contributing to aberrations in synaptic transmission.

This suggests in turn that NOVA activity may be regulated by such dynamic events, leading to changes in RNA regulation and ultimately changes in neuronal proteins. The mechanisms that regulate NOVA are largely unknown, but interestingly, NOVA may be phosphorylated by GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dredge et al., 2005</xref>), which itself is known to be inactivated in response to various extracellular stimuli in the brain, stimulating pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>), which are activated by electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richter and Klann, 2009</xref>). Thus it is possible that neuronal cell dynamics lead to fine tuning of RNA processing and expression through RNA binding proteins that act as sensors of electrical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NOVA-regulated NMD-coupled splicing and epilepsy</title><p>There is growing interest in the relationship between alternative splicing and neuronal excitability in the brain, as underscored by the recent finding that loss of the splicing factor Rbfox1 results in increased susceptibility to seizures and concomitant splicing changes in transcripts encoding synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, NOVA interacts functionally with Rbfox1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and many of the proteins showing large Nova-dependent changes are also involved in synaptic regulation with links to epilepsy were also found to have NOVA-dependent NMD exons regulated after induction of seizures in mice. For example, NOVA regulation of NMD splicing controls the levels of DLG3, one of a family of postsynaptic density proteins, including PSD95, that transduce signals from the NMDA receptor. Increases in both PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ying et al., 2004</xref>) and DLG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qu et al., 2009</xref>) in cortex or post-synaptic fractions, respectively, have been described in brains of patients with focal cortical dysplasia and epilepsy. NOVA regulation of NMD splicing also controls the levels of SCN9a, a sodium channel initially thought to act primarily in dorsal root ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meisler et al., 2010</xref>) (neurons that do not express NOVA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckanovich et al., 1993</xref>)), but more recently found to be mutated in human epilepsy (causing familial febrile seizures; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 2009</xref>)). Other NOVA-NMD related targets in which gene mutations have been implicated in human epilepsy include the anion transporters SLC4a10 and SLC4a3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurnett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sander et al., 2002</xref>)).</p><p>The observation that either induction or loss of the same protein activity may be associated with epilepsy, suggest that the proper stoichiometry of synaptic proteins (or protein activity), rather than their absolute amount, may be a key determinant in electrical balance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This correlates with our observation that NOVA haploinsufficiency is sufficient to induce spontaneous epilepsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), an observation also made with the neuronal RNABP Elavl3 and Elavl4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, NOVA control of NMD exons can act to either up or down-regulate protein levels generated from target transcripts, and, more specifically, to act after seizure to restore balance to synaptic proteins that would inhibit further seizure (e.g. increasing SCN9a, which would presumably be anti-epileptic). Hence the normal regulation of NOVA itself may provide an RNA-based means of regulating homeostatic plasticity in the face of electrical stress.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>New links between nuclear and cytoplasm RNA regulation</title><p>We have previously found that NOVA regulates neuronal alternative splicing, and that steady-state levels of these regulated transcripts are not significantly altered in <italic>Nova</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ule et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>). The observation here of a significant set of transcripts undergoing NOVA-dependent regulation of steady-state levels on the surface therefore initially suggested that this was an independent set of NOVA actions. However, our finding that these were disproportionately NOVA-mediated actions to maintain neuronal transcript levels (215 vs 14) is consistent with an overall action linking alternative splicing suppression of NMD exons to steady-state transcript levels.</p><p>Interestingly, our data also suggested a more general link between splicing and mRNA stability. Among transcripts with NOVA 3′ UTR binding we observed a significant number also had intronic NOVA binding, suggesting a possible hierarchy of events in which nuclear binding precedes (and potentially determines) 3′ UTR binding. Such connections were originally suggested from studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in demonstration of the coupling of the splicing and localization of Oskar mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004</xref>), and the observation that the predominantly nuclear Hrb27c protein (whose mammalian homologue is the DAZAP1 splicing factor; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goina et al., 2008</xref>)) also binds to and is required for localization of <italic>Grk</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodrich et al., 2004</xref>). In mammalian cells, ZBP1 binds to actin mRNA in the nucleus and subsequently is required for its localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 2007</xref>), and NOVA binds to transcripts (e.g. GlyRα2) in introns to regulate alternative splicing and is also associated with 3′ UTR and localization of the same mRNA in the neuronal dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racca et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One potential explanation for such observations, as well as for the link between nuclear and cytoplasmic NOVA tags seen here, would be reassortment of transcripts in cis on individual transcripts, providing a means of linking nuclear functions such as alternative splicing with cytoplasmic function such as RNA localization or RNA stability. For example, intronic NOVA binding to high affinity intronic clusters would allow a high local concentration of the protein upon individual transcripts, potentially allowing rearrangement in cis and binding of additional secondary RNA elements, including those within the 3′ UTR. However, it should be noted that HITS-CLIP provides data that is a population average of many individual RNA–protein interactions, so that such potential cis-actions on a single transcript can only be inferred. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that such local concentration and one-dimensional rearrangements <italic>in cis</italic> are believed to play an important role in scanning and initiation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blainey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang and Greene, 2011</xref>), and hence may plausibly act on pre-mRNAs to distribute RNABPs <italic>in cis</italic> to coordinate different aspects of post-transcriptional regulation. In this context, it is especially notable that NOVA localization changes after seizure, suggesting that the association of NOVA with newly transcribed and spliced transcripts may be coupled in an activity-sensitive manner with their localization and/or translational control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Summary</title><p>We identified transcripts that show NOVA-dependent changes in steady-state levels in KO mice and used HITS-CLIP to drive the unexpected observation that what appeared to be functionless NOVA intronic binding sites in unregulated regions of these pre-mRNAs do function to regulate expression of cryptic NMD exons. These were enriched in transcripts encoding synaptic proteins, and their regulation mediated large changes in protein levels (up or down), including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy. The link between NOVA and regulation of excitation/inhibition balance was supported by finding that NOVA haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy, and that pilocarpine-induced seizures regulated inclusion of a relatively small number of exons, a subset of which are regulated by Nova. Moreover, Nova redistributes from the nucleus to cytoplasm following pilocarpine seizure, and providing a possible mechanism underlying seizure-associated splicing changes involving Nova-regulated exons. Collectively, our data support a model in which changes in electrical activity affect the distribution of Nova, altering the splicing of cryptic exons that elicit NMD; these changes may provide a homeostatic means of regulating levels of transcripts and proteins associated with epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>YCAY elements were amplified by PCR and added into the pd1EGFP vector (Clontech, CA).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife's</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Ben Blencowe and Doug Black.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>In this manuscript, Eom and colleagues investigate the molecular basis by which the neural-specific splicing regulator Nova controls the levels of transcripts and corresponding proteins with important functions in the synapse. Using microarray profiling they detect ∼200 genes with increased transcript levels in the brains of wild-type mice compared to brains of <italic>Nova1</italic>/<italic>Nova2</italic> double knockout (DKO) mice. A much smaller number of genes show the opposite behavior. Using HITS-CLIP data, the authors examine the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Nova binding sites in transcripts with differences in steady-state levels. While Nova binding to 3′UTR sequences appears to control the levels of some transcripts, a more widespread mechanism involves Nova binding within intronic sequences adjacent to previously unannotated exons, referred to as “occult exons” by the authors. Nova-dependent suppression or activation of the PTC-introducing exons promotes increased or decreased transcript/protein levels, respectively. The authors further use pilocarpine-induced seizures to investigate how changes in electrical activity might impact Nova-dependent regulation of transcript levels.</p><p>The results described are interesting and will appeal to researchers in the fields of gene regulation and neurobiology. Although regulation of transcript levels via alternative splicing coupled to NMD has already been described in several biological contexts, the identification of a coherent network of splicing events subject to this mode of regulation, with potentially important roles in the synapse, is a significant advance. Moreover, the use of HITS-CLIP to identify novel exons that function in regulating transcript levels is a clever application of an already powerful genome-wide approach. The reviewers have several concerns that they would like to see addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1. The authors conclude from their experiments involving pilocarpine-induced seizures that the “clear increases in utilization of the NMD exon suggest that the levels of these transcripts can be dynamically tuned by electrical activity”. However, pilocarpine-induced seizures are known to cause oxidative damage and neuronal loss (e.g., Turski et al. 1986, which the authors cite). The authors should attempt to address whether this treatment directly impacts Nova-dependent splicing activity. At the very least, they should mention the caveats of this experiment, soften their conclusions, and modify the manuscript title.</p><p>2. A possible alternative model for the physiological relevance of the authors' findings is that the Nova-dependent suppression of cryptic exons serves as a mechanism to ensure that specific neuronal transcripts are not spuriously expressed in non-neuronal cells. The authors could readily test this by performing RT-PCR assays on the Nova-regulated transcripts, +/- <italic>Upf1</italic> knockdown, in non-neural cells. In this context, it is worth noting related work of Makeyev and co-workers (<italic>G&amp;D</italic> 26, 1209; 2012), who have identified a class of Ptbp1-dependent retained introns that suppress expression of neural transcripts in non-neural cells.</p><p>3. The authors utilize a liberal cutoff in their identification of differentially expressed genes from their microarray analysis. A magnitude log<sub>2</sub> change of 0.3 corresponds to slightly less than a 1.25 fold ratio change, and given the noise inherent in microarray measurements, it is unlikely that estimated changes in this range will validate at the same rate as those changes estimated to be &gt;1.5 fold. Accordingly, the authors are requested to use qRT-PCR assays over the range of 229 genes predicted to show expression differences to assess false-positive rates. In this context, the descriptor “widespread” may be overstated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00178.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

The authors should attempt to address whether this treatment directly impacts Nova-dependent splicing activity. At the very least, they should mention the caveats of this experiment, soften their conclusions, and modify the manuscript title</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that being more circumspect here is prudent and we have revised the text to include caveats along the lines suggested. We specifically address the issue of whether neuronal loss could account for our data below and in the revised text (“Pilocarpine can induce neuronal loss days after seizure (Turski et al., 1986)…”).</p><p>We have taken the reviewers' advice and examined whether this treatment impacts Nova-dependent splicing activity more generally. We have considered carefully our response particularly in light of the editorial policy at <italic>eLife</italic>, which seems to be governed by good sense in providing consensus and focus to reviewer comments and efforts to avoid onerous burdens proposing new lines of research in response to the reviews. We applaud this approach, recognizing that unreasonable demands for additional manuscripts' worth of data may be made by other top-tier journals, and that <italic>eLife</italic> wishes to avoid such demands. At the same time, we interpret <italic>eLife</italic> policy as allowing a reasonable degree of discretion in the detail with which authors choose to respond to the reviewers' questions. In this case, we have responded to the reviewers' comment that we “should attempt to address” Nova's effects on splicing, which we interpret as a suggestion (and not a demand) by doing the full experiment, and we now report the results in this revision in tremendous detail. We include a large amount of very high quality experimental data that we were planning to use as the basis for a separate manuscript. Our intention here is to strengthen the paper significantly, and also to pay genuine respect the reviewers' concerns and to the ethos of the new <italic>eLife</italic> journal itself, by responding to the option to do additional work with the maximum, rather than minimum, response.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we present new experiments analyzing splicing data in mouse brain in various regions (hippocampus and cortex), at different timepoints (4 and 24 hours) and using several platforms (exon junction arrays and RNA-Seq). We go on to experimentally validate this data, and to overlay this analysis with an examination of Nova-dependent splicing as requested. We supplement this validation of RNA levels by examining Nova-dependent cell biology with a completely new finding that may be impacting Nova's effects on the splicing of some transcripts. Finally, we document the physiologic relevance of the Nova-dependent/activity-dependent splicing and cell distribution changes in aggregate by showing that Nova2 KO and indeed, heterozygous mice, have spontaneous seizures.</p><p>These new data are presented in the sections entitled “Dynamic control of NOVA-regulated NMD exons”, “Cortical hyperexcitability and epilepsy in Nova2 heterozygous mice”, and “Activity-dependent changes in NOVA subcellular localization”. In sum, the new experiments address in molecular and cell biologic detail the effects of pilocarpine-induced seizures on Nova biology, and further tie Nova biology to naturally occurring seizures in the haploinsufficient state.</p><p>More precisely, in response to the reviewers' question, these new data allow us to conclude the following:</p><p>“We examined the 35 alternate exons that showed pilocarpine-dependent changes to see which were present on our list of Nova-dependent exons, and identified only 8 as Nova-regulated (Table 3). These data indicate that only a small fraction of potential regulated alternate exons, including those regulated by Nova, are affected by seizure activity, and that pilocarpine does not appear to have a global impact on Nova splicing activity.”</p><p>“Thus perturbing NOVA steady-state levels <italic>in vivo</italic> has relevant physiologic consequences, as haploinsufficiency is sufficient to give rise to spontaneous epilepsy in mice.”</p><p>“We consistently observed marked shifts of NOVA from the neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm within 2-4 hours of pilocarpine-induced seizures … These data suggest that there may in part be a cell biologic mechanism whereby pilocarpine might affect the ability of NOVA to regulate splicing of some targets, but additional experimental follow-up of these observations will be required to fully understand their nature and consequences.”</p><p>These new data are presented in the following:</p><p>• Table 2: Global changes in splicing after pilocarpine seizure</p><p>• Table 3: Validation and splicing changes in Nova-regulated targets.</p><p>• Figure 6: Nova haploinsufficient mice have spontaneous epilepsy</p><p>• Figure 7: Pilocarpine seizures induce a change in Nova subcellular localization.</p><p>We note that the sorts of damage the reviewers are concerned about (e.g., Turski et al., as well as a number of subsequent papers) involve neuronal loss happening as a relatively distant event after the induction of pilocarpine seizures. In contrast, we are examining RNA by qRT-PCR 2 hours after seizure.</p><p>To be more explicit, Turski et al find evidence of neuronal damage at 5–7 days post pilocarpine seizure. The earliest they noted this was 48 hours. Moreover, they found that pre-treating animals with the muscarinic agonist scopolamine abrogated the severe neuronal damage; we pre-treated animals with 1mg/kg scopolamine 30 minutes prior to pilocarpine injection. Importantly, this pilocarpine protocol is generally used to induce kindling and long-term chronic epilepsy, which, as the reviewers point out, definitely induces long-term neuronal stress including death. On the other hand, the protocol also works as an acute stress—in fact, we used this protocol following discussion and recommendation from one of the world's experts in mouse epileptology, Jeff Noebels, who collaborated with us on a recent paper (Ince-Dunn et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2012). Jeff is now included as a co-author on the current manuscript, along with Huidong Wang, given their role in generating and analyzing the more extensive data collection we are including here.</p><p>To more directly address the reviewers' concern, we have now performed immunofluorescence microscopy in the hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum, in a series of time points from 1 to 24 hours after pilocarpine-induced seizures (Figure 7). We find no evidence of neuronal loss. Interestingly, however, we noted a redistribution of Nova protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, an observation that is both cell-specific (evident in seizing cortical/hippocampus neurons, but not Purkinje neurons, which are not a focus of epileptic seizure) and protein-specific (we see no changes in Map2 staining).</p><p><italic>2. A possible alternative model for the physiological relevance of the authors' findings is that the Nova-dependent suppression of cryptic exons serves as a mechanism to ensure that specific neuronal transcripts are not spuriously expressed in non-neuronal cells. The authors could readily test this by performing RT-PCR assays on the Nova-regulated transcripts, +/- Upf1 knockdown, in non-neural cells. In this context, it is worth noting related work of Makeyev and co-workers (G&amp;D 26, 1209; 2012), who have identified a class of Ptbp1-dependent retained introns that suppress expression of neural transcripts in non-neural cells</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers make the interesting connection between the observations of Nova regulation and Ptbp1 regulation of transcript levels through regulation of PTC exons. The point is well made, specifically the idea that there could be cell-type specific regulation of PTC exons/protein levels within the nervous system in a manner analogous to Ptbp1 regulation of expression levels within different tissues of the body. This issue, including the Makeyev citation, has now been added to the text.</p><p>However, we do not believe that it is possible that Nova acts <italic>in vivo</italic> in the manner suggested, as there is no appreciable expression of Nova outside of neurons of the central nervous system (barring trace amounts of RNA detectable by RT-PCR only, whose significance is unclear, but may represent rare truncated transcript isoforms [unpublished data]).</p><p>In summary, while we could undertake transfections into non-neuronal cells, adding back exogenous Nova to demonstrate Nova-dependent and Upf1-dependent regulation of NMD exons, the experiment would not be as physiologically relevant as the experiments we have done. Specifically, we demonstrate in primary neurons expressing endogenous Nova, or in primary Nova DKO neurons, that the Nova-regulated splicing of NMD exons is required to control Upf1-mediated control of mRNA levels.</p><p><italic>3. The authors utilize a liberal cutoff in their identification of differentially expressed genes from their microarray analysis. A magnitude log2 change of 0.3 corresponds to slightly less than a 1.25 fold ratio change, and given the noise inherent in microarray measurements, it is unlikely that estimated changes in this range will validate at the same rate as those changes estimated to be &gt;1.5 fold. Accordingly, the authors are requested to use qRT-PCR assays over the range of 229 genes predicted to show expression differences to assess false-positive rates. In this context, the descriptor “widespread” may be overstated</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers' point, and have now re-examined our validation data as requested. We present the new data in a revised Table 1. All qRT-PCR was done with 3 biologic replicates (3 animals) and three technical replicates (9 reactions per point). In these data we present analysis of 15 transcripts, with P-values and fold changes analyzed, that are examined using the original liberal cutoff, and, as requested, analysis of 7 new transcripts with much small changes, in the range requested by the reviewers. Perhaps because of the stringency with which we performed both the microarray analysis and the experimental validation, even here the small changes predicted by microarray were consistently seen with the qRT-PCR data, although the quantitative correlation was not as strong overall as for data showing larger changes. In any case, the basic data is now open for readers to review and judge for themselves; we would conclude that the false–positive rate, even for small changes, is relatively low.</p><p>To avoid any confusion, we deleted the descriptor “widespread”. We also rewrote relevant text, as in the following (which previously referred to “widespread”): “Taken together, these data indicate the extensive use of NOVA in steady-state neurons to inhibit cryptic NMD exons, and, to a lesser degree, mediate inclusion of NMD exons, as a means to maintain or reduce, respectively, the steady-state levels of neuronal transcripts and proteins.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
