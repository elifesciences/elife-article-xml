experience and a primary driver of adaptive behavior. Pavlovian fear and reward learning paradigms are widely used in preclinical research to probe mechanisms of valence learning but with limited consideration of sex as a biological variable despite known sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impaired valence. Here, we compare appetitive-only, aversive-only, and mixed-valence cue–outcome Pavlovian conditioning paradigms in male and female mice to dissociate effects of context, valence, and salience in a sex-specific manner. Using a data-driven approach to identify behaviors indicative of valence learning in an unbiased manner, we compare task performance between paradigms in male and female mice. We show that while male and female mice acquire appetitive and aversive associations in both single- and mixed-valence paradigms, sex differences emerge in single-valence paradigms. Ultimately, we show that these apparent sex differences in valence learning are driven by non-specific baseline differences in exploratory behavior. Males explore more at baseline, altering their trajectory of cue–reward association acquisition, whereas females explore less at baseline, increasing shock-facilitated freezing in aversive-only contexts, masking cue discrimination. Overall, our findings illustrate how task design differentially impacts behavioral expression in male and female mice and demonstrate that mixed-valence paradigms afford a more accurate assessment of valence learning in both sexes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Emotions are fundamental to our experience and essential to our survival. They shape how we react to the world, interact with others or make decisions. But emotions are difficult to study because they are complex and subjective. One key building block of emotion is valence – the sentiment that something feels good (positive) or bad (negative).</p><p>Valence strongly shapes behavior. We avoid unpleasant experiences and seek out rewarding ones. Animals, including humans, learn to anticipate such outcomes when neutral cues become linked to positive or negative events, a process called associative learning. Problems in this type of learning are central to many psychiatric disorders. For example, anxiety can involve overgeneralizing fear, depression often shows reduced positive memories with a bias toward negative memories, and post-traumatic stress disorder is marked by intrusive traumatic associations. These disorders also show clear differences between men and women.</p><p>To study the biology of valence learning, researchers often use mice and train them to associate cues with either rewards, i.e., ‘appetitive outcomes’, or punishments, i.e., ’aversive outcomes’. However, most studies look at only one type of outcome in isolation, even though real-life situations often involve both. In addition, research has often included only male mice or applies behavioral phenotypes established in male mice to females without considering the influence of sex differences.</p><p>Schuler et al. set out to answer how the presence of only positive, or only negative or both valences together influences associative learning and its behavioral expression in male and female mice. This question arose because few studies have examined mixed-valence learning, and findings on sex differences in reward and threat learning are inconsistent. We need to understand this because sex differences are prevalent in valence-related psychopathologies, and we need robust models to study these phenomena in both sexes.</p><p>The researchers developed a novel mixed-valence conditioning protocol, in which mice are exposed to both positively and negatively valenced stimuli in the same context. They then identified predictors of learning in a data-driven way and found that field-standard metrics perform poorly in evaluating performance. Applying data-driven metrics to evaluate performance during training revealed sex-specific behaviors in the single-valenced protocols; for example, female performance suggested poor discrimination of cues in the aversive-only protocol, while males appeared to take longer to acquire positive associations. These apparent sex differences were not observed in mice trained in the mixed valence protocol. This shows that male and female mice can learn equally well about appetitive and aversive outcomes.</p><p>These apparent sex differences in learning are due to an underlying sex difference in exploration, where males have a higher baseline level of exploratory behaviors. Finally, they demonstrated that females are more sensitive to the delivery of repeated foot shocks, showing higher generalization of pausing response in the aversive-only protocol. This difference is not indicative of a lack of learning, but rather a consequence of differences in exploration specific to the aversive-only context.</p><p>Schuler et al. present a novel mixed-valence conditioning protocol for freely moving mice. This protocol overcomes limitations in classically employed fear- and reward-conditioning protocols and will allow researchers in behavioral and systems neuroscience to disentangle behavioral and neural correlates of normative salience and valence processing, as well as disruptions in animal models for psychiatric disorders. This work highlights the critical importance of considering sex when establishing behavior protocols and describes a novel approach for rigorously evaluating in-depth behavioral phenotyping data, a fundamental concern that has received far less attention than the development of phenotyping tools themselves.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>valence</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01gavpb45</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#180648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagot</surname><given-names>Rosemary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02eqrsj93</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuler</surname><given-names>Heike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01gavpb45</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#195897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagot</surname><given-names>Rosemary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep behavioral phenotyping reveals that performance readouts from single-valence conditioning are biased by baseline sex differences in exploration, and mixed-valence conditioning provides a clearer assessment of learning in both sexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding how emotion is represented in the brain remains a major challenge for modern neuroscience. The complex and subjective nature of human emotional experience challenges efforts to uncover its mechanism. While emotion is complex, valence, the intrinsic attractiveness or aversiveness of a stimulus or state, is fundamental and translates across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolphs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gündem et al., 2022</xref>). Valence guides adaptive behavior: aversive stimuli are avoided, and appetitive stimuli elicit approach. Through associative learning, cues that predict valenced stimuli shape behavior in anticipation of the outcome. Disruptions in valence learning are implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Admon and Pizzagalli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Chiara, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lissek et al., 2005</xref>). For example, patients with major depressive disorder display negative biases in memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brittlebank et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas and Porter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maniglio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noworyta et al., 2021</xref>), anxiety disorders are generally defined by maladaptive threat generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lissek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vandael et al., 2025</xref>), and patients with post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from intrusive memories of traumatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehlers and Clark, 2000</xref>). Notably, sex differences exist in the prevalence, symptom presentation, and severity of these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuehner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McLean et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Preclinical Pavlovian conditioning protocols are widely used to study mechanisms of valence learning in rodents. Mice or rats learn to associate either an auditory or visual cue or a context (conditioned stimulus; CS) with an inherently valenced stimulus, such as an electric foot shock (unconditioned stimulus; US). Fear conditioning is widely used as a model of associative valence learning. Reward conditioning protocols are less frequently employed, partially because rodents take substantially longer to form reward than fear associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deseyve et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Domingues et al., 2025</xref>). In both instances, animals learn about a single valence in isolation, yet real-world environments commonly engender outcomes of both valences. The presence of opposite valence outcomes is known to influence learning, yet this has received little attention of late (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Konorski, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laurent et al., 2022</xref>). Single-valence tasks can conflate cue and context learning and confound valence with salience because valenced outcomes are inherently salient. Despite this, limited research has simultaneously examined appetitive and aversive learning in part due to the scarcity of protocols that dissociate opposing valence processes, especially in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lefner and Moghaddam, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ray et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ray et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To date, few studies have examined associative learning in mixed-valence contexts and even fewer have examined both sexes. The few studies that have considered sex as a biological variable point to potential sex differences in both threat and reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lefner et al., 2022</xref>). However, findings are inconsistent and limitations in experimental designs preclude a clear understanding of the interaction of sex and valence learning. This is particularly important given prevalent sex differences in valence-related psychopathologies, in which often processing of both positive and negative valences is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuehner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McLean et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we asked how the presence of more than one valence influences learning and behavioral expression of learning in male and female mice to comprehensively profile sex differences in valence learning. We trained male and female mice in purely appetitive, purely aversive, or mixed-valence conditioning tasks and used data-driven behavioral profiling combined with a partial least squares discriminant analysis to distill learning-relevant behaviors in both sexes. We show that both sexes acquire appetitive and aversive associations, yet task design differentially influences behavioral expression of learning-relevant behaviors in males and females. Examining the evolution of learning across tasks revealed baseline sex differences in exploratory behaviors that mask learned cue discrimination in a context-dependent manner. Ultimately, we show that a mixed-valence context minimizes sex differences in exploration to more accurately probe valence learning in both sexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Standard metrics of valence learning suggest poor task performance</title><p>Because valenced stimuli are inherently salient, single-valence paradigms conflate salience and valence.

These observations are robust across a range of freezing thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further, overall freezing levels were higher in the aversive-only paradigm.

In contrast, males similarly discriminate CS<sup>S</sup> from CS<sup>−</sup> in both paradigms. The misclassification of CS<sup>R</sup> as CS<sup>−</sup> in males and CS<sup>−</sup> as CS<sup>S</sup> in females suggests that males are exhibiting more CS<sup>−</sup>-associated behaviors (‘<italic>rearing</italic>’ and ‘<italic>locomoting</italic>’) during the CS<sup>R</sup> and that females are showing less of these same behaviors during the CS<sup>−</sup> and more of the CS<sup>S</sup>-associated <italic>pausing</italic> behaviors. Integrating these observations led us to hypothesize that a common underlying factor of exploration might explain the observed sex differences in cue responding in single-valence protocols.</p><p>We reasoned that, if exploration drives sex-specific cue responding, sex differences in exploration should be apparent even before training begins. Specifically, we predicted that males explore more than females. To test this, we compared exploration on the habituation day and pre-cue periods during training by quantifying the total percent time in any <italic>rearing</italic> or <italic>locomoting</italic> syllable (from here on summarized as ‘<italic>exploring</italic>’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This confirmed that males explore more than females throughout the habituation day when no valenced outcomes have been presented. During the pre-cue period, there were no sex differences in exploration in the mixed-valence paradigm. However, as predicted, in the appetitive-only paradigm, males explored more than females, and in the aversive-only paradigm, this trend was maintained. To confirm that elevated exploration inhibits the expression of valence-specific behaviors, we correlated these metrics, confirming the predicted negative relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Overall, this demonstrates that behavioral expression in single-valence paradigms is biased by sex differences in exploration. This bias is not present in a mixed-valenced paradigm, suggesting that a mixed-valenced paradigm provides a more accurate assessment of valence learning. Performance in the mixed-valenced paradigm demonstrates that both sexes <italic>can</italic> similarly learn valenced associations, yet it is not clear why females fail to do this in the aversive-only context.

To test this, we correlated <italic>exploration</italic> and <italic>pausing</italic> between the pre-cue and cue periods for CS<sup>−</sup> and CS<sup>S</sup>. We reasoned that, if cue onset elicits a distinct behavioral response, behavior between pre-cue and cue periods will not correlate. Indeed, for the CS<sup>S</sup>, we observed no significant pre-cue to cue correlation in either paradigm or sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, for the CS<sup>−</sup>, we observed consistent, strong correlation across paradigms and sexes indicating that behavior during the CS<sup>−</sup> cue period is a continuation of contextually mediated behavior and not a distinct cue-mediated response.</p><p>Altered pre-cue responding likely reflects the combination of the acute impact of innately appetitive or aversive outcomes encountered during the current session and the evolving associative history of the context. Both factors contribute on training days, whereas on the recall day, only the associative history of the context is present. In the aversive-only paradigm, while females failed to show evidence of CS<sup>−</sup> versus CS<sup>S</sup> discrimination during training, this was clearly evidenced on the recall day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that pre-cue differences are in part attributable to acute effects of outcome presentations. We reasoned that this effect will be amplified across the session as the impact of successive outcomes accrues but would not be apparent on the non-reinforced recall session. To test this, we compared <italic>pausing</italic> during the pre-cue, CS<sup>S</sup>, and CS<sup>−</sup> periods for early (first two) and late (final two) cue presentations on training days 1 and 13 and recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). In the mixed paradigm, as expected, male and female mice <italic>paused</italic> more in the late pre-cue periods on both training day 1 and 13 but not during recall, suggesting a modest influence of outcomes. In the aversive-only paradigm, this modulation was stronger in both sexes on training day 1; however, by training end, this was no longer evident in males, but females continued to show elevated <italic>pausing</italic> across the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that males, but not females, habituated to footshock, downregulating outcome-induced pausing across training days. As predicted, in females, this phenomenon was also evident in CS<sup>−</sup> responding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), but no such difference was observed for the CS<sup>S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Overall, this suggests that, in females, shock exposure acutely potentiates <italic>pausing</italic> specifically in the aversive-only paradigm and that this obscures CS<sup>−</sup> discrimination. This demonstrates that task-dependent sex differences in non-associative learning processes can mask similar underlying associative learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the fundamental importance of valence learning to health and disease, limited research has simultaneously explored associative valence learning in male and female mice. Here, we compared mixed- and single-valence paradigms and revealed critical effects of task design on exploration and habituation, a form of non-associative learning, that interact with sex to alter behavioral expressions of learning. We demonstrate that both male and female mice can successfully acquire appetitive and aversive cue–outcome associations across mixed- and single-valence tasks. Using data-driven approaches to interrogate cue-mediated behavioral changes, we identify robust performance metrics of cue–outcome associations that are applicable across paradigms and sexes. Critically, we show that behavior in single-valence paradigms is biased by pre-existing sex differences in exploratory behaviors that mask behavioral expression of cue learning, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions of sex differences in associative valence learning. Our analyses demonstrate that performance in the mixed-valence protocol is less biased by baseline sex differences in exploratory behaviors, thereby allowing more accurate assessment of learning.</p><p>Our findings shed new light on previously reported sex differences in single-valence learning tasks.

Superficially, we replicate these findings in an aversive-only protocol, but comparison to the mixed-valence protocol suggests that these observations do not reflect an inherent inability of female mice to discriminate between the CS<sup>S</sup> and the CS<sup>−</sup>. Rather, we show that the lack of discrimination is driven by lack of habituation to repeated shock, a form of non-associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ardiel and Rankin, 2010</xref>), and pre-existing sex differences in the propensity to engage in exploration. Research in rats has previously shown darting as a female-specific sexually divergent response in fear conditioning, a feature we did not observe in our data, possibly due to species or apparatus differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>) or CS characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trott et al., 2022a</xref>). Research in reward learning, while sparser, has also suggested sex differences, with male rodents showing less robust reward conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lefner et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that apparent sex differences in single-valence learning tasks are driven by underlying differences in exploration that mask cue learning in each sex depending on context and are not true learning differences. The underlying neurobiological causes for these sex-specific effects of context on behavior will be an interesting target for future research.</p><p>Sex differences in exploratory behavior in mice have previously been reported in other tasks. For example, in a reward-based decision-making task, males had overall higher levels of exploration than females, but females were able to learn from exploration more quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). Curiously, other research suggests increased velocity or rearing in female rodents compared to males in the open field test or social interaction test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McElroy and Howland, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuler et al., 2025</xref>). This indicates that sex differences in exploration may be task specific with increased exploration in females in anxiety-inducing contexts, consistent with reports that increased locomotion is a female-specific anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuler et al., 2025</xref>). Overall, this study adds to the growing literature on the nuances of sex differences in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greiner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pellman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shansky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tronson, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis highlights the importance of task design in shaping behavioral expression. We find elevated periods of immobility in the aversive-only paradigm compared to the mixed-valence paradigm for both sexes, suggesting an increased influence of contextual learning in single-valence fear learning. This is consistent with the varying predictive value of contexts between single and mixed-valence paradigms. In the single-valence paradigm, the only salient outcome that is encountered is foot shock, making the context a relatively good predictor of outcome. In contrast, in the mixed-valence paradigm, two salient, oppositely valenced outcomes are encountered – footshock and reward – rendering the context a poor predictor of outcome. In this way, mixed-valence contexts reduce contextual learning and better isolate cue-modulation of behavior, limiting the influence of pre-existing sex differences in exploration on behavioral expression. Reduced habituation to repeated shock in female mice was also task dependent and was restricted to the aversive-only setting. This suggests a female-specific sensitivity to repetitive aversive experiences, suggesting a potentially important sex-specific phenotype for future studies with relevance to human sex differences in neuropsychiatric conditions. Our findings emphasize the need for caution in interpreting sex differences in task performance and illustrate the impact of task design.</p><p>In line with previous research, our findings also emphasize the power of rigorously applied data-driven approaches in behavioral neuroscience in re-evaluating long-standing assumptions and identifying sex-specific phenotypes in behaviors previously established exclusively on male data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuler et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shansky, 2024</xref>). Our data show that relying exclusively on existing behavioral metrics can be misleading when developing a novel behavioral protocol. Data-driven approaches, as the one employed in this study, remove biased and preconceived notions from the interpretation of animal behavior, leading to identification of behaviors solely revealed from the data structure with minimal human interference. PLS-DA provides a novel way to understand and interpret the high-dimensional data produced by pose estimation and behavioral classifiers. Behavioral classifiers can identify a large number of syllables, and rigorously comparing the duration spent in each syllable between outcomes of interest is not feasible due to the large amount of multiple testing corrections required in combination with usually small sample sizes in behavioral neuroscience experiments. As compared to unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis, PLS-DA identifies axes of variance in the predictors that are correlated with the outcome. This makes it a useful approach in that it explicitly captures features that play an important role in outcome prediction. We present a blueprint for rigorously identifying relevant behavioral metrics of learning in both sexes that can be applied across a wide variety of paradigms, including animal models of neuropsychiatric disease.</p><p>We established a mixed-valence paradigm with robust behavioral readouts in male and female mice. While similar tasks have been previously designed in rats or in mouse head-fixed setups, it has been challenging to study approach and avoidance behavior in a within-subject design in freely moving mice. We note that, specifically for approach behavior, standard readouts such as head entries or licks perform poorly in quantifying individual learning. This challenge is perhaps reflected in the scarcity of publications that report cue-based reward learning in freely moving mice. We observed that in both appetitive-only and mixed-valence paradigms, mice do not physically enter the food port until reward delivery, yet other approach behaviors are evident in video-based quantification. Using advanced behavioral classification to overcome this challenge, we identified simple behavioral measures that can be easily applied in future using simpler tracking methods (e.g., ezTrack). The mixed-valence paradigm effectively isolates valence learning and overcomes limitations of single-valence approaches to model real-world learning in which mixed-valence outcomes are commonly encountered. However, several important task parameters that influence learning and behavior remain to be further explored, including varying the US modality and US salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 2024</xref>). Further, the precise setup of the conditioning apparatus will likely also influence task performance. For example, our use of a non-retractable food port allowed mice to consume chocolate milk even after the cue ends, potentially slowing learning compared to a retractable reward delivery apparatus, in which mice can only consume chocolate milk during the cue period. Future work could fully explore the parameter space in appetitive- and aversive-only protocols to fully understand the boundaries of sex-specific effects.</p><p>To conclude, we demonstrate that both males and females are able to acquire appetitive and aversive associations in both single- and mixed-valence paradigms, yet the expression of this learning is shaped by task design. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of robust behavioral phenotyping in both sexes to achieve accurate insight into learning. We compared single- and mixed-valence paradigms and revealed how task variables and experimental design considerations differentially impact behavioral expression in male and female mice in cued valence learning. Most importantly, we show that learning assessed in single-valence paradigms is biased by sex differences in exploration and that mixed-valence contexts minimize these non-task relevant sex differences to provide an unobscured assessment of learning in both sexes. Leveraging mixed-valence learning protocols in combination with in vivo circuit interrogation techniques and animal models for disease promises to provide clear insight into the mechanisms of valence processing in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Seven-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were group-housed by sex (<italic>n</italic> = 5/cage) for 1 week prior to experiments.

To balance these considerations, protocols incorporated more appetitive cue–outcome pairings than aversive cue–outcome pairings.

Each conditioning session began with a 2-min habituation period, followed by presentations of auditory cues (CS) in random order separated by a variable inter-trial interval (average 180 s). The appetitive CS (CS Reward; CS<sup>R</sup>) was paired with 30 µl of chocolate milk dispensed into the food port. The aversive CS (CS Shock; CS<sup>S</sup>) was paired with a 0.5-mA foot shock delivered through the grid floor for 0.5 s. The CS<sup>−</sup> was not paired with any outcome. Auditory cues were presented for 15 s, with outcomes delivered randomly within the final 5 s of the cue.

E.g. freezing and 'pausing'.</p><p>Regarding the differences between learning and performance. It is my view that only really performance on the recall test can be thought of as a true measurement of learning, and that all the differences reported during acquisition might reflect learning differences but might also affect performance differences (or a mixture of both). For example, in my experience, footshock causes mice to have several locomotor responses (e.g. running, jumping etc), and as noted by the authors themselves, animals that take longer to drink chocolate milk delivered to the magazine might accrue more head entry measurements. If male or female mice differ on these measures systematically, it could affect acquisition performance. Moreover, it could do so differentially in single versus mixed valence paradigms. My suggestion is that the authors insert a bit more caution into their interpretations of acquisition performance as reflecting 'learning' differences.</p><p>Figures 3-4 have statistics in the caption, but I couldn't find statistics for the data reported in Figures 1 and 2. These should be reported in text or in the caption (in a manner consistent with Figures 3-4).</p><p>Regarding behavioural overlap/independence of behavioural measures, as the authors have done such a thorough job of assessing behaviour, and used regressions, I feel like this has probably been taken into account. However, I am not sure this has been communicated as well as it could be. For instance, when a mouse is being measured for pausing, could it also be scored as freezing? Or are the authors thinking of these as separable constructs? If so, what makes them separable? If this could be spelled out a bit more clearly that would be helpful to readers like me.</p><p>Figure 1B-E – is the x axis showing Day (as in 1A) or seconds? This is confusing and should be labelled. It reads as Day as it is the same scale as Figure 1A (labelled as Day), but in the text it is mentioned that significant differences in responding are only observed in the last 10 seconds of the CS presentation, which appears to correlate with the significance lines and asterisks.</p><p>On page 10 it is suggested that there is a &quot;lack of evidence of acquisition observed with standard behavioural metrics&quot;. I found this confusing because I thought that there is evidence of acquisition using these metrics, as reported in Figure 1 (only not for males in the mixed valence learning). That is, the animals do diverge in their head entries/freezing as appropriate in the last 5 secs of CS presentation, which makes perfect sense as this is when the outcomes are delivered. So I'm not entirely sure what the authors mean here and suggest that they make it clearer.</p><p>Page 3, I believe there should be a full stop (period) after the brackets containing references?</p><p>Page 5 – Is &quot;analysis data&quot; meant to read &quot;data analysis&quot;?</p><p>Is mixed-valence paradigm learning superior or just different (page 14)? I would argue that it's just different. As mentioned before, it is only really the test data that can be thought of as a true measure of learning, and I am not sure this claim can be made unless the authors are directly comparing the amount of learning to an appetitive CS or aversive CS across the two paradigms. I don't see these direct comparisons reported so I am not sure this claim can be made. I also feel that, in life, there are paradigms that are primarily aversive or appetitive, so I'm not sure it's even useful to try and claim that one type of learning is superior over another.</p><p>Cathy S. Chen is listed as a reference when all the other references just refer to the last name. Suggest consistency E.g. Page 18.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Schuler and colleagues describes a powerful set of analyses that reveal that our assumptions about how our measurements of affective behaviors, especially pavlovian conditioned responses, may be influenced by sex, as well as species.</p><p>A first strength is the use of unbiased pose estimation techniques to understand mouse behavior in these conditioning paradigms, rather than assuming the standard measures are the whole story. The vast majority of behavioral tasks for mice were &quot;ported&quot; from (usually male) rats, and this has sometimes led to belated recognition that we may be failing to account for species-specific affective behaviors in mice. This can lead, for example, to assumptions that mice &quot;can't learn&quot; paradigms, when it may be more accurate to say we are simply not measuring their learning appropriately. It is certainly the case that Figure 1 and Figure S2 present a mediocre picture of learning using some standard measures. However, by using pose estimation and applying a linear classifier to the full set of individual behavioral postures, the authors are able to classify behaviors as being conditioned responses to a reward or shock-associated cue in Figure 2, with some intriguing nuances due to sex that they explore in the rest of the paper. These data are convincing in part because the behavior contributing most to the classifier for reward associated cues are port orientation behaviors, and the behavior contributing to shock associated cues are pausing – in other words, the same classes of valenced behavior previously linked with these behaviors are showing up again, but using techniques that accommodate features of how mice move and behave. We have long known that pavlovian conditioned responses are multimodal, and novel techniques like this may now allow us to analyze all relevant behaviors.</p><p>A second strength is the careful analysis of how exploration interacts with the valence of events to lead to sex biases in behavior. They find that exploratory behavior (defined as rearing and locomoting) is negatively correlated in all animals with the strength of conditioning for both shock and reward associated cues – but they also find that male mice are more likely to continue to show these behaviors to a neutral cue during reward conditioning. Conversely, female mice are more likely to engage non-cue elicited pause behaviors by shock experiences. Collectively, these findings suggest that individual biases in exploratory behavior, including those associated with sex, have to be taken into account when analyzing behaviors. Further, the finding that exploratory behavior is generally negatively correlated with the expression of conditioned responses suggests that there are competing demands in the brain to respond to cues or to explore the environment, and that animals can't do both at once. This is a very interesting implication of this paper.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One weakness is generalizability of the findings. The authors had to make some judgement calls about their pavlovian conditioning parameters (how strong, how frequent, etc). A full parametric analysis manipulating these settings is not necessarily warranted, but it is worth considering if these effects needed to be in this &quot;sweet spot&quot; to reveal themselves. This could particularly inform the conclusions about the influence of exploration versus exploratory pauses as the mechanism leading to sex differences in behaviors. In other words, if shock intensity, or number of pairings, or some other variable is manipulated, does this elicit higher levels of nonspecific pausing in male mice? Would a more salient appetitive training paradigm reduce male exploratory behavior during relevant cues? It may be the case that the sex differences they observe in aversive and appetitive learning are differentially influenced by these manipulations, which would point to specific mechanisms regulating sex differences in exploratory behavior. This is a minor weakness and could be the focus of follow up work.</p><p>A second related weakness is the missed opportunity to use manipulations to discover the origins of these differences. In addition to task manipulations proposed in the previous paragraph, one could imagine a variety of manipulations to tease out the neural mechanisms regulating exploration during learning, either as a sex difference question or as a neural circuit question within sex (since Figures 2 and 3 suggest a good deal of within-sex variability in these traits). This is a minor weakness and could be the focus of follow up work.</p><p>The figures are somewhat challenging to read, in part because the differences between symbols (e.g. circle versus diamond) or the colors of CS- versus CSs were not as easy to discriminate as the authors might have hoped.</p><p>There is a typo/run on sentence in the second paragraph of the introduction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A data-driven approach is used in this study to provide a comprehensive analysis of mouse behaviour in a single vs mixed valence conditioning paradigm. The inclusion of both sexes is a major strength, and the description of the data-driven approach is appreciated and encourages a broader perspective on how to assess mouse behaviour in response to appetitive and aversive conditioning. While the data-driven approach is clearly described, the findings are rather exploratory. The value of this approach is present in the text, but is not convincing in its current state. Other issues relate to what is lacking from the text. Definitions of the behaviours should be presented in an easy to reference manner. It took me a while to locate the definition of pausing. It is still unclear how pausing is different than freezing, other than the timing of when it is measured. How did the authors come to their choices for exploratory behaviours and to what extent have they been shown to be sex-neutral, being less common in one sex than the other.</p><p>The authors briefly mentioned some research on female rats displaying darting behaviour and they state that they were unable to measure this in their mice. It is unclear why this is the case. This behaviour has also been detected in mice, including in a study published in the same journal.</p><p>Finally, what are the group sizes?</p><p>In addition to addressing the comments above, more emphasis should be placed on the value of this approach for the field, including how it can be adopted by others in preclinical studies addressing neuropsychiatric conditions with known sex differences. The writing can also be improved to more explicitly describe how the available findings can better reflect our understanding of sex differences in neuropsychiatric conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108498.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Highly in-depth behavioural assessments, with multiple behaviours measured and compared to assess aversive and appetitive learning.</p><p>Interesting data investigating sex differences in baseline exploration – something that is often overlooked.</p><p>The fact that findings highlight the need to take into consideration how tasks are designed when interpreting studies that demonstrate sex differences or, really, learning differences of any kind.</p><p>Well written overall.</p><p>Interesting and insightful discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful evaluation of both the strengths and the weaknesses of our work.

We agree with the reviewer that there is a difference between learning and performance, which is generally overlooked, but our findings suggest is critical. The reviewer is correct in raising the consideration that the presence of the US influences performance. For this reason, in all analyses behavior is evaluated only during the pre-outcome period, and the period of outcome delivery is excluded to avoid conflating response to the cue with the acute effects of outcome delivery. The reviewer makes the valid and important point that experience during the protocols may affect learning rate. We do not intend to claim that learning is better in the mixed-valence protocol, a point further addressed in response to another of the reviewer’s comment below. Rather, we argue that performance in the mixed-valence protocol provides a better approximation of learning that is less biased by underlying sex-differences than afforded by performance readouts in single-valence protocols. We have edited the language to incorporate the reviewer’s feedback and to ensure consistency in the usage of performance and learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 3-4 have statistics in the caption, but I couldn't find statistics for the data reported in Figures 1 and 2. These should be reported in text or in the caption (in a manner consistent with Figures 3-4).</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that statistical results should be reported in the text or figure legends where possible, we have opted to include them in a table within the supplementary file for Figure 1. We made this decision given the large number of contrasts performed for each sub figure, the inclusion of which would make the figure legend challenging to follow. Fully reporting all statistical comparisons for Figure 1 would require 15 days * 3 cue type comparisons for each sex and each model (mixed, appetitive) for Figures B and C (i.e., 90 contrasts total) and 6 days * 3 cue type comparisons for each sex and each model (mixed, aversive) for Figures D and E (i.e., 36 contrasts total). We do not believe that listing the test statistic and significance for 126 contrasts will aid the understanding of the analysis more than it will impair following the description of the analyses. For this reason, we compiled this important information in a supplementary table that is referenced in the legend and invite the reader to access this should they wish to evaluate all the test statistics, their significance and the overall model fit.</p><p>Similarly, we have decided against including the test statistic and <italic>p</italic>-values for the individual regression coefficients shown in Figure 2D, which would include a list of 3 models * 28 predictors, totaling 84 comparisons. The reviewer’s comment has, however, made us realize that the original manuscript omitted some of these statistics in the supplementary tables. This has now been fixed and the reference to Supplementary File 1d is included in the figure legend. The distributions in Figure 2E are shown exclusively for visualizing the raw data, but not to assess or assert statistical significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding behavioural overlap/independence of behavioural measures, as the authors have done such a thorough job of assessing behaviour, and used regressions, I feel like this has probably been taken into account.

However, we refrain from labeling the syllable ‘<italic>freezing</italic>, because ‘<italic>freezing’</italic> is conceptualized by explicitly defined criteria, such as absence of all movement for a minimum duration, which we do not probe in this data-driven approach (Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969).”</p><p>We also include more extensive reasoning on the use of PLS-DA as a model, and thereby a more detailed summary of the data structure in the methods section as well (p.7). We believe that this clarifies the relationships between predictors to the reader:</p><p>“Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PLS-DA is a supervised statistical approach used for classification and dimensionality reduction (Rosipal and Krämer, 2006). Using syllable frequencies as predictors makes them inherently correlated, because animals can only be assigned one syllable at a time. In addition, the location-based predictors are likely correlated with syllable frequency, as some syllables may be performed preferentially at specific locations within the condition box. PLS-DA overcomes this challenge in the data structure, as it performs well with large numbers of correlated predictors, and inherently provides classification and feature selection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B-E – is the x axis showing Day (as in 1A) or seconds?

As mentioned before, it is only really the test data that can be thought of as a true measure of learning, and I am not sure this claim can be made unless the authors are directly comparing the amount of learning to an appetitive CS or aversive CS across the two paradigms. I don't see these direct comparisons reported so I am not sure this claim can be made. I also feel that, in life, there are paradigms that are primarily aversive or appetitive, so I'm not sure it's even useful to try and claim that one type of learning is superior over another.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this point further. Specifically, we are not asserting that the learning in the mixed-valence paradigm is superior, but that “Our analyses highlight the superiority of mixed-valence paradigms in minimizing baseline sex differences in exploratory behaviors, thereby allowing more accurate assessment of learning” (p.14)</p><p>Through the analyses in the manuscript, we demonstrate that performance in the mixed-valence protocol is less influenced by baseline sex-differences in exploration, thereby making performance readouts a more accurate approximation of learning that is less biased by sex-differences in exploration. In contrast, we show that in the single-valenced protocols, sex-differences are amplified, especially in the case of the aversive-only conditioning in females. We do not claim that the learning is better in one protocol or the other, and as the reviewer noted, we are not attempting to directly compare performance metrics across protocols to claim that there is more or less learning observed.</p><p>We hope that clarifying the language around performance and learning, following this reviewer’s suggestion, has helped to clarify this point. We have also rephrased the sentence in the manuscript to avoid this misinterpretation:</p><p>“Our analyses demonstrate that performance in the mixed-valence protocol is less biased by baseline sex differences in exploratory behaviors, thereby allowing more accurate assessment of learning.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cathy S.

The vast majority of behavioral tasks for mice were &quot;ported&quot; from (usually male) rats, and this has sometimes led to belated recognition that we may be failing to account for species-specific affective behaviors in mice. This can lead, for example, to assumptions that mice &quot;can't learn&quot; paradigms, when it may be more accurate to say we are simply not measuring their learning appropriately. It is certainly the case that Figure 1 and Figure S2 present a mediocre picture of learning using some standard measures. However, by using pose estimation and applying a linear classifier to the full set of individual behavioral postures, the authors are able to classify behaviors as being conditioned responses to a reward or shock-associated cue in Figure 2, with some intriguing nuances due to sex that they explore in the rest of the paper. These data are convincing in part because the behavior contributing most to the classifier for reward associated cues are port orientation behaviors, and the behavior contributing to shock associated cues are pausing – in other words, the same classes of valenced behavior previously linked with these behaviors are showing up again, but using techniques that accommodate features of how mice move and behave. We have long known that pavlovian conditioned responses are multimodal, and novel techniques like this may now allow us to analyze all relevant behaviors.</p><p>A second strength is the careful analysis of how exploration interacts with the valence of events to lead to sex biases in behavior. They find that exploratory behavior (defined as rearing and locomoting) is negatively correlated in all animals with the strength of conditioning for both shock and reward associated cues – but they also find that male mice are more likely to continue to show these behaviors to a neutral cue during reward conditioning. Conversely, female mice are more likely to engage non-cue elicited pause behaviors by shock experiences. Collectively, these findings suggest that individual biases in exploratory behavior, including those associated with sex, have to be taken into account when analyzing behaviors. Further, the finding that exploratory behavior is generally negatively correlated with the expression of conditioned responses suggests that there are competing demands in the brain to respond to cues or to explore the environment, and that animals can't do both at once. This is a very interesting implication of this paper.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One weakness is generalizability of the findings. The authors had to make some judgement calls about their pavlovian conditioning parameters (how strong, how frequent, etc). A full parametric analysis manipulating these settings is not necessarily warranted, but it is worth considering if these effects needed to be in this &quot;sweet spot&quot; to reveal themselves. This could particularly inform the conclusions about the influence of exploration versus exploratory pauses as the mechanism leading to sex differences in behaviors. In other words, if shock intensity, or number of pairings, or some other variable is manipulated, does this elicit higher levels of nonspecific pausing in male mice? Would a more salient appetitive training paradigm reduce male exploratory behavior during relevant cues? It may be the case that the sex differences they observe in aversive and appetitive learning are differentially influenced by these manipulations, which would point to specific mechanisms regulating sex differences in exploratory behavior. This is a minor weakness and could be the focus of follow up work.</p><p>A second related weakness is the missed opportunity to use manipulations to discover the origins of these differences. In addition to task manipulations proposed in the previous paragraph, one could imagine a variety of manipulations to tease out the neural mechanisms regulating exploration during learning, either as a sex difference question or as a neural circuit question within sex (since Figures 2 and 3 suggest a good deal of within-sex variability in these traits). This is a minor weakness and could be the focus of follow up work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer of their detailed evaluation of both the strengths and the weaknesses of our work. We agree that the parameter space in the current work is restricted, and that our findings suggest that stimulus salience will be a fruitful avenue to explore in future work. In the discussion, we elaborate on the limitations of the present experiments with regards to the generalizability of the chosen stimuli similar to the reviewer’s argument. In addition, we agree that the sex differences in behavior in the single-valence protocols posit an interesting target for follow-up work to identify their underlying biological mechanisms and have incorporated this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figures are somewhat challenging to read, in part because the differences between symbols (e.g. circle versus diamond) or the colors of CS- versus CSs were not as easy to discriminate as the authors might have hoped.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s observation. Throughout the manuscript we have aimed for consistent visualization of the three main factors in our study: Protocol (Shape), CS Type (Color), and Sex (Fill). Due to the complexity of the design, we have limited opportunity to further distinguish the different levels we are showing through visual means. Where possible, we have additionally added annotations to guide the viewer (e.g., using headers as in Figure1B-E).</p><p>We agree that the distinction between the circle and diamond shape is particularly hard to notice. For this reason, we have altered the diamond shape to be more distinct from the circle to improve the legibility of the figures. With regards to the colors, we chose the color palette to be color-blind friendly (Viridis palette) and selected three colors along this palette with large distances that contrast well against a white background. Changing colors may facilitate distinctions for many viewers but would likely compromise colour-blind accessibility. We therefore chose not to alter the chosen color theme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a typo/run on sentence in the second paragraph of the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. The error has been fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A data-driven approach is used in this study to provide a comprehensive analysis of mouse behaviour in a single vs mixed valence conditioning paradigm. The inclusion of both sexes is a major strength, and the description of the data-driven approach is appreciated and encourages a broader perspective on how to assess mouse behaviour in response to appetitive and aversive conditioning. While the data-driven approach is clearly described, the findings are rather exploratory. The value of this approach is present in the text, but is not convincing in its current state.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify the value of the exploratory nature of our approach. Importantly, we wish to underscore that we view the unbiased, data-driven approach taken in the manuscript as a strength rather than a weakness, which defines the rigor and validity of the current findings. In the provided review, the specific reasons why the reviewer qualifies the current state as not convincing are not explained.</p><p>We would like to emphasize, that we employed this data-driven approach explicitly to support a rigorous exploratory analysis, in that we our goal was to identify the best predictors of cue discrimination in a novel task without the inherent bias introduced by relying on pre-conceived notions about what the behavior should be. Notably, when we applied existing metrics, we fail to see evidence of reward learning in both sexes. Applying a fully hypothesis-driven approach (i.e., freezing = fear learning, head entries = reward learning), would have missed many of the important nuances reported throughout the manuscript, and led to the erroneous conclusion that mice fail to acquire the reward associations.</p><p>We thoughtfully selected methods to identify predictive metrics without compromising statistical rigour. For example, we could have chosen to compare the frequency of each syllable during the different cue types in each model using standard ANOVAs, however, this would ignore inherent collinearity between the syllables and would likely inflate Type-I errors unless appropriately corrected for, which this design is not suited for with the given sample size. These limitations are optimally addressed by our chosen method PLS-DA which provides a statistically rigorous means to identify predictive metrics. In addition to using a robust statistical method for discovering metrics, we rigorously validated these findings in test datasets that are entirely independent from the training cohort that we used to build the classifier. This additional step is important in ensuring that our findings not only are statistically rigorous but also reproducible across cohorts.</p><p>To address this comment, we have expanded the discussion to more explicitly highlight the strength of our approach:</p><p>“In line with previous research, our findings also emphasize the power of rigorously applied data-driven approaches in behavioral neuroscience in re-evaluating long-standing assumptions and identifying sex-specific phenotypes in behaviors previously established exclusively on male data (Levy et al., 2023; Schuler et al., 2024; Shansky, 2024). Our data show that relying exclusively on existing behavioral metrics can be misleading when developing a novel behavioral protocol. Data-driven approaches, as the one employed in this study, remove biased and preconceived notions from the interpretation of animal behavior, leading to identification of behaviors solely revealed from the data structure with minimal human interference. PLS-DA provides a novel way to understand and interpret the high dimensional data produced by pose estimation and behavioral classifiers. Behavioral classifiers can identify a large number of syllables, and rigorously comparing the duration spent in each syllable between outcomes of interest is not feasible due to the large amount of multiple testing corrections required in combination with usually small sample sizes in behavioral neuroscience experiments. As compared to unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis, PLS-DA identifies axes of variance in the predictors that are correlated with the outcome. This makes it a useful approach in that it explicitly captures features that play an important role in outcome prediction. We present a blueprint for rigorously identifying relevant behavioral metrics of learning in both sexes that can be applied across a wide variety of paradigms, including animal models of neuropsychiatric disease.”</p><p>In addition, and in line with suggestions from Reviewer 1, we have further expanded on the choice of PLS-DA as a statistical approach and why it is well-suited for the given dataset as follows:</p><p>“Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PLS-DA is a supervised statistical approach used for classification and dimensionality reduction (Rosipal and Krämer, 2006). Using syllable frequencies as predictors makes them inherently correlated, because animals can only be assigned one syllable at a time. In addition, the location-based predictors are likely correlated with syllable frequency, as some syllables may be performed preferentially at specific locations within the condition box. PLS-DA overcomes this challenge in the data structure, as it performs well with large numbers of correlated predictors, and inherently provides classification and feature selection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues relate to what is lacking from the text. Definitions of the behaviours should be presented in an easy to reference manner. It took me a while to locate the definition of pausing. It is still unclear how pausing is different than freezing, other than the timing of when it is measured. How did the authors come to their choices for exploratory behaviours and to what extent have they been shown to be sex-neutral, being less common in one sex than the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting these opportunities to improve the manuscript. We have made the following changes to clarify the specific points:</p><p>To easily reference individual syllables, we have added a supplementary figure showing the trajectory plots of the individual syllables in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We have further uploaded grid movies showing examples of the individual syllables. This information was used in combination by the experimenter to label the syllables, and the trajectory plots by themselves can sometimes be misleading (e.g., pausing and licking look the same when considering the trajectory plots, but licking is clearly seen to occur in the food port when evaluating the videos). In addition, we have elaborated on how syllables were assigned to the individual categories where we felt an additional explanation is needed (e.g., attending). This is further described in the figure legend to Figure 2—figure supplement 1 as well.</p><p>We have added a supplementary figure showing the correlation between freezing and pausing, and we added the following sentence on p.10 to better explain our reasoning for choosing to treat pausing conceptually different from freezing:</p><p>“Pausing is strongly correlated with ‘<italic>freezing’</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), suggesting that the pausing syllable is capturing at least partially what is classically considered ‘<italic>freezing’</italic>. However, we refrain from labeling the syllable ‘<italic>freezing</italic>, because ‘<italic>freezing’</italic> is conceptualized by explicitly defined criteria, such as absence of all movement for a minimum duration, which we do not probe in this data-driven approach (Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969).”</p><p>We direct the reviewer to the following section from p.10 of the manuscript outlining the observations that led us to hypothesise that sex differences may be explained by differences in exploration:</p><p>“Intriguingly, predicting CS<sup>S</sup> from CS<sup>-</sup> revealed distinct effects of sex. Females rapidly discriminate CS<sup>S</sup> from CS<sup>-</sup> in the mixed paradigm but, in the aversive-only paradigm, the CS<sup>-</sup> is consistently misclassified as CS<sup>S</sup> throughout training, with discrimination only evident at recall (Figure 3A,B). In contrast, males similarly discriminate CS<sup>S</sup> from CS<sup>-</sup> in both paradigms. The misclassification of CS<sup>R</sup> as CS<sup>-</sup> in males and CS<sup>-</sup> as CS<sup>S</sup> in females suggests that males are exhibiting more CS<sup>-</sup> associated behaviours (‘<italic>rearing’</italic>, ‘<italic>locomoting’</italic>) during the CS<sup>R</sup> and that females are showing less of these same behaviours during the CS<sup>-</sup> and more of the CS<sup>S</sup> associated <italic>pausing</italic> behaviours. Integrating these observations led us to hypothesize that a common underlying factor of exploration might explain the observed sex differences in cue responding in single valence protocols.”</p><p>Our choice to call these behaviors ‘exploratory’ is in line with the ‘search’ category of the Stanford Mouse Behavior Ethogram, listing locomotion and rearing as non-stimuli driven, general exploratory behaviors (https://med.stanford.edu/mousebehavior/ethogram/active-behaviors/general-activity/exploratory-behavior/search.html).</p><p>Whether these behaviors are ‘sex-neutral’ is addressed in the manuscript on p. 11 and shown in Figure 3C. In fact, we demonstrate that the amount of time males and females explore differs at baseline and therefore would not be considered sex-neutral. If the reviewer is interested in the individual usage of the individual syllables summarised in exploration behaviors, we refer them to Figure 2—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors briefly mentioned some research on female rats displaying darting behaviour and they state that they were unable to measure this in their mice. It is unclear why this is the case. This behaviour has also been detected in mice, including in a study published in the same journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this apparent contradiction with previous research. First, we would like to re-emphasize that darting as a sex-specific response to fear conditioning has been primarily reported in rats (Gruene et al., 2015; Mitchell et al., 2024, 2022). While some research has found darting to be present in mice as well, this has not been reported as a sex-specific response in female mice and has been primarily investigated in male mice (Borkar et al., 2024, 2020; Fadok et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019). In addition, the validity of a flight-like response to conditioned cues in mice as reported in previous literature has been challenged. That is, it has been proposed that flight-like responses in mice are potentially an innate response driven by characteristics of the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is white noise (Trott et al., 2022). We have added more references to the relevant Discussion section to address this comment. Finally, darting has not been previously reported in a mixed-valence context in rats.</p><p>We would also like to clarify that we were not unable to measure darting in our mice but rather it did not emerge as a predictor. We would hypothesize that darting would show up in our syllables, likely as a type of behavior in the ‘Jump’ or ‘Locomotion’ group, or a combination thereof. If darting were a predictor of the CS<sup>S</sup> in our protocols, PLS-DA would have identified it as such. However, the primary evidence for CS<sup>S</sup> association is observed in ‘pausing’, with no positively predictive value of other movement syllables, as shown in Figure 2D. We have altered the wording in the discussion to clarify this point to the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, what are the group sizes?</p></disp-quote><p>The samples sizes for each experimental cohort are reported in the ‘Materials and methods’ section, under ‘Classical Conditioning Protocols’ / ‘Conditioning cohorts’ (p.5) and individual mice are visualized as data-points throughout the manuscript:</p><p>“Conditioning cohorts.

The writing can also be improved to more explicitly describe how the available findings can better reflect our understanding of sex differences in neuropsychiatric conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken this comment into consideration, and this is further addressed above</p></body></sub-article></article>
