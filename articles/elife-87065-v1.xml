the force driving the heartbeat. The alignment of the individual sarcomeres is important for proper force generation, and misaligned sarcomeres are associated with diseases, including cardiomyopathies and COVID-19. The actin bundling protein, α-actinin-2, localizes to the ‘Z-Bodies” of sarcomere precursors and the ‘Z-Lines’ of sarcomeres, and has been used previously to assess sarcomere assembly and maintenance. Previous measurements of α-actinin-2 organization have been largely accomplished manually, which is time-consuming and has hampered research progress. Here, we introduce sarcApp, an image analysis tool that quantifies several components of the cardiac sarcomere and their alignment in muscle cells and tissue. We first developed sarcApp to utilize deep learning-based segmentation and real space quantification to measure α-actinin-2 structures and determine the organization of both precursors and sarcomeres/myofibrils. We then expanded sarcApp to analyze ‘M-Lines’ using the localization of myomesin and a protein that connects the Z-Lines to the M-Line (titin). sarcApp produces 33 distinct measurements per cell and 24 per myofibril that allow for precise quantification of changes in sarcomeres, myofibrils, and their precursors. We validated this system with perturbations to sarcomere assembly. We found perturbations that affected Z-Lines and M-Lines differently, suggesting that they may be regulated independently during sarcomere assembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac myocyte</kwd><kwd>sarcomere</kwd><kwd>myofibril</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM125028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burnette</surname><given-names>Dylan Tyler</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 5T32HD007502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neininger-Castro</surname><given-names>Abigail C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>Zachary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 5T32GM008320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>836090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1070985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>Zachary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 HL136081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fenix</surname><given-names>Aidan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18PRE33960551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taneja</surname><given-names>Nilay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Software is introduced for the rapid and comprehensive quantification of sarcomere-containing myofibrils and their precursors in cardiac myocytes, aiding in the advancement of cardiovascular cell biology investigations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sarcomere is the fundamental unit of contraction in striated muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Au, 2004</xref>). Sarcomeres individually contract to generate a force, and sarcomeres organize and align within myofibrils to augment that force. These forces enable skeletal muscle to coordinate organism-level locomotion and cardiac muscle to drive the heartbeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hersch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Sarcomere structure and alignment is critical to muscle function, and dysfunctional sarcomeres and myofibrils have been implicated as causes of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eschenhagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harvey and Leinwand, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Olsson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Since the mid-20th century, the question of how sarcomeres are assembled and subsequently organized into higher-order myofibrils has been a much-debated topic, with multiple separate lines of research emerging to support a small host of potential models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dlugosz et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanger et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McKenna et al., 1985</xref>). Generally, the models of sarcomere assembly that are backed by the most data posit that sarcomeres arise from either (i) a ‘parts-wise’ assembly, where precursors of unique sarcomeric regions (e.g., the thin [actin] or thick [myosin] filament) are first assembled separately, then ‘stitched’ together to generate the final structure (i.e., Stitching Model) or (ii) a more direct assembly, where a precursor forms that resembles a sarcomere but has a subset of non-sarcomeric proteins that are later replaced by sarcomeric proteins (i.e., Pre-myofibril Model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dlugosz et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rhee et al., 1994</xref>). Recently, our group has shown that sarcomeres descend directly from muscle stress fibers (MSFs), with our data supporting a subset of predictions made by both models, but not necessarily favoring either model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>). All models of sarcomere assembly are currently limited in their testability because the field lacks a tractable workflow for high-throughput analysis.</p><p>Recently, our lab has shown that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs) can be harnessed as a tractable model for routine imaging of sarcomere assembly in live CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fenix et al., 2016</xref>). In our assay, hiCMs assemble sarcomeres de novo, and directly from MSFs, within 24 hr. Despite having powerful tools for imaging, our analysis workflow is still hampered by technical bottlenecks related to (i) image binarization and (ii) manual quantification. Binarization via classical methods relying on image pixel intensity (e.g., Otsu’s method) is often performed manually – slowly – and can become muddled by a multitude of factors, including (i) high-intensity artifacts related to nonspecific localization of antibodies, (ii) low-intensity staining due to high background levels/noise, and/or (iii) multi-valent interactions by the target protein itself occluding the specific structure of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otsu, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sankur, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Uchida, 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, we find that even well-binarized, high-resolution images can require several hours of manual quantification per image.</p><p>Deep learning has emerged as a powerful potential solution for rapid, accurate binarization of complex grayscale images. Deep learning-based binarization can be accomplished using a framework called a U-Net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ronneberger and Brox, 2015</xref>). A U-Net trains a deep learning model to convert images into only background (noise) and foreground (signal) by matching images to expert-annotated ‘ground truth’ binaries – that is, images manually annotated by the user. Compared to manually performed binarization, U-Net offers the advantages of superior accuracy and speed, but at a high upfront cost, since implementation of a U-Net requires a user with advanced background in mathematics, experience with machine learning, and proficiency in writing software code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ronneberger and Brox, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While a sarcomere contains 100+ proteins, the field has often resorted to ‘proxying’ sarcomere assembly by staining, often exclusively, for α-actinin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Henderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taneja et al., 2020</xref>). α-actinin-2 marks the sarcomeric Z-Lines, which border the sarcomeric contractile machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murphy and Young, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). In the last decade, several methods for automatic quantification of Z-Lines have emerged, with the most widely used methods relying on calculations made in frequency space (i.e., by using a Fourier transformation of the image) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinson et al., 2015</xref>). While frequency space calculations can detect repeating patterns created by adjacent Z-Lines, current methods yield no information about Z-Lines in real space (e.g., number, size, spacing, or organization within myofibrils), about sarcomere precursors, or about any sarcomeric components other than Z-Lines. Moreover, it is not yet clear quite how the assembly of Z-Lines themselves relates either spatially or temporally to the assembly of other sarcomere components, or vice versa.</p><p>Here, we present a high-throughput, automated, and non-biased quantification scheme for sarcomere assembly. Our approach is two-pronged and includes a unique method for both (1) rapid, accurate binarization of images that can consistently separate true signal from noise and structures of interest from those that are not of interest and (2) automated quantification of relevant sarcomeric and pre-sarcomeric structures within the binarized images. Towards (1), we have developed ‘yoU-Net,’ a U-Net-based framework with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that enables a user with little to no experience to binarize images with the power and flexibility afforded by deep learning. We demonstrate that yoU-Net can accurately binarize images of CM sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors using multiple unique sarcomere stains. Towards (2), we have developed ‘sarcApp,’ a software that automatically annotates and calculates 50+ unique descriptive outputs of sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors in real space using binarized images. Using yoU-Net and sarcApp, we demonstrate that some perturbations to sarcomere assembly preferentially affect specific sarcomere components (e.g., M-Lines) more than others (e.g., Z-Lines). Our data emphasize the need for more high-throughput studies into sarcomere assembly that includes multiple sarcomere components, and altogether point to a disjointed or modular sarcomere assembly program within CMs that is more nuanced than was previously believed. The tools presented herein will facilitate future high-throughput studies to develop a more mature and complex model of sarcomere assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>yoU-Net enables user-friendly binarization of dynamic grayscale images</title><p>Our overarching goal was to develop a method for fast and accurate quantification of sarcomeres within hiCMs using our sarcomere assembly assay. We faced two primary bottlenecks in our workflow, the first of which was a slow and cumbersome image binarization process. Binarization facilitates image quantification by converting the complex, raw image of a biological specimen into a far simpler image containing only background (non-relevant information) and signal (relevant information). A well-binarized image should retain high fidelity to the original image but contain only the relevant structures of interest superimposed over a blank background. Individual pixels within a binary image are stripped of dynamic information present within the raw image and are re-assigned to represent only either background or signal – binary images are therefore often represented in black (background) and white (signal).</p><p>Traditional methods of binarization fall short for images of sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors in hiCMs due to the dynamic range of pixel intensities present within the raw images. In images of hiCMs 24 hr after plating, sarcomere precursors and sarcomeres are each stained by α-actinin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but the Z-Lines of the sarcomeres are markedly brighter than the Z-Bodies of the precursor structures (i.e., MSFs). Classical, intensity-based binarization methods force a user to make a choice in this scenario – specifically, whether to accurately binarize based on gray levels of the sarcomere precursors or of the sarcomeres themselves (without the consistent option for both). Classical Otsu-based thresholding (using FIJI) of a representative cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that binarizing this cell according to Z-Lines oversaturates Z-Bodies into an inseparable clump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowhead), leaving a user unable to accurately quantify both structures from this single binary.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>yoU-Net follows a U-Net architecture to binarize immunofluorescence images.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of α-actinin-2 and actin filaments (phalloidin) in a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocyte (hiCM).

A U-Net enables a user to train a deep learning model to automatically binarize images with high precision and speed. Model ‘training’ involves matching raw images to user-annotated binaries – called ‘ground truth’ binaries – using a complex set of mathematical convolution/downsampling and deconvolution/upsampling steps. The architectural layout of a U-Net is represented by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p>We constructed our own U-Net and trained it using 1000 training steps (100 epochs/steps of 10 iterations each) of hiCMs stained for α-actinin-2. After training, our U-Net can reliably and automatically predict high-fidelity binaries of hiCM α-actinin-2 stains that are resistant to artifacts related to differences in pixel intensity and can accurately separate individual Z-Bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrowhead). Recognizing that other labs would benefit from the flexibility and accuracy of our U-Net, we also wrote software encoding for a GUI to accompany our U-Net in the hopes of making it more user-friendly and broadly accessible. Our U-Net and GUI together are known as ‘yoU-Net’ and are available, open source with details in the supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used yoU-Net to binarize images throughout the remainder of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>sarcApp quantifies muscle stress fibers, sarcomeres, and myofibrils</title><p>The next bottleneck within our workflow was the issue of manual quantification, which in some cases can require several hours for a single CM. A meaningful quantitative output of sarcomere assembly would discriminate between sarcomeres and sarcomere precursors (MSFs), and produce readouts for each. Sarcomere assembly involves the formation MSFs near the cell edge that give rise to sarcomeres typically closer to the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Within MSFs are punctate α-actinin-2-containing structures termed ‘Z-Bodies,’ which gradually elongate/concatenate over time and eventually transition into the Z-Lines of sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While the Z-Body to Z-Line transition exists along a continuum, it was necessary for us to define a binary transition point on the basis of α-actinin-2 structure length when a Z-Body ‘becomes’ a Z-Line. We tasked individual lab members with independently annotating 10 images each to determine which structures constituted a Z-Body and which were Z-Lines. Together, we defined a potential Z-Line to be any α-actinin-2-containing structure with a length &gt;1.4 µm, with all other structures being potential Z-Bodies. Because many organisms have variable sarcomere spacing and structure, this variable along with all others discussed (lengths, minimum number of structures, etc.) are customizable and can be easily redefined by the user for their unique model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reedy and Beall, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Using our predefined size criterion for Z-Lines and Z-Bodies, we next desired a method capable of automated detection, measurement, and descriptive output of both structures. Towards this goal, we developed sarcApp, a software-based code that classifies each α-actinin-2 structure within a binary image as a Z-Line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) or Z-Body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) and further assigns each to either a myofibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or MSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). All structures identified as potential Z-Lines are paired to other potential Z-Lines in the cell based on shape, orientation, and location, then assigned to myofibril based on orientation to other Z-Lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Z-Lines, which belong to a myofibril, are considered ‘confirmed.’ This eliminates singular α-actinin-2-positive adhesions. Next, each potential Z-Body is paired to other Z-Bodies based on shape and location, then assigned to an MSF based on orientation to other nearby Z-Bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Like with Z-Lines, only Z-Bodies that belong to an MSF are considered ‘confirmed.’ After detecting, annotating/assigning, and measuring all potential Z-Lines and Z-Bodies within a given cell, sarcApp automatically compiles and generates three spreadsheets summarizing the data on a per-cell, per-myofibril, and per-MSF basis. Cell spreadsheets generated include myofibrils per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), Z-Lines per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), Z-Line lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), myofibril persistence lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), MSFs per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), Z-Bodies per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), Z-Body lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), and MSF persistence lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).

These measurements are customizable as some species have varied inter-Z-Line distance or varied cell curvature. We increase the computational speed of sarcApp by measuring Z-Line spacing using the distance between each Z-Line’s centroid as opposed to parallel spacing, which can produce slightly different results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). sarcApp defines a myofibril as a structure with a linear collection of four or more Z-Lines (i.e., three sarcomeres).

In brief, we trypsinized and replated hiCMs. During this process, the hiCMs lose and reform their sarcomeres, allowing us to monitor sarcomere assembly. Because this assembly begins at the cell edge and moves rearward toward the cell center, a snapshot of a hiCM after 24 hr of spreading (once sarcomeres have begun to form and myofibrils begin to align) contains information on early, mid, and late sarcomere formation at the leading edge, behind the edge in the lamella, and toward the center of the cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Blebbistatin inhibits myosin II-based contractility and Blebbistatin-treated hiCMs exhibit reduced Z-Line assembly in our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).

For myomesin, the M-Line must &gt;1.4 µm and adjacent to at least two other M-lines to be considered part of a myofibril (i.e., at least three M-lines per myofibril, as it could be inferred that such a myofibril would have at least four Z-lines). sarcApp-defined readouts using myomesin include myofibrils per cell, M-Lines per cell, myofibril persistence length, and M-Line lengths. As with titin, sarcApp is additionally equipped to incorporate a cell edge co-stain (e.g., actin or non-muscle myosin IIA or IIB) alongside myomesin to measure myofibril orientation and myofibril distance from cell edge since myomesin antibodies do not stain the edge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>).

We first demonstrate deep learning-based image binarization of three distinct sarcomeric proteins – α-actinin-2, titin, and myomesin – using models trained by a framework we developed called yoU-Net, based off the ubiquitously used U-Net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ronneberger and Brox, 2015</xref>). Each trained model is provided and will function as demonstrated herein based on the use of the antibodies as stated in the ‘Methods.’ yoU-Net is designed and equipped to be functionally versatile, which we hope other researchers can harness to generate additional trained models of proteins not studied here.</p><p>The high fidelity of yoU-Net-generated binaries allowed us to quantify several geometric features of the sarcomere in real space as opposed to frequency space. Automatic quantification of sarcomere/myofibril structure with sarcApp offers multiple advantages over traditional, manual quantification including speed, objectivity, and consistency. sarcApp is capable of quantifying 33 measurements per cell and 24 measurements per myofibril at a rate that is orders of magnitude faster than manual quantification, which besides being slower also requires complete attention from the user. sarcApp also removes the potential for user bias/error from quantification and can detect quantitative differences in cells that are not readily apparent by eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) – we expect this will drive discovery of novel mechanisms in cells that would have remained otherwise undetectable. sarcApp as an automatic tool must operate within a rigid quantitative framework and functions optimally when structures o -interest have shapes that are consistent and definable by simple geometric measurements; however, to increase usability we have enabled users to self-define parameters using an easy-to-navigate GUI.</p><p>Other than basic structural readouts for sarcomere/myofibril precursors (Z-Bodies, titin rings, etc.) and sarcomeres/myofibrils (Z-Lines, titin doublets, M-Lines, etc.), sarcApp is also equipped to proxy sarcomere/myofibril organization. Myofibril organization correlates with function in vivo and poor organization (disarray) is often cited as causative for myocardial disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eschenhagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harvey and Leinwand, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Olsson et al., 2004</xref>). sarcApp reports organization using a novel metric reported here known as myofibril orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>). Orientation is reported relative to the cell membrane by comparing the angle of the myofibril long axis to the nearest cell edge; such a metric was chosen because we routinely observe hiCMs assemble myofibrils with a long axis that is approximately parallel (i.e., 0°) to the cell edge in vitro and also because tissue sections of myocytes in vivo show myofibrillar arrays parallel to the long axis of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taneja et al., 2020</xref>). We generated this measure of orientation to be more transparent and informative than what is currently available in the hopes of reaching a broader audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous work from our lab and others has included as many cells as reasonably possible in analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taneja et al., 2020</xref>), requiring technical expertise in (at minimum) plating cells, sample preparation, microscopy, and image analysis. While microscopy has historically been the rate-limiting step in such analyses, modern microscopes can now rapidly image hundreds to thousands of cells at high resolution. The true bottleneck towards understanding sarcomere assembly now lies for our lab in image analysis/quantification. We summed the quantified cell totals of two recent landmark papers in the field and found the reported totals to be 385 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>) and 785 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>). sarcApp has allowed us to present in this article multidimensional outputs from 3452 single cells with outputs that we feel represent the data clearly at both basic glance and upon close inspection.

Blebbistatin exposure results in predictable, dose-dependent inhibition of sarcomere assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). sarcApp-generated measurements of α-actinin-2 in the presence or absence of Blebbistatin were consistent with observations made by previous groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Meanwhile, several other outputs related to titin and myomesin first reported here by sarcApp suggest that periodic, pseudomyofibrillar structures characteristic to both the Z-Line and M-Line can at least partially self-assemble in the absence of myosin II motor-based contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These data indicate other mechanisms beyond myosin II-based motor-based contractility may independently contribute to the assembly and ordered arrangement of myofibrils in hiCMs. Specifically with titin, we also observe the phenomenon that Blebbistatin disrupts the higher-order organization of titin-based structures with respect to the cell membrane but does not affect titin periodicity within the structure. These data suggest that unique mechanistic tiers of organization exist within the cell at the sub- and super-structural level that become uncoupled upon relieving the cell of myosin II-dependent contractility.</p><p>We find that neither α nor β cardiac myosin II knockdown had any measurable impact on the assembly of Z-Lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Attempts to determine if Z-Lines assemble in the simultaneous absence of both myosins were unsuccessful in our hands. Such an experiment, in addition to the Blebbistatin experiments reported herein and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), could resolve whether myosin II-dependent contractility alone is sufficient to explain the role of myosin II in Z-Line assembly. Meanwhile, β cardiac myosin II knockdown did result in hiCMs with shorter M-Lines, indicating that either contractility or scaffolding by β, but not α myosin II, is required for M-Line maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and M</xref>). Knockdown of myomesin similarly did not impact Z-Line assembly but did result in shortening of the thick filament A-band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H and I</xref>). Our ability to perturb the M-Line/A-band but not the Z-Line suggests that Z- and M-Line assembly are regulated at least in part by distinct mechanistic axes, as previously hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rudy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schafer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beall et al., 1989</xref>). It should be noted here that solely using Z-Lines as a proxy for sarcomere status would have led us to errantly conclude that β cardiac myosin II and myomesin both play no or at least minor roles in sarcomere assembly. Future studies examining assembly should therefore consider Z-Line assembly to be distinct from, or at least not wholly representative of, assembly of other sarcomere components.</p><p>Here we used exclusively fixed-cell immunofluorescence for high-throughput quantification of sarcomere assembly. We eliminated as much bias as possible by selecting cells for quantification solely using a nuclear DAPI stain and are therefore confident that data presented herein fully captures the true biological variability present within whole hiCM cultures. A future goal of the lab is to further adapt sarcApp for live cell quantification. Tracking specific structures across time would be a necessity for a ‘live’ version of sarcApp, a hurdle the lab is currently working to overcome. We also designed this initial version of sarcApp to quantify in 2D rather than in 3D space. As we have published previously, sarcomeres/myofibrils assemble on the dorsal (top) surface of an hiCM plated on glass for up to 48 hr after plating, and we consider them within that timeframe to exist largely within a two-dimensional plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taneja et al., 2020</xref>). Breaking into three dimensions will require more complex mathematics and produce more convoluted outputs, which could limit adoption by other researchers, but is a long-term goal of the lab nonetheless.</p><p>In summary, sarcApp and yoU-Net provide frameworks for automatic binarization, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of sarcomeric proteins in striated muscle cells. We anticipate these software packages will be useful for lower-throughput single-cell analyses of sarcomere structure and/or assembly as well as for high-throughput screens to analyze several hundreds to thousands of cells at a time. In this way, we hope to facilitate the entry of more researchers into the field of cardiac cell biology and continue to introduce novel quantification metrics and additional sarcomere proteins in the future through continued maintenance and management of sarcApp as an open-source community project.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>SarcApp and yoU-net can be found

The authors further utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) as their model to verify their software by staining multiple sarcomeric components with and without the treatment of Blebbistatin, a known myosin II activity inhibitor. With the treatment of different Blebbistatin concentrations, the morphology of sarcomeric proteins was disturbed. These disrupted sarcomeric structures were further quantified using sarcApp and the quantification data supported the phenotype. The authors further investigated the roles of muscle myosins in sarcomere assembly by knocking down MYH6, MYH7, or MYOM in hiCMs. The knockdown of these genes did not affect Z-line assembly yet the knockdown of MYOM affected M-line assembly. The authors demonstrated that different muscle myosins participate in sarcomere assembly in different manners.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87065.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Neininger-Castro and colleagues developed software tools for the quantification of sarcomeres and sarcomere-precursor features in immunostained human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs). In the first part they used a deep-learning- based model called a U-Net to construct and train a network for binarization of immunostained cardiomyocyte images. They also wrote graphical user interface (GUI) software that will assist other labs to use this approach and made it publicly available. They did not compare their approach to existing ones, but example from one image suggests their binarization tool outperforms Otsu thresholding binarization.</p><p>In the second part they developed a software tool called sarcApp that classifies sarcomere structures in the binarized image as a Z-Line or Z-Body and assigns each to either a myofibril or to stress fibers. The tools can then automatically count and measure multiple features (33 per cell and 24 per myofibril) and report them on a per-cell, per-myofibril, and per- stress fiber basis.</p><p>To test the tools they used Blebbistatin to inhibit sarcomere assembly and showed that the sarcApp tool could capture changes in multiple features such as fewer myofibrils, fewer Z-Lines, decreased myofibril persistence, decreased Z-Line length and altered myofibril orientation in the Blebbistatin treated cells. With some changes the tool was also shown to quantify sarcomeres in titin and myomesin stained cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Finally they used sarcApp to quantify the changes in sarcomere assembly after siRNA mediated knockout of MYH7, MYH7, or MYOM. The analysis indicates that neither MYH6 nor MYH7 knockdown perturbed the assembly of Z- or M-lines, and that knockdown of MYOM perturbed the A-band/M-Line but not the Z-Line assembly according to features captured by the sarcApp tool.</p><p>Overall the authors developed and made publicly available an excellent software tool that will be very useful for labs that are interested in studying sarcomere assembly. Multiple features that are difficult to measure or count manually can be automatically measured by the software quickly and accurately.</p><p>There are however some remaining questions about these tools:</p><p>1. The binarization tool which is tailored to sarcomere image binarization appears promising but was not systematically compared with existing approaches. Example from one cell suggests it outperforms Otsu's binarization approach.</p><p>2. How robust is the tool? The tool was tested on images from one type of cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) taken from one lab using Nikon Spinning Disk confocal microscope equipped with Apo TIRF Oil 100X 1.49 NA objective or instant Structured Illumination Microscopy (iSIM), using deconvolution (Microvolution software) and in a specific magnification.

I am surprised that there is no reference in the manuscript to SarcTrack, published by Toepfer and colleagues in 2019 (PMID 30700234), which has exactly the same purpose. The advantage of the image analysis software presented in the current manuscript appears to me to be that it can cover both mature sarcomeres and nascent sarcomeres in premyofibrils effectively.</p></disp-quote><p>We whole-heartedly disagree that SarcTrack has the exact same purpose as sarcApp. sarcApp measures more than the frequency of actinin2 images, and can measure real-space quantifications of actinin, myomesin, and titin, which has not been done before in this way. However, SarcTrack is an interesting method that we hope many researchers find helpful in their research. SarcTrack is a particle tracker that outputs the dimensions of the objects found, but does not distinguish between Z-Lines and other actinin2-positive structures (Z-Bodies, adhesions). It also does not group these structures into higher order structures such as myofibrils and muscle stress fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When going through the manuscript there were a few issues that should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>1. I am a bit puzzled that they took 1.4 um length as a cutoff length for a mature A-band in their quantifications, since the consensus in the field for thick filament length seems to be 1.6 um?</p></disp-quote><p>We use 1.4 µm as a cutoff length for the length of a Z-Line rather than the A-Band. We believe the reviewer is referring to the width of the A-Band perpendicular to the Z-lines, which is indeed 1.6 µm. However, we are referring to the length of the Z-Lines, which can span anywhere from1.4 µm to up to 10 or more µm. Thank you for allowing us to make the clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. When doing the knockdown for alpha and beta-myosin heavy chain, respectively, why did they not also do a Western blot for the &quot;other&quot; isoform as well (Figure 7)? We know that iPSCCM express a mixture, so the relatively mild phenotype that they observe in single knockdown experiments may well be due to concomitant upregulation of the expression of the other isoform. In my point of view this should be checked.</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that in the single knockdown experiments the other isoform is upregulated, which is why we were careful in stating that neither muscle myosin alone is required for sarcomere formation. We do agree this would be an interesting experiment to check beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There seems to be a disconnect between the images for myomesin knockdown shown in Figure 8H and the quantification shown in Figure 8I, which makes me wonder whether the image shown in H middle (MYOM1 (1) KD), where the beta-myosin doublets do not seem to be much affected is really representative?</p></disp-quote><p>The image shown in the middle of H is representative of the mean length of beta-myosin doublets in MYOM1 (1) KD hiCMs. While the beta-myosin doublets are still present and organized, they are significantly shorter. In the zoomed out image, you can appreciate much shorter arrays of beta-myosin doublets that, while extending across the entire cell, are thinner than control cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Neininger-Castro et al report on their original study entitled &quot;Independent regulation of Z-lines and M-lines during sarcomere assembly in cardiac myocytes revealed by the automatic image analysis software sarcApp&quot;, In this study, the research team developed two software, yoU-Net and sarcApp, that provide new binarization and sarcomere quantification methods. The authors further utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) as their model to verify their software by staining multiple sarcomeric components with and without the treatment of Blebbistatin, a known myosin II activity inhibitor. With the treatment of different Blebbistatin concentrations, the morphology of sarcomeric proteins was disturbed. These disrupted sarcomeric structures were further quantified using sarcApp and the quantification data supported the phenotype. The authors further investigated the roles of muscle myosins in sarcomere assembly by knocking down MYH6, MYH7, or MYOM in hiCMs. The knockdown of these genes did not affect Z-line assembly yet the knockdown of MYOM affected M-line assembly. The authors demonstrated that different muscle myosins participate in sarcomere assembly in different manners.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Neininger-Castro and colleagues developed software tools for the quantification of sarcomeres and sarcomere-precursor features in immunostained human induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs). In the first part they used a deep-learning- based model called a U-Net to construct and train a network for binarization of immunostained cardiomyocyte images. They also wrote graphical user interface (GUI) software that will assist other labs in using this approach and made it publicly available. They did not compare their approach to existing ones, but an example from one image suggests their binarization tool outperforms Otsu thresholding binarization.</p><p>In the second part they developed a software tool called sarcApp that classifies sarcomere structures in the binarized image as a Z-Line or Z-Body and assigns each to either a myofibril or to stress fibers. The tools can then automatically count and measure multiple features (33 per cell and 24 per myofibril) and report them on a per-cell, per-myofibril, and per- stress fiber basis.</p><p>To test the tools they used Blebbistatin to inhibit sarcomere assembly and showed that the sarcApp tool could capture changes in multiple features such as fewer myofibrils, fewer Z-Lines, decreased myofibril persistence, decreased Z-Line length and altered myofibril orientation in the Blebbistatin treated cells. With some changes the tool was also shown to quantify sarcomeres in titin and myomesin stained cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Finally they used sarcApp to quantify the changes in sarcomere assembly after siRNA mediated knockout of MYH7, MYH7, or MYOM. The analysis indicates that neither MYH6 nor MYH7 knockdown perturbed the assembly of Z- or M-lines, and that knockdown of MYOM perturbed the A-band/M-Line but not the Z-Line assembly according to features captured by the sarcApp tool.</p><p>Overall the authors developed and made publicly available an excellent software tool that will be very useful for labs that are interested in studying sarcomere assembly. Multiple features that are difficult to measure or count manually can be automatically measured by the software quickly and accurately.</p><p>There are however some remaining questions about these tools:</p><p>1. The binarization tool which is tailored to sarcomere image binarization appears promising but was not systematically compared with existing approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared it with the existing approach we used previously in the lab, which was Otsu’s method for binarization. We are not aware of several other binarization approaches to compare to, other than using other machine learning techniques that are less advanced than a U-Net, the current standard in image-to-image translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How robust is the tool? The tool was tested on images from one type of cardiomyocytes(hiCMs) taken from one lab using Nikon Spinning Disk confocal microscope equipped with Apo TIRF Oil 100X 1.49 NA objective or instant Structured Illumination Microscopy (iSIM), using deconvolution (Microvolution software) and in a specific magnification. It remains to be seen whether the tool would be equally effective with images taken with other microscopy systems, with other cardiomyocytes (chick or neonatal rat), with different magnifications, live imaging, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the software with several magnifications, with live imaging, and with other tissues. We did not include the information in the manuscript because the data we tested the software with is for future manuscripts studying different aspects of sarcomere formation and maintenance. sarcApp reliably identifies Z-Lines and sarcomeres with deconvolved widefield fluorescence images of hiCMs and frozen human tissue, and are currently using it to measure zebrafish data for another study. Further, it works for live imaging with an actinin2-GFP (or similar) label. For the titin quantification, we would recommend using only 60-100X magnification, as the titin structures (doublets and rings) are not resolvable at lower magnifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The tool was developed for evaluation of sarcomere assembly. The authors show that for this application it can detect the perturbation by Blebbistatin, or knockdown of sarcomeric genes.

We are currently doing the same for other manuscripts from our lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1)&quot;alpha-actinin..., which border the sarcomeric contractile machinery (thin and thick filaments); Z-lines do NOT border thick filaments in a relaxed sarcomere</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed “(thin and thick filaments)” from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. myomesin targeting siRNAs (gene name MYOM): there are actually three genes encoding for myomesin family members, specify, which one was targeted (I am assuming MYOM1).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the clarification: we do target MYOM1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I am not surprised that they found not many mature Z-lines in the absence of both sarcomeric myosins; a similar codependence of assembly of mature Z-discs and the presence of functional thick filaments was previously shown by Geach and colleagues in 2015 (PMID 25845369)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for sharing this manuscript: we have added a reference to it in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This work offers the possibility to gain more insights into the process of sarcomere assembly through the advancement in sarcomeric or myofibril structure analyses. However, some clarifications are needed from the authors, please see below for the comments.</p><p>1. It is recommended that the authors include the time points for replating and harvesting hiCMs. After replating, the cardiomyocytes require at least three to four days for sarcomeric structures to reform. If the hiCMs were fixed before sarcomere assembly had completed, the staining of sarcomeric proteins including ACTN2 and titin could be compromised and it is difficult to tell if the phenotypes observed were consequences of drug treatments or knockdown of sarcomeric genes or simply because the replating hiCMs were fixed before their sarcomeric structures had fully regrown. It is also recommended that the authors replate hiCMs at a fixed time point to avoid discrepancies in the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Cardiomyocytes do not require three to four days for sarcomeric structures to re-form, and indeed only require 24 hours, with the first sarcomeres typically appearing at ~6 hours. We and others have published several studies demonstrating this (Fenix et al., eLIfe 2018, Taneja, Neininger and Burnette MBoC 2020, Chen et al. Nature Methods, 2022). While sarcomeres continue to develop and turn over after this time, our lab is interested in the beginning steps of sarcomerogenesis rather than the turnover of mature structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The sarcApp automatically identifies Z-lines and Z-bodies; however, is there an option for the users to set their own thresholds? Some users may select different criterions when quantifying sarcomeres. Moreover, the Z-lines and Z-bodies identified by the software are not always accurate. Can the users modify the list manually in an unbiased way. If this function is not available, the authors may consider adding this function to their software. sarcApp measures Zline and Z-bodies length but does not measure Z-line and Z-bodies width, but sometimes it is also necessary to measure the width.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely, users can modify the thresholds to identify Z-Lines and Z-Bodies. There is not a way for users to modify the list in an unbiased way per se, as editing the list of Z-Lines and Z-Bodies based on non-mathematical measurements is inherently biased, but the user is free to add in other Z-Lines and Z-Bodies as they wish. In this context, “manually” and “unbiased” is mutually exclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is recommended that the authors include the original images beside the sarcomeric structures identified by sarcApp (Figure 2A, 2C, 4C-F and more). It would be easier to compare the original Z-lines and Z-bodies with those identified by the software.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these in Author response image 1.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Uncropped images and merges from Figures 2, 4 and 6, respectively.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87065-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The M-line length quantification data in Figure 3G, 5F, and 6H showed different colored-dots labeling n1 to n3, but the authors did not discuss the significance of these symbols.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the reviewer means by this statement: there is no significance of the different colored dots other than to mark the biological replicate shown. These graphs were created using SuperPlots, which was not stated in the original methods. It has now been added to the Statistical Analysis section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Can the authors elaborate more on the reasons why they treated Blebbistatin at concentrations of 50µM and 100µM. Previous studies showed that 25µM of Blebbistatin was sufficient to delay the transformation of cardiomyocytes (PMID 27072942). Can the authors also comment on why they selected 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post replating for drug treatment. Moreover, the drug treatment at different time points was only done on ACTN2 but not titin or myomesin.</p></disp-quote><p>We selected 6, 12, and 24 hours for actinin2 to show the time course of sarcomere formation and to show that sarcomeres are developed by 24 hours, as also mentioned above. We are interested in future studies of the time course of titin and myomesin over time, and are working on it in the lab.</p><p>We chose 50 and 100 µM Blebbistatin as these completely blocked sarcomere assembly whereas treatment with 25 µM did not. This manuscript is a methods paper that aims to validate sarcApp and show how it could be used. We did not intend for it to be a comprehensive study of how different concentrations of blebbistatin affects sarcomere assembly.</p><p>We are also unsure what the reviewer means by “transformation of cardiomyocytes”. The manuscript with the PMID of 27072942 does not address this issue. The paper is a “review and analyze readmission data for patients who received a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD)”. We assume the reviewer is referring to differentiation. The model system we developed and published in eLife in 2018 does not use differentiating iPSC cardiac myocytes. The hiCMs we use are terminally differentiated but still immature, as they are more transcriptionally similar to primary fetal myocytes. As such, they do not maintain their sarcomeres when they removed from the 96 well and plated onto a glass coverslip for highresolution microscopy. These assemble sarcomeres within 24 hours with the sarcomeres forming close to the dorsal membrane and then rearrange overtime (e.g., moving from the top of the cell to the bottom) (Fenix et al., eLife 2018). With that said, we do agree with the reviewer that a study of sarcomere assembly in the context of cardiac myocyte differentiation would be a fascinating direction for future studies, and we think sarcApp could facilitate such studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors mentioned that the myofibrils of Z-line, titin, and M-line were randomly oriented after Blebbistatin treatments. The myofibrils were randomly oriented for titin and M-line. However, the orientation of Z-line after 50µM Blebbistatin treatment was not necessarily random, only the orientation after 100µM Blebbistatin treatment was randomized. The authors might consider changing bar graph to other types of charts if the orientation was really randomized after quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We find that the bar chart is the most informative to us, but users can consider other types of charts in their analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is recommended that the authors include images staining ACTN2 at lower magnifications (Figure 1A, 1C). With current images, it is true that yoU-Net can separate Z-lines from Z-bodies yet it is difficult to tell if yoU-Net can still distinguish Z-lines from Z-bodies with larger images or it only applies to a small portion of the image.</p></disp-quote><p>The yoU-Net can distinguish Z-Lines from Z-Bodies with images of any size, as image size (height vs. width in pixels) does not affect how binarization occurs. During binarization, the only pixel requirement is that the width and height are divisible by 8 (for downsampling purposes). Usually this is not the case with raw images, so the image borders are slightly cropped to make them usable. In terms of resolution, we recommend using 60X-100X objectives on confocal or superresolution data for the clearest results. We have, however, successfully binarized deconvolved widefield images at 100X as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors mentioned that the knockdown of MYH7 did not affect Z-lines and M-lines; however, the structures of ACTN2, myomesin, and titin appeared more organized as compared to those in control.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the sarcomeres and myofibrils look slightly more organized, and did mean to state that the knockdown did not negatively affect Z-Lines and M-Lines and have updated the manuscript to be more accurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Please provide the merge images for Fig. 4D, 4E, 6B</p></disp-quote><p>The merge images for Fig. 4D, 4E, and 6B are included with the original images requested above (point 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the text, they described&quot; &quot;antibodies to the titin I-band localize to both MSFs and sarcomeres in hiCMs (Figure 4A). Titin forms ring-like structures around the Z-Bodies of MSFs that are closer to the apparent sarcomere transition point (Figure 4A)&quot; However, based on the antibody information they provided, it is not explicitly recognized for N-or C-terminus TITIN. Please provide TTN N-terminus or TTN-C terminus co-stainings with ACTN2 antibody to understand which part of TTN together with ACTN2 forms a Z-Body.</p></disp-quote><p>The TTN antibody is an N-terminal antibody localizing to the I-Band region of sarcomeres. We agree with the reviewer that a more thorough study of titin will be of interest and we are currently undertaking such a study. However, this is a methods paper presenting a tool. While some of the data we present does point to mechanistic hypotheses, it is beyond the scope of this study to fully characterize titin during sarcomere assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. TITIN doublet was used to indicate a sarcomere in Fig. 4C-D. Moreover, they also used another combination (myomesin and F-ACTIN) to label a sarcomere in Fig. 6D. Can they compare the difference between these two methods or by using these two methods (TITIN doublet) and (myomesin and F-ACTIN), how is the average length of sarcomere? Will the sarcomere length be the same?</p></disp-quote><p>We noted in the manuscript that due to the organization of titin doublets (wrapping around the ends of Z-Lines) that the average titin doublet will be approximately 0.3 um longer than the ZLine. We did not expect to see a difference in lengths of myomesin M-Lines and mature actinin2 Z-Lines and indeed do not see major differences in the average lengths (between 2.0 and 2.5 um in 24 hour control cells)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. They used siRNA method to knockdown MYH6, MYH7 and MYOM and concluded that the knockdown of these genes did not affect the Z-line assembly.
