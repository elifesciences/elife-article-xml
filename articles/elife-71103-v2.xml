diverse subclasses of neurons. Towards this goal, we combined spatially precise optogenetic stimulation with multicellular recording to deeply characterize intralaminar and translaminar monosynaptic connections to supragranular (L2/3) neurons in the mouse visual cortex. The reliability and specificity of multiphoton optogenetic stimulation were measured across multiple Cre lines, and measurements of connectivity were verified by comparison to paired recordings and targeted patching of optically identified presynaptic cells. With a focus on translaminar pathways, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from genetically defined presynaptic populations were characterized by their relative abundance, spatial profiles, strength, and short-term dynamics. Consistent with the canonical cortical microcircuit, layer 4 excitatory neurons and interneurons within L2/3 represented the most common sources of input to L2/3 pyramidal cells. More surprisingly, we also observed strong excitatory connections from layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons and potent translaminar inhibition from multiple interneuron subclasses. The hybrid approach revealed convergence to and divergence from excitatory and inhibitory neurons within and across cortical layers. Divergent excitatory connections often spanned hundreds of microns of horizontal space. In contrast, divergent inhibitory connections were more frequently measured from postsynaptic targets near each other.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008796</institution-id><institution>Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hage</surname><given-names>Travis A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bosma-Moody</surname><given-names>Alice</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kratz</surname><given-names>Megan B</given-names></name><name><surname>Campagnola</surname><given-names>Luke</given-names></name><name><surname>Jarsky</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Hongkui</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Gabe J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of multicellular recording and optogenetic photostimulation was used to deeply characterize the spatial profiles and effective strengths of intralaminar and translaminar synaptic connections from genetically defined neuronal populations in the visual cortex of adult mouse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The receptive field properties of visual cortical neurons are governed by long-range synaptic connections formed across brain areas and local inputs formed between cells within a cortical area. Lack of detailed information about both inter-areal and local connections limits mechanistic understanding of how sensory information is propagated and transformed. So, too, does the absence of detailed information about the patterns of convergence of synaptic inputs to neurons in the recipient layers and divergence of outputs from the projecting layers.</p><p>Positioned between the thalamic input layer 4 and output layer 5, L2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs) represent a critical internal node in the canonical pathway. Although L2/3 neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are known to receive direct input from dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Morgenstern et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">DâSouza et al., 2019</xref>) and from higher visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">DâSouza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Young et al., 2021</xref>), monosynaptic rabies tracing suggests the majority of presynaptic inputs arise from neurons within V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wertz et al., 2015</xref>). These local inputs include well-established recurrent excitatory connections between L2/3 PCs, horizontal inhibition from nearby interneurons, and ascending inputs from L4 excitatory neurons that directly receive sensory information from thalamus.</p><p>Local ascending projections from neurons in layers 5 and 6 to L2/3 have been described in anatomical studies of sensory cortex and are thought to represent feedback from later stages of cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burkhalter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yoshioka et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harris et al., 2019</xref>). Experiments using laser scanning photostimulation combined with glutamate uncaging in visual and somatosensory cortex of juvenile rodents have identified connections from excitatory neurons in L5 to L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dantzker and Callaway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bureau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). However, connections from L5 to L2/3 have been scarce or absent when probed via simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in rodent cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomson and Bannister, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Thomson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). The L5 to L2/3 connection is most often observed from L5a and therefore thought to originate from intratelencephalic (IT)-type L5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dantzker and Callaway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bureau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). It was recently demonstrated that feedback projections from anteromedial or lateromedial visual areas preferentially target IT-type L5 neurons in V1 to generate loops between higher and lower visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Young et al., 2021</xref>), raising the possibility that local ascending projections from L5 could transmit behavioral or brain-state-related information to superficial layers. A direct comparison of the translaminar excitation from layers 4â6 to L2/3 in adult rodent V1 has not yet been made and will be necessary to understand the contributions of feedforward- and feedback inputs to the response properties of L2/3 neurons.</p><p>Likewise, direct comparisons of horizontal and vertical inhibition are needed to understand the role of local inhibition in shaping neuronal responses. Intralaminar inhibition from interneurons to nearby PCs has been described as abundant and nonselective when measured using two-photon glutamate uncaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Packer and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Karnani et al., 2014</xref>). Such horizontal inhibition from somatostatin-expressing (Sst) interneurons shapes the receptive field properties of nearby L2/3 PCs in mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>). Several patterns of vertical inhibition (mediated by translaminar inhibitory connections) have been described for Sst interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Naka et al., 2019</xref>) and parvalbumin-expressing (Pvalb) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bortone et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, subtypes of Sst interneurons may be differentially integrated into distinct layer-specific subnetworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Naka et al., 2019</xref>). While intra- and inter-laminar inhibitory inputs to L2/3 of V1 have been compared using one-photon photostimulation of GABAergic interneurons via either caged glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Xu et al., 2016</xref>) or channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">KÃ¤tzel et al., 2011</xref>), potentially unique roles of subclasses of GABAergic interneurons may be revealed by photostimulation techniques with increased genetic and spatial specificity.</p><p>To this end, two-photon excitation targeted to individual opsin-expressing neurons within genetically defined subclasses of cells can provide improved genetic and spatial precision. Two-photon optogenetic stimulation capable of inducing action potentials (APs) was first demonstrated using rapid galvo scanning of cultured dissociated neurons expressing ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rickgauer and Tank, 2009</xref>). Newly discovered and engineered opsin variants were subsequently combined with rapid scanning and patterned illumination methods to demonstrate feasibility of two-photon optogenetic stimulation in acute brain slices and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Prakash et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Packer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chaigneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ronzitti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">PÃ©gard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shemesh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Forli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>). In recent years, these methods have been combined with electrophysiological recordings to measure synaptic connectivity, with individual studies focused on recurrent excitatory connectivity within cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Izquierdo-Serra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>) or distinct connectivity of subtypes of Sst interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Naka et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the applicability of two-photon optogenetics to a probe a diverse array of potential synaptic connections by measuring the reliability and specificity of two-photon optogenetic stimulation using seven different Cre lines with either transgenic or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of the opsin ChrimsonR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). We then combined multiphoton stimulation with multicellular patch-clamp recording (up to four neurons) to measure the spatial distribution and functional properties of intralaminar and translaminar synaptic connections to neurons in L2/3 of primary visual cortex in the young adult mouse (722 total connections identified from 10,720 probed). Measures of within-layer connectivity were validated by comparing two-photon optogenetics data to independently collected, gold standard multicellular recordings from the same cortical region and developmental stage. Additionally, we performed targeted patching and validation of optically identified connections in a subset of experiments.</p><p>Consistent with the canonical microcircuit, L4 excitatory neurons (labeled by Rorb-Cre or Scnn1a-Cre) and inhibitory interneurons within L2/3 displayed the highest rates of connectivity onto L2/3 PCs, while recurrent excitatory connectivity was sparse. Furthermore, we observed translaminar connections from L5 IT-type excitatory neurons (labeled by Rorb-Cre or Tlx3-Cre), and vertical inhibition from Pvalb and Sst interneurons in L4 and L5. Multicellular recordings allowed us to identify individual presynaptic cells with divergent connections onto multiple postsynaptic targets in L2/3. Diverging outputs from inhibitory interneurons were most often confined to postsynaptic cells within 100 Âµm of each other. By contrast, translaminar connections from individual excitatory neurons in L4 and L5 often diverged to target distant postsynaptic cells separated by hundreds of microns. Many classes of synaptic connections displayed broad and skewed distributions in the amplitudes of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) â with a small minority of connections generating very strong responses. Differences in the strength, kinetics, and short-term dynamics of synaptic responses were found across presynaptic and postsynaptic subclasses of cells; however, the amplitudes of less common synaptic connections were often similar to the more canonical connection paths when probed at the single-cell level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We measured intra- and translaminar synaptic connectivity to L2/3 in primary visual cortex of young adult mouse using two-photon stimulation of ChrimsonR-expressing neurons. We used layer-specific Cre lines â Penk-Cre (L2/3 IT), Scnn1a-Cre (L4 IT), Rorb-Cre (L4 and L5 IT), Tlx3-Cre (L5 IT), and Ntsr1-Cre (L6 coritcothalamic [CT]) to stimulate excitatory neurons. Pvalb-Cre and Sst-Cre were used to stimulate subclasses of inhibitory interneurons in multiple layers. Photostimulation of possible presynaptic cells has the potential to greatly increase the throughput of synaptic physiology experiments, but the approach does not provide the verification and record of presynaptic APs for all tested connections that one obtains from multicellular patch-clamp recording. Additionally, while current injection into a patch-clamped cell reliably yields single-cell precision, photostimulation has the potential to activate nearby photosensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we began our study by carefully measuring the sensitivity and specificity of two-photon stimulation across all Cre lines used in subsequent mapping experiments.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of two-photon stimulation of ChrimsonR-expressing neurons</title><p>A number of methods have been developed for two-photon stimulation of neurons, with varying trade-offs in terms of reliability, spatial specificity, ability to stimulate multiple neurons, and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Emiliani et al., 2015</xref>).

Across all ChrimsonR-expressing cells, the minimum power necessary to reliably generate one or more AP per stimulus ranged from 0.5 to 94 mW (10 ms photostimulus duration, measured from 8 to 19 neurons for each Cre line/expression method combination; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the distributions vary between Cre lines, we observed spiking in 85â100% of targeted cells in all Cre lines when using an 85 mW photostimulus. AAV-transfected neurons in the Pvalb and Sst lines were very sensitive to photostimulation â half of the sampled cells reliably generated APs in response to 8 mW photostimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on these results, we used 85 mW as our primary photostimulation power for probing synaptic connectivity in experiments using Ai167 and excitatory Cre lines transfected with AAV. To avoid off-target activation of the more photosensitive AAV-transfected interneurons, we used a lower stimulus intensity of 35 mW, which reliably activated 86% (Pvalb) and 94% (Sst) of ChrimsonR-expressing interneurons tested.</p><p>We measured the number of light-evoked APs, the latency to the first AP, and the associated temporal jitter (standard deviation of the latency) as a function of stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The mean and standard deviation of these values at the powers used for mapping experiments are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Latency and jitter decreased with higher stimulus intensities, although the effect on jitter was less dramatic as the majority of cells displayed sub-millisecond jitter even with low-power stimuli. Some cells generated multiple APs per photostimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, we observed instances of multiple light-evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in subsequent mapping experiments and utilized exponential deconvolution to aid in identifying such cases (see âMaterials and methodsâ).</p><p>Finally, we characterized the spatial resolution of photostimulation. The probability of light-evoked spiking decreased rapidly with lateral offset of the photostimulus target (full-width at half-maximum [FWHM] of Gaussian curve fit: 12â23 Âµm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), whereas greater axial offset was necessary to observe the same decrease in light-evoked spiking (FWHM: 38â75 Âµm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

Both the latency and jitter of light-evoked spiking increased with either lateral or axial offset of the photostimulus location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). As a result, while nearly all responsive neurons displayed AP firing with short latency (&lt;15 ms) and low jitter (&lt;2 ms) following on-target stimulation (143/144 cells, 99%, aggregated across Cre lines), only 30% of photoresponses measured with 10 Âµm of lateral offset met the same criteria (127/423 photostimulus locations). Such precise firing was nearly absent with 20 Âµm of lateral offset (9/396 photostimlus locations; 2.3%). The data further suggest that off-target photostimulation is unlikely to produce reliable, short-latency synaptic responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Measurements of cell densities and estimation of off-target activation</title><p>In addition to the spatial resolution of individual opsin-expressing neurons, the likelihood of generating off-target spiking will be influenced by the density of photosensitive cells. Across Cre lines and expression methods used in this study, the average densities of labeled cells ranged from ~2000 to 22,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). As expected, labeling with interneuron Cre lines was relatively sparse in comparison to excitatory Cre lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). For each Cre line, the density of cells labeled using AAV was slightly lower or approximately equal to the corresponding density measured in Ai14 (tdTomato reporter) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; on average, density with AAV was 84% of densities measured in Ai14). In contrast, cell densities measured from Ai167 mice suggest a minority of cells within a targeted subclass were labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; on average, density with Ai167 was 25% of densities measured in Ai9 or Ai14). Incomplete or sparse labeling has been observed with other combinations of Cre lines and some TIGRE1.0 or TIGRE2.0 reporter lines ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bounds et al., 2021</xref>). Although the sparse labeling by Ai167 may be serendipitous to the extent that it limits off-target photostimulation, the more thorough labeling and inclusion of a soma-targeting motif with AAV-mediated expression motivated us to use it as our primary strategy in this study. Data collected from individual Cre lines using either method of expression (Rorb and Sst) are directly compared in subsequent sections (Figure 4B and C, Figure 6B and C, Figure 7âfigure supplement 3). When targeting excitatory subclasses, labeled cells were observed in the expected cortical layers (Figures 3-5)<bold>,</bold> and the intrinsic electrophysiological features of labeled Pvalb and Sst interneurons resembled previous reports (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).

Using these distances and the measurements of spatial resolution described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we estimated the probability of off-target activation for each neighbor. Spatial offsets and corresponding activation probabilities are illustrated for 100 randomly selected starter cells and all identified neighbors from a densely labeled driver line (Tlx3-Cre; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and a relatively sparse line (Sst-Cre; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) â both transfected with AAV. For quantification across all experimental conditions, two-dimensional histograms measuring the number of neighbors at combined lateral and axial offsets were generated and an edge correction was applied to account for possible off-target cells outside of the imaged volumes (see âMaterials and methodsâ). The resulting heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, left panels) represent the average number of labeled neighbors per targeted cell. Next, measurements of the spatial resolution of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) were used to estimate the probability of off-target activation at the same lateral and axial offsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, middle panels). The product of these two arrays predicts the number of off-target activated neighbors at each distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, right panels). Finally, the sum across all elements estimates the total number of activated off-target cells per targeted cell (0.21 off-target cells/stimulus for Tlx3:AAV and 0.03 off-target cells/stimulus for Sst:AAV). These estimates were generated for the nine experimental conditions used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, colored markers) and for homogeneously distributed photosensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) at densities up to 164,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (the average reported density of all neurons in mouse visual cortex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Keller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The estimates outlined above predict that unwanted off-target activation is uncommon with sparse interneuron Cre lines (estimated off-target cells/stimulus &lt; 0.13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), but considerably higher when using more densely labeled excitatory Cre lines (up to 0.94 off-target cells/stimulus for Ntsr1-Cre combined with Ai167; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, filled red circle). Applying photostimulation with similar spatial resolution to experiments in which a larger fraction of neurons are photosensitive (due to either broader opsin expression or use of caged glutamate) will likely activate multiple cells per target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, line plots). In close agreement with these estimates, two-photon photolysis of caged glutamate was previously estimated to activate ~4.7 excitatory neurons at each photostimulus location (based on an estimated PC density of 68,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in rat visual cortex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Matsuzaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, gray star). Therefore, restriction of photosensitivity using subclass-specific Cre lines can dramatically limit the extent of unwanted off-target activation. Additionally, synaptic responses resulting from off-target activation are expected to originate from the subclass of cells labeled by the utilized Cre line.</p><p>Finally, we considered what effect off-target activation may have on estimates of synaptic connectivity inferred from photostimulus responses. The probability of generating an off-target synaptic response will depend on both the total number of cells activated and the connection probability of those cells. If we assume that off-target presynaptic cells exhibit similar connection probabilities to the targeted cells (of a common Cre line and in a similar anatomical location), we can estimate the probability of at least one photostimulated cell producing a synaptic response (P<sub>response</sub>) as (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where P<sub>connection</sub> represents the per cell connection probability and <italic>n</italic> represents the total number of cells activated per photostimulus (including targeted and untargeted).

In this scenario, it may be difficult to distinguish abundant connectivity from ubiquitous connectivity; however, the measured likelihood of responses can potentially reveal patterns within sparsely connected circuits. It is also important to consider that as the number of off-target cells increases the potential for polysynaptic responses and/or complex responses from a heterogenous population of cells will likely increase as well. In total, these analyses predict that our two-photon optogenetic stimulation strategy will robustly correspond to underlying synaptic connectivity, even as modest off-target activation and some misassignment of connectivity to specific presynaptic cells may occur. We sought to verify these predictions in our initial mapping experiments and test putative connections identified by photostimulation using targeted patching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Intralaminar connectivity measured by two-photon stimulation resembles connectivity measured by paired recordings</title><p>Given the caveats associated with photostimulation, we began our study of synaptic connectivity to L2/3 of V1 by examining intralaminar connections so that we could compare data generated using two-photon optogenetics to analogous measurements from multicellular recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Campagnola et al., 2021</xref>).

Unlabeled cells come from experiments in which an alternative Cre line was used to drive the expression of ChrimsonR (e.g., Penk-Cre, Rorb-Cre, Tlx3-Cre). Cells labeled by the Pvalb- and Sst- Cre lines are found on opposite sides of the UMAP. Middle: a cluster of unlabeled cells near the top of the UMAP displayed properties qualitatively consistent with known features of VIP-expressing interneurons (e.g., large upstroke:downstroke ratio). Right: based on genetic labeling and observed intrinsic properties, we hypothesized that groups in the data corresponded to Pvalb-, Sst-, and VIP-expressing subclasses of interneurons. Therefore, we applied K-means clustering with the number of clusters set to 3. Clustering was based on the first eight principal components (PCs) of the intrinsic parameters (these eight PCs explain 93% of the total variation). The resulting clusters were highly consistent with the UMAP visualization and partial genetic labeling. The first cluster (maroon) included all 11 Pvalb-labeled cells, 2 Sst-labeled cells, and 33 unlabeled cells. A second cluster (orange) contained the majority of the Sst-labeled cells (25/27) and 12 unlabeled neurons. A third cluster (purple) consisted entirely of unlabeled cells (16) and corresponded to the putative VIP-expressing neurons. Finally, we compared the intrinsic features of neurons in unsupervised clusters to genetically labeled interneurons in the Allen Institute Cell Types Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>) (panels <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>). Recordings in these two datasets were made under different recording conditions (most notably, data from mapping experiments do not include blockers of synaptic transmission) and therefore the distributions of some parameters are shifted between the datasets. Despite this, the relative properties of the clusters in the two-photon mapping dataset are highly consistent with data from the Cell Types Database. For example, compared to Sst and VIP neurons, cells in the Pvalb cluster displayed lower input resistances, faster membrane time constants, more symmetrical spikes, and little adaptation of interspike intervals. These similarities combined with the accurate classification of the labeled Pvalb and Sst neurons impart a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the clusters. We therefore used cluster membership to define subclasses of patched interneurons in two-photon mapping data.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig3s1sdata1"><label>Figure 3âfigure supplement 1âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw values for plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71103-fig3-figsupp1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71103-fig3-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 3âfigure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Estimation of interneuron labeling by the Penk-Cre driver line.</title><p>Top: pseudocolored example images of double fluorescence in situ hybridization (dFISH) staining for tdTomato (magenta) and <italic>Gad1</italic> (cyan) mRNA from Ai14 reporter mice crossed to the indicated Cre lines.

The connection probability decreased significantly at larger intersomatic distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; chi-squared test statistic = 11.8, p=0.0027, largest distance of connected cells = 258 Âµm).</p><p>To determine if cell-class preferences were present in the outputs of photostimulated L2/3 excitatory neurons, we compared the frequency of observed excitatory responses in L2/3 interneurons to the frequency recorded in L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The throughput of two-photon stimulation allowed us to probe 168 potential intralaminar excitatory connections from a small number of interneuron recordings (three recordings from FSIs and two recordings from putative VIP interneurons). In contrast to the sparse excitation of L2/3 PCs, over 40% of photostimulated Penk neurons generated EPSPs in nearby FSIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; intersomatic distance &lt; 100 Âµm: 46.3%, 19/41 connections probed; Fisherâs exact p=1e-9 compared to L2/3 PCs).

The data demonstrate cell-class specificity in the intralaminar outputs of L2/3 excitatory neurons labeled by Penk-Cre in adult mouse V1.</p><p>When comparing optogenetic data to studies using paired recordings or glutamate uncaging, it is important to note that use of transgenic driver lines may label cells that are not representative of a broader population â such as excitatory neurons defined by cortical layer. Of further note with the Penk-Cre driver line, transcriptomic analysis of dissociated cells shows that reporter-labeled cells include VIP interneurons in addition to L2/3 excitatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). However, the fraction of reporter-labeled cells expressing the GABAergic marker gene <italic>Gad1</italic> appears low (~12%) when examined in situ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>; see âAnimals and stereotaxic injectionsâ for additional information). The presence of a subpopulation of interneurons within the photostimulated cells will result in a proportional underestimate of excitatory connectivity; however, relative differences across postsynaptic subclasses are expected to be preserved (as the identity of photostimulated cells will not depend on the subclass of the patched cells). Accordingly, the high connectivity of L2/3 excitatory neurons to nearby FSIs is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hofer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pala and Petersen, 2015</xref>), suggesting that Penk-labeled L2/3 excitatory neurons resemble other L2/3 excitatory neurons in terms of outgoing intralaminar connectivity.</p><p>We previously observed congruous measurements of recurrent connectivity among L5 IT neurons using either paired recordings or two-photon photostimulation of ReaChR-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>).

Spatial patterns and properties of inhibitory connections measured by two-photon photostimulation will be later discussed in greater depth (see below).

This is consistent with our characterization of the spatial resolution of our photostimulus protocol, which exceeds the size of a single soma, particularly in the axial dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In combination with statistical comparisons of two-photon mapping data to paired recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), the high positive predictive values measured for excitatory and inhibitory connections argue that connectivity measured in our mapping experiments is representative of the underlying connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Translaminar excitatory connectivity measured using two-photon optogenetics</title><p>The excitatory synaptic connection from L4 to L2/3 represents the initial feedforward projection within the canonical cortical microcircuit (immediately following input from the thalamus to L4 cells). To probe physiological features of this connection, we utilized Rorb-Cre mice with either AAV-mediated expression of soma-targeted ChrimsonR or transgenic expression of ChrimsonR via the Ai167 mouse line. Both expression methods resulted in labeling of neurons within L4, as well as relatively sparse expression in L2/3, L5, and L6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, compared to using the transgenic line, labeling by AAV was more confined to L4 and the superficial region of L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel). The differences in expression patterns could result from broader expression of Rorb over the course of development, as well as possible tropism of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Haery et al., 2019</xref>). The spatial specificity of two-photon stimulation provided the ability to sequentially stimulate individual cells to test for differences in connectivity according to presynaptic cortical layers and opsin expression methods. Optically identified connections were observed from Rorb-labeled neurons within L2/3, L4, and L5; however, connections were most often found from Rorb neurons in L4 and slightly below the L4/L5 border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Nearly all identified presynaptic partners in L4 were within 300 Âµm of horizontal distance from the L2/3 PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Within this horizontal distance, connection probabilities of L4 Rorb cells labeled by Ai167 or AAV were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As an additional comparison, we measured excitatory connectivity from L4 using Scnn1a-Cre mice (labeled with Ai167) and observed similar connection probabilities across all three groups (chi-squared p=0.18; Rorb:Ai167: 10.7%, 110 connections/1022 probed, Rorb:AAV: 7.8%, 38 connections/489 probed, Scnn1a:Ai167: 9.1%, 12 connections/132 probed).</p><p>Excitatory projections from L5 to L2/3 have been described as tightly focused and weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomson and Bannister, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Thomson and Bannister, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>) relative to inputs from L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Douglas and Martin, 2004</xref>).

Additionally, the axonal projections of Rorb neurons extend outside of primary visual cortex to higher visual areas and the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harris et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that Rorb-Cre expression in L5 revealed local projections from L5 IT neurons (that are primarily associated with inter-areal projections). To more deliberately measure the local projections of L5 IT neurons, we used the Tlx3-Cre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) to drive soma-targeted ChrimsonR expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows an example experiment in which combining multicellular recording with photostimulation revealed divergence from a Tlx3-labeled neuron to two L2/3 PCs (photostimulus 2).

In total, L5 to L2/3 PC connectivity was assayed via transgenic ChrimsonR expression driven by Rorb-Cre, as well as soma-targeted ChrimsonR expression driven by either Rorb-Cre or Tlx3-Cre with AAV.

We were unable to measure the horizontal dependence of excitatory connectivity to L2/3 FSIs as completely due to a smaller number of recordings and fewer connections tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Future experiments may benefit from genetic labeling of Pvalb and other interneuron subclasses using a complementary recombinase to allow targeted patching of less common postsynaptic targets.</p><p>Human annotation of photo-evoked connections took place over the course of the study, and it was impractical to blind the annotator to experimental parameters such as the Cre line or the cell class of the postsynaptic neurons. We questioned to what extent unintended annotator bias or variability in human attention could have influenced the results. Therefore, we employed two complementary, quantitative methods to measure connectivity (see âAnalysis of connectivityâ for details). The first used classification by a support vector machine (SVM) trained on a randomly selected subset of the annotated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The second approach used measurement of the peak photo-evoked voltage response relative to background variance (z-score) and was completely independent of human annotation. For the majority of tested connections, both methods aligned with human annotation. While discrepancies were observed for a small number of individual connections, the spatial distribution and cell-class preferences of excitatory connectivity were highly similar at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The quantitative approaches served to increase our confidence in the patterns of connectivity reported in this study, and in a small number of cases helped to identify errors in human annotation (detailed in âMaterials and methodsâ). We anticipate that further development will allow more automated annotation of mapping data and real-time analysis during data acquisition that could facilitate collection of additional photostimulus responses for putative connections.</p><p>Given that two-photon stimulation may activate multiple ChrimsonR-expressing cells, we wondered if some of the observed excitatory synaptic responses could be polysynaptic; that is, the result of AP firing in an intermediate cell that is connected to the patched cell rather than a direct monosynaptic connection from the targeted presynaptic cell. Multiple lines of evidence lead us to believe that this is not common in our dataset. First, experiments in which optically identified presynaptic partners were subsequently patched suggest that the majority of observed synaptic responses are the result of spiking in the targeted cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, the latencies of optically evoked EPSPs are consistent with our measurements of light-evoked spiking and display low jitter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, two-photon-evoked responses in patched cells rarely exceeded 1 mV or approached the threshold for AP generation (described further in Figure 7). While one-photon-evoked synaptic responses were larger (due to simultaneous activation of many cells in a field of view), these relatively strong stimuli only rarely generated APs in PCs that were not ChrimsonR-positive (i.e., directly photosensitive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, the possibility remains that intermediate cells that mediate polysynaptic connections reside in other areas of the slice or were otherwise not sampled among the cells patched in our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Translaminar and within-layer inhibition by Pvalb and Sst neurons</title><p>How, if at all, does the pattern of vertical inhibitory input to L2/3 PCs resemble that of vertical excitatory input to the same cells?

In contrast, many previous studies of synaptic connectivity have utilized transgenic labeling of interneuron subclasses that may present other caveats, such as the developmental history of Cre expression. To explore potential differences between labeling strategies, we measured Sst to L2/3 PC connectivity using the Ai167 transgenic line. Similar to experiments using Sst-Cre with AAV, we observed dense intralaminar inhibition in L2/3 as well as translaminar connections from labeled neurons in L4 and L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Notably, there were fewer labeled cells in L4 when using Ai167, leading to fewer connections probed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>); however, the fractions of photostimulated L4 Sst cells that generated a synaptic response were statistically similar (Sst:Ai167: 10.5%, 2 connections/19 probed; Sst:AAV: 20.6%, 51 connections/248 probed; p=0.38, Fisherâs exact, all measures within 200 Âµm horizontal distance). Therefore, transgenic or AAV-driven ChrimsonR expression using Sst-Cre resulted in anatomically overlapping but unique distributions of labeled cells. However, Sst-labeled cells in common anatomical locations displayed similar connectivity to L2/3 PCs in experiments using either Ai167 or AAV-mediated ChrimsonR expression.</p><p>Unlike excitatory connections, which often spanned hundreds of microns in the horizontal (anterior-posterior) dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), inhibitory connections to L2/3 PCs were more spatially confined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). The inhibitory connection probability displayed a steep decline with horizontal distance for both Pvalb and Sst connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A recent study using rabies virus to reveal the spatial distribution of presynaptic ensembles to L2/3 PCs demonstrated a broader distribution of excitatory inputs relative to inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>). This pattern is further recapitulated in our data when we combine connectivity measured across excitatory and inhibitory Cre lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, both anatomical and physiological surveys reveal differences in the spatial distribution of excitatory and inhibitory connections to L2/3 PCs.</p><p>Do translaminar inhibitory projections to L2/3 specifically target PCs, or alternatively, do translaminar inhibitory projections also form connections onto L2/3 interneurons? To address this, we photostimulated potential intralaminar and translaminar inhibitory inputs from Pvalb and Sst-labeled interneurons to L2/3 FSIs (postsynaptic FSIs were also genetically labeled in Pvalb-Cre experiments). Inhibitory connections to L2/3 FSIs were observed from presynaptic Sst- and Pvalb- interneurons in layers 2/3, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Therefore, translaminar inhibition to L2/3 is not specific to PCs and cross-layer inhibitory connections will also shape the activity of FSIs. In total, experiments measuring inhibitory connections via two-photon optogenetics demonstrate that translaminar inhibition is a feature of multiple pre- and postsynaptic subclasses in adult mouse V1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Features of synaptic connections vary by pre- and postsynaptic subclass</title><p>As shown in example experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, amplitudes of light-evoked synaptic responses varied dramatically within and across subclasses of connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Skewed distributions such as these have been described in previous large-scale surveys of synaptic properties made using paired recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sayer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Feldmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>).

interneuron.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Is the strength of a synaptic connection influenced by the subclass of the pre- and/or postsynaptic cell? To address this question, we compared PSP amplitudes measured in L2/3 PCs and L2/3 FSIs for each Cre-labeled presynaptic subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In some cases, the strength of outgoing connections from a single Cre-defined presynaptic population differed according to the postsynaptic subclass. For example, L2/3 excitatory neurons labeled by the Penk-Cre line generated dramatically larger EPSPs in L2/3 FSIs than in L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>; p=2.1e-4, post hoc Dunnâs). In other cases, the properties of connections to a postsynaptic class differed according to the presynaptic subclass. For example, IPSPs measured from Pvalb interneurons to L2/3 PCs were stronger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and displayed faster rise times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), than IPSPs measured from Sst interneurons to L2/3 PCs (amplitude: p=1.5e-6, rise time: p=5.6e-4, post hoc Dunnâs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2B and D</xref>). These observations are consistent with previously observed biases in subcellular compartments targeted by each interneuron subclass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). Namely, given that Pvalb interneurons target the soma and proximal processes of postsynaptic cells, Pvalb-mediated IPSPs will experience less dendritic filtering than IPSPs from Sst interneurons that target more distal dendritic regions. However, other mechanisms such as differences in postsynaptic receptor composition and transmitter release mechanisms may also contribute to the observed differences in PSP properties.</p><p>Experiments using Rorb-Cre and Sst-Cre with either Ai167 or viral expression of ChrimsonR led to overlapping but unique anatomical distributions of labeled cells; however, measures of connectivity at cortical depths labeled by both methods were not statistically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Could comparison of PSP properties reveal differences between the populations of cells labeled by each expression strategy that measures of connectivity did not? We compared the amplitudes, rise times, and CV of synaptic responses measured using Ai167 and AAV-mediated ChrimsonR expression for both Rorb-labeled and Sst-labeled presynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We did not observe any significant differences, but note that inhibitory connections measured using Sst:Ai167 did trend towards larger amplitude responses compared to those measured using Sst:AAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). This may be indicative of higher off-target labeling of Pvalb interneurons in transgenic Sst:Ai167 animals due to the expression of <italic>Sst</italic> in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). However, we observed greater differences between Cre lines than between expression strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Based on these observations, we pooled data acquired using Ai167 and AAV for comparisons between presynaptic subclasses.</p><p>To what extent might the relative locations of pre- and postsynaptic cells influence connection strength? We examined synaptic connection strength as a function of the horizontal distance between connected cells and the distance of the presynaptic neuron from the pia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7DâF</xref>). Within Cre lines, we observed little to no correlation between PSP amplitude and the horizontal distance between cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Differences in excitatory connection amplitudes according to the cortical layer of the presynaptic cell largely recapitulated differences observed when measuring differences across excitatory Cre lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). For L2/3 PCs, EPSP amplitudes were larger for translaminar connections than for intralaminar connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, blue markers; p=0.017, MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic>). Excitatory inputs to L2/3 FSIs displayed the opposite pattern â intralaminar excitatory connections were stronger than translaminar excitatory connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, orange markers; p=0.035, MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic>).

We expected this probability to decrease with greater intersomatic distance as it would be less likely that distant postsynaptic cells both reside within a common presynaptic axonal arbor. The process of in vitro slicing could amplify this pattern if disparate regions of an axon are more likely to become severed than adjacent regions. It was therefore surprising to find that the probability of divergence did not vary with total intersomatic distance for excitatory Cre lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>; Fisherâs exact test; Penk: p=0.29, n = 3/68; Rorb: p=0.43, n = 71/280; Tlx3: p=0.22, n = 16/103; n reported as divergence motifs/motifs in which cell <italic>i</italic> received a connection, across all distances). The data illustrate that single excitatory axons contact L2/3 neurons separated by hundreds of microns and argue that excitatory neurons display target specificity beyond spatial proximity. In contrast to excitatory neurons, both Pvalb and Sst interneurons displayed a decrease in the likelihood of completed divergence as the distance between postsynaptic targets increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>; Fisherâs exact test; Pvalb: p=0.0014, n = 56/118; Sst: p=0.046, n = 45/114; n reported as divergence motifs/motifs in which cell <italic>i</italic> received a connection, across all distances). Consistent with dense local innervation from inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Karnani et al., 2014</xref>), postsynaptic cells near each other were likely to share common input from Pvalb and Sst interneurons (Pj|i &gt; 0.5 at intersomatic distances &lt; 100 Âµm). The relatively high, but distance-dependent, probability of inhibitory divergence suggests that the outgoing connectivity of interneurons is less selective than the output of excitatory neurons. However, the data additionally illustrate that interneurons can connect to widely distributed targets as we observed examples in which postsynaptic cells more than 200 Âµm apart shared divergent inhibitory input from the same interneuron.</p><p>We next examined how divergence varies according to the layer of the presynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).

Accordingly, the number of observed divergence motifs measured using the Penk-Cre line was consistent with a random network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, for translaminar excitatory connections (from Rorb or Tlx3-labeled cells), the probability of completed divergence was two- to threefold higher than the corresponding connection probabilities measured across all tested connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Additionally, the numbers of observed divergence motifs from Rorb and Tlx3 neurons were dramatically and significantly greater than predicted by a random network (L4 Rorb: p&lt;0.001, L5 Rorb: p=0.004; L5 Tlx3: p=0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Divergence from inhibitory interneurons was also overrepresented, and this was especially true for translaminar inhibition from both Pvalb and Sst interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Data from both excitatory and inhibitory Cre lines suggest the existence of subsets of photostimulated neurons in L4 and L5 that mediate translaminar synaptic connections to L2/3. By extension, these subsets of cells in L4 and L5 likely target a greater number of neurons within L2/3 than predicted by the overall measured connection probabilities.</p><p>Finally, we examined the relationships between the strengths of divergent connections made by individual presynaptic cells onto multiple L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). We did not observe significant correlations when examining PSP amplitudes from single Rorb, Tlx3, or Pvalb neurons onto multiple L2/3 PCs (Rorb: <italic>R</italic> = â0.25, p=0.17, n = 32; Tlx3: <italic>R</italic> = â0.46, p=0.30, n = 7; Pvalb: <italic>R</italic> = 0.07, p=0.77, n = 19, Pearsonâs <italic>R</italic> in log-space). However, we found a moderate positive correlation in the amplitudes of synaptic responses measured from diverging Sst interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>; Sst: <italic>R</italic> = 0.52, p=0.016, n = 21). In total, the data demonstrate that the effective strength of connections generated by a single presynaptic neuron onto its targets can vary substantially, but also provide evidence that some Sst neurons more strongly inhibit their local network than others.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Differences in connectivity, strength, and dynamics across and within subclasses</title><p>The combination of multicellular patch-clamp recordings and multiphoton stimulation was used to probe more than 10,000 neuron pairs and characterize hundreds of synaptic connections in adult mouse V1 with genetic and spatial specificity. The data reveal aspects of synaptic connectivity, strength, and dynamics that align with specific presynaptic and/or postsynaptic cell subclasses and may suggest unique roles for these connections in cortical computations. For example, intralaminar excitatory connections from Penk-labeled neurons in L2/3 displayed a strong bias for FSIs over PCs in terms of connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and unitary connection strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In contrast, translaminar excitatory connections from Rorb- and Tlx3-neurons in layers 4 and 5 displayed similar connection probabilities for L2/3 PCs and L2/3 FSIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The intrinsic electrophysiological properties and rapid kinetics of their outgoing inhibitory connections make FSIs/Pvalb interneurons well suited to mediate feedforward inhibition (FFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>). Our measurements of excitatory inputs to L2/3 FSIs and L2/3 PCs suggest that FFI may be engaged following excitatory neuron activity within layers 2/3, 4, or 5, but will be most robustly recruited by activity within L2/3 due to the abundance and strength of intralaminar excitatory inputs to L2/3 FSIs. Strong intralaminar FFI could promote sparse coding by L2/3 PCs and contribute to feature competition among L2/3 PCs, wherein the activity of one L2/3 PC reduces the activity of similarly tuned neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chettih and Harvey, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Differences in the strength, kinetics, and dynamics of inhibitory signaling likely impart diverse computational functions to inhibitory interneuron subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Silver, 2010</xref>). Inhibitory responses from Pvalb interneurons to L2/3 PCs were on average stronger, faster, and displayed greater paired-pulse depression than responses from Sst interneurons to L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). These differences are generally consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>), but our study is unique in the extent to which both intralaminar and translaminar inhibition were characterized at the single-cell level. As differences between Pvalb and Sst connection properties were found for both intralaminar and translaminar connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and C</xref>), our data suggest that horizontal and vertical and inhibition from an interneuron subclass may serve similar computational functions.</p><p>In addition to the significant differences in connection probability and synaptic properties described above, the data reveal broad diversity within subclasses and overlapping distributions across subclasses (Figures 6 and 7). Furthermore, we recorded widely varying amplitudes of synaptic responses converging to individual postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and diverging from individual presynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).

However, it is reported that nearby cells display more similar tuning than those farther away from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ringach et al., 2016</xref>) and that local biases in orientation tuning reveal a global map in orientation tuning that spans V1 and neighboring visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fahey et al., 2019</xref>). Connections with little horizontal offset may preserve or stabilize functional maps, while connections between more horizontally distributed neurons may promote their reorganization. In our study, the highest rate of excitatory neuron connectivity to L2/3 PCs was observed from L4 Rorb-labeled neurons with 0â100 Âµm of horizontal offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) â a likely means of preserving the retinotopic map established by inputs from dLGN. However, the falloff in connection rate with horizontal distance was gradual for all classes of translaminar excitatory inputs to L2/3 PCs measured in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, there was little to no correlation between intersomatic horizontal distances and EPSP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). These findings, and the convergence and divergence of connections across hundreds of microns of horizontal space (Figures 8 and 9), illustrate putative circuit mechanisms by which translaminar excitatory connections can promote both the maintenance and redistribution of sensory information across layers.</p><p>We found that excitatory input from L5 IT neurons (labeled by either Rorb or Tlx3-Cre) to L2/3 PCs rivals excitation from L4 IT neurons (labeled by either Rorb or Scnn1a-Cre) in terms of connection probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>), unitary connection strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), as well as convergence and divergence (Figures 9 and 10). The connection from L5 IT neurons to L2/3 PCs is interesting in the context of in vivo studies demonstrating a strong influence of brain state and active behavior on the activity of neurons in primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Neske et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). If L5 IT neurons receive long-range input encoding behavioral variables from higher cortical areas, local projections from L5 IT neurons could provide a mechanism to distribute this information within V1 so that it can be integrated with synaptic connections providing sensory information (e.g., thalamic input or connections ascending from L4).</p><p>Why were excitatory connections from L5 to L2/3 previously described as sparse or weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomson and Bannister, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Thomson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>)? The age range of animals used in this study is older than most, and connectivity in younger animals may be more specifically driven by sensory input. It is also possible that the use of Tlx3 and Rorb-Cre allowed us to more thoroughly identify and measure these somewhat rare connections that may be specific to IT-type L5 neurons rather than the primarily subcortical-projecting extratelencephalic (ET)-type L5 neurons. This difference may be especially valuable in visual cortex where L5 excitatory projection types are not as distinctly separated into sublayers compared to somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Groh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). More generally, imparting photosensitivity to genetically defined subclasses of neurons can provide additional insight into the source of photostimulus responses not achieved with one-photon or two-photon glutamate uncaging. However, connections arising from unlabeled populations of cells cannot be tested. Glutamate uncaging may allow less biased measures of connectivity due to the ubiquitous expression of glutamate receptors, but the higher density of photosensitive neurons may result in greater off-target activation and subsequent false positives, even with spatially refined two-photon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâI</xref>). One such study estimated that roughly five neurons were activated at each photostimulus location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Matsuzaki et al., 2008</xref>), though effective resolution will depend on many experimental factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations of photostimulation</title><p>When assaying connectivity by photostimulation, we do not have record of presynaptic APs and instead rely on separate experiments to characterize the reliability and precision of two-photon-evoked spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found our photostimulation protocol to be effective across several Cre lines. However, we observed differences in photosensitivity between Cre lines and expression methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We endeavored to account for these differences by calibrating photostimulation power according to the Cre line used; however, due to variability between cells within a Cre line, we estimate that up to 15% of photostimulated neurons did not generate APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, while the timing of two-photon-evoked spiking in response to repeated photostimulation was highly consistent for most ChrimsonR-expressing cells (jitter &lt; 1 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), even low variability in AP timing may preclude detection of weak and/or unreliable connections. These sources of false negatives are strongly mitigated in paired recordings where variability in timing, or failure to evoke presynaptic APs by current injection, can be corrected using AP detection and alignment of postsynaptic responses.</p><p>The spatial resolution of our photostimulation protocol approached, but did not reach, the dimensions of an individual neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, photostimulation can generate spiking in off-target presynaptic cells that also express the opsin, leading to false positives when measuring connectivity. Experiments in which we subsequently patched optically identified presynaptic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) demonstrated that this occurs, but suggested that it was rare under our experimental conditions (11 verified excitatory connections in 12 tested, 22 verified inhibitory connections in 22 tested). Given the potential for both false positives and false negatives to arise from photostimulation, it was critical to compare optical measures of connectivity to measures made using paired recordings. We did so for 14 different categories of synaptic connections determined by presynaptic and postsynaptic cell identities and intersomatic distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Connection probabilities estimated by each method were not statistically different. Furthermore, connection probabilities measured using two-photon stimulation displayed a strong and significant correlation with corresponding measures made by multicellular recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Altogether, the results argue that while photostimulation carries sources of error not present in paired recordings, measurements of synaptic connectivity made at the population level accurately represent the underlying connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of slice physiology</title><p>A source of false negatives inherent to acute slice preparations is the severing of neuronal processes. This subject has been explored in other studies, and in this context, connection probabilities measured in vitro may be thought of as the lower bounds for connection probabilities present in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Stepanyants et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>). In this study, slices were cut at a slightly oblique angle to preserve neuronal processes, and we targeted patching and photostimulation to cells that were &gt;40 Âµm below the surface of the slice (both cells were &gt;40 Âµm deep for 81.9% of connections probed). We observed connections from L5 IT-type neurons (labeled by Rorb or Tlx3-Cre) to distant L2/3 neurons with 300â600 Âµm of horizontal offset â corresponding to total intersomatic distances of 485â744 Âµm (11 connections/506 probed, 2.2%). Considering this, we believe the near absence of connections observed over similar intersomatic distances (e.g., from Sst neurons with &gt;200 Âµm of horizontal offset or from Ntsr1 neurons) indicates selectivity of the connections and is not strictly a result of acute slice preparation. However, we acknowledge that intersomatic distance is not equivalent to the distance an axon travels to form a synaptic contact (e.g., synapses formed on the distal dendrites of a nearby postsynaptic cell), and some presynaptic projections may be more prone to cutting than others due to tortuous axon trajectories.</p><p>The effect of a synaptic connection on the postsynaptic membrane potential is influenced by multiple complex biological mechanisms including presynaptic transmitter release, postsynaptic receptor activation, and the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the cell. Features measured in the acute slice preparation may differ in vivo due to differences in ionic gradients and the dynamic influence of neuromodulators. Furthermore, the effect of a distal synaptic connection on its local postsynaptic compartment may be drastically different than the response measured by a somatic recording, and such connections may go undetected. To this end, recording of postsynaptic responses in either voltage- or current-clamp each comes with inherent advantages and disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Williams and Mitchell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Although voltage-clamp recording is generally thought to increase the ability to detect small responses (especially when combined with pharmacology to partially isolate synaptic currents), it presents challenges in the interpretation of results due to space-clamp errors, and strong somatic bias has been shown to persist under nominally ideal recording conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Spruston et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Williams and Mitchell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beaulieu-Laroche and Harnett, 2018</xref>). Given these limitations and the insight into cell subclass provided by the intrinsic features of patched cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we opted to conduct this survey of synaptic connectivity and functional properties using current-clamp recordings, as have many previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sayer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Feldmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Due to the diversity of postsynaptic morphologies and the target preferences of interneuron subclasses for specific subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>), the propensity to miss distal synaptic contacts is unlikely to be uniform across cell classes. In the context of results reported in this study, differences in the amplitude and kinetics of Pvalb and Sst-mediated connections are consistent with Sst neurons targeting more distal dendritic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). This may predict a greater likelihood of missed connections from Sst interneurons compared to Pvalb interneurons. Large-scale anatomical studies of cortical microcircuitry are beginning to provide unprecedented insight on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Turner et al., 2020</xref>), and it will be of great value to examine the correspondence between anatomical and physiological measures of connectivity and function across cortical cell types.</p><p>This study illustrates that combining multicellular recording with multiphoton optogenetic stimulation can efficiently characterize synaptic connectivity from genetically defined populations of neurons. Future studies can readily employ the Cre lines validated in this study with electrophysiological recording in other layers or cortical areas. Validation of additional Cre lines will allow more subclasses of connections to be probed. Furthermore, there is the potential to test for differences in synaptic connectivity between transcriptomically defined cell types within Cre line-defined subclasses by following two-photon circuit characterization with post hoc measurement of gene expression using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nicovich et al., 2019</xref>).

Fluorescence intensities measured in <italic>Gad1</italic>-defined ROIs were used to set the minimum fluorescence value required to classify tdTomato-labeled cells as co-labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In images from a Penk:Ai14 mouse, we observed colocalization of <italic>Gad1</italic> fluorescence signal in approximately 12% of tdTomato-labeled cells within L2/3 of visual cortex (26/211 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting a small minority of cortical Penk-Cre-labeled neurons are GABAergic. In comparison, <italic>Gad1</italic> labeling was observed in the majority of tdTomato-labeled cells in two interneuron Cre lines (VIP:Ai14: 191/225 cells, 85%; Pvalb:Ai14: 208/243 cells, 86%), demonstrating the relatively high sensitivity of the co-labeling criteria. Transcriptomic characterization of the other excitatory Cre lines used in this study does not suggest significant labeling of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, only 2.9% of Rorb:Ai14-labeled neurons (13/455 cells) displayed significant <italic>Gad1</italic> signal, likely resulting from close apposition of excitatory and inhibitory cells (see example image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In total, the analyses suggest that less than 20% of targeted Penk-Cre-labeled neurons were interneurons. Reducing the number of connections probed by this factor has little effect on the relative differences in excitatory connectivity measured between postsynaptic subclasses or across intersomatic distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, photostimulation data remain closely aligned with data from paired recordings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) following a reduction in the number of excitatory connections tested via photostimulation. Inhibitory synaptic responses were not observed in mapping experiments using the Penk-Cre line. This is consistent with previous reports that VIP interneurons largely avoid synapsing with L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), and our estimate that &lt;20% of Penk-labeled neurons were interneurons (resulting in a relatively small number of inhibitory connections tested).</p><p>Transgenic expression of ChrimsonR was achieved by crossing the indicated Cre line to the effector line Ai167(TIT2L-ChrimsonR-tdT-ICL-tTA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>). Expression of soma-targeted ChrimsonR was achieved by stereotaxic injection of AAV serotype one carrying ChrimsonR-EYFP fused to a K<sub>V</sub>2.1 somatic localization motif (âflex-ChrimsonR-EYFP-kv,â Addgene plasmid #135319, titer ~4 Ã 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml). Injections were made into right visual cortex of mice aged between P26 and P53. Injection coordinates were 3.8 mm posterior from bregma and 3.0 mm lateral from midline. Two injections of 500 nL each were targeted 300 and 600 Âµm below the surface of the pia with the goal of transfecting cells in all cortical layers.

We opted to use a high divalent aCSF in this study for two reasons. 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used with the intent of increasing the probability of presynaptic release, thereby decreasing the likelihood that a connection was missed as a result of a low probability of release. 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was used to limit the activation of NMDA receptors that could promote sustained depolarization of cells and increase the likelihood of polysynaptic responses. aCSF was bubbled with carbogen and maintained at 32â34Â°C with an inline heater. Slices were visualized under infrared illumination using either a Ã10/0.2 NA or Ã40/1.0 NA objective (Zeiss) and a digital camera (Hamamatsu; ORCA Flash4.0).

For the majority of experiments, we measured synaptic responses evoked by full-field one-photon stimulation before conducting two-photon stimulation of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). When measuring either one-photon or two-photon-evoked synaptic responses, automated bias current injection was used to maintain the membrane potential near â70 mV or â55 mV for mapping of excitatory or inhibitory inputs, respectively. Recordings were terminated if necessary holding current exceeded Â±300 pA or if access resistance increased above 35 Mâ¦.</p><p>PC identity was confirmed by examination of cell morphology in a two-photon z-stack acquired at the end of each experiment (typically 15â90 min after obtaining whole-cell access). Z-stacks were examined for dendritic spines and a prominent apical dendrite. To further assist in our classification of the postsynaptic cells, intrinsic properties were characterized by a family of 1 s square current injections from â130 pA to 250 to pA, in 20 pA steps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). A subset of cells required current injections &gt; 250 pA to evoke APs (additional current injections applied with +20 pA intervals). Responses to current injection were measured from a baseline membrane potential of â70 mV (adjusted by automated bias current injection). Intrinsic parameters were measured as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref> with the exception that the smallest hyperpolarizing current injection (â10 pA) was not used in our estimation of the membrane time constant. Exponential fits to the weakest hyperpolarizing current injection were often inaccurate due to background synaptic activity present in mapping experiments. AP properties (FWHM, upstroke-downstroke ratio, peak, trough, and height) were measured from the first AP evoked at rheobase. The average firing rate and adaptation index were measured from current injections 40 pA above rheobase. A small number of cells initially identified as PCs displayed electrophysiological characteristics typical of interneurons (high input resistance, narrow AP width, and/or small upstroke:downstroke ratio) and were reclassified as interneurons. Interneurons were further classified as FSIs (putative Pvalb), putative VIP, or putative Sst interneurons based on unsupervised clustering of intrinsic features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic physiological properties of recorded neurons.</title><p>Measured intrinsic values for L2/3 PCs and L2/3 interneurons.

A tunable pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra, Coherent) was used for imaging, and a fixed wavelength (1070 nm) pulsed laser (Fidelity 2, Coherent) was used for photostimulation. Locations of putative presynaptic neurons were manually identified from two-photon reference images acquired in PrairieView software. The experimenter placed a target at the center of the soma, around which a spiral path of 5 revolutions and 10 Âµm outer diameter was generated. Stimulus duration was 10 ms, and each cell was stimulated at least 20 times at 85 mW for all experiments except those using Pvalb-Cre and Sst-Cre neurons transfected with AAV. ChrimsonR-expressing neurons identified using these Cre lines with AAV-mediated expression were stimulated at 35 mW due to their higher photosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Photostimulation and electrophysiology recordings were synchronized via a TTL trigger generated by MIES acquisition software. The voltage output from the Prairie system to the photoactivation Pockels cell was recorded in MIES for precise alignment of electrophysiological recordings to the photostimulus. In initial mapping experiments, photostimulation targets were placed by the experimenter within the PrairieView user interface. However, for the majority of data collection, two-photon reference images were first collected in PrairieView and then imported into ACQ4. An experimenter placed targets within ACQ4 software, and photostimulation was controlled via the PrairieLink API. Photostimulation parameters were the same in experiments using PrairieView or ACQ4 to place photostimulus locations. In both cases, the trajectory of the photostimulation galvos was determined by the location of photostimulus targets within the two-photon reference image. The ability to visualize photostimulus locations and two-photon reference images within the same coordinate system in which transmitted light images from the camera were streamed greatly facilitated experiments in which optically identified connections were subsequently patched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>For experiments characterizing two-photon-evoked generation of APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), loose-seal recordings (20â80 Mâ¦ seal resistance) were made from ChrimsonR-expressing neurons 40â135 Âµm below the surface of the slice. ChrimsonR-expressing cells were identified by the presence of fluorescence, visualized by brief reflected light illumination via an LED. Prior to two-photon stimulation, we confirmed our ability to detect light-evoked APs by applying a 1 ms one-photon stimulation to the cell via the Ã40 objective (1.3â1.5 mW, 590 nm). The minimum power required to drive reliable two-photon-evoked spiking was determined as the stimulus intensity that generated APs on 10 out of 10 trials. Effective optogenetic excitation is predicted to decrease with depth in tissue due to increased scattering of photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yona et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this, for some of the Cre line and expression methods examined, the minimum power required to drive reliable firing displayed a weak to moderate positive correlation with cell depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, only one group reached clear statistical significance (Sst:Ai167, Pearsonâs <italic>R</italic> = 0.66, p=0.004). We did not attempt to set stimulus power according to cell depth in mapping experiments due to the moderate and variable nature of this relationship. Additional factors including strength of ChrimsonR expression and the intrinsic excitability of cells are likely to contribute to the observed variability.</p><p>To characterize the lateral resolution of our photostimulus, we delivered stimuli in a radial grid pattern containing seven spokes, each with three stimuli 10, 20, and 30 Âµm away from the center of the recorded cell. To measure the axial resolution of our photostimulus, we offset the focus of the objective above and below the recorded cell in 10 Âµm increments until we observed spiking on 0 out of 10 trials. Spatial resolution was characterized using the same photostimulation powers used for mapping. FWHM was calculated for each cell using from Gaussian fits to spike probability versus the distance of the offset (either lateral or axial).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measurements of cell densities and estimation of off-target activation</title><p>Z-stacks were collected at the conclusion of each mapping experiment (300 Âµm Ã 300 Âµm images with ~0.6 Âµm Ã 0.6 Âµm pixels, collected in 1 Âµm z-steps; 89 Â± 31 slices per stack, mean Â± SD). 217 z-stacks were used to manually identify the number and location of labeled cells. The densities of labeled cells were calculated as the number of cells divided by the imaged volume. The densities of cells in the same Cre lines crossed to the commonly utilized Ai14 mouse line (tdTomato reporter) were measured using images from the Allen Institute Transgenic Characterization webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic</ext-link>). For each Cre line, three images from experiments measuring tdTomato expression in adult mouse (P55âP97) were selected for analysis and the average densities are represented as inverted triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>. For Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre, data from adult Ai14 mice were not available; therefore, images collected from an adult Ai9 mouse were used instead. Links to images utilized and corresponding measurements are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>. To calculate density using these reference images, the volume was calculated as the product of the surface area of the region containing counted cells and the reported thickness of each slice (25â50 Âµm).</p><p>Our strategy to estimate the extent of off-target activation associated with two-photon stimulation was to associate measurements of relative cell locations denoted when measuring the density of cells to measurements of the spatial resolution of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We began by calculating the cell-to-cell distances (lateral and axial) from each cell to all other cells in the same imaged volume. We then measured the number of neighbors per cell with combined lateral and axial offsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). To avoid discounting photosensitive cells that were not imaged, we normalized the number of neighbors in each bin to the number of seed cells that were a sufficient distance from the edges of the imaged volume to include the corresponding offsets. This edge correction may result in an overestimate of off-target activation and subsequent false positives in mapping experiments as unimaged cells near the upper boundary of the slice may be prone to axonal severing and therefore unlikely to generate off-target synaptic responses. Unimaged cells below the collected z-stacks may be less likely to be activated due to the scattering of light with increasing depth and resulting need for greater photostimulus intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To avoid underestimating the errors associated with off-target photostimulation, we did not attempt to account for these factors.</p><p>For each cell-to-cell distance, we estimated the probability that one cell would be co-activated when the other was targeted. Given the variability observed between Cre lines and expression methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), each experimental condition was considered separately using corresponding characterization data. To estimate off-target activation probabilities with combined lateral and axial offsets (which were not directly measured), we first estimated the probability of off-target activation given either the lateral or the axial offset between cells. We subsequently assigned the lower of the two probabilities predicted by the independent offsets. For example, in the Tlx3:AAV dataset, a neighbor with 10 Âµm lateral offset and 10 Âµm axial offset would yield independent off-target activation probabilities of 0.18 and 0.83, respectively (estimated from Gaussian fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). In this case, off-target activation with the combined offsets would be estimated as 0.18. This may be a conservative estimate of our photostimulus resolution as the falloff in off-target activation probability may be more dramatic with combined lateral and axial offsets than with one alone. To illustrate the effective point spread functions predicted by this method, the photostimulus resolutions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> were drawn with 1 Âµm resolution. We also explored making this estimation based on a series of ellipsoids corresponding to off-target activation probabilities ranging from 0.01 to 0.99, with the radius of each axis determined by our characterization data. This strategy produced slightly lower estimates of off-target activation, but similar results in terms of relative estimates generated across Cre lines and expression methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of connectivity</title><p>The individual and averaged responses to photostimulation were quantitatively and visually assessed for evidence of a synaptic response. The features in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref> were measured in a 50 ms post-stimulus window beginning at the start of photostimulation and a 50 ms pre-stimulus window 70â20 ms before photostimulation â when no evoked responses are expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The standard deviation of both the average response and the deconvolved response was measured in a baseline window 20 ms before the onset of the photostimulus. The features were used to train a SVM on human annotation of the presence or absence of a synaptic response (using the scikit-learn package in Python; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">http://scikit-learn.org/stable/</ext-link>). Experiments examining excitatory or inhibitory responses were considered separately. The excitatory classifier was trained on 3328 randomly selected probed connections and tested against 4994 withheld probed connections (a 40â60% train-test split). The excitatory classifier achieved 99% overall accuracy in classifying the test dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The inhibitory classifier was trained on 1887 examples and tested on 2831 withheld examples and achieved 97% overall accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). False negatives missed by either classifier were typically reliable but low-amplitude or slowly rising voltage responses, whereas false positives were often caused by large changes in membrane potential only present on a small number of trials. In a few cases, discrepancies between the SVM and initial human annotations were found to be human errors. In these cases, annotations were corrected, and the analyses were repeated. To determine if differences in human versus machine classification impacted our measurements of connectivity, we ran the classifiers on the full datasets and examined the spatial distribution of connection probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The classifications provided by the SVM displayed similar patterns of connectivity with regard to cortical layer of the presynaptic cell, Cre line, postsynaptic subclass, and horizontal offset between cells.</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>Features measured for all photostimulus responses.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Features from average response</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Features from deconvolved average response</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Features from individual deconvolved responses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maximum amplitude of response (peak)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peak of deconvolved average (deconvolved peak)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Average number of times each trace exceeded 3Ã deconvolved SD</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Time of peak</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Time of deconvolved peak</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SD of number of crossings per sweep</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Standard deviation (SD) at time of peak</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SD of deconvolved trace in baseline window (deconvolved SD)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SD in baseline window</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Number of times the deconvolved trace exceeded 3Ã deconvolved SD</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Number of times the deconvolved trace exceeded 5Ã deconvolved SD</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">â</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>As an alternative measure of connectivity that was completely independent of human annotation, we generated post-stimulus and pre-stimulus z-scores for each photoresponse by dividing the peak amplitude of the average response by the standard deviation of the average response measured in a 20 ms baseline period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then set a threshold equal to the 99th percentile of all pre-stimulus z-scores. If post-stimulus z-scores exceeded that threshold, corresponding cells were classified as connected. Discrepancies between human annotation and this single measure were slightly higher compared to the machine classifier. Despite that, the patterns of connectivity examined by presynaptic layer of origin, horizontal offset, or Cre line were similar for all three methods of connection classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2DâF</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>In a subset of mapping experiments measuring excitatory connectivity from Penk neurons to L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and in all experiments measuring inhibitory connectivity between Pvalb interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), the patched cell expressed ChrimsonR. As a result, a subset of photostimulus locations near the patched cell generated subthreshold depolarization that was an artifact of direct activation of ChrimsonR. Direct stimulus artifacts were distinguished from excitatory connections based on the onset of depolarization, which was coincident with the start of photostimulation. Although the amplitudes of these artifacts were fairly modest (median = 0.23 mV), they could in principle mask small, coincident synaptic connections. Therefore, these photostimulus locations were excluded from calculation of the connection probability.</p><p>Stage coordinates of the photostimulated neurons were extracted from the position of the motorized stage and the targeted locations of the photostimulation galvos. Photostimulus locations were then offset to the position of the recorded neuron and rotated according to the orientation of the slice to provide vertical (along the pia to white matter axis) and horizontal (anterior to posterior) offsets between the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. The distance of the postsynaptic neuron from the pia was measured from overlaid transmitted light and fluorescence images captured after the neuron was filled with fluorescent dye. This postsynaptic distance from the pia was added to the vertical offset between probed cells to calculate the distance of the presynaptic neuron from the pia. This does not account for curvature of the pial surface, which was minimal for V1 across the horizontal distances considered here. Representative layer boundaries used in this study are L1 0â80 Âµm, L2/3 80â330 Âµm, L4 330â480 Âµm, L5 480â750 Âµm, and L6 750â1000 Âµm. These boundaries were informed by the Allen Reference Atlas and the positions of presynaptic neurons assayed using the layer-specific excitatory Cre lines in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To measure connection rate as a function of the distance of the presynaptic neuron from the pia and horizontal offset, we used 100 Âµm bins. Adjustment to bin sizes did not influence findings. We calculated 95% Jeffreys Bayesian confidence intervals based on the number of connections found and probed (presented as shading throughout the article) using statsmodels in Python. Fisherâs exact tests using 2 Ã 2 contingency tables and all chi-squared tests were performed using scipystats in Python. Fisherâs exact test using larger contingency tables (3 Ã 2 or 4 Ã 2) were performed in RStudio. This approach was taken (in place of chi-squared tests) when measuring the distance dependence of divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) due to the low number of expected counts.</p><p>To test for the overrepresentation of convergence and divergence motifs, we simulated random connectivity of each dataset 1000 times using experimentally measured distance-dependent and subclass-dependent connection probabilities. Distance-dependent connection probabilities were based on horizontal distance between cells and the distance of the presynaptic cell from the pia using 100 Âµm Ã 100 Âµm bins. We counted the number of convergence or divergence motifs in each simulation and compared the resulting distribution to the number of motifs observed in the experimental dataset. p-Values are reported as the fraction of simulations in which the number of motifs was equal to or greater than the observed measurement. In cases where the observed number exceeded all 1000 simulations, the p-value is reported as &lt;0.001.</p><p>To measure completed convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>), we identified all ordered pairs of probed connections that shared a common postsynaptic target (i.e., two photostimulated cells and one patched cell). We then identified all such pairs in which the first presynaptic cell formed a connection with the postsynaptic cell. From this subset of the data, we calculated the fraction of pairs in which the second presynaptic cell also formed a connection; that is, completed the convergence motif. Measurement of completed divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>) followed the same process, except that we started by considering all order pairs of probed connections that shared a common presynaptic cell (one photostimulated cell and two patched cells). Unlike the bootstrap method described above, this analysis made no assumptions of independent connectivity, nor did it employ experimentally determined measures of distance dependence. It provided complementary, descriptive measures that allowed us to examine the spatial profiles of the higher-order motifs within the dataset.</p><p>When measuring PSP amplitude correlations across convergent and divergent pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), assignment of a connection strength as <italic>i</italic> or <italic>j</italic> would be arbitrary and potentially influence the measurement of Pearsonâs <italic>R</italic>. Therefore, each pair of connections was plotted twice with a given connection amplitude assigned once as <italic>i</italic> and once as <italic>j</italic> and an <italic>R</italic> score was calculated from these values. To determine the probability of obtaining the measured <italic>R</italic> score (<italic>p-</italic>value), we used the number of unique unordered pairs in the data (one half of the number of pairs plotted). A similar approach was taken to examine recurrent connectivity between L5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Song et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of PSPs</title><p>Voltage recordings were excluded from measures of connection strength if the voltage preceding the photostimulus differed from the target voltage by &gt;5 mV or if the voltage changed by &gt;1 mV in a 50 ms window preceding the photostimulus. The latter was done to avoid the influence of rare, large amplitude spontaneous events. Individual voltage recordings were baseline adjusted by subtracting the median membrane potential in a 20 ms window before photostimulation. An average PSP was generated from the baselined sweeps. The number of two-photon-evoked presynaptic spikes and their timing varies across photostimulated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, to identify the timing of the first PSP and measure its amplitude, we used an exponential deconvolution of the average photoresponse to emphasize the timing of underlying synaptic events (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Richardson and Silberberg, 2008</xref>).

We set the threshold for peak detection to equal five times the standard deviation of the deconvolved trace prior to photostimulation (measured in a 20 ms pre-stimulus window). If a single-threshold crossing was found, we measured the peak of the average voltage response in a time window from the first threshold crossing to 20 ms later. If multiple peaks were found, the window was refined to start at the first threshold crossing and end at the time of the inter-peak minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The CV of PSP amplitudes was calculated using the peaks of each voltage trace within this time window. Rise time was calculated from the average photoresponse as the time taken to go from 20% to 80% of the peak amplitude. To avoid the influence of spontaneous background activity on this measure, we subset data for responses &gt;0.1 mV in amplitude. Measurements of PSP FWHM and PSP decay were frequently marred by the presence of multiple PSPs and are not reported.</p><p>Optically identified connections used in the estimation of the PPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) were manually identified as photoresponses with multiple time-locked PSPs observed across trials. An experimenter set two nonoverlapping time windows corresponding to the first and second PSPs. Exponential deconvolution of individual photoresponses was used to account for temporal summation of PSPs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Richardson and Silberberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Loebel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bird et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barros-Zulaica et al., 2019</xref>). For some connections, the value of Ï in Equation 2 was adjusted from a starting value of 20 ms to avoid overshoot or undershoot of the baseline. This was most often a decrease in Ï to 5â10 ms for responses measured in FSIs due to the faster membrane time constants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>) and PSP kinetics compared to L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The peak of each deconvolved photoresponse within the two windows was measured. The PPR is reported as the ratio of the second peak to the first peak. The difference in the timing of the peaks was used to estimate the inter-PSP interval.</p><p>To test for differences in connection parameters across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we first performed a KruskalâWallis (KW) test using all excitatory or all inhibitory connections grouped according to presynaptic Cre line and postsynaptic cell class. For comparisons of amplitude, rise time, and PPR, the KW test returned a low p-value, indicating that at least one group had an unequal distribution. Subsequent pairwise comparisons were made by performing a Dunnâs multiple comparisons test using the scikit-posthocs Python package. Resulting p-values are reported in each matrix element. Cohenâs d was used to measure the effect size of each pairwise comparison and was calculated as the difference in means normalized to the pooled standard deviations for the two groups (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:msqrt></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Changes in optically evoked PSP amplitudes over the course of repeated photostimulation were characterized by linear regression of PSP amplitude versus photostimulus number for each connection.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at its current form. While the significance and the impact of the work is well recognized by the reviewers, two key control experiments are deemed critical (#1 and #2). If these experiments are complete, we will be happy to look at the new submission. We have summarized the major and minor concerns from the reviewers as well as the appended the full reviews.</p><p>In this manuscript, Hage and colleagues applied channelrhodopsin-mediated 2 photon stimulation to measure the synaptic connections from layers 4, 5 and 6 to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse primary visual cortex (V1). This work built upon rich literature of the cortical microcircuits of V1. Consistent with previous studies, the authors find the highest connections to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons are from layer 4 excitatory and layer 2/3 SST neurons. Furthermore, the authors observe a log-normal distribution of connection strengths. The current work is focused on addressing adult mice circuits compared to most of the published work using juvenile mice, and is using two photon to reach single cell stimulation resolution. Because of the single-cell resolution and efficiency of the light stimulation, one main advantage of the current study is to be able to examine the input convergence to L2/3 pyramidal neurons and divergence of L4 <italic>Rorb</italic>+, L5 Tlx3+ and Sst+ neurons to L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Overall, this manuscript showed that 2p photostimulation can be used to map local cortical circuits. Regarding the biological findings, it validates previous work using paired-recording and 1p photostimulation and emphasize on the SST neurons contribution to the local circuits in V1.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1. With the combination of the 2photon stimulation and recent developed ChR2 variants, the reviewers think it is crucial to validate that the observed connections using this method are bonafide synaptic connections and to evaluate false positive and false negative rates with the method. This requires pair recordings in the following two aspects: (i) patching the optically identified putative pre and postsynaptic pair; (ii) using pair recordings to test whether the connective rates between populations of neurons is true at the statistically level. To make this feasible in the defined time frame, this will be best and easiest to do in the layer2/3 to layer 2/3 connections and is also connected with the requested experiment point 2.</p><p>2. It is essential to evaluate connections between layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. This will serve as a benchmark to be compared to not only young adult results known in laye2/3 but also to the rich literature of layer2/3 connectivity in other primary cortices. Given previous findings that local interactions in layer 2/3 may contribute to V1 tuning characteristics, this is also important to the implication in the visual biology.</p><p>3. Several major claims need to be tuned and carefully worded to reflect what the data actually suggest.</p><p>i) The cre lines label cells that are restricted to a cortical layer â  they define a cortical layer. This has to be carefully distinguished when interpreting the results and articulating the claims. In the abstract and throughout the manuscript, it needs to be made clear to the readers that the connections are to layer-specific cell types, not the layers. This is one of the differences between cre-dependent optogenetic mapping vs. glutamate uncage mapping utilizing the endogenous glutamate receptors.</p><p>ii) Given that response amplitude is dependent on pre- and post-synaptic properties that may be highly dynamic in vivo, and measurement of IPSP amplitudes almost at the reversal potential for GABA-A receptors has limited utility, it is tricky to use the PSP amplitude to calculate the connection rate in a static slice. It would be far more compelling to report currents (or better, conductance) as a readout of relative response magnitude. This point needs to be discussed and conclusions would be better softened based on such amplitude data.</p><p>iii) Title &quot;interlaminar synaptic connectivity&quot; suggests that this would be a broad survey of ascending and descending connections between many cell types across the layers, but this work only contains ascending connections onto L2/3 pyramidal cells. Reviewer suggests amending title to reflect that all inputs are converging onto L2/3 pyramidal cells.</p><p>iv) For divergence analysis, Tlx3 has a small data size (5 data points) for statistics and in layer 5, 1 connection determined the conclusion (1 divergent/249 probed). Strong claim was made based on this small data size. The authors need to either increase n number, or show that the current n number is enough for the statistic tests.</p><p>4. Data analysis and display:</p><p>i) The authors only show half of the graph on the lower two rows in Figure 1 â Supplement 1. The authors should show the activity both above and below the target cell and state the full width at half maximum for the resolution in xy and z of the photostimulation.</p><p>ii) The authors make a good point that patch-clamp technique has its flaws when it comes down to qualitatively measuring inputs from distal locations in Panels 4C-D. The authors made the case that the connectivity rates between SST to L23 and SST to L5 are relatively similar when recorded in current or voltage clamp. However the authors did not compare the actual connectivity rate between the current clamp and voltage clamp. Based on the plots, it looks like SST to L2/3 current vs SSt to L2/3 voltage clamp might be significantly different, whereas SST to L4/5 current vs SST toL4/5 voltage clamp may not appear to be different. If it is true, this would suggest that the connectivity rates measured in all other figures might be affected but not in a linear fashion across all connections. Please add statistic comparison of the connectivity using voltage and current and discuss the significance of the results.</p><p>iii) In Table 1, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used on data for which the distribution is not fully specified. Rather, the authors state that they fit the data and then tested the goodness of fit, which invalidates the calculation of the critical region. In addition, the p-value obtained with this method seems to suggest that the fit is in fact better for the normal distribution than the lognormal distribution. Perhaps the authors can confirm the calculations or discuss this issue.</p><p>iv) Connection rate data display should show individual data points, instead of just a line so readers can easily grasp the bin size, and where they fall into the cortical depth and lateral position. For example, in Figure2B right, there are positive green cells around 300 lines, and there is no data point there. It is hard to see how to get the green line in the graph from the green triangles in the middle.</p><p>5. Discussion points:</p><p>i) Please add discussion of the rationale for using 3 methods (manual, SVM, and threshold) to threshold the response. Also add description of how objectively the human determined a synaptic input. Related to the response threshold, it is also important to discuss how polysynaptic events were differentiated from monosynaptic events.</p><p>ii) Discussion of false-positive rate and false negative rate and potential sources of them. For example, what is the estimated labeling efficiency of labeling presynaptic cells? In order to validate the connectivity rate, it is important to understand how many of neuronal population that was aimed to be sampled was actually labeled with channelrhodopsin. An example where this concern might be reflected is in panel 4B. Although the same SST-Cre driver line was used, the number of sampled cells in L4 is widely different between Ai167 and AAV experiments, resulting in a doubling of the connectivity rate in L4. In general, discussion of the differences of the results from transgenic lines and the AAV viral approach is needed.</p><p>iii) Discussion on the distribution of synapses in Figure 5. Does this suggest an inverse sombrero-function of activation where excitation from neurons in neighboring columns distal neurons is suppressed by inhibitory neurons in the same column? Does short-term synaptic plasticity shaping response amplitudes?</p><p>iv) In Figure 3C, there is strong asymmetry on L6 inputs at horizontal axis. Explain and discuss the implication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Preliminary comments:</p><p>In this manuscript, Hage and colleagues applied channelrhodopsin-mediated 2 photon stimulation to measure the synaptic connections from layers 4, 5 and 6 to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). There are a lot of literature about the cortical microcircuits of V1. The main differences between the current work and the existing work are that the mice used are older than most of the previous work (adult vs. young adult) and the stimulation resolution is much higher (2 photon vs. 1 photon). Because of the single-cell resolution and efficiency of the light stimulation, one main advantage of the current study is to be able to examine the convergence of the inputs to L2/3 pyramidal neurons and divergence of L4 <italic>Rorb</italic>+, L5 Tlx3+ and Sst+ neurons to L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Overall, this manuscript showed convincing evidence that 2p photostimulation can be used to map local cortical circuits. Regarding the biological findings, there are not much novel findings using the 2P stimulation. Instead, it mostly validates many previous work using paired-recording and 1p photostimulation. Part of the reason is that although the stimulation is with 2p single cell resolution, in the analyses only the reduced resolution was used (bin size is 150 Î¼m along cortical depth and 100 Î¼m along horizontal axis), which is comparable with 1p mapping resolution.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1). The cre lines label cells that are restricted to a cortical layer â  they define a cortical layer. This has to be very carefully distinguished when interpreting the results and articulating the claims. For example, ntst-cre do not define L6 and ntsr-cre only labels deep two thirds of the layer 6. Along the line of shallower L5 neurons are more likely to connect to L2/3 pyramidal neurons, one wonders whether a cre line labeling shallower L6 would have the same results. Similarly, Tlx3 is one of many cre lines that label only a subset of L5 neurons. For exmaple, Efr3a-cre also contains contico-cortical projections (Kim et al., 2014). This issue is further exemplified in the case that L5 <italic>Rorb</italic>+ and Tlx3+ show quantitatively different results, and L4 <italic>Rorb</italic>+ and Scnn 1a+ are quantitatively different (Figure 3B, right). To this point, if L4 <italic>Rorb</italic> and Scnn1a represent independent cell types, should the connection rate of L4 is at least the sum of the L4 <italic>Rorb</italic>+ and Scnn1a+ results? To fix this problem, we should either ask the authors to have at least one other cre line in each layers, or to tone down in the entire paper what they can claim.</p><p>2) Connection rate data display should show individual data points, instead of just a line so readers can easily grasp the bin size, and where they fall into the cortical depth and lateral position. For example, in Figure2B right, there are positive green cells around 300 lines, and there is no data point there. It is hard to see how to get the green line in the graph from the green triangles in the middle.</p><p>3) The different results from transgenic lines and the AAV approach: first, it is well appreciated that the authors are comparing the results from two gene delivery methods. However, the observed differences were not addressed. E.g., Figure 4B right panel, green and red line look different within L2/3 range which is the main focus of the manuscript. Was the difference has anything to do with the ectopic expression of Sst-cre line to PV+ neurons or other cell types that have been observed in this particular line? Along the same line, in figure 3B, when it stated that <italic>Rorb</italic>-cre data were plotted using both AAV and transgenic, were the positive cells from the two are combined to generated the connection, or it is the average of the two? If it is combined, it created the bias towards L2/3 cells; if it is averaged between the two, given how different they are quantitatively in Figure 2B right panel, this also created potential bias since other layers were not operated the same way.</p><p>4) For divergence analysis, Tlx3 has a small data size (5 data points) for statistics. Therefore, for L5, based on 1 connection, it leads to the conclusion that 'the observed rates of divergence do not depend on the intersomatic distance between postsynaptic neurons' (1 divergent/249 probed). Also based these 5 data point, the authors made strong claim that 'broad diverging (Figure 7) local projections from L5 IT neurons could provide a mechanism to distribute this information within V1â¦..&quot;. The authors need to either increase n number, or show that the current n number is enough for the statistic tests.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>There is a fundamental flaw in this study: the authors did not confirm any the putative connections that they report in this work by performing dual whole cell recordings from stimulated and postsynaptic cells. Photostimulation of off-target cells may lead to false positive errors wherein off-target cells fire concomitantly with the on-target cell. If the on-target cell is not monosynaptically connected to the patched cell but the off-target cell is connected, the authors may incorrectly attribute a synaptic connection to the on-target cell. This is not a theoretical possibility since opsins are expressed in axons, presynaptic terminals and dendrites. The authors should perform dual patch clamp experiments, electrically stimulate the putative presynaptic cells, confirm the connectivity and the connection amplitude, and report the false-positive and false negative rate of their photostimulation. This is critical and, in fact, has been done in similar studies previously for more than a decade. Otherwise, their entire study is up for grabs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Hage et al. uses 2p photostimulation of ChrimsonR-expressing excitatory and inhibitory neurons to measure connectivity with postsynaptic L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Consistent with previous studies, they find the highest connections from layer 4 excitatory and layer 2/3 SST neurons. Overall, they also observe a log-normal distribution of connection strengths. These results build on a relatively large literature of similar work, but the findings do make an important addition to the field. In particular, the data sets for convergence and divergence of inputs are made possible by the outstanding multi-patch/photostimulation combination approach, substantially increasing the throughput of the experiments. Moreover, the older age of the mice versus previous studies presents an important point of comparison. The data are of high quality, and I have only a few concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>1. My biggest concern is why connections between layer 2/2 PNs were not investigated here. Even as a comparison point, it seems strange to omit intralaminar connectivity from the study. Given previous findings that local interactions in layer 2/3 may contribute to V1 tuning characteristics, it would be very helpful to get a sense of the relative contribution of intra- versus interlaminar wiring using the present method.</p><p>2. A second major concern is with the interpretation of response amplitude. As long as the response is large enough to be statistically above baseline, it seems reasonable to categorically judge that a functional &quot;connection&quot; exists. Moreover, one would expect this anatomical connection observed in the slice to be good evidence that such a connection exists in vivo. However, response amplitude is dependent on presynaptic (release probability) and postsynaptic (receptor complement and biochemical state) properties that may be highly dynamic in vivo. In addition, measuring IPSP amplitudes almost at the reversal potential for GABA-A receptors has limited utility. It would be far more compelling to report currents (or better, conductances) as a readout of relative response magnitude. Overall, it is unclear to me what conclusions to draw about PSP amplitudes in a static slice. I would urge the discussion of this point and perhaps a softening of the conclusions drawn from the amplitude data.</p><p>3. The ACSF used in this study is relatively &quot;high divalent&quot; (2 ca<sup>2+</sup> and 2Mg<sup>2+</sup>). This will raise both spike threshold and release probability, potentially skewing measures of PSP amplitude (in opposite directions) due to excessive axon conduction failure and non-physiologically high release to single spikes. This issue should at least be discussed (and the choice of ACSF explained).</p><p>4. On a slightly related note, there is no consideration for short-term synaptic plasticity shaping response amplitudes. in vivo, cellular activity can average 1-5Hz, producing sustained synaptic depression that shapes amplitudes. Given the presence of multi-spike PSPs (as illustrated in Figure 5S1), it might be possible to estimate the amount of depression/facilitation at some of the connections. These data may be modest, but would nevertheless be potentially very interesting to the field.</p><p>5.

With the high throughput of photostimulation and high stimulation resolution, the current study examined the convergence of the inputs to L2/3 pyramidal neurons using genetically defined cell population. The results are also compared with the gold standard of paired recordings. In this resubmission version, the manuscript shows convincing evidence that 2p photostimulation can be used to map local cortical circuits. This work validates many previous work using paired-recording and 1p photostimulation and further provides cell type-specific cortical connectivity.</p><p>The authors addressed all of my previous major concerns by including the pair recording data and increased sample size. I now support the publication of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>After their reticence, in this revised version the authors have finally carried out the critical dual recording control experiments that validate their method. The predictability is very high so their putative presynaptic neurons appear to be a faithful representation of the underlying connectivity. They have also toned down some of their claims and added novel statistics. I am satisfied with their response and the paper has been greatly improved. The only remaining issue is to put this work in the methodological context of previous two-photon mapping of excitatory and inhibitory cortical connections, with caged glutamate and optogenetics. The abstract, introduction and discussion are written as if the authors were the first to use two-photon mapping of synaptic circuits, ignoring any mention to previous studies. While their method may represent the current state-of-the-art in terms of throughput, genetic lines and opsins, this is not the first time that a similar approach has been published. Previous work pioneering two-photon mapping should be properly acknowledged, for the same collegiality reasons than the authors would like their own work to be properly acknowledged by subsequent studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Hage and colleagues present a semi-comprehensive survey of functional synaptic connectomics onto L2/3 pyramidal cells (PCs) in mouse V1. They go broad â sampling a good variety of Cre lines that sparsely label cell types in different layers and two major classes of GABAergic neurons. They provide an admirable and rigorous analysis of the effective spatial resolution of their photo-stimulation and perform difficult and important ground truth validation of their optogenetic approaches using targeted paired recording. Overall, I find the experiments performed to a high caliber and the conclusions largely sound. One key issue is the density of the opsin expression in these Cre lines is not quantified â neither for the Cre expression per se in each line nor the infectivity ratio, making it hard to assess the denominator in the connectivity frequency estimates. However, the presumed sparsity of expression (since they typically only sampled a relatively small number of Cre+ cells per recording with manual selection) does help mitigate any issues with 'off target' activation since their resolution is not at the single cell level.</p><p>The authors analyze their extensive data in a number of logical and expected ways, quantifying connection probability and strength vs cell type and horizontal distance from the patched PC, as well as a nice analysis of convergence, divergence, and reciprocal connections. Nearly all of their findings confirm prior work from pair recordings, helping validate their approach, with the major exception being the stronger input from L5 intratelecenphalic neurons to L2/3 PCs which is certainly interesting and unexpected based on past work.</p><p>My criticism is this study is nearly overly broad but somewhat shallow â there are many results but limited new insight gained into the underlying connectivity, and few impactful or entirely new findings. The study establishes their approach as a powerful and valid technique for sampling connectivity in this manner, but the approach has been used by others, including one of the co-authors. Thus, I am uncertain of the true impact of this study. Nevertheless, it is well executed and convincing that this approach is powerful and well-controlled.</p><p>1) Please show images of each Cre line in the Ai167 line and with viral infection. Please quantify penetrance and/or infectivity by staining for NeuN and other appropriate strains. My sense is the expression was very sparse in most cases but this is not clearly explicated or quantified.</p><p>2) The authors motivate the use of a higher power (85 mW in a small spot!) because this will spike most cells based on a very nice stimulation power analysis. This reduces false negatives but should increase false positives by increasing off target activation. This might be mitigated by very sparse expression (see point 1). Not worth redoing, but I would suggest using less power at the expense of spiking every cell in the future, particularly in denser expressing lines.</p><p>3) Based on point 1 and 2 the authors could provide estimates of how many cells on average each photo-stimulus activates in each line. This would be informative.</p><p>4) The FWHM numbers in Figure 1 and Figure 1 supplement just don't seem to match up to my eye. Perhaps the FWHM or the average has been computed improperly, or Figure 1 is reporting HWHM? From Figure 1 â Supplement 1 it's clear the 85 mW is driving saturation of spiking (hence the PSFs look 'squared off' and using less power would be preferable). Is is odd the PSFs are saturated in the z axis by not in the x axis, I can't seem to wrap my mind around that. In many of the individual examples (grey lines) the z axis FWHM looks much larger than the average, sometimes almost 100 microns. This is a cause for concern. Figure 1 S1 implies each photo-stimulation may be activiting quite a few cells along the z-axis depending on expression density.</p><p>5) Please provide more information on the Penk-Cre line, it's not actually listed in the Methods section and not a super-well established line. From the Allen website it looks very sparse and biased to L2(?). Is it all pyramidal cells, what shows this?</p><p>6) Though the study probes ~10,000 connections, this is actually not that much. Lefort et al. probed thousands by patching 6 cells at a time and doing many recordings. In table 1 the data says only 205 Exc to Exc connections were probed in L2/3. This is actually very few, not even double their paired recordings. Some explanation for the lower number is warranted â is this related to the very sparse nature of opsin expression in each line?</p><p>7) The paired recording confirmation of optically identified pairs is admirable, but if opsin expression was extremely sparse to begin with, this really isn't that compelling. In Figure 3 there appears to be very few opsin+ neurons, so their high confirmation rate is not surprising. This being said, it doesn't negate the proof their approach works, but it doesn't imply the approach would work for dense expression. If this is a real limitation of this approach is much be stated much more forthrightly in the text so other groups don't adopt this approach without carefully checking their spatial resolution. There is nothing wrong with using sparse expression for what they do in this study, but it needs to be more clear to the reader.</p><p>8) Are L5 <italic>Rorb</italic>-Cre cells more similar to L4 neurons or other L5 neurons? This is not really for this study, but would be nice to state since the AI must have the transcriptomic data.</p><p>9) What was the motivation for sometimes using the Ai167 line (not soma-targeted) and other times an AAV? Some clarification is warranted.</p><p>10) For Figure 6D, can the Exc to L2/3 be split according to presynaptic layer for clarity?</p><p>11) For the paired pulse analysis the authors identify high frequency bursts of the presynaptic cell in the postsynaptic potentials, with 5-10 ms ISIs. This is very fast (100-200Hz) and not typical for most paired pulsed analysis, although still interesting. It would have better to deliberately generate paired pulse or pulse train responses of connected neurons at lower, more physiological frequencies for most cell types (say 10-40 Hz). Also, I'm not convinced the deconvolution analysis for estimated PPF is valid, this could be assessed, at least at lower frequencies, by comparing against voltage clamp measurement of the same inputs in the same cells (this would not be compromised by space clamp since PPF measurements are of the same equally poorly clamped synapse).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71103.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

In addition to measuring excitatory connections between L2/3 pyramidal neurons, we also measured excitatory connectivity onto subclasses of interneurons within L2/3. In agreement with published findings, we found that recurrent excitatory connectivity among L2/3 pyramidal cells was sparse, while connectivity from L2/3 excitatory neurons to Pvalb and VIP interneurons was dramatically and significantly higher. In all cases, measured connection probabilities were statistically similar to measurements from paired patch-clamp recordings in the Allen Institute Synaptic Physiology dataset (Figure 3C).</p><p>We expanded this analysis to include intralaminar inhibition from Pvalb and Sst interneurons (Figure 3D, Figure 3âfigure supplement 2). As with excitatory connectivity, we did not observe any statistically significant differences between measurements from 2P optogenetics and paired recordings (Figure 3 &amp; Table 1). We believe the additional data and analyses more than fully satisfy the reviewersâ request for statistical comparisons of our photostimulation data to paired recordings among L2/3 pyramidal neurons. To the best of our knowledge, the breadth of these comparisons (multiple pre and postsynaptic cell classes at multiple intersomatic distances) is unique among photostimulation studies, and we believe this to be a major strength of our revised manuscript.</p><p>We tested optically identified excitatory and inhibitory connections by subsequent patching of the putative presynaptic neurons (Figure 4, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). For excitatory connections, we focused on translaminar connections identified using the <italic>Rorb</italic> and Tlx3 Cre lines due to the relative lack of gold standard data to compare against. In total, 11 out of 12 excitatory connections were verified (4/4 with <italic>Rorb</italic>:Ai167, 4/4 with <italic>Rorb</italic>:AAV, 3/4 with Tlx3:AAV). In experiments with inhibitory Cre lines, 22 out of 22 connections were verified (15/15 with Sst:AAV, 7/7 with Pvalb:AAV). Throughout the manuscript, a total of 8 such examples are shown (including the observed false positive; Figure 4, Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1, and Figure 5 âfigure supplement 3). The fraction of optically identified connections verified is similar to previous two-photon stimulation approaches using either C1V1 or caged glutamate to confer photosensitivity. Furthermore, PSP amplitudes measured in mapping experiments and after patching of the presynaptic cell were very strongly correlated (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Weâve extended this discussion and, as the reviewers suggest, we more explicitly made the comparison between optogenetic mapping and glutamate uncaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Given that response amplitude is dependent on pre- and post-synaptic properties that may be highly dynamic in vivo, and measurement of IPSP amplitudes almost at the reversal potential for GABA-A receptors has limited utility, it is tricky to use the PSP amplitude to calculate the connection rate in a static slice. It would be far more compelling to report currents (or better, conductance) as a readout of relative response magnitude. This point needs to be discussed and conclusions would be better softened based on such amplitude data.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Discussion section, we more explicitly discuss how the effect of a synaptic connection on the postsynaptic membrane potential is influenced by multiple complex biological mechanisms including presynaptic transmitter release, postsynaptic receptor activation and the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the cell. We also state that the features measured in the acute slice preparation may differ in vivo due to differences in ionic gradients and the presence of neuromodulators that dynamically influence synaptic transmission. We discuss our decision to use current-clamp recordings and acknowledge its limitations (also related to <italic>Concern 4ii</italic> regarding somatic recording bias). As part of this discussion, we cite several studies that highlight the challenges of using voltage-clamp to measure synaptic currents in morphologically complex cells, as well as several studies that have measured PSP amplitudes to describe the strengths of synaptic connections (similar to our study).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Title &quot;interlaminar synaptic connectivity&quot; suggests that this would be a broad survey of ascending and descending connections between many cell types across the layers, but this work only contains ascending connections onto L2/3 pyramidal cells. Reviewer suggests amending title to reflect that all inputs are converging onto L2/3 pyramidal cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The title of the manuscript has been changed to âSynaptic connectivity to L2/3 of primary visual cortex measured by two-photon optogenetic stimulationâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) For divergence analysis, Tlx3 has a small data size (5 data points) for statistics and in layer 5, 1 connection determined the conclusion (1 divergent/249 probed). Strong claim was made based on this small data size. The authors need to either increase n number, or show that the current n number is enough for the statistic tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously limited our statistical comparison of divergence to two intersomatic distances (0-100 and 100-200 microns) due to a limitation of the SciPy stats package which only supports 2x2 tables for Fisherâs Exact tests. We have exported data to RStudio which can accommodate larger contingency tables for the Fisherâs Exact tests and report an updated p-value that includes all instances of divergence (including intersomatic distances of 200-300 microns where divergence from Tlx3 was most frequent). We have also added bootstrap analyses regarding the abundance of convergence and divergence motifs observed (Figure 9 âfigure supplement 1, Figure 10 âfigure supplement 1). We no longer speak to the broad divergence of Tlx3 specifically, but instead highlight differences in the patterns of divergence observed across inhibitory and excitatory Cre lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Data analysis and display:</p><p>i) The authors only show half of the graph on the lower two rows in Figure 1 â Supplement 1. The authors should show the activity both above and below the target cell and state the full width at half maximum for the resolution in xy and z of the photostimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>These changes were made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) The authors make a good point that patch-clamp technique has its flaws when it comes down to qualitatively measuring inputs from distal locations in Panels 4C-D. The authors made the case that the connectivity rates between SST to L23 and SST to L5 are relatively similar when recorded in current or voltage clamp. However the authors did not compare the actual connectivity rate between the current clamp and voltage clamp. Based on the plots, it looks like SST to L2/3 current vs SSt to L2/3 voltage clamp might be significantly different, whereas SST to L4/5 current vs SST toL4/5 voltage clamp may not appear to be different. If it is true, this would suggest that the connectivity rates measured in all other figures might be affected but not in a linear fashion across all connections. Please add statistic comparison of the connectivity using voltage and current and discuss the significance of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>All voltage-clamp measurements were made using Sst:Ai167 animals, in large part because these mice were more readily available than mice having received stereotaxic injection of AAV.

While our data do not provide strong statistical support for the nonlinearity suggested by the reviewers, their point is well taken, and we have amended our discussion of proximity bias in somatic recordings to acknowledge that the bias is unlikely to be uniform when considering connections to and from different subclasses of neurons.</p><p>For our initial submission, we included Sst to L5 pyramidal cell data, as it demonstrated the utility of two-photon optogenetics to measure differences in connectivity from one Cre line to multiple postsynaptic subclasses (SstâL5 pyr. cell connectivity was lower than SstâL2/3 pyr. cell connectivity). In the revision, we now make similar comparisons between L2/3 pyramidal cells and L2/3 fast-spiking interneurons for several presynaptic Cre lines (Penk, <italic>Rorb</italic>, Tlx3, Pvalb, and Sst). With the additional data and analyses in our revision (2 new primary figures and 10 additional figure supplements), we think it is beneficial to remove data measuring L5 SstâL5 pyramidal connectivity to keep the manuscript focused on L2/3 as a receiving layer and stay closer to the recommended word count. We plan to share data measuring connectivity from Sst interneurons to L5 pyramidal cells along with the data in this manuscript as part of the associated GitHub and Dryad repositories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) In Table 1, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used on data for which the distribution is not fully specified. Rather, the authors state that they fit the data and then tested the goodness of fit, which invalidates the calculation of the critical region. In addition, the p-value obtained with this method seems to suggest that the fit is in fact better for the normal distribution than the lognormal distribution. Perhaps the authors can confirm the calculations or discuss this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it was a mistake to use a KS test for this analysis and thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. The low p-values obtained by comparing the observed amplitude distributions to a normal distribution indicated that we should reject the null hypothesis that the distributions were the same, so we believe our interpretation was correct in that regard. With the additional data added to the manuscript, we have modified the section on PSP amplitudes to focus on differences in synaptic strength and kinetics according to pre- and postsynaptic cell identities. We still highlight that many of the distributions of PSP amplitudes are broad and highly skewed (Figure 7, Table 2), but do not argue for the use of a lognormal distribution specifically to describe the data. We believe the comparisons between pre- and postsynaptic cell-classes will be of greater interest to a broad readership, and we appreciate the opportunity to share the measured distributions as supplemental data files for readers who wish to dig deeper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Connection rate data display should show individual data points, instead of just a line so readers can easily grasp the bin size, and where they fall into the cortical depth and lateral position. For example, in Figure2B right, there are positive green cells around 300 lines, and there is no data point there. It is hard to see how to get the green line in the graph from the green triangles in the middle.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added distinct markers to all individual estimates of connection probability. We have added a statement to each figure legend that estimated connection probabilities and confidence intervals were not drawn if fewer than 20 connections were probed. These cases most often corresponded to the cortical depths that were sparsely labeled by a given Cre line, such as near the L2/3-L4 border for <italic>Rorb</italic>-Cre in the figure mentioned by the reviewer (now Figure 4C). For the revision, we relaxed this minimum number of connections probed and now include additional connectivity estimates with broader confidence intervals. We believe it is beneficial to leave some threshold in place. In extreme cases illustrating 95% confidence intervals will require significantly expanding the corresponding axis range and make it more difficult to visualize and compare regions of the plots where our sampling (and statistical confidence) is higher.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Discussion points:</p><p>i) Please add discussion of the rationale for using 3 methods (manual, SVM, and threshold) to threshold the response. Also add description of how objectively the human determined a synaptic input. Related to the response threshold, it is also important to discuss how polysynaptic events were differentiated from monosynaptic events.</p></disp-quote><p>We have more explicitly and narratively described our rationale for using the 3 methods (to strengthen our confidence in our results and avoid influence of unintended bias on our conclusions) in the Results section. Further details were also added to the Methods.</p><p>We added multiple lines of evidence that lead us to believe polysynaptic events were uncommon in our dataset. This includes the results of new experiments confirming connections by subsequent patching â which themselves suggest the majority of optically identified connections arise from the activity of individual presynaptic neurons. From these verified connections, we also measured presynaptic AP to EPSP latencies. These measures were combined with measured photostimulus to presynaptic AP latencies (from characterization experiments of Figure 1) to generate a distribution of photostimulus to EPSP latencies that would be consistent with monosynaptic connections (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 3). This predicted distribution and the observed distribution of photostimulus to EPSP latencies are strikingly similar. However, we acknowledge here and in the corresponding section of the Results that we cannot completely rule out polysynaptic events for any given connection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Discussion of false-positive rate and false negative rate and potential sources of them. For example, what is the estimated labeling efficiency of labeling presynaptic cells? In order to validate the connectivity rate, it is important to understand how many of neuronal population that was aimed to be sampled was actually labeled with channelrhodopsin. An example where this concern might be reflected is in panel 4B. Although the same SST-Cre driver line was used, the number of sampled cells in L4 is widely different between Ai167 and AAV experiments, resulting in a doubling of the connectivity rate in L4. In general, discussion of the differences of the results from transgenic lines and the AAV viral approach is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>A large portion of the Discussion is now devoted to the limitations of photostimulation compared to paired recordings and to more general limitations of slice physiology. Additionally, potential sources of error associated with photostimulation are now described to motivate our initial characterization of photosensitivity (Figure 1).</p><p>Differences in the anatomical locations of presynaptic populations labeled by Ai167 and AAV are more explicitly discussed for both <italic>Rorb</italic> and Sst-Cre lines in the revised manuscript. We directly compared connectivity measured using Ai167 and AAV in Figures 4B, 4C, 6B, 6C, and Figure 3 âfigure supplement 3, and provide statistics in the text. Additionally, we compared features of synaptic responses measured using either Ai167 or AAV for both <italic>Rorb</italic> and Sst-Cre (Figure 7 âfigure supplement 3). Although none of these comparisons revealed significant differences between connections identified with AAV or Ai167, we highlighted that inhibitory connections identified using Sst:Ai167 did trend towards larger amplitude responses compared to those measured using Sst:AAV. Given that we observed significantly larger IPSPs in response to photostimulation of Pvalb interneurons, we proposed that this trend may be indicative of off-target labeling of Pvalb-interneurons in transgenic animals due to <italic>Sst</italic>-driven expression of Cre in early development.</p><p>Regarding the reviewersâ specific point of L4 Sst to L2/3 PC connectivity and differences in the number of cells sampled between Ai167 and AAV, the connectivity rate was calculated as the number of connections found divided by the number of connections probed within each distance bin. To probe a connection, photostimuli were targeted to individual labeled cells. We would expect differences in labeling density to be of much greater concern if stimuli were generated in a standardized grid pattern across all experiments (as is often done in one-photon mapping experiments). While the observed connection rate is lower for Sst:Ai167 compared to Sst:AAV, we highlight the highly overlapping confidence intervals (Figure 6B) and provide the following statistics in the text of the Results: (Sst:Ai167: 10.5%, 2 connections/19 probed; Sst:AAV: 20.6%, 51 connections/248 probed; p=0.38, Fisherâs Exact, all measures within 200 Âµm horizontal distance).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Discussion on the distribution of synapses in Figure 5. Does this suggest an inverse sombrero-function of activation where excitation from neurons in neighboring columns distal neurons is suppressed by inhibitory neurons in the same column? Does short-term synaptic plasticity shaping response amplitudes?</p></disp-quote><p>Weâve added a description of differences in the spatial distributions of excitatory and inhibitory connections to the end of the Results section on connectivity (Figure 6 âfigure supplement 2). We reference a recent rabies study that similarly found a broader distribution of excitatory inputs to L2/3 pyramidal cells relative to inhibitory inputs (also in mouse V1). We appreciate the suggestion to highlight and discuss this.</p><p>Weâve added a new figure describing short-term plasticity measured from photoresponses with multiple PSPs (collected from over 200 optically identified connections, Figure 8). We observed and highlight some significant differences in paired-pulse ratios measured between presynaptic Cre lines. We agree with Reviewer #3âs statement that âthe data may be modest, but would nevertheless be potentially very interesting to the fieldâ, and thank all reviewers for the suggestion.</p><p>In further regard to changes in connection strength, we characterized rundown over the course of repetitive photostimulation by performing linear regressions of PSP amplitudes versus photostimulus number. On average, rundown was small (0.2% decrease in PSP amplitude per photostimulus trial). The results (including mean, median, and standard deviation of rundown across cells) are further broken down by Cre line in the Methods section describing measurement of PSP amplitudes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) In Figure 3C, there is strong asymmetry on L6 inputs at horizontal axis. Explain and discuss the implication.</p></disp-quote><p>While heatmaps (such as Figure 3C in the initial submission) can provide a useful visualization of connection probability in two-dimensional space, they are limited in the ability to convey confidence intervals (such as those associated with sampling). In our initial submission, the âhot spotâ near the L5/L6 border that drove the apparent asymmetry on the anterior/left side of the graph has an overall connection rate of 11%; however, the associated 95% confidence interval ranges from 3-26% (3 connections found/28 probed). After conducting more experiments with <italic>Rorb</italic> and Tlx3-Cre, our sampling of these deep L5 excitatory connections increased and the âhot spotâ in this region of the plot is less prominent (Figure 6 âfigure supplement 2A). We have added an additional panel that plots connection probability with 95% confidence intervals against anterior and posterior horizontal offset (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2C; also related to Discussion point <italic>iii</italic>) to provide readers with a visual sense for these confidence intervals.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Present cell density counts for each Cre line and for viral infection and add high quality images of representative expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have presented these images and estimates of density as a new figure in the manuscript (Figure 2).

They go broad â sampling a good variety of Cre lines that sparsely label cell types in different layers and two major classes of GABAergic neurons. They provide an admirable and rigorous analysis of the effective spatial resolution of their photo-stimulation and perform difficult and important ground truth validation of their optogenetic approaches using targeted paired recording. Overall, I find the experiments performed to a high caliber and the conclusions largely sound. One key issue is the density of the opsin expression in these Cre lines is not quantified â neither for the Cre expression per se in each line nor the infectivity ratio, making it hard to assess the denominator in the connectivity frequency estimates. However, the presumed sparsity of expression (since they typically only sampled a relatively small number of Cre+ cells per recording with manual selection) does help mitigate any issues with 'off target' activation since their resolution is not at the single cell level.</p><p>The authors analyze their extensive data in a number of logical and expected ways, quantifying connection probability and strength vs cell type and horizontal distance from the patched PC, as well as a nice analysis of convergence, divergence, and reciprocal connections. Nearly all of their findings confirm prior work from pair recordings, helping validate their approach, with the major exception being the stronger input from L5 intratelecenphalic neurons to L2/3 PCs which is certainly interesting and unexpected based on past work.</p><p>My criticism is this study is nearly overly broad but somewhat shallow â there are many results but limited new insight gained into the underlying connectivity, and few impactful or entirely new findings. The study establishes their approach as a powerful and valid technique for sampling connectivity in this manner, but the approach has been used by others, including one of the co-authors. Thus, I am uncertain of the true impact of this study. Nevertheless, it is well executed and convincing that this approach is powerful and well-controlled.</p><p>1) Please show images of each Cre line in the Ai167 line and with viral infection. Please quantify penetrance and/or infectivity by staining for NeuN and other appropriate strains. My sense is the expression was very sparse in most cases but this is not clearly explicated or quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We added example images for each Cre line/expression method used in this study (Figure 2A). We measured the density of labeled cells in our experiments and report these values in Figure 2B,C. We are not aware of appropriate and validated antibodies which could be used to estimate penetrance for all Cre lines and/or targeted subclasses examined here. This is particularly challenging for the Cre lines that do not utilize an IRES insertion after the endogenous gene (Ntsr1-Cre_GN220, Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre, Tlx3-Cre_PL56). As an alternative compared the densities of cells measured in our photostimulation experiments to densities measured from same Cre lines crossed to the Ai14 tdTomato reporter (Figure 2B,C; Scnn1a was compared to Ai9 to have data from a matched age). For Pvalb and Sst interneurons, these density estimates of ~4600-4800 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in Ai14 are similar to previous density measurements for these subclasses (~4900-5000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; Kim et al., 2017; Keller et al., 2018). We could not find reported densities of cells labeled using the other Cre lines to compare our measurements to. The analysis suggests that use of AAV labeled ~85% of the targeted cells, but penetrance was lower with Ai167 (~25%). We cite previous estimates of the density of all neurons in mouse visual cortex and plot the reported average of these estimates alongside our labeled cell densities (Figure 2B,C). We note that based on these estimates, photosensitivity by Cre-mediated opsin expression is imparted to a minority of all neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors motivate the use of a higher power (85 mW in a small spot!) because this will spike most cells based on a very nice stimulation power analysis. This reduces false negatives but should increase false positives by increasing off target activation. This might be mitigated by very sparse expression (see point 1). Not worth redoing, but I would suggest using less power at the expense of spiking every cell in the future, particularly in denser expressing lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and are exploring use of either lower power stimuli or both low and high power stimuli to all tested connections in future projects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on point 1 and 2 the authors could provide estimates of how many cells on average each photo-stimulus activates in each line. This would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide these estimates for all experimental conditions using characterization data and the relative positions of labeled cells (Figure 2D-H). Additional information on the generation of these estimates is provided in the Material and Methods section and within Figure 2âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The FWHM numbers in Figure 1 and Figure 1 supplement just don't seem to match up to my eye. Perhaps the FWHM or the average has been computed improperly, or Figure 1 is reporting HWHM? From Figure 1 â Supplement 1 it's clear the 85 mW is driving saturation of spiking (hence the PSFs look 'squared off' and using less power would be preferable). Is is odd the PSFs are saturated in the z axis by not in the x axis, I can't seem to wrap my mind around that. In many of the individual examples (grey lines) the z axis FWHM looks much larger than the average, sometimes almost 100 microns. This is a cause for concern. Figure 1 S1 implies each photo-stimulation may be activiting quite a few cells along the z-axis depending on expression density.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the close attention paid to Figure 1 and the corresponding supplement. In our initial submission, we reported values as HWHM throughout the manuscript. When submitting our previously revised manuscript with a requested change to FWHM, an old version of Figure 1 was included. This has been corrected.</p><p>Regarding saturation, we have added measures of latency and jitter with lateral and axial target displacement (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 and 3). We observed progressive increases in these values with increasing spatial offset â including at distances where the spike probability is 1. An increase in latency with axial offset can also be observed in the example traces in Figure 1A.</p><p>We indeed observe variability in spatial resolution across cells and find a minority of cells that exhibit spiking with 50 Âµm of axial offset. Specifically, 17% of cells when using <italic>Rorb</italic>:AAV and 0-10% of cells in other experimental conditions. The falloff in activation probability is relatively sharp with lateral offset, so the axial alignment between cells needs to be precise to have the highest likelihood of off-target activation. We hope Figure 2D-H and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 provide qualitative and quantitative context for the relationship between photostimulus resolution and relative cell locations measured in our experiments and predicted for homogenously distributed cells across a range of densities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please provide more information on the Penk-Cre line, it's not actually listed in the Methods section and not a super-well established line. From the Allen website it looks very sparse and biased to L2(?). Is it all pyramidal cells, what shows this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more information on the Penk-Cre line to the Methods including the full name and analysis of co-labeling by the interneuron marker gene Gad1. We report the densities of labeled cells in our photostimulation experiments and with Penk-Cre crossed to Ai14. As described in response to Recommendation 1, we report that with the Cre lines used in this study, a minority of all neurons are labeled.</p><p>We added that transcriptomic analysis of cells labeled by the Penk-Cre line indicates that a subset of labeled cells are VIP interneurons (Tasic et al. 2018). To estimate the fraction of Penk-Cre labeled cells that are GABAergic interneurons, we examined double fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization images staining for tdTomato and Gad1. We observed that ~12% of tdTomato labeled cells in the Penk-Cre line are co-labeled with Gad1 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2). We performed the same analyses on analogous images from interneuron Cre lines (Pvalb-Cre and VIP-Cre) and observe a high degree of tdTomato and Gad1 co-labeling (85-86%). In contrast, we measured a low amount co-labeling with <italic>Rorb</italic>-Cre (3%) â increasing our confidence in the analysis. We describe that off-target labeling of interneurons will result in an underestimate of excitatory connection probability. However, we do not expect the identity of photostimulated cells to depend on the identity of cells patched or their relative locations. Therefore, reducing the number of connections probed by a common factor has little effect on the relative differences in excitatory connectivity observed between postsynaptic cell subclasses and across intersomatic distances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Though the study probes ~10,000 connections, this is actually not that much. Lefort et al. probed thousands by patching 6 cells at a time and doing many recordings. In table 1 the data says only 205 Exc to Exc connections were probed in L2/3. This is actually very few, not even double their paired recordings. Some explanation for the lower number is warranted â is this related to the very sparse nature of opsin expression in each line?</p></disp-quote><p>Table 1 compares data from 2P photostimulation experiments to data from paired recordings at matched intersomatic distances. The value of 205 excitatory to excitatory connections probed refers only to cells within 100 Âµm of each other. On the following row of Table 1, we report analogous data measured at 100-200 Âµm (312 connections tested by 2P opto and 48 by paired recordings). Additional photostimulation data collected with the Penk Cre line at larger intersomatic distances are shown as a map and a histogram in Figure 3B,C, but are not reported within Table 1, as we do not have sufficient paired data at these distances to make meaningful comparisons. Across all distances, we tested 895 L2/3 excitatory to L2/3 excitatory connections from 25 patched cells using the Penk-Cre line (reported in the legend of Figure 3).</p><p>For further explanation of the number of tested connections within 100 Âµm of intersomatic distance, we note the different sampling strategies of paired recordings and photostimulation. Though it is not a strict limitation, in practice, paired recordings for measuring synaptic connectivity are often made between nearby cells. In photostimulation experiments, we targeted all identified opsin-expressing cells within a 300 Âµm x 300 Âµm field of view before adjusting either the focus or stage position to examine additional cells in a new field of view. Even in cases where a patched/postsynaptic cell is centered within the frame, most of the area (~65%) corresponds to intersomatic distances &gt;100 Âµm away from the postsynaptic cell â leading to greater sampling of more distant cells. We hesitate to call this a bias as it represents the inherent geometry of the system â neurons have a greater number of distal neighbors than proximal neighbors. Notably, within our study, measuring connectivity at extended distances revealed translaminar excitatory connections with large horizontal offsets and a gradual decline in excitatory connectivity with distance relative to inhibitory connectivity (Figures 5, 6; Figure 6âfigure supplement 2). Therefore, it was informative to test connections at extended distances.</p><p>Regarding the broader merit of the ~10,000 connections probed, the impressive study of Lefort et al. (2009) reports on 8895 possible connections tested by recording from 2550 neurons. Another impressive and widely cited multipatch study (Jiang et al., 2015) describes 11,771 connections probed via 2201 patch-clamp recordings. In our study, we report on 10,720 tested connections from 384 postsynaptic recordings. As the process of patching is widely viewed as a rate limiting step, this study represents a significant improvement in throughput in this regard. The reviewer is correct that relative density of labeling does influence the throughput of a given experiment. For example, from the relatively dense Ntsr1-Cre line, we probed 1216 connections from 23 patched cells. In comparison, mapping with the sparse Scnn1a-Cre line yielded 158 tested connections from 22 patched cells. We report the total number of connections tested and the corresponding number of postsynaptic cells patched in the legends of each figure containing mapping data (Figures 3-6).</p><p>The other major factor influencing throughput is the length of the recordings. We likely could have acquired more data from each patched cell had we conducted experiments in conditions that favor longer recordings (e.g. room temperature and brain slices generated from juvenile mice). We also tested connections relatively thoroughly (each cell stimulated at least 20 times) and cautiously (at least 1 second between photostimuli). Depending on the goals of future studies, it may be beneficial to adjust some of these factors in favor examining more connections.</p><p>For most readers, we believe the focus on translaminar connectivity within the &gt;10,000 connections tested will be of greater interest than experimental throughput. While large-scale multipatch studies often include recordings from neurons in multiple layers, the sampling is commonly biased to testing intralaminar connections. For example, for inputs to L2/3 pyramidal neurons, Jiang et al. tested a total 651 intralaminar and 442 translaminar connections (from L5, L4 &amp; L6 not examined; data compiled from their Figure S14). Similarly, Lefort et al. report 1828 excitatory connections tested within layers 2 and 3, compared to 1059 possible translaminar excitatory connections to L2/3 from all other layers (L4-L6; compiled from their Table 2). 2P optogenetic stimulation allowed us to deeply characterize synaptic inputs to a single subclass of postsynaptic cell (L2/3 pyramidal cells), with a purposeful focus on translaminar connections. A total of 7824 translaminar connections to these cells were tested. From these, &gt;300 translaminar excitatory connections and &gt;100 translaminar inhibitory connections were measured. In comparison, the studies above describe a total of 65 translaminar excitatory (all from Lefort et al., 2009) and 31 translaminar inhibitory (all from Jiang et al., 2015) connections to L2/3 pyramidal cells. Our intent here to highlight the relative depth of characterization enabled by our approach. Importantly, the multipatch studies mentioned include additional, broader sampling of translaminar connections to other layers, enabled in part by the bidirectional testing of connectivity possible with paired recordings.</p><p>We hope to deepen and extend this dataset in the future, but we also believe the depth to which we have characterized translaminar synaptic connections to L2/3 (and compared to intralaminar connections under the same conditions) is unique and will be of interest to many readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The paired recording confirmation of optically identified pairs is admirable, but if opsin expression was extremely sparse to begin with, this really isn't that compelling. In Figure 3 there appears to be very few opsin+ neurons, so their high confirmation rate is not surprising. This being said, it doesn't negate the proof their approach works, but it doesn't imply the approach would work for dense expression. If this is a real limitation of this approach is much be stated much more forthrightly in the text so other groups don't adopt this approach without carefully checking their spatial resolution. There is nothing wrong with using sparse expression for what they do in this study, but it needs to be more clear to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a plot of the measured positive predictive value versus the corresponding cell densities (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). We also estimate off-target activation across a range of photosensitive cell densities (Figure 2H) and include a previously reported estimate made using two-photon glutamate uncaging in rat cortex (with a high density of endogenously photosensitive cells) that is in close agreement with our own estimates. We highlight that if photosensitivity was imparted to most neurons, with the spatial resolutions measured in our study, we would expect more common and problematic off-target activation. We hope these additions provide appropriate context and caution to readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Are L5 Rorb-Cre cells more similar to L4 neurons or other L5 neurons? This is not really for this study, but would be nice to state since the AI must have the transcriptomic data.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on transcriptomic data, at least some L5 <italic>Rorb</italic> Cre neurons more closely resemble L5 IT neurons than L4 excitatory neurons. Additionally, the long-range axonal projections measured in <italic>Rorb</italic> Cre mice are consistent with labeling of L5 IT neurons. We cite and state these previous observations more deliberately in this version of the manuscript. Given the caveats of sampling by FACS and layer dissections, it is difficult to broadly state if all or most L5-<italic>Rorb</italic> Cre cells are more similar to L4 neurons or other L5 neuron types. Spatial transcriptomics may soon provide additional information, but we agree that this question is outside of the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What was the motivation for sometimes using the Ai167 line (not soma-targeted) and other times an AAV? Some clarification is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Both strategies were developed and tested largely in parallel and found to be suitable for targeted 2P photostimulation. In the added section on density measurements, we describe how the more complete labeling with AAV was motivation to use it as our primary strategy, but also acknowledge that the sparse labeling with Ai167 may limit off-target activation. When motivating our comparison of connectivity and connection properties between Sst:Ai167 and Sst:AAV experiments, we discuss how previous studies of synaptic connectivity have primarily used transgenic labeling and that viral transfection carries caveats of possible tropism and toxicity.</p><p>Each presynaptic subclass examined in this study was tested using AAV (or both AAV and Ai167), except for Ntsr1-Cre/L6 corticothalamic neurons. As photostimulation of these cells in the Ai167 line produced little in the way of synaptic responses, we did not pursue additional mapping with somatic restriction using AAV. The lack of somatic restriction in Ai167, combined with the weak response to one-photon stimulation (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) mitigated concern that the near absence of 2P-evoked connections was a result of axonal severing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) For Figure 6D, can the Exc to L2/3 be split according to presynaptic layer for clarity?</p></disp-quote><p>Weâve added plots of excitatory and inhibitory connection amplitudes versus horizontal distance split by layer (Figure 7F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) For the paired pulse analysis the authors identify high frequency bursts of the presynaptic cell in the postsynaptic potentials, with 5-10 ms ISIs. This is very fast (100-200Hz) and not typical for most paired pulsed analysis, although still interesting. It would have better to deliberately generate paired pulse or pulse train responses of connected neurons at lower, more physiological frequencies for most cell types (say 10-40 Hz). Also, I'm not convinced the deconvolution analysis for estimated PPF is valid, this could be assessed, at least at lower frequencies, by comparing against voltage clamp measurement of the same inputs in the same cells (this would not be compromised by space clamp since PPF measurements are of the same equally poorly clamped synapse).</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous submission, we acknowledged that the measurements of STP presented here are more limited than one would obtain by paired recordings. We also described how we did not attempt to apply trains of photstimuli due to the variable photostimulus responses observed across ChrimsonR-expressing cells. Finally, we point to the potential for newer, faster opsins to make such assays more consistent and interpretable in the future. We have added references to previous studies that used exponential deconvolution to account for temporal summation of PSPs. While we are sympathetic to the reviewerâs desire for such data in this study, we donât believe this generation of tools is sufficient. We note here that the figure on STP was added following the suggestion received in our initial reviews. Extraction of STP data from doublets of PSPs has been a frequently asked question when sharing the data in other contexts as well. We hope that we have provided an adequate description of the data and our analyses to satisfy interested readers, but also make the limitations clear.</p><p>References</p><p>Jiang X, Shen S, Cadwell CR, Berens P, Sinz F, Ecker AS, Patel S, Tolias AS. 2015.
