During gamete formation by meiosis, chromosomes are reshaped to support crossover recombination and two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation. Here, we show that meiotic chromosomes are organized into functional domains by Eco1 acetyltransferase-dependent positioning of both chromatin loops and sister chromatid cohesion in budding yeast. Eco1 acetylates the Smc3 cohesin subunit in meiotic S phase to establish chromatin boundaries, independently of DNA replication. Boundary formation by Eco1 is critical for prophase exit and for the maintenance of cohesion until meiosis II, but is independent of the ability of Eco1 to antagonize the cohesin release factor, Wpl1. Conversely, prevention of cohesin release by Wpl1 is essential for centromeric cohesion, kinetochore mono-orientation, and co-segregation of sister chromatids in meiosis I. Our findings establish Eco1 as a key determinant of chromatin boundaries and cohesion positioning, revealing how local chromosome structuring directs genome transmission into gametes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome organization</kwd><kwd>boundary</kwd><kwd>Eco1</kwd><kwd>Wapl</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Rachael E</given-names></name><name><surname>Massari</surname><given-names>Lucia F</given-names></name><name><surname>Marston</surname><given-names>Adèle L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>220780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Massari</surname><given-names>Lucia F</given-names></name><name><surname>Marston</surname><given-names>Adèle L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Rachael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Rachael E</given-names></name><name><surname>Massari</surname><given-names>Lucia F</given-names></name><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Marston</surname><given-names>Adèle L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S018018/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Rachael E</given-names></name><name><surname>Massari</surname><given-names>Lucia F</given-names></name><name><surname>Marston</surname><given-names>Adèle L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation require the establishment of chromatin boundaries by the acetyltransferase Eco1, which anchors both chromatin loops and cohesion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cohesin complex defines genome architecture to support DNA repair, gene expression, and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson and Peters, 2021</xref>). Core cohesin is a DNA translocase comprising a V-shaped heterodimer of two structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, whose two ATPase heads are connected by a kleisin subunit. Cohesin folds the genome through ATP-dependent extrusion of intra-molecular DNA loops. Cohesin also entraps newly replicated sister chromatids within its tripartite structure to establish the cohesion needed for chromosome segregation. Loop extrusion and cohesion are biochemically distinct and dependent on cohesin accessory proteins, although the mechanisms are not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>). Loading of cohesin onto DNA requires the Scc2-Scc4 (NIPBL-MAU2 in mammals) complex, which also drives loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petela et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). Chromosomal cohesin is destabilized by the cohesin release factor, Wpl1/Rad61 (WAPL in mammals), an activity that is counteracted by acetylation of cohesin’s Smc3 subunit by the Eco1 acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Unal et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Cohesin-mediated loops are positioned by boundary elements. In mammalian interphase cells, the insulation protein CTCF anchors cohesin at the sites of long-range interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). In yeast, CTCF is absent, but chromosomes are nevertheless organized into cohesin-dependent loops in mitosis and convergent genes, which are known to accumulate cohesin, are found at loop boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costantino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lengronne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). Budding yeast pericentromeres provide an exemplary model of how a functional chromosome domain is folded. Cohesin loaded at centromeres extrudes loops on both sides until it is stalled by convergent genes at flanking pericentromere boundaries, thereby establishing a structure that facilitates chromosome segregation in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>). Loop size and position are also controlled by cohesin regulators. Wpl1 restricts loop size, but does not affect their positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costantino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>). Eco1 also limits long-range interactions, but additionally affects loop positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>). Whether this is a direct effect, through Eco1-mediated acetylation and inhibition of loop-extruding cohesin, or indirect, as a result of acetylated cohesive cohesin forming a barrier to translocating cohesin, is unclear. Cells lacking Eco1 are inviable due to cohesion defects, which can be rescued by removal of Wpl1 to restore viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Unal et al., 2008</xref>). However, cells lacking both Wpl1 and Eco1 show an additive increase in long-range interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that loop positioning is not essential for viability. Consistent with its essential function in establishing cohesion, in mitotically growing cells, acetylation of Smc3 occurs in S phase and is largely dependent on DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckouët et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>). As cells exit vegetative S phase, Eco1 is degraded, which prevents deposition of Smc3 acetylation post-S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons and Morgan, 2011</xref>). Overexpression of Eco1 in metaphase-arrested cells is sufficient to acetylate newly loaded cohesin, implying that Eco1 might also be capable of acetylating Smc3 independently of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckouët et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons and Morgan, 2011</xref>). Moreover, in the presence of DNA damage, Eco1 is stabilized after S phase and acts to acetylate cohesin on replicated chromosomes, albeit on the Scc1, rather than Smc3, subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lyons et al., 2013</xref>). In mammals, ESCO2 similarly acetylates SMC3 during S phase to establish cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alomer et al., 2017</xref>) while, during interphase, an additional family member, ESCO1, is active and contributes to boundary formation in chromatin looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wutz et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that Eco1-dependent cohesin acetylation can both position loops and maintain cohesion.</p><p>During gamete formation by meiosis, chromosomes undergo extensive restructuring, underpinned by cohesin-dependent chromosome looping and cohesion. In many organisms, a meiosis-specific kleisin, Rec8, enables functions that cannot be carried out by canonical kleisin, Scc1/Rad21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tóth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yokobayashi et al., 2003</xref>). During meiotic prophase, chromosomes comprise a dense array of chromatin loops emanating from cohesin-rich axes that are zipped together in homologous pairs by a central core – the synaptonemal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahoon and Hawley, 2016</xref>). Budding yeast Rec8-cohesin anchors loops at their base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>) and supports crossover recombination and DNA repair to allow prophase exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 1999</xref>). Between prophase I and metaphase I, Wpl1 removes a fraction of chromosomal Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Challa et al., 2019</xref>). WAPL also promotes meiotic release of cohesin in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and reduces loop number in mouse oocytes, although the kleisin target differs between organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crawley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Silva et al., 2020</xref>). Following prophase exit, two distinct meiotic divisions ensue (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>). During meiosis I, sister kinetochores are mono-oriented to ensure sister chromatid co-segregation. In budding yeast, the monopolin complex fuses sister kinetochores, while in fission yeast and mammals centromeric Rec8-cohesin directs sister chromatid co-segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monje-Casas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakuno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarangapani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Severson et al., 2009</xref> ). Homolog segregation at meiosis I is triggered by separase-dependent cleavage of Rec8 on chromosome arms, while pericentromeric cohesin is retained and cleaved only at meiosis II to allow sister chromatid segregation. How cohesin-dependent loop formation and cohesion are spatially and temporally regulated to establish distinct functional chromosome domains in meiosis remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we identify Eco1 acetyltransferase as a key determinant of localized meiotic chromosome structure in budding yeast. In meiosis, Eco1 acetylates Smc3 both linked to and independently of DNA replication and is critical for viability, even in the absence of Wpl1. Eco1 counteracts Wpl1 to allow centromeric cohesion establishment and thereby kinetochore mono-orientation. In contrast, arm cohesion and prophase exit require an Eco1 function other than Wpl1 antagonism. We show that anchoring of chromatin loops is the critical Wpl1-independent function of Eco1. While Eco1 and Wpl1 independently restrict chromatin loop size in prophase I, only Eco1 is critical for boundary formation, notably at pericentromere borders. We propose that cohesin acetylation by Eco1 traps both loop extruding and cohesive cohesin complexes at boundaries to define a chromosome architecture that is essential for meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Eco1 acetylates cohesin during meiotic S phase, independently of DNA replication</title><p>To determine the timing of Eco1-dependent Smc3 acetylation during meiosis, wild-type cells carrying functional <italic>ECO1-6HIS-3FLAG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were arrested in G1 prior to meiotic S phase and then released (by conditional <italic>IME1/IME4</italic> expression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>), allowing synchronous meiotic DNA replication and nuclear divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Upon induction of meiosis in the presence of rapamycin, Smc3-Ac was undetectable in <italic>ECO1-FRB-GFP</italic> cells and full-length Rec8 persisted long after its expected time of degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Furthermore, only a minor fraction of <italic>ECO1-FRB-GFP</italic> cells completed the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

Therefore, the FRB-GFP tag on Eco1 specifically affects meiosis, and we employed the <italic>ECO1-FRB-GFP</italic> allele as a constitutive meiotic loss-of-function mutant.

We conclude that Eco1 acetylates Smc3 on residues K112,113 during S phase of meiosis, and that Eco1 is required for efficient meiotic division.</p><p>We reasoned that Eco1 activity early in meiosis may be required to counter Wpl1-dependent cohesin destabilization during any of the subsequent stages of meiosis. If this is the case, deletion of Wpl1 may overcome the impaired ability of <italic>eco1-aa</italic> cells to undergo the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Wpl1 promotes the non-proteolytic removal of cohesin between meiotic prophase and metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Challa et al., 2019</xref>). Prior to meiotic S phase, functional Wpl1-6HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) gains an activating phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Challa et al., 2019</xref>) and its overall levels increase, as visualized by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in cells synchronously undergoing S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Following S phase, and reminiscent of the sequential loss of cohesin from chromosome arms and pericentromeres, Wpl1 undergoes stepwise degradation during meiosis I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To test the idea that Eco1 allows meiotic progression by countering Wpl1, we sought to measure spore formation and viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, deletion of <italic>WPL1</italic> in the <italic>eco1-aa</italic> background only slightly increased the formation, but not the viability, of spores, while <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells showed a small decrease in spore viability, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but could be related to the relative distance of the <italic>CEN5-GFP</italic> labels from the centromere in the two studies. Importantly, <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> has only a minor effect on meiosis and spore viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, chromosome segregation fidelity in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells is comparable to wild type (see below), indicating that cohesion is largely functional. We conclude that a critical role of Eco1 in cohesion establishment at centromeres is to counteract Wpl1, while on chromosome arms Eco1 plays an additional, essential function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Eco1 counteracts Wpl1-dependent cohesin destabilization during meiotic prophase</title><p>While Wpl1 promotes cohesin removal from chromosomes between prophase exit and metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Challa et al., 2019</xref>), paradoxically, Wpl1 levels and the slower migrating, presumed active, form decline at prophase exit and are instead highest during meiotic S and prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, Wpl1 may need to be counteracted by Eco1 prior to or during meiotic prophase. Calibrated ChIP-seq revealed a global increase in the levels of the cohesin subunit Smc3 on chromosomes of <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> prophase I cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We confirmed that the majority and similar numbers of cells had undergone DNA replication and that Smc3 total protein levels were comparable in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In contrast, chromosomal Smc3 was greatly reduced in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> genome-wide, with the exception of core centromeres, where cohesin levels were less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, inactivation of Wpl1 increased the chromosomal levels of Smc3 in <italic>eco1-aa</italic>, and this was particularly apparent at centromeres, where Smc3 levels in <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> were comparable to the <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> mutant alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Elsewhere, including at pericentromere borders and known chromosomal arm cohesin sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>), Smc3 levels in <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> were similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). ChIP-seq of the meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8 in prophase I revealed a similar pattern to that of Smc3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the different strains cannot be directly compared due to lack of a suitable antigen for calibration (see Materials and methods), inspection of Rec8 levels in individual strains confirmed that Eco1 is more important for Rec8 association with borders and arm sites than centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our Rec8 and Smc3 ChIP-seq show that the function of Eco1 at pericentromere borders and chromosome arms in meiotic prophase is twofold. First, Eco1 protects cohesin from Wpl1-dependent removal since cohesin levels are higher in <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> compared to <italic>eco1-aa</italic> cells. Second, Eco1 has an additional, Wpl1-independent function in cohesin retention at border and arm sites because cohesin levels are higher in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> compared to <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Eco1 restricts Wpl1-dependent removal of chromosomal cohesin during meiotic prophase and retains cohesin at pericentromere borders.</title><p>Wpl1 globally reduces chromosomal cohesin levels, while Eco1 is required for normal cohesin levels on chromosome arms.

To understand how Eco1 and Wpl1 define chromosome structure in meiotic prophase, we performed Hi-C 6 hr after inducing <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> cells to sporulate and confirmed consistent DNA content for all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Analysis of contact probability on chromosome arms as a function of genomic distance revealed an increase in long-range interactions in both <italic>eco1-aa</italic> and <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> mutants, which was further exacerbated in <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Plotting the slope resulted in a right-ward shift of the curve maxima, which estimates the average size of the loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This indicated an increase in loop size from ~10 kb in wild type to ~20 kb in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> or <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells and up to ~40 kb in <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Heatmaps of individual chromosomes corroborated the additive increase in long-range interactions in <italic>wpl1Δ eco1-aa</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Further inspection revealed that spots and stripes on the Hi-C contact maps, indicative of positioned loops anchored on two or one sides, respectively, were stronger and increased in number in <italic>wpl1</italic>Δ, but were more diffuse in <italic>eco1-aa</italic>, even after <italic>WPL1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that loop boundaries/anchors are strengthened by <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> but lost in <italic>eco1-aa</italic>. Mirrored pileups of all 16 wild-type pericentromeres centered on the centromeres confirmed the organization of the flanking chromatin into two separate domains, indicating that centromeres act as insulators, as in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the absence of active Eco1 reduced insulation across centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; see also top-right and bottom-left quadrants on the ratio difference maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The intensity of the Hi-C contact stripe protruding from centromeres increased at progressively longer distances in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> and <italic>wpl1Δ eco1-aa</italic> cells compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, arrows), suggesting that Eco1 limits the extent of loop extrusion by cohesin complexes anchored at centromeres. Pileups centered on all 32 pericentromere borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>) revealed strong boundaries in wild type, which were sharper and more defined in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). In contrast, boundaries at pericentromere borders were barely detectable in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> and were only partially rescued by deletion of <italic>WPL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), suggesting that Eco1 is critical to halt loop extrusion at borders, even in the absence of Wpl1. Note that border pileups also display a second centromere-proximal stripe (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), corresponding to loop extrusion from the centromeres that is increased in intensity in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic>, consistent with the centromere pileups. Both <italic>eco1-aa</italic> and <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> cells also exhibited reduced insulation at borders, indicating that Eco1 is also important to prevent loop extrusion across borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Consistent with the pileup analysis, examination of individual wild-type pericentromeres revealed the presence of Hi-C spots, indicative of positioned loops, between the centromere and each of the two borders, as marked by the characteristic tripartite Smc3 ChIP-seq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). While stronger Hi-C spots were localized with tripartite Smc3 in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells, both features were absent in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> and weaker in <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These data indicate that Wpl1 and Eco1 limit loop expansion through distinct mechanisms in meiotic prophase. While Wpl1 destabilizes loop-extruding cohesin to reduce its lifetime, Eco1 anchors cohesin at boundary sites to stabilize and position loops. We further note that Eco1-dependent loop stabilization critically defines the boundaries that demarcate the pericentromeric domain. This is consistent with the greater requirement of Eco1 to maintain cohesin association with borders and chromosomal arm sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Eco1 restricts long-range chromatin interactions.</title><p>Hi-C analysis of chromosome conformation in meiotic prophase of wild-type (AM28719), <italic>eco1-aa</italic> (AM28720), <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> (AM29750), and <italic>eco1-aa wpl1Δ</italic> (AM29781) cells carrying <italic>ndt80Δ</italic>.

Nevertheless, several observations imply that loop boundaries are established throughout meiotic S phase and prophase. First, in wild-type cells, loop extrusion progressively shapes meiotic chromosomes from G1 to prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>). Second, meiotic loops are strictly dependent on Rec8 and their boundaries correspond to Rec8 peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>), but Rec8 expression does not occur in the early G1 phase prior to meiotic entry (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In either wild-type or <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> cells arrested in meiotic G1 (equivalent to timepoint 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), long-range contacts were absent and no loops or loop boundaries were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>).

Ratio difference maps show a striking change in chromatin conformation surrounding borders and centromeres between meiotic G1 and prophase with the appearance of strong loop anchors and centromere insulation only in prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

In <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> cells, contact frequency in the 5–100 kb range, indicative of chromosome condensation, was only slightly increased in prophase compared to G1. However, the average loop size was slightly lower than in the wild type (~8 kb in <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> vs. 10 kb in wild type; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Examination of individual pericentromeres and border pileups showed that Hi-C stripes were anchored at the pericentromere borders in <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>), though to a lesser extent than in wild type (see ratio maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

Unfortunately, and for reasons that are currently unclear, we found that <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ eco1-aa</italic> cells are inviable (data not shown), while <italic>cdc6-md eco1-aa</italic> cells were viable with no apparent growth defect.

The less sharp cohesin peaks in <italic>cdc6-md</italic> cells suggest that DNA replication, or the presence of cohesin engaged in cohesion, limits the spreading of loop-extruding cohesin in meiosis. Inactivating Eco1 in <italic>cdc6-md</italic> cells further decreased both arm and pericentromeric cohesin peaks, similar to <italic>eco1-aa</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). Therefore, Eco1 anchors cohesin at least in part independently of cohesion, that is, by acting directly on loop-extruding cohesin.

First, Eco1 directs the formation of cohesin-dependent boundaries and loop anchors in unreplicated cells. Second, loop anchors are further focused and strengthened in the presence of a sister chromatid. Therefore, Eco1 is likely to promote loop anchoring through cohesion-dependent and -independent mechanisms, with the latter occurring via acetylation of loop-extruding cohesin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Recombination prevents prophase exit in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> cells</title><p>We next sought to understand how boundary formation and cohesion establishment by Eco1 impact meiotic chromosome segregation.

Therefore, Eco1 is essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis II, even in the absence of Wpl1. One potential explanation for these findings is that localization of the cohesin protector protein, shugoshin (Sgo1), or the meiotic protein Spo13, which is also required for cohesin protection during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galander et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galander et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), may require Smc3 acetylation.

We conclude that Eco1-dependent Smc3-Ac functionally organizes meiotic chromosomes for their segregation. At centromeres, Eco1-dependent Smc3 acetylation counteracts Wpl1 to direct sister kinetochore mono-orientation and thereby enforce sister chromatid co-segregation in meiosis I. Eco1 acetylation of Smc3 is also essential for prophase exit and sister chromatid segregation in meiosis II, even in the absence of Wpl1, likely due to its requirement for cohesin anchoring to establish chromatin boundaries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cohesin regulators organize functionally distinct chromosomal domains</title><p>We have shown how cohesin regulators remodel chromosomes into functionally distinct domains to allow for the unique events of meiosis.

These functions of Eco1 and Wpl1 that we uncovered in meiosis may also explain how other chromosome domains are established to support other genomic functions, including localized DNA repair and control of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Loop anchoring allows the formation of specific chromosomal boundaries</title><p>Eco1 associates with replication factors and is proposed to couple cohesion establishment to DNA replication by traveling with replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ladurner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lengronne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2012</xref>). In mitotically dividing yeast cells, Smc3 acetylation is largely coupled to DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>); however, during meiotic S phase, substantial Smc3 acetylation, and anchoring of chromatin boundaries, occurs even in the absence of DNA replication. The anchored loops that form on unreplicated chromatin require Eco1 similarly to those on replicated chromatin. Cohesin acetylation also occurs without DNA replication in mammalian G1 cells, with a preference for STAG1-containing cohesin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alomer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wutz et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, Smc3-Ac can exist independently of cohesion establishment. Indeed, Smc3-Ac per se is not critical for cohesion since mitotic <italic>eco1Δ wpl1Δ</italic> yeast cells build sufficient cohesion to support viability. How Eco1 gains access to cohesin that is not associated with replication forks remains to be understood, but it is interesting to speculate that specialized cohesin subunits, for example, STAG1 in mammals or Rec8 in yeast, may allow cohesin targeting by Eco1 independent of the replication machinery.</p><p>In addition to Wpl1 antagonism, Eco1 and Smc3-Ac confer a more fundamental role in chromosomal loop positioning that we find to be indispensable for meiosis. We envisage that early in meiosis, prior to DNA replication, Scc2-Scc4-cohesin complexes load onto chromosomes and begin to extrude loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Loaded cohesin, and loops, has a limited lifetime due to the removal of unacetylated cohesin by Wpl1. However, a fraction of cohesin engaged in <italic>cis-</italic>looping is acetylated by Eco1, with two consequences. First, Smc3-Ac blocks cohesin’s Wpl1-dependent release. Second, Smc3-Ac anchors cohesin at the base of loops, preventing loop migration and restricting extrusion, resulting in the stable positioning of moderately sized loops. The absence of Wpl1 increases the lifetime of loop-extruding cohesin complexes, resulting in loop extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costantino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>). The combined absence of both Eco1 and Wpl1 results in mobile cohesin with extended lifetimes on chromosomes and untempered loop-extruding activity, leading to long, poorly positioned loops. Therefore, the role of Eco1 in anchoring cohesin is Wpl1 independent and is essential for meiosis. The positioning activity of Eco1 also facilitates cohesion establishment along chromosome arms by anchoring cohesin complexes that are engaged in linking the two sister chromatids (‘cohesive cohesin’). Whether it does this directly by acetylating cohesive cohesin to prevent its migration or indirectly by generating <italic>cis-</italic>loops that form a barrier to translocation of cohesive cohesin is unclear. Our finding that the converse is also true, that is, that loop boundaries are increased in focus in the presence of a sister chromatid, together with the fact that functional pericentromeric cohesion in meiosis II also requires Eco1, suggests that cohesive cohesin complexes are also directly positioned by acetylation, At centromeres, Smc3-Ac, which blocks the destabilizing activity of Wpl1, is sufficient for cohesion establishment, likely due to enhanced cohesin loading or specialized anchoring mechanisms at this site. A recent report indicates that Eco1-dependent Smc3 acetylation also establishes loop positioning in S phase of yeast mitotic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastié et al., 2021</xref>). Exactly how acetylation affects cohesin enzymology awaits detailed biochemical analysis. However, recent reports investigating the relationship between molecular structure and loop-extruding activity of human cohesin identified the residues acetylated by Eco1 as part of the surface that binds DNA in the cohesin ‘clamp’ structure. The clamp is one of the conformational transitions occurring in the part of the cohesin cycle required for the loop extrusion step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for Eco1 and Wpl1 roles in meiosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In wild-type cells (top panel), Eco1 cohesin acetylation is essential in three meiotic processes: it protects centromeric cohesin from Wpl1-mediated release, allowing sufficient cohesion to be built to establish mono-orientation; it positions DNA loops along chromosome arms to promote recombination and prophase exit; and it positions loops and cohesion at pericentromeric borders to guide correct sister chromatid segregation in meiosis II.

We found that Eco1 and Smc3-Ac are critical for the completion of meiotic recombination to allow exit from meiotic prophase. Restoration of cohesin levels in Eco1-deficient cells by removal of Wpl1 was insufficient to support DNA repair and prophase exit, or for chromosomal arm cohesion. We speculate that loss of positioned chromatin loops causes defects in the repair of double-strand breaks, leading to a delay in prophase exit. Eco1-dependent cohesin anchoring may promote homology search, be required to reel broken ends within loops to chromosome axes for repair, and/or ensure that loops are positioned in register with the homologous chromosome. Although positioned loops are readily detectable during meiotic prophase in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), loops appear less positioned in mouse, rhesus monkey, human, and mouse spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavattam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zuo et al., 2021</xref>).

Although we cannot currently rule out the possibility that Eco1 has an additional substrate that confers its function in sister kinetochore co-orientation as has been suggested for fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kagami et al., 2017</xref>), the simplest explanation is that acetylation of Smc3 by Eco1 counteracts Wpl1 at centromeres allowing the establishment of centromeric cohesion, which in turn facilitates kinetochore fusion via the monopolin complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, budding yeast lacking Rec8 cohesin do not show co-orientation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monje-Casas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>), raising the possibility that mitosis-like, Scc1-containing cohesin complexes confer the co-orientation function of cohesin at centromeres. It will be of great interest to understand how monopolin and cohesin-mediated co-orientation pathways intersect to ensure proper meiosis I chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Pericentromere boundaries define persistent cohesion at meiosis II</title><p>During meiosis, cohesion on chromosome arms requires Eco1 and Smc3-Ac even in the absence of Wpl1. This argues against the idea that the key function of Smc3-Ac in cohesion is to antagonize Wpl1. Instead, we propose that the ability of Eco1 to reinforce chromatin boundaries is critical for cohesion during meiosis. This phenomenon is most apparent at pericentromere borders, where centromere-loaded cohesin is trapped by convergent genes in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>). In meiosis II, cells rely entirely on cohesin at pericentromere borders to hold sister chromatids together. We now show that Eco1 is required to retain cohesin at these sites and, consequently, to establish the boundaries that structure pericentromeres during meiosis. As a result, sister chromatids undergo random meiosis II segregation in cells lacking Eco1, whether or not Wpl1 is present. This can explain why cohesin anchoring is essential in meiosis but not in mitosis, where cohesin is present also along chromosome arms. Understanding how Eco1-dependent Smc3 acetylation and convergent genes together trap cohesin to elicit loop anchoring and cohesion at pericentromere borders is an important question for the future.</p><p>The critical importance of cohesion and loop positioning for chromosome segregation has important implications for meiosis in human eggs, where the events of prophase and the meiotic divisions are temporally separated by years. It will be interesting to understand whether Esco1/2 remain active in mammalian eggs and whether this is important to safeguard cohesin during the female reproductive lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Importance of cohesin anchoring</title><p>A universal feature of cohesin-dependent chromosome organization is the existence of boundary elements that position both loops and cohesion. However, how these boundaries are established and the functional importance of cohesin anchoring were unclear. We found that Eco1-dependent cohesin acetylation confers boundary recognition and cohesin anchoring. The importance of loop anchoring was revealed by their requirement for proper recombination and pericentromeric cohesion in meiotic chromosome segregation. Our demonstration of the importance of cohesin anchoring for fundamental chromosomal processes provides a framework for understanding how chromatin folding into defined domains maintains and propagates the genome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Finally, NEXTflex-6 barcoded adapters (PerkinElmer) were ligated using 1 μl Quick T4 DNA Ligase (NEB) and DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with NEXTFlex primers (primer 1–5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC</named-content>; primer 2–5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT</named-content>) and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) and further purified with AMPure XP beads to eliminate unligated primers and adapters. Libraries were sequenced with 42 bp paired-end reads on an Illumina NextSeq500 (EMBL Core Genomics Facility, Heidelberg, Germany). Hi-C read numbers for each library are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>.</p><p>For Hi-C data analysis, FastQ reads were aligned to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SK1 reference genome using HiC-Pro v2.11.4 bowtie2 v2.3.4.1 (<monospace>--very-sensitive</monospace> -L 30 <monospace>--score-min</monospace> L,−0.6,–0.2 <monospace>--end-to-end --reorder</monospace>), removing singleton, multi hit, duplicated, and MAPQ &lt; 10 reads. Read pairs were assigned to restriction fragment (<italic>Dpn</italic>II) and invalid pairs filtered out. Valid interaction pairs were converted into the .cool contact matrix format using the cooler library, and matrices balanced using Iterative correction down to 1 kb resolution. Multiresolution cool files were uploaded onto a local HiGlass server. To generate pileups at centromeres/pericentromeric borders, the cooltools library was used and cool matrices were binned at 1 kb resolutions. Plots were created around the midpoint of centromeres/pericentromeric borders at the same coordinates used for ChIP-seq plots (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>), with 25, 50, and 100 kb flanks on each side, showing the log<sub>10</sub> mean interaction frequency using a color map similar to HiGlass ‘fall’. All centromere annotations were duplicated in both the forward/reverse strand orientations to create an average image, which is mirror symmetrical. Pileups at pericentromeric borders were oriented where positions are identical in relation to the centromere. The ratio pileups between samples were created in a similar fashion plotting the log<sub>2</sub> difference between samples in the ‘coolwarm’ color map, for example, A/B; red signifying increased contacts in A relative to B and blue decreased contacts in B relative to A.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Akira Shinohara as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dean Dawson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Thanks for giving us an opportunity to review your paper on &quot;Eco1-dependent cohesin acetylation anchors chromatin loops and cohesion to define functional meiotic chromosome domains&quot;. As mentioned above, three reviewers as well as a senior editor, discussed your results, and all acknowledge the importance of this paper and recommend possible publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we agree that additional experiments are required for revision of the paper, which described in detail below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. HiC analysis at 0 h in clb5, clb6: The authors nicely showed that the clb5 clb6 double mutant (and CDC6mn), which is defective in meiotic DNA replication, shows Eco1-dependent acetylation of Smc3 (Figure 1E and S1E). This is clearly difference from mitotic cells, which show replication-dependent Smc3 acetylation. The key finding in the paper would be on replication-independent border formation (Figure 5). One concern is whether this is indeed promoted by Smc3 acetylation or comes from chromosome memory of the boundary from previous mitotic cells. To distinguish these possibilities, the authors need to analyze boundary profiles in the clb5 clb6 double mutant (and wild type) at 0 h and compared to those in prophase I (Figure 5).</p><p>2. Live-imaging of sister centromeres during meiosis I: The role of Eco1-dependent Smc3 acetylation in promoting mono-polar kinetochore formation is one of the key findings (Figure 6) since previous studies showed mono-polar orientation of sister kinetochores during meiosis I does not depend on Rec8-cohesin in budding yeast. The authors only analyzed the results of chromosome segregation after anaphase I of the spo11 eco1-aa mutant. It would be helpful if the authors could see bipolar sister kinetochores on meiotic spindles during meiosis I. One concern is on precocious sister separation in late prophase I may cause similar defect in the assay (Figure 6C and D). The authors can check the status of sister centromeres in late prophase I, metaphase I and anaphase I in the spo11 eco1-aa mutant by live-imaging of cells with CenV-GFP used in Figures 2 and 6.</p><p>3. Discussion on functionality of Eco1-FRB-GFP: Since the FRB-GFP tag seems to affect the functionality of Eco1 protein in meiosis, it would be nice to carry out a complemental approach such as auxin-degron. However, there might be similar problem(s) for any tagging, even for N-terminal tagging. Thus, it is recommended that, by text rewriting, the authors describe more clearly about the limitation of the tag to know the Eco1 function in vivo and soften some conclusions in the text.</p><p>4. Figure 7H and a model: In this model, the authors suggest the model on a cohesin-mediated loop-extrusion and sister chromatid cohesion. As, in the paper, the authors showed two distinct cohesin-mediated structures on centromeres and chromosome arms (and pericentromeres). It would be helpful to readers if the authors provide models on how cohesin- and its acetylation-mediated chromatin structures on the two regions.</p><p>In addition of these major points, 3 reviewers gave comments shown below, some of which are redundant to the above points. It would be nice to respond (or rebut) them also.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Although the authors have not analyzed the defect of the eco1-aa mutant in meiotic recombination in detail, which would be for future studies, the authors need more detailed analysis of chromosome segregation at meiosis I and II by examining microtubule(spindle) dynamics to see the altered centromere and peri-centromeric regions affect the spindle dynamics to see a molecular role of the chromosomal regions in accurate segregation of chromosomes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below are a number of thoughts, critiques, and suggestions that might help to make the manuscript more impactful. They are arranged according to their order in the manuscript.</p><p>Line 76: Here and elsewhere (until the Discussion) there is de-emphasis of the fact that it is already known that Eco1 in yeast can act outside of S-phase to acetylate Smc3 (albeit at lower levels). This was shown in G1 and in cdc6 mutants in the two publications listed. I think it would be easier to state up front that this is known to occur.</p><p>Related – it might be worth mentioning that budding yeast Eco1 levels are down-regulated in vegetatively cells as they exit S-phase by (by CDK phosphorylation and degradation) – (Lyons and Morgan 2011)</p><p>Line 111: &quot;In meiosis, Eco1 acetylates Smc3 independently of replication….&quot; This result could appreciated in context if the known (G1, cdc6, and DNA damage) examples of Eco1 acetylating Smc3 in replication-independent scenarios had been spelled out.</p><p>Line111: Maybe should say &quot;both linked to and independently of DNA replication&quot;. It's not all independent of replication.</p><p>Line 136: I'm not sure this is so &quot;Surprising&quot; if one is already aware that Eco1- family proteins are known to acetylate Smc3 outside of S-phase and in some situations much more than in S-phase. I personal feel the editorial starter words (Surprisingly, Interestingly, etc.) seem manipulative when I'm reading a Results section (although, yes, I do it myself sometimes – probably to be manipulative).</p><p>Line 163: &quot;Therefore….&quot; It's not ideal to have a tag that inactivates meiotic function even without the rapamycin added, but I understand the constraints of trying to modulate gene function in meiosis. So does this result mean that there is a meiosis-specific function (or at least one that is more essential in meiosis than mitosis) that involves the carboxy-end of Eco1?</p><p>Line 164: Do you mean – &quot;cells that were induced&quot;?</p><p>Line 165: Does &quot;eco1-aa&quot; stand for something?</p><p>Line 169: Does it have to be &quot;later&quot; stages? Not any time after cohesin establishment?</p><p>Line 184: &quot;Therefore..&quot; This sentence seems like it should be moved in front of the sentence that precedes it.</p><p>Line 194: What makes it remarkable?</p><p>Line 196: The cohesin defects of WPL1 mutations have been reported previously – though using a CEN5 marker (Challa et al.,?). Shouldn't this be mentioned here?</p><p>Line 197: Shouldn't it be &quot;a&quot; critical role? Is there only one?</p><p>Line 198: Maybe Eco1's essential function on arms is to counteract Wpl1, but only after Wpl1 does its other critical function -not cohesin unloading – the unappreciated function that is necessary for normal cohesion establishment/function. Wpl1 deletion shouldn't be expected to restore cohesion in eco1-aa since you have shown that wpl1 has a cohesion defect.</p><p>Line 198: Here and throughout the paper I thought this role of Wpl1 in promoting cohesion that you are revealing (even though Challa saw it previously) was under-discussed. It helps to show us that cohesion regulation isn't just a few genes each with a singular function (cohesion &quot;off&quot; or cohesion &quot;on&quot;)</p><p>Figure 4: I found Figure S4 A and B to be very helpful. Could they be included in Figure 4?</p><p>Line 260: The &quot;length&quot; of contact stripe is a bit hard to know since it gets very dim. &quot;Intensity – yes.</p><p>Line 265: Would it be more accurate to say the boundaries persisted in wpl1 (the ratio map w WT in Figure S4F looks mainly neutral at the borders), but the movement towards longer loop sizes in wpl1 makes the borders look brighter in Figure 4F because there is less red around the border stripes (ie. Better signal to noise, not a stronger signal)?</p><p>Line 290: The &quot;interestingly&quot; seems to suggest this observation is unprecedented. But there is evidence in budding yeast of low levels acetylation in unreplicated vegetative cells. Further, the demonstration earlier in the paper that in meiosis, Eco1 levels persist after S-phase into meiotic prophase (an important observation) would make this result an expected one, given that in other situations when the Eco family of transacteylases are present they will acetylate Smc3.</p><p>Line 295-339: I think these are important results (cohesin deposition in clb5 clb6 cells). But a critical control is to demonstrate that the observed clb5, clb6 cohesin patterns (Figure 5) are not residual cohesins from the preceding mitotic cycle and were indeed deposited during the replication-free meiosis. I don't think it is critical to the manuscript but a time course of cohesin loading in clb5, clb6 would be informative (T=0 to T=6).</p><p>Line 371: The apparent disjunction of sisters in the spo1 eco1-aa cells would, if true, be an important observation, making budding yeast a little more like other organisms with respect to co-orientation of sisters. However, an alternate explanation is that in the eco1-aa the sisters simply become totally disconnected before metaphase I and separate independently: 50% to opposite poles (pretty close to 40%) and 50% to the same pole. If in eco1-aa prophases, 20% of sisters stayed connected and co-oriented and 80% lost track of each other and segregated randomly the cells would exhibit the observed result. This could be resolved with a video. If the sisters orient mid-spindle as a single unit (one GFP spot) in prometaphase then disjoin at anaphase I, the reported conclusions are justified. If sisters behave as two independent GFP foci in pro-metaphase then partition randomly a different interpretation (that cohesin holds sisters together in prophase) is required.</p><p>Line 406: &quot;Therefore…&quot;. I'm confused by this conclusion. The experiments show Eco1 is required at meiosis II for something that isn't just amounts of cohesin, Sgo1 or Spo13. And that &quot;thing&quot; is necessary for MII bi-orientation or cohesion – but it isn't clear what the thing is.</p><p>With respect to post-replicative Eco1 activity in meiosis. Is it worth discussing the persistence if Eco1 in meiotic prophase reported here relative Eco1 regulation in mitotic cycles? Is persistence related to the behaviors of Eco1 in cells with DNA damage since meiotic prophase cells are full of DSBs? Maybe not – just a thought.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors are encouraged to confirm some of the more distinctly unusual effects, such as the strong prophase arrest and the Wpl1-independent cohesin maintenance defect, using an independent eco1 allele, such as a ts allele or an auxin degron allele.</p><p>2. Figure 2D. Please provide separate graphs for spore formation and spore viability. This combined data is difficult to look at and also does not show whether there is a spore formation defect in the eco1 wpl1 double mutant.</p><p>3. Line 407: The conclusion &quot;the failure to build rather than to protect&quot; is an overstatement and should be softened. The authors show nicely that the mutants are not obviously defective in protection, but that the meiosis II missegregation is a defect in building cohesion has not been shown beyond correlation.</p><p>4. Figures 6B: Please provide better description of these data. Were these numbers taken at a particular time point or at the end of the live cell imaging? Also, please provide time course data as in 6A for the meiotic progression of experiments in 7E and S7A.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74447.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Also, Scc1 (or Rec8 when considering subsequent entry into meiosis) is not expressed until after START (we examined this previously in mitosis (Fernius et al., 2013)) and this is apparent for meiosis from Figure 1C, E and I in our current manuscript. Given the absence of chromosomal cohesin in early G1, and our prior demonstration that the boundaries are strictly dependent on cohesin (Paldi et al., 2020) together with the demonstration from the Neale group that Rec8 is required for loops in meiosis (Schalbetter et al., 2019), it seems unlikely that a chromosome memory of the boundary could persist from mitotic cells into meiosis. Moreover, both the Neale and Koszul groups showed that in the G1 phase before meiosis loops are absent and established only throughout meiotic S phase and prophase I (Muller et al., 2018; Schalbetter et al., 2019).</p><p>Nevertheless, we carried out the suggested experiment, performing Hi-C on meiotic G1 arrest (<italic>IME1, IME4</italic> depletion), which is prior to S phase and prior to Rec8 expression. The Hi-C data for wild type and <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> in the <italic>ime1/ime4</italic> pre-S phase block are shown together with the prophase I data (<italic>ndt80Δ</italic>) in Figure 6 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1. The results show that in both wild type and <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> cells anchored loops (or any kind of contact) are absent at meiotic entry. Therefore, the boundaries observed in prophase are established de novo in meiosis during S phase/prophase and, at least in part, independently from DNA replication.</p><p>To further address the question of whether the boundaries in unreplicated cells are due to Eco1-dependent acetylation we also performed Hi-C in unreplicated prophase I cells lacking Eco1 function. For reasons that are unclear, we found that <italic>eco1-aa clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> cells are inviable, and so we performed Hi-C on prophase I-arrested <italic>eco1-aa cdc6-md</italic> cells along with <italic>cdc6-md, eco1-aa</italic> and wild type controls (Figure 7; Figure 7 —figure supplement 2). We also provide matched Smc3 ChIP-seq for these strains in prophase I (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). As in replicated cells (Figures 4 and 5), Eco1 is required for robust border/boundary formation in unreplicated (<italic>cdc6-md</italic>) cells.</p><p>Therefore we added three new major datasets: (i) wild type and <italic>clb5Δ clb6Δ</italic> Hi-C in meiotic G1; (ii) wild type, <italic>cdc6-md, eco1-aa</italic> and <italic>cdc6-md eco1-aa</italic> Hi-C in prophase I and (iii) wild type, <italic>cdc6-md, eco1-aa</italic> and <italic>cdc6-md eco1-aa</italic> ChIP-seq in prophase I. Together, these datasets show that (i) borders/boundaries are established de novo in meiosis during S phase/prophase; (ii) borders/boundaries and loops do not depend on DNA replication and (iii) Eco1 can drive loop formation and anchoring independently of DNA replication, presumably by acetylating loop extruding cohesin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Live-imaging of sister centromeres during meiosis I: The role of Eco1-dependent Smc3 acetylation in promoting mono-polar kinetochore formation is one of the key findings (Figure 6) since previous studies showed mono-polar orientation of sister kinetochores during meiosis I does not depend on Rec8-cohesin in budding yeast.

The authors can check the status of sister centromeres in late prophase I, metaphase I and anaphase I in the spo11 eco1-aa mutant by live-imaging of cells with CenV-GFP used in Figures 2 and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity in our description of the live cell imaging experiment and its conclusions. Our data show that the mono-orientation defect is likely a <italic>consequence</italic> of the centromeric cohesion defect. We therefore believe that cohesion at centromeres in prophase I is required for the establishment of monoorientation. This is an important conclusion as it differs from the previous conclusion (Monje-Casas et al., 2007) which suggested that the monopolin complex linked sister centromeres independently of cohesin. Monje-Casas based their conclusion on the finding that sister centromere GFP foci are not separated in <italic>spo11Δ rec8Δ</italic> prophase I cells, but they are in <italic>spo11Δ rec8Δ mam1Δ</italic> double mutants (Figure 7 in Monje-Casas et al., 2007).</p><p>We now present data showing the status of <italic>CEN5-</italic>GFP cohesion in prophase I cells from the live cell imaging experiment (Figure 8C). Only cells that progress to anaphase I were included in this analysis to ensure that any effects observed were not a result of prolonged prophase I arrest. Analysis of metaphase I cells is confounded by the fact that in <italic>spo11Δ</italic> background, spindles elongate directly after spindle pole body duplication as there are no linkages between homologs. We therefore restricted our analysis to prophase I (new Figure 8C) and anaphase I (as was already shown in our original submission). As shown in Figure 8C, the only mutants to show splitting of <italic>CEN5-GFP</italic> foci prior to SPB separation are <italic>spo11Δ eco1-aa</italic> and <italic>eco1-aa</italic> (though very few <italic>eco1-aa</italic> cells progressed beyond prophase I). The absence of centromeric cohesion in <italic>spo11Δ eco1-aa</italic> cells led to equational segregation of sister chromatids in meiosis I. Notably, these defects are all rescued by <italic>wpl1Δ.</italic> This, together with the data presented in Figure 2F leads to the conclusion that centromeric cohesion is required for the establishment of sister kinetochore monoorientation. We have revised the text describing this experiment to indicate the likely causal relationship between centromeric cohesion and sister kinetochore monoorientation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Discussion on functionality of Eco1-FRB-GFP: Since the FRB-GFP tag seems to affect the functionality of Eco1 protein in meiosis, it would be nice to carry out a complemental approach such as auxin-degron. However, there might be similar problem(s) for any tagging, even for N-terminal tagging. Thus, it is recommended that, by text rewriting, the authors describe more clearly about the limitation of the tag to know the Eco1 function in vivo and soften some conclusions in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not consider that lack of functionality of the FRB-GFP tag in meiosis a major issue as our intention is to ablate Eco1 function in meiosis. We have not performed any experiment that relies on the functionality of the tag (such as depleting Eco1 function for a specific window – we agree that such experiments are impossible with this allele). Rather, <italic>eco1-aa</italic> can be considered similar to a meiotic depletion allele such as <italic>pCLB2</italic> where genes are placed under control of a mitosis-specific promoter and which are widely used in the literature (original description (Lee and Amon, 2003)). The only slight concern would be if <italic>eco1-aa</italic> has dominant effects, even in the presence of rapamycin (note that all our experiments except the initial characterisation were carried out in the presence of rapamycin from the time that we induce meiosis). However, dominant effects seem very unlikely, as evidence indicates that <italic>eco1-aa</italic> is a loss of function allele. First, Smc3-Ac is greatly diminished in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> (Figure 1I), similar to <italic>eco1Δ wpl1Δ</italic> vegetative cells. Second, deletion of <italic>WPL1</italic> rescues the viability of <italic>eco1-aa</italic> cells, similar to what has been shown for <italic>eco1Δ</italic> (Figure 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 7H and a model: In this model, the authors suggest the model on a cohesin-mediated loop-extrusion and sister chromatid cohesion. As, in the paper, the authors showed two distinct cohesin-mediated structures on centromeres and chromosome arms (and pericentromeres). It would be helpful to readers if the authors provide models on how cohesin- and its acetylation-mediated chromatin structures on the two regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have now revised the model to include the centromere and pericentromere borders and included this as a separate Figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition of these major points, 3 reviewers gave comments shown below, some of which are redundant to the above points. It would be nice to respond (or rebut) them also.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Although the authors have not analyzed the defect of the eco1-aa mutant in meiotic recombination in detail, which would be for future studies, the authors need more detailed analysis of chromosome segregation at meiosis I and II by examining microtubule(spindle) dynamics to see the altered centromere and peri-centromeric regions affect the spindle dynamics to see a molecular role of the chromosomal regions in accurate segregation of chromosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to essential revisions #2 above. In particular, please note that due to the necessity to analyse chromosome segregation in <italic>spo11Δ</italic> background, where homologs are not linked, leading to premature extension of meiosis I spindles, it is unclear how informative examination of the spindle directly would be. We therefore chose to focus our analysis on <italic>CEN5-GFP</italic>, using the spindle pole bodies labels to stage the meiotic cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below are a number of thoughts, critiques, and suggestions that might help to make the manuscript more impactful. They are arranged according to their order in the manuscript.</p><p>Line 76: Here and elsewhere (until the Discussion) there is de-emphasis of the fact that it is already known that Eco1 in yeast can act outside of S-phase to acetylate Smc3 (albeit at lower levels). This was shown in G1 and in cdc6 mutants in the two publications listed. I think it would be easier to state up front that this is known to occur.</p></disp-quote><p>In the two publications referred to, the situation is not so clear-cut as suggested by the reviewer. In one study (Beckouët et al., 2010), the authors delayed replication (by delaying Dbf4 expression) which delayed Smc3 acetylation. In the other study (Ben-Shahar et al., 2008), Cdc6 is depleted but residual replication occurs, which could explain the small amount of Smc3 acetylation observed. The best evidence that Eco1 can function independently from DNA replication comes from studies by the Morgan and Nasmyth groups who showed that Eco1 activity after S phase can establish cohesin de novo (Beckouët et al., 2010; Lyons and Morgan, 2011). In addition, it is known that Eco1 can establish cohesin in G2 in response to DNA damage (Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009; Lyons et al., 2013). To take account of these observations, we modified the text referring to these experiments in the introduction.:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related – it might be worth mentioning that budding yeast Eco1 levels are down-regulated in vegetatively cells as they exit S-phase by (by CDK phosphorylation and degradation) – (Lyons and Morgan 2011)</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 111: &quot;In meiosis, Eco1 acetylates Smc3 independently of replication….&quot; This result could appreciated in context if the known (G1, cdc6, and DNA damage) examples of Eco1 acetylating Smc3 in replication-independent scenarios had been spelled out.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line111: Maybe should say &quot;both linked to and independently of DNA replication&quot;.

So does this result mean that there is a meiosis-specific function (or at least one that is more essential in meiosis than mitosis) that involves the carboxy-end of Eco1?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know the reason but we suspect that C-terminal tags on Eco1 reduce its stability, particularly in meiosis. We observed a similar meiosis-specific loss of function with Eco1-6HA (not shown), though Eco1-6His-3FLAG is functional, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A. This would clearly be a problem if our aim was to re-activate Eco1 at a particular time in meiosis but as our goal is merely to inactivate Eco1 in meiosis we do not consider the lack of functionality of <italic>eco1-aa</italic> a major problem. It could be compared to e.g. temperature-sensitive alleles which have used in numerous studies and which are rarely fully functional at the permissive temperature. The problem of inactivating proteins in meiosis is an important consideration. In general, and not specific for Eco1, our attempts to induce degradation using the auxin-inducible degron have not produced satisfactory results (and this would also require the addition of a tag to Eco1). Temperature-sensitive alleles suffer from the difficulty that meiosis is itself temperature-sensitive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 164: Do you mean – &quot;cells that were induced&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 165: Does &quot;eco1-aa&quot; stand for something?</p></disp-quote><p>“Anchor-away”, we added this in brackets to this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 169: Does it have to be &quot;later&quot; stages?

The only observation suggestive of cohesion defects in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic>cells are those made by Challa (2016) and ourselves (Figure 2F) where sister GFP labels are observed to separate in a prophase I arrest. An alternative explanation for this observation is that the longer chromatin loops in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells lead to extrusion of part of the large (~10kb) <italic>tetO</italic> array away from its sister sequence.

This point is addressed in essential revisions #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 371: The apparent disjunction of sisters in the spo1 eco1-aa cells would, if true, be an important observation, making budding yeast a little more like other organisms with respect to co-orientation of sisters. However, an alternate explanation is that in the eco1-aa the sisters simply become totally disconnected before metaphase I and separate independently: 50% to opposite poles (pretty close to 40%) and 50% to the same pole. If in eco1-aa prophases, 20% of sisters stayed connected and co-oriented and 80% lost track of each other and segregated randomly the cells would exhibit the observed result. This could be resolved with a video. If the sisters orient mid-spindle as a single unit (one GFP spot) in prometaphase then disjoin at anaphase I, the reported conclusions are justified. If sisters behave as two independent GFP foci in pro-metaphase then partition randomly a different interpretation (that cohesin holds sisters together in prophase) is required.</p></disp-quote><p>The data presented in Figure 6 of the original manuscript was all from videos. As argued in our response to essential revisions #2, we believe that our findings show that Eco1 is required for centromeric cohesion, which is in turn required for sister kinetochore monoorientation, in contrast to an earlier conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 406: &quot;Therefore…&quot;. I'm confused by this conclusion. The experiments show Eco1 is required at meiosis II for something that isn't just amounts of cohesin, Sgo1 or Spo13. And that &quot;thing&quot; is necessary for MII bi-orientation or cohesion – but it isn't clear what the thing is.</p></disp-quote><p>We toned down this conclusion. It now reads “Therefore, a failure in cohesin protection is unlikely to be the cause of meiosis II mis-segregation in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> cells. Since <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> rescues the loss of cohesin on pericentromeric borders in <italic>eco1-aa</italic> cells, but not the anchoring of loops, it is likely that Eco1 enables accurate meiosis II segregation by anchoring cohesin at chromatin boundaries to generate robust cohesion at pericentromere borders.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to post-replicative Eco1 activity in meiosis. Is it worth discussing the persistence if Eco1 in meiotic prophase reported here relative Eco1 regulation in mitotic cycles? Is persistence related to the behaviors of Eco1 in cells with DNA damage since meiotic prophase cells are full of DSBs? Maybe not – just a thought.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion on the timing of Eco1 inactivation due to our mislabelling of meiotic stages on the western blot. As pointed out by Reviewer 3, FACS profile from the timecourse in Figure 1A-C shows that replication was complete by timepoint 150min, not 120min as we indicated on top of the Western blots and described in the text. The data show that Eco1 degradation starts soon after the completion of DNA replication. We have adjusted Figure 1C and the text accordingly. Nonetheless, low levels of Eco1 reproducibly persist all throughout meiosis, opening up the possibility that Eco1 could acetylate Smc3, or other targets, after S phase. Although Eco1-dependent acetylation of Smc3 occurs in <italic>spo11Δ</italic> cells, and therefore in the absence of meiotic double strand breaks (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2), it is possible that Eco1 activity is boosted by DNA damage in meiosis similar to in mitosis. We agree that this is a very interesting avenue for future investigation, but as the manuscript already covers a lot of ground we decided to focus our discussion on the main findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors are encouraged to confirm some of the more distinctly unusual effects, such as the strong prophase arrest and the Wpl1-independent cohesin maintenance defect, using an independent eco1 allele, such as a ts allele or an auxin degron allele.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, it is challenging to work with ts alleles in meiotic cells as meiosis is itself temperature-sensitive. Furthermore, ts alleles are never fully functional at the permissive temperature so effects due to impaired function in the mitotic divisions preceding meiosis can also not be ruled out, so even if they were an option, it is unlikely that they would provide any advantage over <italic>eco1-aa</italic>. Despite attempts to make several aid degrons, we have not been successful with reliable depletion in meiosis. Furthermore, it is likely that aid tagging will have the same effect on Eco1 protein function, since we know that other tags on Eco1 are non-functional. We therefore believe that <italic>eco1-aa</italic> represents the best possible available tool to analyse Eco1 function in meiosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2D.
