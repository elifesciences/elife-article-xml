of the Americas, there was a dramatic population collapse of the Indigenous inhabitants caused in part by the introduction of new pathogens. Although there is much speculation on the etiology of the Colonial epidemics, direct evidence for the presence of specific viruses during the Colonial era is lacking. To uncover the diversity of viral pathogens during this period, we designed an enrichment assay targeting ancient DNA (aDNA) from viruses of clinical importance and applied it to DNA extracts from individuals found in a Colonial hospital and a Colonial chapel (16th–18th century) where records suggest that victims of epidemics were buried during important outbreaks in Mexico City. This allowed us to reconstruct three ancient human parvovirus B19 genomes and one ancient human hepatitis B virus genome from distinct individuals. The viral genomes are similar to African strains, consistent with the inferred morphological and genetic African ancestry of the hosts as well as with the isotopic analysis of the human remains, suggesting an origin on the African continent. This study provides direct molecular evidence of ancient viruses being transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade and their subsequent introduction to New Spain. Altogether, our observations enrich the discussion about the etiology of infectious diseases during the Colonial period in Mexico.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The arrival of European colonists to the Americas, beginning in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, contributed to the spread of new viruses amongst Indigenous people. This led to massive outbreaks of disease, and millions of deaths that caused an important Native population to collapse. The exact viruses that caused these outbreaks are unknown, but smallpox, measles, and mumps are all suspected.</p><p>During these times, traders and colonists forcibly enslaved and displaced millions of people mainly from the West Coast of Africa to the Americas. The cruel, unsanitary, and overcrowded conditions on ships transporting these people across the Atlantic contributed to the spread of infectious diseases onboard. Once on land, infectious diseases spread quickly, partly due to the poor conditions that enslaved and ndigenous people were made to endure. Native people were also immunologically naïve to the newly introduced pathogens, making them susceptible to severe or fatal outcomes. The new field of paleovirology may help scientists identify the viruses that were circulating in the first years of colonization and trace how viruses arrived in the Americas.</p><p>Using next-generation DNA sequencing and other cutting-edge techniques, Guzmán-Solís et al. extracted and enriched viral DNA from skeletal remains dating back to the 16<sup>th</sup> century. These remains were found in mass graves that were used to bury epidemic victims at a colonial hospital and chapel in what is now Mexico City. The experiments identified two viruses, human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus. These viral genomes were recovered from human remains of first-generation African people in Mexico, as well as an individual who was an Indigenous person.</p><p>Although the genetic material of these ancient viruses resembled pathogens that originated in Africa, the study did not determine if the victims died from these viruses or another cause. On the other hand, the results indicate that viruses frequently found in modern Africa were circulating in the Americas during the slave trade period of Mexico. Finally, the results provide evidence that colonists who forcibly brought African people to the Americas participated in the introduction of viruses to Mexico. This constant influx of viruses from the old world, led to dramatic declines in the populations of Indigenous people in the Americas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aDNA</kwd><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>paleovirology</kwd><kwd>B19V</kwd><kwd>HBV</kwd><kwd>paleogenomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Welcome Trust Sanger</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208934/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ávila Arcos</surname><given-names>María C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>PAPIIT-DGAPA-UNAM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA201219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ávila Arcos</surname><given-names>María C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0075/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ávila Arcos</surname><given-names>María C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The characterization of ancient B19V and HBV genotype A4 viruses circulating during Colonial epidemics provides new insights into the pathogens that were introduced to the Americas after the European colonization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>European colonization in the Americas resulted in a frequent genetic exchange mainly between Native American populations, Europeans, and Africans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aguirre-Beltrán, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Rotimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Salas et al., 2004</xref>).

The B19V ancient genome from the individual COYC4 is the first genotype 3 genome obtained from a non-African individual and suggests that following the introduction from Africa, the virus (B19V) spread and infected people of different ancestries during the Colonial period.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we reconstructed one HBV and three B19V ancient genomes from four different individuals using NGS, metagenomics, and in-solution targeted enrichment methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Several lines of evidence support the ancient nature of these viral sequences, in contrast to environmental contamination or a capture artifact. First, our negative control was not enriched for B19V or HBV hits in our capture sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). For those samples that showed an enrichment in viral sequences after capture, the reads covered the reference genomes almost in their entirety and displayed deamination patterns at the terminal ends of the reads, as expected for aDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Moreover, it is important to notice that B19V and HBV are blood-borne human pathogens that are not present in soil or the environment, and that DNA from these viruses had never been extracted before in the aDNA facilities used for this study.</p><p>The recovery of aDNA from B19V, which has a ssDNA genome (with dsDNA terminal repeats), in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mühlemann et al., 2018b</xref>) as well as in our samples is noteworthy considering the NGS libraries were constructed using dsDNA as a template. Therefore, we would not expect to recover the ssDNA from B19V with this library building method. However, it is known that dsDNA intermediates form during the B19V replication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ganaie and Qiu, 2018</xref>), and that throughout the viral infection the replicating genomes are present in both the ssDNA and dsDNA forms. The sequences we retrieved must therefore correspond to the cell-free dsDNA replication intermediates. This is coherent with the peculiar coverage pattern on the B19V genome, where the dsDNA hairpins at its terminal sites and are highly covered, reflecting a better stability of these regions over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Similarly, the partially circular dsDNA genome from HBV was poorly covered at the ssDNA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which also goes through a dsDNA phase during replication, a similar coverage is reported in three previous ancient HBV genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Krause-Kyora et al., 2018</xref>). Although HBV and B19V are also capable of integrating into the human host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yuen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Janovitz et al., 2017</xref>), the uneven read coverage observed for all reconstructed viruses (higher coverage in dsDNA regions) suggests that these sequences do not correspond to integration events. If the B19V or HBV reads we recovered derived from integrated sequences in the human genome, we would expect an even coverage along the reference viral genome, which is not the case. Further analyses would be needed to determine if the aDNA retrieved in this and other studies comes from systemic circulating virions or from systemic cell-free DNA intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>) produced after viral replication in the bone marrow or liver for B19V and HBV, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Broliden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yuen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The ancient B19V genomes were assigned to genotype 3.

Two other genotypes, 1 and 2, exist for this virus. Genotype 1 is the most common and is found worldwide, while the almost extinct genotype 2 is mainly found in elderly people from Northern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pyöriä et al., 2017</xref>). Ancient genomes from genotypes 1 and 2 have been recovered from Eurasian samples, including a genotype 2 B19V genome from a 10th-century Viking burial in Greenland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mühlemann et al., 2018b</xref>). <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr isotopes on individuals from this burial revealed that they were immigrants from Iceland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mühlemann et al., 2018b</xref>), suggesting an introduction of the genotype 2 to North America during Viking explorations of Greenland.</p><p>While serological evidence indicates that B19V currently circulates in Mexico, only the presence of genotype 1 has been formally described using molecular analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Valencia Pacheco et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, our results are consistent with an introduction of the genotype 3 to New Spain as a consequence of the transatlantic slave trade imposed by European colonization. This hypothesis is supported by the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr isotopic analysis, which suggests that the individuals from the HSJN with B19V (HSJN240, HSJNC81) were born in West Africa and spent their last years of life in New Spain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the radiocarbon analysis for individuals HSJN240 and HSJN194 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) support this notion as they correspond to the Early Colonial period, during which the number of enslaved Africans arriving was higher compared to later periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aguirre-Beltrán, 2005</xref>). Remarkably, a B19V genome belonging to the genotype 3 was recovered from an individual (COYC4) with 100% Indigenous ancestry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). COY4 was excavated in an independent archeological site 10 km south of the HSJN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), supporting the notion that viral transmissions between African individuals and Native Americans occurred during the Colonial period in Mexico City.</p><p>The HBV genotype A is highly diverse in Africa, reflecting its long evolutionary history, and likely originated somewhere between Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kostaki et al., 2018</xref>). The introduction of the genotype A from Africa to the Americas has been proposed based on phylogenetic analysis of modern strains from Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Freitas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kostaki et al., 2018</xref>) and Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Roman et al., 2010</xref>), and more precisely of the sub-genotype A1 using sequences from Martinique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brichler et al., 2013</xref>), Venezuela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Quintero et al., 2002</xref>), Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Andernach et al., 2009</xref>), and Colombia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alvarado-Mora et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, a similar introduction pattern was proposed for the quasi genotype A3 based on an ancient HBV genome recovered from an ancient African individual sampled in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barquera et al., 2020</xref>). The origin of the sub-genotype A4 is controversial since the apparent African origin is based on modern sequences recovered from African immigrants living in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pourkarim et al., 2010</xref>). The Colonial ancient HBV genome reconstructed in our work represents the first ancient A4 linked to the transatlantic slave trade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the only report of this sub-genotype in the Americas, further supporting its African origin. The introduction of pathogens from Africa to the Americas has been proposed for other human-infecting viruses such as smallpox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mandujano-Sánchez et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Somolinos d’Árdois, 1982</xref>), based on historical records; or yellow fever virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bryant et al., 2007</xref>), HTLMV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gadelha et al., 2014</xref>), hepatitis C virus (genotype 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Markov et al., 2009</xref>), and human herpes simplex virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Forni et al., 2020</xref>) based on phylogenetic analysis of modern strains from Afro-descendant or admixed human populations.</p><p>Although we cannot assert where exactly the African-born individuals in this study contracted B19V or HBV (Africa, America, or the Middle Passage) nor if the cause of their deaths can be attributed to such infections, the identification of ancient B19V and HBV in contexts associated with Colonial epidemics in Mexico City is still relevant in light of their paleopathological marks and the clinical information available for the closest sequences in the phylogenetic analyses. Notably, individual HSJNC81 displayed cribra orbitalia in the eye sockets and porotic hyperostosis on the cranial vault (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The reconstructed ancient B19V genome from this individual is closest to the V9 strain, which was isolated from an infant with severe anemia and G6PD deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nguyen et al., 1999</xref>; GenBank: AJ249437; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The HSJN skeletal collection has a notably higher rate of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis compared to other Colonial archeological sites, marks that were proposed to be caused by an unknown infectious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Castillo-Chavez, 2000</xref>). These skeletal indicators are caused by irregular hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and are typically associated with genetic anemias such as thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Angel, 1966</xref>), as well as to nutritional stress or parasitic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Walker et al., 2009</xref>). It is acknowledged that B19V infection can cause severe or even fatal anemia due to the low level of hemoglobin in individuals with other blood disorders, such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, malaria, or iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Broliden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heegaard and Brown, 2002</xref>). Therefore, since B19V infects precursors of the erythroid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Broliden et al., 2006</xref>), it is possible that the morphological changes found in HSJNC81 might be the result of a severe anemia caused or enhanced by a B19V infection. With our data we cannot discard the simultaneous presence of a genetic disease since the loci for thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and G6PD deficiency were not covered with our human-mapped NGS data. Nevertheless, the identification of ancient B19V in a Colonial context is noteworthy considering several recent reports reveal that measles-like cases were actually attributable to B19V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Los Ángeles Ribas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rezaei et al., 2016</xref>) or rubella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Davidkin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Los Ángeles Ribas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rezaei et al., 2016</xref>), which produce a similar kind of rash and fever. Therefore, it is possible that B19V might have been responsible for some of the numerous cases attributed to measles that were described in early 16th-century Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Acuña-Soto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mandujano-Sánchez et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wesp, 2017</xref>), in particular historical records that document the treatment of an outbreak of measles at the HSJN in 1531 CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Meza, 2013</xref>). Our study, however, does not reject the notorious role that measles played during the Colonial outbreaks (as it is strongly supported by historical records), but provides evidence of the presence of B19V during the Colonial period in Mexico City to facilitate discussions about the paradigmatic etiology of the supposed measles epidemics reported in historical records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvido and Viesca, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mandujano-Sánchez et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Somolinos d’Árdois, 1982</xref>). This hypothesis requires additional comprehensive studies aimed at characterizing the presence of measles and rubella viruses from ancient remains, a task that currently poses difficult technical challenges given that RNA is known to degrade rapidly. In fact, most ancient viral RNA genomes have been recovered only from formalin-fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Düx et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, historical records of the autopsies of the victims of the 1576 CE <italic>Cocoliztli</italic> epidemic treated at the HSJN describe the presence of enlarged hard liver and jaundice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acuña-Soto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Acuña-Soto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvido and Viesca, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marr and Kiracofe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Somolinos d’Árdois, 1982</xref>) as well as a black spleen and lungs and heart with yellow liquid and black blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuña-Soto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvido and Viesca, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Somolinos d’Árdois, 1982</xref>). This is noteworthy given that both HBV and B19V viruses proliferate in the liver and are associated with hepatitis and jaundice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Broliden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yuen et al., 2018</xref>). The radiocarbon dating of individuals HSJN194 (HBV) and HSJN240 (B19V) suggests that these individuals died between 1472–1625 CE and 1442–1608 CE (years calibrated for 1σ), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), which overlaps with the period of time when the hepatitis symptoms were reported in the autopsies after the 1576 <italic>Cocoliztli</italic> epidemic at the HSJN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Acuña-Soto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marr and Kiracofe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Somolinos d’Árdois, 1982</xref>). However, additional analyses are needed before being able to establish a link between these viruses and the wide array of symptoms described for <italic>Cocoliztli</italic>. Currently, technological limitations prevent the direct identification of ancient RNA viruses in bone or dental remains. However, future studies, with larger sample sizes from different contexts associated with the outbreak, should explore a wider range of pathogens previously suggested as potential causative agents, like arthropod-borne pathogens (malaria, yellow fever virus, and dengue virus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marr and Kiracofe, 2000</xref>) or hemorrhagic fever RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Acuña-Soto et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that both viruses have also been previously identified in aDNA datasets not necessarily associated with disease or epidemic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kahila Bar-Gal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Krause-Kyora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mühlemann et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Patterson Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, our data is not sufficient to elucidate the age when the individuals acquired the viruses or if it is related to their cause of death.</p><p>In the case of HSJN194, we cannot establish if he acquired HBV vertically or horizontally, nor if this individual presented an acute or chronic infection. Finally, although our data does not allow us to associate these viruses to a specific epidemic outbreak, the identification of HBV and B19V in Post-Contact remains opens up new opportunities for investigating their presence in similar contexts and expand our knowledge on their evolution and potential link to disease in Colonial Mexico. This type of research is particularly relevant when considering previous hypotheses favoring the synergistic action of different types of pathogens in these devastating Colonial epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Somolinos d’Árdois, 1982</xref>).</p><p>It is important to emphasize that our findings should be interpreted with careful consideration of the historical and social context of the transatlantic slave trade. This cruel episode in history involved the forced displacement of millions of individuals to the Americas (ca. 250,000 to New Spain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aguirre-Beltrán, 2005</xref>) under inhumane, unsanitary, and overcrowded conditions that, with no doubt, favored the spread of infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mandujano-Sánchez et al., 1982</xref>). Therefore, the introduction of these and other pathogens from Africa to the Americas should be attributed to the brutal and harsh conditions of the Middle passage that enslaved Africans were subjected to by traders and colonizers, and not to the African peoples themselves. Moreover, the adverse life conditions for enslaved Africans and Native Americans, especially during the first decades after colonization, surely favored the spread of diseases and emergence of epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mandujano-Sánchez et al., 1982</xref>). Integrative and multidisciplinary approaches are thus needed to understand this phenomenon in full.</p><p>In summary, our study provides direct aDNA evidence of HBV and B19V introduced to the Americas from Africa during the transatlantic slave trade. The isolation and characterization of these ancient HBV and B19V genomes represent an important contribution to the ancient viral genomes reported in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barquera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Duggan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Schrick et al., 2017</xref>). Our results expand our knowledge on the viral agents that were in circulation during Colonial epidemics like <italic>Cocoliztli</italic>, some of which resulted in the catastrophic collapse of the immunologically naïve Indigenous population. Although we cannot assign a direct causality link between HBV and B19V and <italic>Cocoliztli</italic>, our findings confirm that these potentially harmful viruses were indeed circulating in individuals found in archeological contexts associated with this epidemic outbreak. Further analyses from different sites and samples will help understand the possible role of these and other pathogens in Colonial epidemics, as well as the full spectrum of pathogens that were introduced to the Americas during European colonization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample selection and DNA extraction</title><p>Dental samples (premolars and molars) were obtained from 21 individuals from the skeletal collection associated with the HSJN and were selected based on morphological features indicating a possible African origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hernández-Lopez and Negrete, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Karam-Tapia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Meza, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ruíz-Albarrán, 2012</xref>).

Twenty-five whole genomes from different viruses were included in our customized capture design, as well as a selection of genes from <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> and <italic>Poxviridae</italic> (VARV). Raw or consensus sequences were used as described in Materials and methods. (B). Enrichment yield of HBV-like or B19V-like hits. The metagenomic analysis was carried out with MALT 0.4.0 based on the NCBI RefSeq Viral database, hits were normalized automatically between capture assay(s) and shotgun assay(s) per sample in MEGAN 6.8.0. HSJN177 was considered a negative control for capture based on the shotgun metagenomic analysis. Fold enrichment was calculated as (normalized target capture hits/normalized target shotgun hits). *Two independent NGS libraries were constructed (and then captured) from two different tooth samples belonging to the same individual. NA: not available. (C) . Mapping statistics for ancient viral genome reconstruction. Viral enriched NGS libraries were sequenced and mapped to the human genome (hg19); unmapped reads are shown as total sequences. Number of reads kept in subsequent steps of B19V (COYC4, HSJNC81, HSJN240) and HBV (HSJN194) genome reconstruction are shown as well (Materials and methods). *A second independent round of capture was sequenced deeper in order to obtain a better coverage of the targeted viral ancient genome. **A different tooth was used to construct an independent library for the same individual. <sup>#</sup>Coverage and depth calculated based on the B19V CDS (AB550331) or whole HBV genome (GQ331046).

With appropriate research ethics in place, the authors demonstrate that respectful destructive analyses of ancient DNA from teeth collected from individuals dated to Colonial period Mexico can uncover the source and impact of infectious diseases introduced to the Americas with European colonization.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ancient viral genomes reveal introduction of HBV and B19V into Mexico during the transatlantic slave trade&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: C. Eduardo Amorim (Reviewer #1); Charlotte J Houldcroft (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers individually and collectively offered praise of your study and its potential for <italic>eLife</italic>. I agree with their assessment. Some excellent reviewer discussions are appended below for your consideration as you revise. There are several points on which expanded detail is required, and other suggestions concerning the balance between the results and discussion. In our consultation session we focused primarily on developing consensus around how to address the question that was consistently raised by the reviewers – what about the bacterial pathogen data? Ultimately, our consensus is that (i) we encourage you to expand on these results as much as possible in the present study. However, (ii) if you prefer to not present the full bacterial results in this study (perhaps due to a forthcoming study with that focus), then at the very least you still need to present an overview of the metagenomic content of the shotgun libraries and address this directly. In addition, considerably further detail into mapping results across all stages of the analysis needs to be provided in order for the reviewers (and future readers) to more fully assess the strength of your results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In my opinion, the major strength of this work is its novelty regarding its questions, results, and ethical imperative of preventing misinterpretation of the results and the stigmatization of the studied subjects/communities. The latter aspect, although only briefly highlighted in the manuscript, is of utmost importance for human population genetics studies in general and for ancient DNA studies in particular, since these studies are reaching the general public beyond academia and research results are often misinterpreted and misused.</p><p>Although it is widely known that colonial epidemics had a strong impact on Indigenous populations from the Americas, there is still much speculation on the etiology of these epidemics and direct molecular evidence for the presence of specific viruses is lacking. In this context, Guzmán-Solís et al.'s work pioneer into addressing these questions using state-of-the-art methods and techniques in the genomic sciences. Their results represent the initial steps into characterizing ancient viruses and their spread into the continent during the Colonial era. This manuscript offers a concrete example of how human migrations shaped pathogen dispersal, challenges views about the etiology of colonial epidemics, and adds new evidence for the presence of African viral strains in the Americas. In addition, the phylogenetic contextualization of these ancient viruses sheds new light on the genetic diversity of HBV and B19V in different time transects and the history of the spread of their associated diseases around the world. Authors' claims and conclusions are fully justified by their data and the study is technically sound. I envision Guzmán-Solís et al.'s findings being of interest for scholars from diverse fields which include, human genetics, virology, epidemiology, history of medicine, archaeogenetic, phylogenetics, anthropology, among others.</p><p>It is my belief the inclusion of more detailed methods description and explicit research questions would potentially improve this manuscript. For instance, details about how the hits in the metagenomics analysis were normalized are still lacking. In that regard, I am confused with the claim that the &quot;viral abundances were normalized based on the smallest sample size&quot; (line 534). What does &quot;sample size&quot; refer to? Are these sample sizes from the study (N=3 for HSJN; N=1 for COY)? Would that be instead the number of hits? In addition, aspects such as the viral temporal dynamics could be further discussed and the rationale behind this analysis could be more explicit. The manuscript currently does not fully address what it means for the temporal structure to be detected (or not) in their datasets. In addition, I do not see why the root-to-tip distances should depend on sampling times and what is the contribution of this analysis to the understanding of the general questions raised in the paper. It is my belief that other analyses such as population clustering/structure inference would be more appropriate to infer temporal structure. This is not a criticism about the methods employed, but a suggestion for explicitly explaining the rationale behind these analyses and for further discussing the corresponding results. In my detailed review, authors can find additional questions about how double-stranded libraries are expected to perform in the sequencing of single-stranded DNA viruses, as well as whether the overrepresentation of Africans in the human population structure analysis could be biasing their results - however, I believe these potential issues do not invalidate the authors' conclusions in any way. Finally, I miss mapping statistics and contamination estimates for the human ancient genomes.</p><p>1. Line 140: regarding the sentence &quot;…contained at least one normalized hit to viral DNA…&quot;, could you please specify in the text how this normalization is done (e.g., normalized based on what) and/or what is the purpose of this normalization? This relates to the Methods section, lines 534-536. This part, I believe, would benefit from being more detailed. For instance, I am confused with the claim that the &quot;viral abundances were normalized based on the smallest sample size&quot; (line 534). What does &quot;sample size&quot; refer to? Are these sample sizes from your study (N=3 for HSJN; N=1 for COY)? Would it be instead the number of hits of the sample with the least hits? In addition, how does the number of hits (line 140) translate to viral abundances (line 534)?</p><p>2. Line 167: Why only HBV and B19V, if you searched for other viruses as well? Were there cases in which the top hit was not HBV or B19V? If so, why removing these? If there weren't any other cases, then the sentence (line 167) is, in my opinion, somewhat misleading in that it seems a choice was made to focus on HBV and B19V.</p><p>3. &quot;DNA extraction and NGS library construction&quot; section: I wonder how your choice for dsDNA libraries could be affecting the detection of B19V, whose genetic material is mostly ssDNA. The cited reference (Meyer and Kircher, 2010) explicitly says that their method allows for preparing libraries from any type of dsDNA and, to my knowledge, they do not mention if their method is adequate for ssDNA. Apparently, this has not been an issue for your experiment, since you were able to detect B19V DNA. Could you explain why?</p><p>4. I really appreciate the effort put into designing a capture assay for clinically relevant viruses in human remains and the level of detailing about it in the manuscript. This is a very relevant tool for the community, and I would personally be thrilled to use it to study ancient pathogens in my own research.</p><p>5. Virus temporal dynamics/structure (lines 205-223 and Suppl Figure 6): I suggest explaining in the main text what authors mean with &quot;temporal dynamics&quot; or &quot;temporal structure.&quot; My understanding is that the root-to-tip distance in phylogenetic trees reflects the number of substitutions in a lineage. Why would this be related to sampling times? I believe you would expect a strong dependency between root-to-tip distances and sampling times if, within each lineage, substitution rates accrued with time and did not depend on other factors. However, at least across mammal lineages, we know that this is not the case because life-history traits, mutation rate modifiers, and effective population sizes are thought to drive variation in the root-to-tip distances across lineages. I wonder if this also applies to viruses. On a related note, even considering this relationship between root-to-tip distances and sampling time to be perfect, I am not sure how it informs about temporal dynamics or temporal structure. Unless this is something well established in the field, I would suggest explaining the rationale behind this analysis. My understanding is that other types of analysis would better characterize the temporal structure. For instance, wouldn't an ADMIXTURE or STRUCTURE analysis be a better choice to characterize temporal structure? Or alternatively, using phylogenetic trees, wouldn't it be better to use the pattern of lineage clustering as an indication for temporal structure (i.e., when lineages from the same time transect cluster together)? Additionally, I strongly suggest the authors further discuss their results in their manuscript. For instance, what does it mean that the HBV does not have a temporal structure while B19V has one? What does it mean that genotype A has a stronger temporal signal than all HBV genotypes together? What does this analysis say about the HBV and B19V lineages found in these human remains in relation to others from the Americas and Africa?</p><p>6. I appreciate the paragraph starting at the end of page 15 that explains the introduction of these pathogens is a consequence of the slave trade and not the African peoples themselves. All aDNA studies would benefit from this type of observation that prevents both the misinterpretation of the research results and the stigmatization of the human subjects/communities involved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Guzman-Solis and colleagues present a study of the host genetic origins, and selected viral pathogens, of a group of individuals buried in two cemeteries soon after the arrival of European colonisers in Mexico. The paper provides an important insight into the health of people who are often little thought of in conversations about disease brought by European colonisers to the Americas: enslaved and forcibly transported Africans and their descendants. They identify three individuals with parvovirus B19 infections and one person infected with hepatitis B virus. These viruses have been notoriously difficult to accurately date using molecular clock analysis of modern, circulating strains, and thus direct ancient DNA evidence is a very important way of identifying these viral pathogens (which do not leave obvious palaeopathological traces) and dating important events in their evolution and spread.</p><p>This paper also presents an example of how to ask questions about infectious disease in the past, and shows the difficulty of trying to identify historical or ancient pathogens even where palaeopathological and written records exist. The authors include much discussion of cocoliztli (what is in the historical record, what theories have been proposed) but this paper is not really an answer to which pathogen(s) caused cocoliztli or whether the individuals studied died of cocoliztli. Ancient DNA studies of infectious diseases are always affected by our current limitations of studying only pathogens with a DNA genome (or a partial DNA stage of their life cycle). Whereas many hypotheses about cocoliztli suggest it was caused by an RNA virus, which would not preserve well in human remains over hundreds of years. The work of the authors points to a view that Europeans - and forcibly transported Africans - brought a package of diseases with them to the Americas. If cocoliztli is in fact a polymicrobial infection or a name for a series of independent epidemics, this will shape how ancient DNA studies of this period of time are conducted in future.</p><p>This work selected for individuals who were thought to be of African ancestry (by birth or recent genetic relationships) at one of the sites studied. Therefore it is not surprising that the authors find hepatitis B virus and parvovirus B19 strains which are today associated with African individuals, including in the admixed individual. While it is possible that the forced migration of African individuals to the Americas introduced these viruses to a naïve population, it is also possible that there were (and perhaps still are) local genotypes which have yet to be detected. Patchy modern sampling of these viruses in the Americas today makes the authors' jobs harder. With such a small sample size, partially biased by design towards Africans, this study can't shed much light on whether HBV and B19V were already in the Americas before the arrival of European colonisers or not.</p><p>I think this should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. It's an important contribution to the growing field of ancient viral DNA, and focuses on an exciting period of time and of the world that has been somewhat neglected. I thought the paper had an excellent methods section in particular, very detailed.</p><p>The authors don't mention whether bacterial pathogens were also found – I respect that the authors may want to publish such findings elsewhere (if applicable) but I would like the authors to be honest about this – especially as paratyphi has been found associated with remains from C16 Mexico. This is also important to discuss as the authors hint at polymicrobial causes cocoliztli (either within the same host, or circulating at the same time as co/multi-epidemics).</p><p>I think the title needs to be slightly changed, as at present it seems to suggest that enslaved Africans brought HBV and B19V to the Americas, which isn't the conclusion of the paper. I thought the discussion of cocoliztli needed focusing, because this paper and its methods aren't really able to answer that question (ie no RNA viruses were considered and there is no mention of malarial parasite DNA or bacteria). However this paper can and very neatly does contribute new knowledge on the milieu of viruses present at the time.</p><p>A comment for future experimental design not something to be changed for this study: I thought the design of the viral enrichment panel was sub-optimal. It is missing the rash-causing virus varicella-zoster (chicken pox and shingles) which is highly infectious, associated with more severe disease if primary infection occurs in adulthood, and also thought to be one of the package of diseases carried to the New World by Europeans; KSHV was missing, which would have been common among enslaved Africans and their direct descendants, and can cause endemic disease even in relatively healthy people; adenoviruses would have been another sensible choice given they persist for weeks or months in the host and are spread by respiratory infection. Whereas the choice of cycloviruses perplexed me. I also thought the choice of targets in eg CMV was a bit odd. UL54 (DNA pol) is highly conserved which is good for detection, but wouldn't give you much geographic/phylogenetic signature, and I have only seen functionally significant UL54 mutations after extensive drug treatment. I respect that the composition of the viral enrichment panel will reflect the local interests and experience of the team(s) involved, but if the authors do redesign the panel in future, they should think more broadly among the human DNA viruses and about the sub-genomic regions chosen.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Guzmán-Solís, Blanco-Melo, and colleagues present a study of ancient viruses recovered from remains dating to the Colonial period in Mexico. Dental samples from 26 individuals in two different sites with burial contexts suggesting epidemic disease were processed for the recovery of ancient DNA. Following preliminary shotgun results, 12 samples were enriched with a custom bait set designed to capture molecules originating from clinically important viral taxa to examine questions of infectious disease introductions by colonial powers. From these 12 samples, the authors recovered sufficient molecules to reconstruct the genomes of three human parvovirus B19 viruses and one hepatitis B virus.</p><p>The weaknesses of this paper are those common to all ancient DNA papers, namely the small sample size, low average coverage, genomes that cannot be fully reconstructed, and the lack of metadata to contextualize epidemiological factors such as acute or chronic infections and cause of death. However, the achievements of this paper far outweigh the weaknesses of the field in general and advance our scientific understanding of colonial impacts on the health and well-being of the Indigenous people of Mexico as well as people of African origin in Mexico during the colonial period. The identification of B19V and HBV within this timeframe does not negate or erase previous scholarship studying the description of colonial epidemics but rather augments those narratives.</p><p>All three B19V genomes and the reconstructed HBV genome fall within diversity associated with the African continent suggesting African origins for these infections. African ancestry of the individuals themselves was confirmed via mtDNA for three of the individuals, as well as autosomal data compared to the 1000 Genomes reference panel, and further supported by isotopic analysis of tooth enamel. The fourth individual carried an mtDNA haplogroup associated with Native American populations and autosomal PCA analysis suggested admixed ancestry of Native American and African origin which demonstrates that viruses were transmitted between individuals of different ancestries during this colonial period.</p><p>Though the sample size is small, this study demonstrates the effects of European colonization in Mexico through the introduction of humans, both European and enslaved Africans, and pathogenic species carried with these individuals. The interpretation of the data is both biologically sound and conscientiously contextualized for those who had no agency.</p><p>This paper was a pleasure to read.

For instance, I am confused with the claim that the &quot;viral abundances were normalized based on the smallest sample size&quot; (line 534). What does &quot;sample size&quot; refer to? Are these sample sizes from your study (N=3 for HSJN; N=1 for COY)? Would it be instead the number of hits of the sample with the least hits?

The cited reference (Meyer and Kircher, 2010) explicitly says that their method allows for preparing libraries from any type of dsDNA and, to my knowledge, they do not mention if their method is adequate for ssDNA. Apparently, this has not been an issue for your experiment, since you were able to detect B19V DNA. Could you explain why?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concerns as it makes us realize that we weren’t clear in our attempt to discuss this in the first version of the manuscript.

Therefore, we would not expect to recover the ssDNA from B19V with this library building method. However, it is known that dsDNA intermediates form during the B19V replication cycle (Ganaie and Qiu, 2018), and that throughout the viral infection the replicating genomes are present in both the ssDNA and dsDNA forms. The sequences we retrieved must therefore correspond to the cell-free dsDNA replication intermediates. This is coherent with the peculiar coverage pattern on the B19V genome, where the dsDNA hairpins at its terminal sites and are highly covered, reflecting a better stability of these regions over time (Figure 2b). Similarly, the partially circular dsDNA genome from HBV was poorly covered at the ssDNA region (Figure 2c), which also goes through a dsDNA phase during replication, a similar coverage is reported in three previous ancient HBV genomes (Krause-Kyora et al., 2018)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Virus temporal dynamics/structure (lines 205-223 and Suppl Figure 6): I suggest explaining in the main text what authors mean with &quot;temporal dynamics&quot; or &quot;temporal structure.&quot; My understanding is that the root-to-tip distance in phylogenetic trees reflects the number of substitutions in a lineage. Why would this be related to sampling times? I believe you would expect a strong dependency between root-to-tip distances and sampling times if, within each lineage, substitution rates accrued with time and did not depend on other factors. However, at least across mammal lineages, we know that this is not the case because life-history traits, mutation rate modifiers, and effective population sizes are thought to drive variation in the root-to-tip distances across lineages. I wonder if this also applies to viruses. On a related note, even considering this relationship between root-to-tip distances and sampling time to be perfect, I am not sure how it informs about temporal dynamics or temporal structure. Unless this is something well established in the field, I would suggest explaining the rationale behind this analysis. My understanding is that other types of analysis would better characterize the temporal structure. For instance, wouldn't an ADMIXTURE or STRUCTURE analysis be a better choice to characterize temporal structure? Or alternatively, using phylogenetic trees, wouldn't it be better to use the pattern of lineage clustering as an indication for temporal structure (i.e., when lineages from the same time transect cluster together)? Additionally, I strongly suggest the authors further discuss their results in their manuscript. For instance, what does it mean that the HBV does not have a temporal structure while B19V has one? What does it mean that genotype A has a stronger temporal signal than all HBV genotypes together? What does this analysis say about the HBV and B19V lineages found in these human remains in relation to others from the Americas and Africa?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestions.

In the context of viruses, temporal structure is canonically tested with a root-to-tip distance anxd date-randomization analyses (see Firth et al., 2010; Rieux and Balloux, 2016).”</p><p>We do not believe ADMIXTURE or STRUCTURE approaches assess in a quantitative way (as we do with the used tests) the presence or absence of temporal structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
