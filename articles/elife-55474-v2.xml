mammalian sperm continue to mature in a long epithelial tube known as the epididymis, which plays key roles in remodeling sperm protein, lipid, and RNA composition. To understand the roles for the epididymis in reproductive biology, we generated a single-cell atlas of the murine epididymis and vas deferens. We recovered key epithelial cell types including principal cells, clear cells, and basal cells, along with associated support cells that include fibroblasts, smooth muscle, macrophages and other immune cells. Moreover, our data illuminate extensive regional specialization of principal cell populations across the length of the epididymis. In addition to region-specific specialization of principal cells, we find evidence for functionally specialized subpopulations of stromal cells, and, most notably, two distinct populations of clear cells. Our dataset extends on existing knowledge of epididymal biology, and provides a wealth of information on potential regulatory and signaling factors that bear future investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>sperm maturation</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD080224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaldi</surname><given-names>Vera D</given-names></name><name><surname>Donnard</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Gellatly</surname><given-names>Kyle</given-names></name><name><surname>Rasmussen</surname><given-names>Morten</given-names></name><name><surname>Kucukural</surname><given-names>Alper</given-names></name><name><surname>Yukselen</surname><given-names>Onur</given-names></name><name><surname>Garber</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Rando</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2AG066622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Upasna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaldi</surname><given-names>Vera D</given-names></name><name><surname>Rando</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systematic survey of the epididymis identifies the cell types involved in post-testicular maturation of sperm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, the production of sperm that are competent to fertilize the egg requires multiple organs that together constitute the male reproductive tract. A common characteristic of these tissues is the presence of specialized somatic cells that support the development and maturation of gametes. For instance, spermatogenesis requires multiple functionally distinct cells in the testis that support the development and function of sperm, most notably including Sertoli cells, which envelop and provide support to developing sperm, and Leydig cells, which are located in the testicular interstitial space and are responsible for testosterone biosynthesis.</p><p>Following completion of testicular spermatogenesis, sperm are morphologically mature, but do not yet exhibit forward motility and are incapable of fertilization. After sperm exit the testis, they enter a long convoluted tube known as the epididymis, where they continue to mature over the course of approximately 10 days in the mouse. During this journey, sperm are concentrated as they proceed from caput (proximal) to corpus and then to the cauda (distal) epididymis, where they can be stored for prolonged periods in an inactive state thanks to the ionic microenvironment of the lumen. Epididymal transit has long been understood to be essential for male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bedford, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hinton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Orgebin-Crist, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Young, 1931</xref>), and sperm undergo extensive molecular and physiological changes during this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cooper, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cornwall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gervasi and Visconti, 2017</xref>). Most notably, sperm proteins – including, but not limited to, protamines – become extensively disulfide-crosslinked during epididymal maturation, and this is thought to mechanically stabilize various sperm structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balhorn, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Calvin and Bedford, 1971</xref>). At the sperm surface, lipid remodeling events include cholesterol removal and an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids which results in increased membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Saez et al., 2011</xref>), while maturation of the glycocalyx involves extensive remodeling of accessible sugar moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tecle and Gagneux, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tulsiani, 2006</xref>). In addition, a heterogeneous population of extracellular vesicles collectively known as epididymosomes deliver proteins and small RNAs – some of which may play functional roles in fertilization and early development – to maturing sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caballero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Conine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Krapf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Martin-DeLeon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reilly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sullivan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sullivan and Saez, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The organ responsible for this ever-expanding diversity of functions is a long tube – on the order of one to ten meters long when extended, depending on the species – of pseudostratified epithelium. The functions of the epididymis differ extensively along its length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domeniconi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Turner et al., 2003</xref>), as for example genes such as <italic>Rnase10</italic> and <italic>Lcn8</italic> are expressed almost exclusively in the proximal epididymis, most notably in the testis-adjacent section known as the ‘initial segment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hsia and Cornwall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jelinsky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jervis and Robaire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Turner et al., 2003</xref>). Connective tissue septa separate the mouse epididymis into 10 anatomically defined segments (this number varies in other mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Turner et al., 2003</xref>), with early microarray studies revealing a variety of gene expression profiles across these segments, and defining roughly six distinct gene expression domains across the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>). Dramatic gradients of gene expression along the epididymis are also observed in many other mammals, including rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jelinsky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jervis and Robaire, 2001</xref>), boar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Guyonnet et al., 2009</xref>), and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Browne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dubé et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Legare and Sullivan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Thimon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to the variation in gene regulation along the epididymis, the epididymal epithelium at any point along the path is comprised of multiple morphologically- and functionally distinct cell types, including principal cells, basal cells, and clear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Breton et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we sought to further explore the cellular makeup and gene expression patterns across this relatively understudied organ. In recent years, microfluidic-based cell isolation and molecular barcoding strategies, coupled with continually improving genome-wide deep sequencing methods, have enabled ultra-high-throughput analysis of gene expression in thousands of individual cells from a wide range of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ramsköld et al., 2012</xref>). Using droplet-based (10X Chromium) single-cell RNA-Seq, we profiled gene expression in 8880 individual cells from across the epididymis and the vas deferens. Our data confirm and extend prior studies of segment-restricted gene expression programs, and reveal that these regional programs are largely driven by principal cells. We find evidence suggesting the possibility of several novel cell subpopulations, most notably including an Amylin-positive clear cell subtype, and we predict intercellular signaling networks between different cell types. Together, these data provide an atlas of cell composition across the epididymis and vas deferens, and provide a wealth of molecular hypotheses for future efforts in reproductive physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dataset generation and overview</title><p>We set out to characterize the regulatory program across the post-testicular male reproductive tract, focusing on four coarsely defined anatomical regions – the caput, corpus, and cauda epididymis, as well as the vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Each population represented a pool of eight tissue samples obtained from four male mice sacrificed at 10–12 weeks of age. We note that dissection margins were varied slightly between individual samples to ensure complete recovery of any cell types present at the dissection borders.</p><p>Following scRNA-Seq, quality control, and removal of reads attributable to contaminating cell-free RNA (Materials and methods), we obtained a final dataset with 8880 individual cells with an average of 3110 (median = 1965) unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. We detected cells with similar transcriptional profiles through dimensionality reduction and clustering (Materials and methods), and the resulting map was visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), with cells from each sample labeled in different colors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Consistent with the dramatic segment-specific gene expression programs known to distinguish the different regions of the epididymis, we find that roughly half of the clusters are composed entirely of cells from one tissue sample – the caput, corpus, cauda, or vas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Region-specific clusters included all principal cell clusters (discussed below), as well as muscle cells and a subset of stromal cells, both of which were enriched in the vas deferens samples. The remaining cell clusters included cells from multiple dissections and thus represent cell types present throughout the epididymis.</p><p>We assigned the 21 cell clusters to known cell types by the expression profiles of marker genes detected through differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This identified several populations of principal cells and basal cells, one of clear cells, and multiple groups of support cells including fibroblasts, endothelium, muscle, and immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Characteristic genes enriched in each cluster are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, where we highlight both known and novel marker genes for various epididymal cell types. To expand on gene enrichment in cell clusters and to visualize gene expression across all cells in our dataset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows expression levels of several well-known marker genes, as well as a handful of genes of interest for downstream analyses, across all individual cells. Overall, we find that epididymal cells are distinguished primarily by two broad molecular features. First, functionally and histologically distinct cell types such as clear cells, basal cells, and so on are characterized by known marker genes, as for example genes encoding vacuolar ATPase subunits (<italic>Atp6v1a</italic>, <italic>Atp6v0c</italic>, etc.) are highly expressed in clear cells which are responsible for luminal acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 1992</xref>). Second, even for a relatively histologically uniform cell type, the principal cells, a large number of genes distinguish cells originating in different regions along the epididymal tube. This suggests that principal cells are specialized within their niches, maintaining a complex succession of luminal microenvironments across the epididymis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-cell decomposition of the epididymis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-cell cluster (expanded from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with 21 clusters annotated according to predicted cell types.

The second round of clustering was again dominated by the anatomical origin of principal cells, separating cells from the caput, corpus, cauda, and vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, at this resolution, cells from each anatomic region could be further subdivided into three to four subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), largely reflecting further subspecialization of cells in the various compartmentalized epididymal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>). For instance, cells corresponding to the mouse initial segment were readily identified as a subset of principal cells from the caput dissection based on their expression of genes (<italic>RNase10</italic>, <italic>Cst11</italic>, <italic>Lcn2</italic>, <italic>Mfge8</italic>, and others) previously associated with segment 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>), and were distinguished from other cells from more distal segments of the caput epididymis (<italic>Lcn2</italic> and <italic>Defb15</italic> for segments 3–4, etc.). Similarly, corpus and cauda principal cell subclusters reflected anatomical segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>), separating corpus cells into segments 5–6 and 7 (<italic>Lcn5</italic>/<italic>Rnase9</italic>/<italic>Plac8</italic> vs <italic>Npy</italic>, respectively), and cauda cells into segments 8–9 and 10 (<italic>Gpx3</italic>/<italic>Klk1b27</italic>/<italic>Hint1</italic>/<italic>Gstm2</italic> vs <italic>Ptgds</italic>/<italic>Spink10</italic>/<italic>Crisp1</italic>).

Overall, our subclustering is concordant with prior functional and molecular studies of epididymal segmentation, and supports the notion that the anatomical segmentation of the epididymis generates multiple distinct microenvironments that sperm experience during post-testicular maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domeniconi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As is clear from many prior studies of epididymal gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Guyonnet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hales et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jelinsky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jervis and Robaire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Papp et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ribeiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Thimon et al., 2007</xref>), the genes that define principal cells from any given segment tend to be members of multi-gene families encoded in genomic clusters of many paralogous genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These clusters include gene families encoding serine protease inhibitors, antimicrobial defensin peptides, cysteine-rich peptides involved in glycocalyx maturation, small molecule-binding lipocalins, aldo-keto reductases, and RNaseA family members. The encoded proteins play roles throughout the male reproductive tract, both locally in the epididymal lumen as well as in downstream regions of the male reproductive tract, or even in the female reproductive tract (see Discussion). Curiously, a number of these region-specific proteins, including various metabolic enzymes, small-molecule-binding proteins, and defensins, also end up decorating the sperm surface.</p><p>As our data largely confirm the extensive prior literature on segmental gene regulation across the epididymis, we focused next on gene expression in the vas deferens, which has been the subject of relatively few genome-wide studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Snyder et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast to the principal cells of the epididymis, few of the marker genes for the vas deferens are encoded in large multi-gene families, with two major exceptions being members of gene families encoding serine protease inhibitors (<italic>Akr1b7</italic>, <italic>Akr1c1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jagoe et al., 2013</xref>) and crystallin proteins (<italic>Crygb</italic>, <italic>Crygc</italic>). Instead, genes enriched in the vas deferens included various transmembrane transporters (<italic>Abcg2</italic>, <italic>Fxyd4</italic>, <italic>Aqp2</italic>, etc.) and signaling molecules (<italic>Plac8</italic>, <italic>Ptgr1</italic>, <italic>Ptges</italic>, <italic>Ptgs2</italic>, <italic>Prlr</italic>, <italic>Cited1</italic>, <italic>Pcbd1</italic>, <italic>Comt</italic>, <italic>Slco2a1</italic>, etc.). Vas deferens clusters were also enriched for expression of nuclear-encoded genes involved in mitochondrial energy production (<italic>Atp5g1</italic>, <italic>Uqcr10</italic>, <italic>Ndufa3</italic>, <italic>Cox6b1</italic>, <italic>Ndufa7</italic>, <italic>Ndufa11</italic>, <italic>Atp5e</italic>, <italic>Mrpl33</italic>, etc.), but this was not unique to the vas deferens – across the epididymis, mitochondrial energy production was enriched in principal, clear, and muscle cells, and depleted in basal, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We were particularly interested in one notable marker of vas deferens epithelial cells, <italic>Abcg2</italic>, which encodes a xenobiotic transporter whose functions are best-understood in the placenta. Abcg2 is localized to the apical end of syncitiotrophoblast cells of the human placenta, where it protects the developing fetus by pumping small molecules back into the maternal circulation, thereby preventing xenobiotics from crossing the placental barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Abcg2 has also been implicated in sperm function, as it is localized on the sperm surface where it is proposed to play a role in modulating the levels/localization of specific membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caballero et al., 2012</xref>). Although the function of Abcg2 in the vas deferens is unclear, we note that ABC-class transporters such as Abcg2 are typically localized to the apical end of polarized epithelia, which we confirmed with immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that Abcg2 expression in the vas deferens would be predicted to pump small molecules <italic>into</italic> the lumen, rather than clearing them out. As ABC class transporters such as Abcg2 are known to pump some endogenously synthesized molecules (such as heme), our data suggest an unappreciated role for this protein in concentrating some factor(s) in the lumen of the vas deferens.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Clear cells</title><p>Clear cells are largely responsible for one of the best-known functions of the epididymis, which is to provide an acidic luminal environment that ensures that sperm remain quiescent until mating occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 1992</xref>). This function is accomplished via high-level expression of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breton and Brown, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carr and Acott, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hermo et al., 2000</xref>), and clear cells are readily identified in our dataset by expression of the V-ATPase-encoding marker genes <italic>Atp6v0c</italic>, <italic>Atpv1e1</italic>, and <italic>Atp6v1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). In addition to expressing genes encoding V-ATPase subunits and V-ATPase-interacting proteins (<italic>Dmxl1</italic>), clear cells were enriched for genes involved in a wide range of functions, with the two most prominent being energy metabolism and membrane trafficking. In the former case, similar to vas deferens principal cells, clear cells also express high levels of genes involved in metabolic energy production, presumably serving to provide the high levels of ATP needed to power the acidification of the epididymal lumen. In addition to this elevated energy production, clear cells are also characterized by high expression of various membrane trafficking genes (<italic>Dab2</italic>, <italic>Ap1s3</italic>, <italic>Arf3</italic>, <italic>Stx7</italic>, <italic>Cdc42se2</italic>). This is consistent with the important role for active membrane recycling/endocytosis in localization of the vacuolar ATPase to clear cell microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breton and Brown, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shum et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To explore diversity among epididymal clear cells, we isolated and reclustered them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) as described above for principal cells, finding three clear cell subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Two of these clusters included clear cells from throughout the epididymis, while Cluster 2 was comprised entirely of clear cells from the caput and corpus epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This subcluster was distinguished by the expression of a small number of genes, with one standout marker gene: <italic>Iapp</italic>, encoding islet amyloid polypeptide, or Amylin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To validate these potentially distinct clear cell types, we stained epididymal tissue sections for a general clear cell marker (V-ATPase) and for Amylin. Consistent with the single-cell expression profiles, we find that Amylin labels a subset of V-ATPase-positive clear cells in the caput and the corpus epididymis, and that these cells were undetectable in the cauda or vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and not shown).

After reclustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>), we find that the largest subcluster of these cells was characterized by high levels of muscle markers (albeit not as high as bona fide muscle cells – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) such as <italic>Tagln</italic>, <italic>Myl9</italic>, <italic>Tpm2</italic>, <italic>Acta2</italic>, etc., and potentially corresponds to the myoid cells whose contraction plays roles in moving sperm and fluid through the epididymal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oliveira et al., 2016</xref>). Two other clusters of fibroblasts (C2, C4) were distinguished by relatively few marker genes and were not further considered. Finally, we identified two particularly interesting stromal cell subtypes that were almost entirely confined to the vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, inset). One of these clusters expressed a number of markers associated with stem cells (<italic>Angpt1</italic>, <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Tspan8</italic>) and may represent mesenchymal stem cells.

Prior studies decomposing complex tissues into scRNA-Seq have leveraged the expression profiles for known ligand-receptor pairs to infer significant pathways for cell-to-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). Motivated by these prior efforts, we asked whether our dataset could be used to explore potential intercellular communication networks throughout the epididymis.</p><p>We identified known ligands, and their receptors, expressed across the 34 cell subpopulations defined in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), using a large-scale ligand-receptor resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ramilowski et al., 2015</xref>). From these lists, we identified the number of potential interactions linking every cell type to every other cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Of these, significant interactions (p&lt;0.01) between cell types were defined based on the number of cases of expression of a ligand-receptor pair between the cell types, relative to the number of pairs expected by chance based on the total number of ligands and receptors expressed in each cell type (Materials and methods). This revealed multiple potential pairs of cells in communication, of which we highlight two. First, we find that basal cells and endothelial cells expressed complementary sets of ligands and receptors, consistent with the spatial juxtaposition between basal cells and the subepithelial capillary beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 1984</xref>). Second, we found reciprocal connections between macrophages and the ‘secretory fibroblasts’ in the vas deferens, suggesting the possibility that these vas deferens stromal cells play a role in recruiting macrophages. Indeed, although we found macrophages throughout the epididymis and vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), there was a bias for macrophages to be found in the vas deferens sample in our dataset (p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>, hypergeometric). Our data thus highlight candidate factors to be investigated in future genetic studies that aim to explore the role of signaling pathways in cell-to-cell communication within the epididymis.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Potential signaling interactions between epididymal cell types.</title><p>Bars on left and right show clusters of ligands and receptors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) named according to the cell population with highest expression levels.

We document more complete molecular profiles for the individual cell populations and provide a compendium of transcriptional profiles for a range of cells from this key reproductive organ. We further identify markers for potentially novel cell types, and our analyses suggest a wide variety of new hypotheses for future molecular studies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Distinctive principal cell programs across the epididymis</title><p>The most striking feature of the epididymis is the presence of regional gene expression programs in the principal cells that comprise the majority of epididymal epithelial cells. Consistent with previous surveys of the epididymis in a variety of mammals, we find multiple discrete groups of principal cells arrayed along the epididymis, with roughly eight unique gene expression signatures being appreciable across the epididymis and vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Even within a given cluster, we find evidence for heterogeneous expression of marker genes between individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), consistent with immunostaining studies documenting patchy expression of GSTs and other proteins among principal cells in a given epididymal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hermo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hermo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Papp et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rankin et al., 1992</xref>). Importantly, these highly variable markers exhibit little co-expression – this cellular heterogeneity is insufficient to drive further subclustering – suggesting that these cell-to-cell differences arise from stochastic expression of individual genes rather than coordinated expression of a broader program. Whether these heterogeneous expression patterns reflect temporally stable subspecialization/individualization of principal cells, or whether individual cells in a given region all express the same characteristic program with peak expression of different genes occurring transiently and asynchronously, will require long-term imaging studies using live cell reporters to address.</p><p>Turning to marker genes that are penetrantly expressed in specific regional domains, we note that a wide range of functions are represented, including signaling peptides (<italic>Npy</italic>, segments 7–8), putative RNA modifying enzymes (<italic>Mettl7a1</italic>, segment 2), and various metabolic enzymes. However, the most notable feature of region-specific gene regulation in the epididymis is the segmental expression of individual members of several large multi-gene families that are organized in genomic clusters, including β-defensins, aldo-keto reductases, lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and RNases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The activities encoded by these gene clusters encompass many well-characterized functions of the epididymis, as for example it has long been known that the sperm membrane and glycocalyx are extensively remodeled in the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernal et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tecle and Gagneux, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yanagimachi et al., 1972</xref>), while the wide array of antimicrobial peptides presumably serve to insulate the testis from ascending infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dorin and Barratt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gregory and Cyr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ribeiro et al., 2016</xref>). Sperm also undergo elaborate redox remodeling during their time in the epididymis, with extensive cysteine oxidation resulting in disulfide crosslinks in the genome-packaging protamines and many other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Calvin and Bedford, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ijiri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saowaros and Panyim, 1979</xref>). Conversely, another major redox function of the epididymis is to protect sperm from oxidative damage, which can cause lipid peroxidation, genome damage, and loss of sperm function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aitken, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delbès et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jones and Mann, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Selvaratnam et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with these and other major redox functions of this tissue, many families of redox enzymes exhibit region-specific expression in the epididymis, as for example different members of the glutathione S-transferase-encoding gene family exhibit strong regional biases in expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andonian and Hermo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hales et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Papp et al., 1995</xref>). Aldo-keto reductase genes also exhibit strongly region-specific expression patterns; members of this gene family are involved in the biosynthesis of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Volat et al., 2012</xref>) such as prostaglandins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kabututu et al., 2009</xref>), which have the potential to mediate both lumicrine signaling within the male reproductive tract as well as inter-partner signaling following delivery to the female reproductive tract. The aldo-keto reductases may also protect sperm from oxidative damage during transfer outside the body.</p><p>The lipocalins are a family of small molecule binding proteins which bind to lipophilic cargoes with a range of functions from signaling (retinoic acid, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lareyre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ong et al., 2000</xref>]) to innate immunity (siderophores, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Golonka et al., 2019</xref>]). Serine protease inhibitors are homologous to the semen coagulum proteins (which are synthesized primarily by the seminal vesicle) and potentially play some role in the protease-controlled processes of semen coagulation and liquefaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clauss et al., 2011</xref>), and may also be involved in acrosome maturation and sperm capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, high level expression of various RNases presumably explains the high levels of tRNA cleavage in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>), with resulting tRNA fragments potentially acting as another layer of protection from selfish elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schorn et al., 2017</xref>), or serving as environmentally modulated signaling molecules delivered by sperm to the zygote upon fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rompala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sarker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Segmentation of long tubes into distinctive chemical and gene expression microenvironments is a common feature of biological tubes, ranging from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad to the mammalian intestine. Among these, the gene expression gradients observed in the epididymis are in many ways most similar to those observed in the nephrons and collecting ducts of the kidney, another set of tubes whose function involves intricate manipulation of the pH and other chemical features of the luminal contents. Indeed, a number of genes exhibit prominent region-selective expression in both the epididymis and in ureteric principal cells, including genes of the <italic>Aqp</italic>, <italic>Fxyd</italic>, <italic>Cry</italic>, <italic>Akr</italic>, and <italic>Tspan</italic> families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ransick et al., 2019</xref>). Other similarities in cell composition between the epididymis and kidney include V-ATPase-positive intercalated cells of the kidney, analogous to epididymal clear cells, and the basal cell-like Krt5-positive cells of the kidney’s deep medullary epithelium. That said, the functions of the epididymis and kidney also differ in many important ways, and accordingly identification of epididymis-specific genes (eg <italic>Rnase9-12</italic>, <italic>Cst</italic> family members) can be used to infer genes with functions in sperm maturation per se.</p><p>While the organization of gene expression domains in nephrons and collecting ducts plays well-understood roles in urine concentration and pH manipulation, the functions of the consecutive microenvironments of the epididymis in sperm maturation are less clear. In other words, is there any utility to having sperm first incubate for days in the presence of Defb21, then move into an incubation with Defb48, etc.? Would sperm function any differently if the various defensins (or Rnases, etc.) switched positions? The segment-specific expression of individual members of various gene families is also of mechanistic interest — what transcription factor or post-transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Björkgren et al., 2012</xref>) is responsible for, say, expression of <italic>Defb21</italic> but not <italic>Defb2</italic> in the caput epididymis?

However, our Amylin-positive clear cell subset is unlikely to correspond to either of these cell types, as apical and narrow cells are confined to the initial segment of the caput epididymis, while Amylin-positive clear cells are found in downstream segments of the caput and corpus epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, one of the few reported markers of narrow cells, Carbonic Anhydrase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamali and Hermo, 1996</xref>), is not enriched in the cells comprising Cluster two in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, our data suggest that Amylin-positive clear cells do not correspond to previously identified initial segment-specific clear cells, and Amylin expression therefore may distinguish between two distinct subsets of clear cells. Whatever the correspondence to narrow cells, it will be important in future studies to determine whether functional differences can be identified that distinguish Amylin-positive and -negative clear cells – Amylin has been implicated in systemic control of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyle and Le Foll, 2019</xref>), so it will be interesting to determine whether clear cell-secreted Amylin is used to signal locally within the male reproductive tract, or whether systemic release of Amylin is used to modulate organismal metabolism, potentially in response to reproductive function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Perspective</title><p>Together, our data provide a bird’s eye view of the cellular composition of the mouse epididymis. We identified several novel features of epididymal cell biology, most notably including a detailed examination of the understudied vas deferens. Potentially novel cell types identified include Amylin-positive clear cells, as well as two subtypes of fibroblasts – secretory and stem-like – confined to the vas deferens. Moreover, our data highlight several groups of cells with the potential for extensive intercellular signaling, and suggest that secretory fibroblasts in the vas deferens may play roles in recruiting macrophages. These data will provide a rich resource for hypothesis generation and future efforts to more fully understand the biology of the epididymis and vas deferens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Tissues were obtained from 10- to 12-week-old male FVB/NJ mice.

Using a dissection microscope with warm stage set to 35°C, the organ was cleared of any fat and excessive connective tissue. In a clean 10-cm dish containing 10 mL of Krebs media the organ was cut into four segments that roughly corresponded to caput, corpus, cauda, and vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each group of eight segments was placed into different 5-cm petri dishes with about 2 mL of Krebs media. Using curved scissors, each group was further cut into roughly 1–5 mm pieces and transferred to a 15-mL conical tube. Media was added to a final volume of 10 mL, and samples allowed to decant while in an upright position at a 35°C incubator for 3–5 min. Supernatant was discarded and this wash step repeated for two more times. In order to further remove sperm, the tubules were transferred to a 50-mL conical tube containing 25 mL pre-warmed RPMI-1640 media. After ten minutes incubation at 35°C under mild agitation, samples were allowed to settle for 3–5 min and supernatant discarded. These steps were repeated until supernatant looked clear.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Dissociation</title><p>Tissue dissociation was optimized to obtain a single cell suspension free of sperm. Once dissected samples were cleared of any visible sperm, 3 mL of the RPMI-1640 sample mixture was transferred to a small 25 mL glass Erlenmeyer flask containing 7 mL of dissociation media (Collagenase IV 4 mg/mL, DNAse I 0.05 mg/mL) and placed in a 35°C water bath with rotations of 200 rpm for 30 to 45 min. Afterwards, samples were transferred to a conical tube and allowed to settle. Supernatant was removed, leaving 4–5 mL of sample solution to be returned to the Erlenmeyer flask, where 10 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and 0.05 mg/mL DNAse I was added prior to the return to the water bath shaker. After 35 min, the samples were pipetted up and down until there were no observable pieces of tissue and allowed to incubate in the water bath for an additional 20 min. Once cell disaggregation was achieved 1 mL of FBS was added to inactivate the trypsin. Sample was transferred to falcon tube while passing the cell solution through a series of 100 μm, 70 μm, and 40 μm cell strainers, and adding media (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic and anti-mycotic - 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 µg/mL of streptomycin, and 0.025 µg/mL of Amphotericin B) to a final volume of 30 mL. Finally samples were submitted to centrifugation for 15 min at 400 rcf (g) at room temperature (RT). Supernatant was discarded and up to 25 mL of media added prior to centrifugation for 5 min at 800 rcf (g) at RT. Afterwards supernatant was discarded and 2 mL of PBS added, and the cells transferred to a 2-mL microfuge tube. Media was further removed by centrifugation at 900rcf (g) for 3 min, supernatant discarded and pellet resuspended in 600 μL PBS. A 10 μL aliquot of cells plus a cell viability marker (tryphan blue), was used to determine cell viability and concentration using an automated cell counter (Bio-RAD TC20). Cells were maintained on ice and samples deemed good (&gt;85% survival) proceeded to the downstream preparation with the 10X protocol/dilutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Library protocol</title><p>Single-cell sequencing libraries were prepared using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit V2 (10X Genomics), as per the manual, and sequenced on NextSeq 500 and HiSeq 4000 at the UMass Medical School Deep Sequencing Core.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data processing</title><p>Sequencing reads were processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Derr et al., 2016</xref>), using the graphical interface DolphinNext [<bold>doi:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/689539">https://doi.org/10.1101/689539</ext-link>].

Valid reads were extracted using umitools [doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.209601.116">10.1101/gr.209601.116</ext-link>] and valid barcode indices supplied by 10X Genomics. Reads where the UMI contains a base assigned as N were discarded. Remaining reads were aligned to the mm10 genome using HISAT2 v2.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) with default parameters and the reference transcriptome RefSeq v69. Alignment files were filtered to contain only reads from cell barcodes with at least 100 aligned reads and were submitted through ESAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/garber-lab/ESAT">github.com/garber-lab/ESAT</ext-link>) for gene-level quantification of unique molecule identifiers (UMIs) with parameters -wLen 100 -wOlap 50 -wExt 1000 -sigTest. 01 -multimap ignore -scPrep. Finally, we identified and corrected for UMIs that were likely a result of sequencing errors, by merging the UMIs observed only once that display hamming distance of 1 from a UMI detected by two or more aligned reads.</p><p>Barcodes with at least 350 and no more than 15,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) mapped to known genes were considered valid cells. Additionaly, background RNA contamination was removed from the gene expression matrix using a modified version of the algorithm SoupX v0.3.1 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/303727">https://doi.org/10.1101/303727</ext-link>]. Briefly, barcodes corresponding to empty droplets were selected per sample according to their distribution of UMIs per barcode (caput: 20 =&lt; x =&lt; 175, corpus: 20 =&lt; x =&lt; 150, cauda: 20 =&lt; x =&lt; 150, vas: 20 =&lt; x =&lt; 115; where x = total UMIs for a given barcode). UMI counts for empty droplets were used as input for the SoupX algorithm to infer the expression profile from the ambient contamination per sample. The main alteration consisted in the selection of the fraction of contamination per cell (rho), which was determined by the most frequent number of UMIs for the empty droplets in each sample (caput = 139; corpus = 114; cauda = 109; vas = 84), under the assumption that the same contamination level could be expected from valid cell containing droplets. Using these estimated contamination fractions, the SoupX algorithm was used to remove counts from genes that had a high probability of resulting from ambient RNA contamination for each cell using the function adjustCounts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Dimensionality reduction and clustering</title><p>Gene expression matrices for all samples were loaded into R (V3.6.0) and merged. The functions used in our custom analysis pipeline are available through an R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/garber-lab/SignallingSingleCell">github.com/garber-lab/SignallingSingleCell</ext-link>). Using the clean raw expression matrix, the top 20% of genes with the highest coefficient of variation were selected for dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction was performed in two steps, first with a PCA using the most variable genes and the R package irlba v2.3.3, then using the first 7 PCs (&gt;85% of the variance explained) as input to tSNE (Rtsne v0.15) with parameters perplexity = 30, check_duplicates = F, pca = F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>). Clusters were defined on the resulting tSNE 2D embedding, using the density peak algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rodriguez and Laio, 2014</xref>) implemented in densityClust v0.3 and selecting the top 30 cluster centers based on the γ value distribution (γ = ρ × δ; ρ = local density; δ = distance from points of higher density). Using known cell type markers, clusters were used to define six broad populations (Immune, Stromal, Basal, Principal, Clear and Muscle). UMI counts were normalized using the function computeSumFactors from the package scran v1.12.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lun et al., 2016</xref>), and parameter min.mean was set to select only the top 20% expressed genes to estimate size factors, using the six broad populations defined above as input to the parameter clusters. After normalization, only cells with size factors that differed from the mean by less than one order of magnitude were kept for further analysis <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = cell size factor; N = number of cells). Normalized UMI counts were converted to gene fractions per cell and the resulting matrix was used in a second round of dimensionality reduction and clustering. The top 15% variable genes were selected as described above and used as input to PCA and the first 24 PCs that explained &gt;95% of the variance were used as input to tSNE. The resulting 2D embedding was used to determine 21 clusters as described above. Marker genes for each cluster were identified by a differential expression analysis between each cluster and all other cells, using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McCarthy et al., 2012</xref>), with size factors estimated by scran and including the sample of origin as the batch information in the design model. Each of the six broad cell type populations was independently re-clustered following the same procedure described above, to reveal more specific cell types. Expression values per cluster were calculated by aggregating gene expression values from individual cells in each cluster and normalizing by the total number of UMIs detected for all cells in that cluster, multiplied by 10<sup>6</sup> (UMIs per million). In scRNA-Seq data, zero values for a given gene can result from technical dropouts or from true biological variability where cells do not express that gene. To estimate the fraction of true zeros for each gene, we used a zero inflated negative binomial model implemented in DESingle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miao et al., 2018</xref>). From this model we calculated the fraction of cells in any given cluster expressing each gene displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, with outputs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> including the fraction of expressing cells as well as expression level only in positive cells.</p><p>An R script for the steps described here and containing all parameters used is available through GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/elisadonnard/SCepididymis">github.com/elisadonnard/SCepididymis</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/SCepididymis">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/SCepididymis</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Donner, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Receptor-ligand network analysis</title><p>Receptors and ligands expressed in the dataset were selected based on a published database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ramilowski et al., 2015</xref>).

Genes were filtered to select only those expressed by at least 20% of cells in at least one cell population, resulting in a set of 226 ligands and corresponding 212 receptors. Aggregated expression values were calculated based on this filtered gene matrix per cell type as described above.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gail Cornwall (Reviewer #2); Louis Hermo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is timely and of considerable interest to researchers working in the field of the epididymis. It is a re-examination of mouse epididymis gene profiling using microfluidic-based cell isolation and molecular barcoding strategies coupled with genome-wide deep sequencing technologies. The purpose is to dissect out the contributions of different cell types to the highly regionalized gene expression profiles in the mouse epididymis and vas deferens. Although most of the authors' conclusions, including that distinct cell populations such as that unique subsets of principle cells express different genes which leads to changing luminal microenvironments along the tubule, are not at all new to the field, information is presented that does provide new &quot;tools&quot;. This includes the clustering of genes to the different cell populations in the epididymis and vas deferens (within a single study), the inclusion of the vas deferens in this analysis, and the identification of putative new subpopulations of clear and basal cells.</p><p>While this study takes a novel approach to understand the diversity of cell types of the epididymis and vas deferens, there are a number of major points that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title should be &quot;mouse&quot; not &quot;mammalian&quot;- it is well known that there are profound species differences in genital duct structure and function.</p><p>2) Introduction. The Introduction has an inadequate bibliography. For example, only one paper from 2007 specifically related to studies on the transcriptome of the human epididymis is cited. Several others relevant papers from different research groups, both from the mid 2000's and more recently are ignored.</p><p>3) Materials and methods. Unfortunately, the bioinformatics-based predictions of regional distribution of subclasses of key cell types (e.g., principal cells) and new cell types (e.g., variant clear cells) presented here are not been validated by another experimental protocol, preferably immunohistochemistry. The PI has the tissues and the skill set required to produce these imaging data and is encouraged to provide them in a revised manuscript.</p><p>4) Materials and methods. The choice to divide the mouse epididymis into three sections as the basis for the rest of the studies presents a major problem, given what is already well established in the literature about this tissue. It has long been known that the gross separation caput/corpus/cauda reflects neither the finely segmented anatomy of the organ nor its functional segmentation. The studies in this manuscript could have provided a major enhancement on the excellent studies done by Johnston et al., 2005, where anatomical segmentation of the mouse epididymis into 10 segments was described. Although it is understandable that separation into 10 segments would have been challenging, separating the segments by following at least the 5 functional domains previously identified by Johnston's work (i.e. S1, S2, S3 to S6, S7, S8 to S10) would have been appropriate. Such a functionally more appropriate approach is much more powerful with respect to this segmented organ, and how this may affect its physiology and cell-cell interactions. As an example of strange differences between the two studies, how is it that <italic>Gpx5</italic>, which is undoubtedly a highly expressed caput gene (representing about 5% of the total caput transcripts), does not appear in Figure 1—figure supplement 1? The same applies to <italic>Gpx3</italic> in the cauda epididymidis. These are just a few examples. Please explain why that was not done.</p><p>Further, even if one accepts the segments used for this study, the authors make no effort to use the scRNAseq data to attempt to functionally separate cells of the initial segment from other caput cells. Since some species lack an initial segment, it will be useful to compare the gene expression profile from the initial segment with, for example, efferent ducts in the human epididymis.</p><p>5) Figure 1. The diagram of the mouse genital duct in Figure 1A is unacceptable. Please show an image of real tissue and the septa used to define the dissection. One of the advantages of mouse is the ability to do precise dissections according to location of septa in the epididymis.</p><p>6) Figure 2. The single-cell approach presented in Figure 2 is interesting because it allows localization of the expression of particular genes in cell subtypes. In panel 2C, what was the rationale for illustrating the selected genes and not systematically the genes that are considered markers of epididymal sub-cell types and that are listed in the right margin of Figure 2A? It is also difficult to understand the C8, C18, C11 distinction in the principal cells; C6 and C11 being caudal principal cells whereas C18 comes from the corpus. What are the reasons for this and why is the numbering not logical from caput to caudal?</p><p>The data suggesting regional gene expression profiles of different principal cells along the epididymis need to be confirmed by immunofluorescence or other histological methods. Other explanations could underlie these cell clusters.</p><p>7) Similarly, the data in Figure 3 that shows genomic clusters of expressed genes from multigene families, needs to be validated by direct visualization of marker proteins.</p><p>8) Figure 3—figure supplement 3, localization of Abcg2 in the vas deferens requires an image of tissue incubated with a control serum (normal IgG, or better blocked antibody with peptide; secondary antibody alone is not an appropriate control for IIF). This could replace one of the panels shown (which are just two images at two different magnifications); a scale bar is also necessary.</p><p>9) Figure 4E is not adequate as there is no orientation of the tissue section and no illustration of negative controls or other markers.</p><p>10) The identification of two types of clear cells by re-clustering is novel. The use of amylin as a marker of the second group is also of interest, but it would be important to know if this marker is also found in other clusters of epididymis cells before arriving at this interpretation. There is the speculation that the amylin positive cells are &quot;narrow cells&quot; but again more extensive validation using imaging is required to support this conclusion.</p><p>Further, the finding that different populations of a cell type, even within a single cross-section, can have different levels of gene expression needs to be considered and properly referenced. This has also been noted for principal cells and their expression of many different proteins (Hermo et al., 1991, 1992; Rankin et al., 1991), where in a given cross section some principal cells are highly reactive while adjacent principal cells were unreactive. In these cases, it was proposed that the principal cells were not in synchrony with respect to the secretion of these proteins. However, it may also suggest that the principal cell population of a given region is more diverse than ever imagined. Likewise, one could argue that not all the clear cells of a given region are not in synchrony with respect to the expression of a given protein at one given time or that the population of clear cells is more diverse than expected. Examples of diverse expression of GSTs in principal cells also highlights the hypothesis of diverse populations of principal cells in a given epididymal region (Papp et al., 1995). Please consider including these points in your data interpretation.</p><p>11) The description of a potential new population of basal cells is interesting but no indication is given as to whether these were restricted/enriched in a particular epididymal region. Please provide this information.</p><p>12) Basal cells have been suggested to be derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage (Seiler et al., 1998, 1999). The group of Breton has indicated that basal cells are COX-1 and cytokeratin 5+ cells and distinct from the F4/80 macrophages. In addition, dendritic cells are present in the epithelium. Furthermore, all of these cells are lodged at the base of the epithelium where they firmly adhere to the basement membrane. Without the use of appropriate markers to separate these cells, how can we be certain that what is being called basal cells are not in fact a mixture of the monocyte/macrophage basal cells of the Cooper group as compared with the dendritic cells of the Breton group. LM images and quantification would appear to be a way to confirm what basal cell type was extracted.</p><p>13) Although in this study, macrophages are indicated to be strongly linked to the vas deferens, no indication of epididymal region is given for the other immune cell populations. Furthermore, in the heading of immune cells, the authors define a category of endothelial cells. There is no evidence of any endothelial cells being present in the epididymal epithelium. This suggests that the preparations are contaminated. Endothelial cells are found lining blood vessels and these do not exist in the epithelium. Can the authors clarify from where the endothelial cells were derived? As for the immune cells, once again some LM images and quantification of percent of each of the different immune cells examined would be in order, e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes, etc).</p><p>14) The cell:cell communication aspect shown by bioinformatics comparisons in Figure 6 is interesting. However, the speculation that basal cells and endothelial cells, and macrophages and &quot;secretory fibroblasts&quot;, in the vas express complementary sets of ligands and receptors needs to be validated by another method, e.g., immunohistochemistry, to demonstrate that these cells are co-localized. Please also define PC , DC, SI, NS.</p><p>15) Analysis of the vas deferens is of interest as this part of the duct is rarely studied. The authors note high expression of genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Is it possible that the cells isolated from the vas include spermatozoa? The tissue samples are from 10-14 weeks mice, when males are already sexually mature. Though the single cell isolation protocol stresses the removal of sperm from tissue, it appears to rely on visual inspection of supernatant turbidity. Some other markers should be investigated to exclude the possibility of contaminating sperm.</p><p>16) While the fluorescent images are good, they do not cover all regions of the duct, and there is no way of knowing if the images are representative. How many animals were used and how many experiments were done to ensure reproducibility?</p><p>17) The Discussion is remarkably incomplete and somewhat biased. Some specific questions that are not satisfactorily addressed are:</p><p>1) To which cell type do the so-called apical cells belong? Apical cells are not discussed at all in this manuscript;</p><p>2)- The discussion on immune cells is poor considering the recent publications on murine epididymal immune cells from several laboratories. Please refer to and discuss the studies focussed on epididymal immune cells, e.g., Voisin et al., 2018;</p><p>3) There is a complete lack of discussion of the major and well-known roles of epididymal sperm maturation concerning the fine balance between oxidative and anti-oxidative processes. These are just a few examples, as there are many landmark manuscripts dealing with epididymal physiology that have been ignored.</p><p>In addition, the speculation in the Discussion on the highly segmental expression of several large multigene families and its relative importance is &quot;epididymocentric&quot;. It could be argued that this is a feature of any tubular structure in the body and the authors are encouraged to examine (for example) the single cell data from the mouse kidney before making the assumption that this is an epididymis-specific feature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55474.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for the detailed and constructive comments. In addressing these comments, we have learned a great deal about the history of epididymal gene regulation, and we believe we have significantly improved the utility of the manuscript to the community.</p><p>The major new data included in this revised manuscript, based on quite a few distinct requests from the reviewers, are a number of immunostaining studies. Specifically, we now include new images for the following studies:</p><p>– ATP6V1G3 (clear cell marker) + Amylin. We had already included some images of these data, described a subset of Amylin-positive clear cells, in the original manuscript. As requested by reviewers, we have added additional images of this staining effort from different parts of the epididymis, confirming our claim that the Amylin-positive clear cells are confined to the caput and early corpus (<bold>Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</bold>) as well as validating our findings using independent antibodies.</p><p>– KRT5 (basal cells) + F4/80 (Macrophages and monocytes), KRT5 + MHC Class II (antigen-presenting cells). These new staining data address reviewer comments regarding the distinction, or potential lack thereof, between basal cells and various mononuclear phagocytes. We confirm prior reports documenting clear distinctions between basal cells and macrophages and other APCs (<bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D</bold>).</p><p>– F4/80 and MHC Class II images in the vas deferens, responding to the reviewer concern that these APCs might only be found in contaminating blood vessels, and demonstrating the presence of interstitial APCs (<bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</bold>).</p><p>– Vas deferens staining with Lgr5 and either Ptx3 or Tslp, confirming our distinction between two stromal cell types (“secretory” and “stem-like”) in the vas deferens (<bold>Figure 6—figure supplement 2</bold>).</p><p>The other major addition to the manuscript is an explicit analysis of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression within principal cell subclusters, presented in the new <bold>Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold> and <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>. This analysis proved quite interesting, as we find evidence – consistent with the prior staining studies from Hermo, Rankin, Papp highlighted by the reviewers – for different genes to be expressed either more penetrantly or more variably. For example, we confirm that Clusterin is unusually “patchy” relative to other genes with the same expression level, consistent with staining studies. We think this analysis adds substantially to the manuscript and thank the reviewers for suggesting the idea.</p><p>Beyond these, other major changes to the manuscript include reanalysis of the relationship between basal cells and mononuclear phagocytes, new or more extensive discussions of several requested topics, including increasing citations to prior literature, and a discussion comparing epididymal gene regulation to that observed in similar organs like the kidney. Together, we believe these changes have greatly increased the value of this resource to the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title should be &quot;mouse&quot; not &quot;mammalian&quot;- it is well known that there are profound species differences in genital duct structure and function.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction.

The PI has the tissues and the skill set required to produce these imaging data and is encouraged to provide them in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is one of many comments requesting immunostaining-based validation, which we address in the introduction to the revision. With respect to the specific issues raised here, the reviewer is partly mistaken – our initial manuscript DID include IF studies validating the presence of Amylin-positive clear cells in the caput. Beyond that, carrying out additional lab experiments was challenging due to the CoVid pandemic, and among the various specific follow-up efforts, validation of principal cell gene expression patterns was quite low on our priority list for two major reasons: 1) our data are so strongly concordant with many prior studies; 2) many of the region-specific gene expression differences are seen in large multi-gene families, where high quality antibodies that distinguish family members are scarce (if they exist at all).</p><p>We do have one image that could be relevant, a light sheet image of Defb41 Cre-driven tdTomato expression in the caput epididymis. But the Defb41 Cre has previously been validated as caput-specific, so we do not feel this adds much.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Materials and methods. The choice to divide the mouse epididymis into three sections as the basis for the rest of the studies presents a major problem, given what is already well established in the literature about this tissue. It has long been known that the gross separation caput/corpus/cauda reflects neither the finely segmented anatomy of the organ nor its functional segmentation. The studies in this manuscript could have provided a major enhancement on the excellent studies done by Johnston et al., 2005, where anatomical segmentation of the mouse epididymis into 10 segments was described. Although it is understandable that separation into 10 segments would have been challenging, separating the segments by following at least the 5 functional domains previously identified by Johnston's work (i.e.: S1, S2, S3 to S6, S7, S8 to S10) would have been appropriate. Such a functionally more appropriate approach is much more powerful with respect to this segmented organ, and how this may affect its physiology and cell-cell interactions. As an example of strange differences between the two studies, how is it that Gpx5, which is undoubtedly a highly expressed caput gene (representing about 5% of the total caput transcripts), does not appear in Figure 1—figure supplement 1? The same applies to Gpx3 in the cauda epididymidis. These are just a few examples. Please explain why that was not done.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are more meaningful ways to segment the epididymis than the simple caput/corpus/cauda dissection presented here. However, single cell RNA-Seq behaves counterintuitively in terms of tissue sampling: the more individual dissections done, the more substantial and complex the analysis that goes into removing contamination by cell-free RNA (see our Materials and methods).</p><p>Indeed, if anything we actually regret not simply analyzing the entire epididymis without <bold>any</bold> dissection – the major advantage of single-cell RNA-Seq is that no assumptions whatsoever have to be made about the boundaries of functionally-distinct territories, the data will highlight the different cell types if meaningful differences exist (as of course they do). Thus, with the exception of the bulk RNA-Seq in <bold>Figure 1B</bold> and <bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 2</bold> (originally <bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 1</bold>), the dissection margins do not meaningfully influence the dataset. Principal cells are easily mapped to known segments based on comparison to prior RNA-Seq studies, for example, given the clear fact that these cells contribute the major segment-defining genes in prior studies.</p><p>In the end, the only way that the dissection margins helped here was to search for region-specific expression patterns in the accessory (basal clear, etc.) cell types. We found two uses for this information – the amylin-positive clear cells in the caput, and the region-specific localization of certain immune cells. Otherwise we find very little evidence for segment or region-based specialization of accessory cell types in the epididymis. Thus, the dissection margins are immaterial for this study – there would not have been much to gain from looking specifically at basal cell density in segment 5 vs. segment 7 of the corpus.</p><p>As for the specific queries regarding <italic>Gpx5</italic> and <italic>3</italic>, we have now included <italic>Gpx3</italic> as requested (it was simply not listed among the genes of interest for us in the image, but it was one of the unlabeled genes in the heatmap). As for <italic>Gpx5</italic>, <bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 2</bold> (old <bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 1</bold>) is focused on extremely segment-restricted genes from Johnston et al., 2005, and as it happens <italic>Gpx5</italic> did not fulfil our criteria in the Turner, 2005 data, as it was expressed at nearly identical levels across FOUR segments: <italic>Gpx5</italic> is indeed highly enriched in the caput as expected but very flat across segments 1-4: 1045 / 1110 / 1272 / 1200 ppm). And our data nicely validates this, showing precisely the pattern the reviewer expects: mRNA abundances for <italic>Gpx5</italic> are ~39000 / 14 / 68 / 50 ppm for caput, corpus, cauda, and vas, exactly behaving as predicted. So our data perfectly confirm prior art here. We also now illustrate this in new <bold>Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</bold>.</p><p>More generally speaking, as far as our choices for genes to show in figures, we chose to highlight a subset of genes (rather than every gene studied in the epididymis in the literature) first of all to validate our approach, and then second of all we also included genes of interest to us specifically (RNases for instance).</p><p>Finally, as this is a Resource for interested researchers, full lists of genes can be found in Supplementary file <bold>2</bold>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, even if one accepts the segments used for this study, the authors make no effort to use the scRNAseq data to attempt to functionally separate cells of the initial segment from other caput cells. Since some species lack an initial segment, it will be useful to compare the gene expression profile from the initial segment with, for example, efferent ducts in the human epididymis.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial segment corresponds to what was initially called Cluster 15 in <bold>Figure 3</bold>, which we now annotate (and rename as Cluster 1). This is based on maximal expression of the same genes in Cluster 15 (now Cluster 1) and in Segment 1 from Johnston et al., 2005 (<italic>RNase10</italic>, <italic>Cst11</italic>, <italic>Lcn2</italic>, <italic>Mfge8</italic>, and others).</p><p>As for comparing to human efferent ducts, we compared both our data and the Turner et al. dataset to the analysis of human efferent ducts in Legare and Sullivan, 2019. By and large the genes that are noted to be enriched in human efferent ducts in Legare and Sullivan – genes involved in cilia function (<italic>Dnah</italic> genes, <italic>Ift</italic> genes), signaling genes (<italic>Esr1</italic>, <italic>Esrrg</italic>, <italic>Hnf4a</italic>, etc.) and sperm-related genes (<italic>Piwil4</italic>, <italic>Tsga10</italic>, etc.) – are not enriched in our Cluster 1, nor enriched in Turner et al. Segment 1. We could note this briefly in our revised text, although we have not made any effort generally to compare to other species’ datasets (and many segment-specific genes are rapidly-evolving, making ortholog assignment a nontrivial task) so unless specifically requested we were going to skip this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1.

What “other explanations” could explain the marked gene expression differences between principal cell clusters, which <bold>perfectly</bold> overlap with MANY prior gene expression analyses of regional gene regulation in the epididymis? We would be very happy to modify our manuscript if we were informed of any legitimate alternative explanations that would explain how our data would so be perfectly consistent with scores of prior studies; we note that as far as we can tell, any such explanations would require that <bold>the prior studies somehow <italic>also</italic> be marred</bold> by the artifact in question.</p><p>Focusing just on the comparison to Johnston et al., 2005 (the dataset we used as our 10 segment “bible”) , our 11 principal cell clusters from the epididymis (not including our 4 vas deferens clusters) in <bold>Figure 3</bold> very cleanly recapitulate segmental gene expression patterns – based on highly-enriched marker genes, our clusters from 1 to 11 (new numbering) correspond to segment 1 (initial segment), segments 1-2, segments 3-4, segment 5 (early), late segment 5/segment 6, segment 7, late segment 7, segments 8-9, segment 9, late segment 9 (some segment 10 markers), segment 10. We now detail this in the legend for <bold>Figure 3D</bold>.</p><p>In addition to recapitulating <bold>extensive</bold> prior studies, we note that few antibodies exist for genes that distinguish region-specific principal cells, as they are typically distinguished by members of paralogous multi-gene families, many of which are secreted. Even before the CoVid pandemic stopped the majority of experimental work in our lab, we did not think it would be worthwhile to explore the complete catalog of Defb antibodies to find reasonable markers when multiple other lines of evidence support the fact that principal cells from different segments exhibit differences in gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Similarly, the data in Figure 3 that shows genomic clusters of expressed genes from multigene families, needs to be validated by direct visualization of marker proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have covered this exhaustively above. We do not think the requested IF is likely to succeed, and we do not see any legitimate scientific benefit to doing it either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3—figure supplement 3, localization of Abcg2 in the vas deferens requires an image of tissue incubated with a control serum (normal IgG, or better blocked antibody with peptide; secondary antibody alone is not an appropriate control for IIF). This could replace one of the panels shown (which are just two images at two different magnifications); a scale bar is also necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added a scale bar to what is now Figure 3—figure supplement 4, and we provide several negative control images throughout the manuscript stained with antibodies to proteins not expressed in a given region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4E is not adequate as there is no orientation of the tissue section and no illustration of negative controls or other markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not clear as to the request for “orientation of the tissue section” – we would be happy to indicate whatever is needed, but we do not understand the request. We believe this is addressed by the images of other regions of the epididymis in the new <bold>Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</bold>, but if not, we are unsure what was requested. As for negative controls, here for example the new images of Abcg2 staining in the epididymis (where it is not expressed) provides a new staining control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The identification of two types of clear cells by re-clustering is novel. The use of amylin as a marker of the second group is also of interest, but it would be important to know if this marker is also found in other clusters of epididymis cells before arriving at this interpretation. There is the speculation that the amylin positive cells are &quot;narrow cells&quot; but again more extensive validation using imaging is required to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this comment in several ways. First, new <bold>Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</bold> show <italic>Iapp</italic> expression across all cells in our main dataset (A) and across clear cells only (B), showing the restriction of <italic>Iapp</italic> to a subset of clear cells. Second, the new IF images in <bold>Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</bold> now include several additional sections stained for V-ATPase and Amylin.</p><p>In the original manuscript we did note that Amylin-positive clear cells might not be narrow cells, given the presence of Amylin-positive cells in both the initial segment but also in the caput and corpus. In addition, Amylin-negative clear cells in our image also show the “champagne” glass apical nucleus attributed to narrow cells. So altogether we do not believe that Amylin-positive clear cells represent narrow (nor apical) cells, but instead a distinctive subset of clear cells. We have tried to be clearer about the relationship between Amylin-positive clear cells and narrow and apical cells in the revised text describing the analysis of clear cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the finding that different populations of a cell type, even within a single cross-section, can have different levels of gene expression needs to be considered and properly referenced. This has also been noted for principal cells and their expression of many different proteins (Hermo et al., 1991, 1992; Rankin et al., 1991), where in a given cross section some principal cells are highly reactive while adjacent principal cells were unreactive. In these cases, it was proposed that the principal cells were not in synchrony with respect to the secretion of these proteins. However, it may also suggest that the principal cell population of a given region is more diverse than ever imagined. Likewise, one could argue that not all the clear cells of a given region are not in synchrony with respect to the expression of a given protein at one given time or that the population of clear cells is more diverse than expected. Examples of diverse expression of GSTs in principal cells also highlights the hypothesis of diverse populations of principal cells in a given epididymal region (Papp et al., 1995). Please consider including these points in your data interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question and idea, and we have added a new supplementary figure (new <bold>Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold>) and Supplementary file <bold>3</bold> and a paragraph in the Discussion on the topic. Briefly, in principle, single cell RNA-Seq data provide some insight into cell to cell heterogeneity in gene expression, although the low efficiency of mRNA capture in scRNA-Seq makes it difficult to distinguish “true zeroes” – cases where a given cell does not express a gene – from technical dropouts resulting from failure to capture any molecules of the gene in question. To address this we used DESingle (Miao et al., 2018) to estimate the fraction of expressing cells for all genes expressed in any given principal cell subcluster, and present this analysis in new <bold>Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold> and in new Supplementary file 3. Briefly, we do find that genes expressed at similar levels per cell can vary in their penetrance of expression, as shown in panels <bold>C-E</bold>, and consistent with the reviewer comments above. Indeed, we highlight Clusterin as one of the genes with unusually high cell to cell variability as a “positive control” – based on Hermo 1991 – in panel <bold>B</bold>. We anticipate that the new Supplementary file <bold>3</bold> should provide a valuable resource for investigators interested in the question of principal cell heterogeneity.</p><p>As an important aside, we note that cell to cell variability in apparent expression of marker genes is independent for different genes that mark a given cluster. In other words, both <italic>Car4</italic> and <italic>Gdf15</italic> are markers for Cluster 6 (new terminology) in <bold>Figure 3D</bold>. While these and other marker genes are not present in every cell in this Cluster, the cells lacking <italic>Car4</italic> and the cells lacking <italic>Gdf15</italic> are uncorrelated (not ANTIcorrelated, UNcorrelated). This means that there is no coherent way to subdivide Cluster 6 into meaningful subclusters – e.g. putative Clusters 6A (Car+/Gdf+) and 6B (Car-/Gdf-) – and is the reason Cluster 6 is not further subdivided. So while staining studies might find Car4+ and Car4- cells, these different populations are not indicators of cell states with larger underlying gene regulatory programs. We have attempted to efficiently express these thoughts in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The description of a potential new population of basal cells is interesting but no indication is given as to whether these were restricted/enriched in a particular epididymal region. Please provide this information.</p></disp-quote><p>We indicate the locations of all basal cells in new <bold>Figure 5B</bold>, revealing that the “low UMI” basal cells are found throughout the epididymis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Basal cells have been suggested to be derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage (Seiler et al., 1998, 1999). The group of Breton has indicated that basal cells are COX-1 and cytokeratin 5+ cells and distinct from the F4/80 macrophages. In addition, dendritic cells are present in the epithelium. Furthermore, all of these cells are lodged at the base of the epithelium where they firmly adhere to the basement membrane. Without the use of appropriate markers to separate these cells, how can we be certain that what is being called basal cells are not in fact a mixture of the monocyte/macrophage basal cells of the Cooper group as compared with the dendritic cells of the Breton group. LM images and quantification would appear to be a way to confirm what basal cell type was extracted.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point which we had neglected. We have now addressed the distinction between basal cells and macrophages/dendritic cells two ways. First, using our scRNA dataset we have grouped putative basal and immune cells, and reclustered this subset of cells. New <bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B</bold> shows this clustering, confirming the major transcriptional separation of basal cells and macrophage/DC cell groups. To further validate these distinctions in vivo, we also carried out two-color immunostaining to compare basal cells and macrophages. For basal cells we used the classic marker <italic>Krt5</italic>, and also stained with Adm to confirm the basal cell expression of this marker predicted by our scRNA-Seq dataset. For immune cells, we stained with MHC Class II for general antigen presenting cells, and F4/80 to more specifically stain macrophages – we also attempted to stain for DCs using Cd207 but the antibody proved nonspecific. Consistent with other recent studies (Shum et al., 2014), we find <italic>Krt5</italic>-positive basal cells generally do not stain with MHC Class II or F4/80 – these antigens stain distinct cell types – thus supporting the distinction between basal cells and mononuclear phagocytic cells. These data are show in the new <bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D</bold>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Although in this study, macrophages are indicated to be strongly linked to the vas deferens, no indication of epididymal region is given for the other immune cell populations. Furthermore, in the heading of immune cells, the authors define a category of endothelial cells. There is no evidence of any endothelial cells being present in the epididymal epithelium. This suggests that the preparations are contaminated. Endothelial cells are found lining blood vessels and these do not exist in the epithelium. Can the authors clarify from where the endothelial cells were derived? As for the immune cells, once again some LM images and quantification of percent of each of the different immune cells examined would be in order, e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to note that endothelial cells are not present in the epithelium proper – the lining of the epithelial tube. However, endothelial tubes <italic>are</italic> present in the stroma of the tissue, between the capsule of the vas deferens and the epithelium. We readily find capillaries in the stroma of the vas – although we would be happy to include these images as part of the rebuttal, we do not imagine this will be viewed as controversial. Anyway, we would not characterize this as “contamination”, any more than the presence of muscle cells – which did not seem to concern the reviewer – in the vas is contamination.</p><p>As for the immune cells, the location of the immune cell populations was shown in <bold>Figure 5A</bold> (new <bold>Figure 6A</bold>) – we tend to find more immune cells in the vas, but all four immune cell subclusters include representatives from throughout the epididymis. As for follow-up, as noted above we now present IF studies showing the presence of macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells, using F4/80 and MHC Class II for markers. For both of these cell types, we clearly see infiltrating cells far from any endothelial vessels, as seen in <bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D</bold>. This is consistent with prior staining studies which identified infiltrating macrophages in the epididymal interstitium. As far as quantitating the fractions of different immune cells in different epididymal regions, this has been done by FACS and published (Voisin et al., 2018) and we did not feel repeating this analysis by IF would much improve our single-cell RNA-Seq manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The cell:cell communication aspect shown by bioinformatics comparisons in Figure 6 is interesting. However, the speculation that basal cells and endothelial cells, and macrophages and &quot;secretory fibroblasts&quot;, in the vas express complementary sets of ligands and receptors needs to be validated by another method, e.g., immunohistochemistry, to demonstrate that these cells are co-localized. Please also define PC , DC, SI, NS.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have clarified the cell populations in this figure. Although we did a fair amount of staining of the vas to explore these cell populations, given that many of the ligand-receptor interactions involve secreted ligands that can diffuse away from the secreting cell, we do not think juxtaposition of two cells is the appropriate test of these hypotheses. We contend that future genetic studies will be needed to test the hypotheses we raise, and we state as much in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Analysis of the vas deferens is of interest as this part of the duct is rarely studied. The authors note high expression of genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Is it possible that the cells isolated from the vas include spermatozoa? The tissue samples are from 10-14 weeks mice, when males are already sexually mature. Though the single cell isolation protocol stresses the removal of sperm from tissue, it appears to rely on visual inspection of supernatant turbidity. Some other markers should be investigated to exclude the possibility of contaminating sperm.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have looked into expression of sperm markers (<italic>Prm1</italic>, etc.) in the vas deferens clusters and indeed throughout our dataset (see new <bold>Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</bold>), finding no evidence that the vas deferens cells in question are sperm. This is consistent with our expectation that microfluidic droplets are unlikely to capture cells as long as sperm (we tried to minimize sperm contamination largely to avoid clogging the 10X Genomics platform, not to avoid reading RNAs in sperm). In addition, the high expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes is found in cells that otherwise exhibit all other hallmarks of being epithelial cells (high level <italic>Spink8</italic> expression etc.), and in any case would not be expected in sperm, which have abundant mitochondria but little evidence for abundant mRNAs associated with mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) While the fluorescent images are good, they do not cover all regions of the duct, and there is no way of knowing if the images are representative. How many animals were used and how many experiments were done to ensure reproducibility?</p></disp-quote><p>We now have added a great deal more IF data, as detailed above in the introduction to the rebuttal. All staining efforts represent multiple slides from at least three different animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The Discussion is remarkably incomplete and somewhat biased. Some specific questions that are not satisfactorily addressed are:</p><p>1) To which cell type do the so-called apical cells belong? Apical cells are not discussed at all in this manuscript;</p><p>2) The discussion on immune cells is poor considering the recent publications on murine epididymal immune cells from several laboratories. Please refer to and discuss the studies focussed on epididymal immune cells, e.g., Voisin et al., 2018;</p><p>3) There is a complete lack of discussion of the major and well-known roles of epididymal sperm maturation concerning the fine balance between oxidative and anti-oxidative processes. These are just a few examples, as there are many landmark manuscripts dealing with epididymal physiology that have been ignored.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to address all of these comments in the revised manuscript (often in the relevant Results section rather than Discussion, to avoid duplicating text). That said, in our opinion it is somewhat unfair to call the Discussion “remarkably incomplete” – the point of Discussion sections is generally to cover some of the implications arising from key points of a manuscript, not to review the entire literature on the subject. Especially for a genomics paper, it is simply not feasible to list every paper that studied expression of a gene by q-RT-PCR or IF in this tissue, as one might infer to be the intention of the reviewer’s comment here.</p><p>More broadly, we do not view it as an obligation to cite and discuss every “landmark manuscript dealing with epididymal physiology” – this would require writing a textbook, not a manuscript. The purpose of this Resource paper is not to provide a comprehensive list of every paper ever published on this tissue. When we cite prior publications, the purpose is to provide sufficient proof of concept, and validation by comparison of our new data to known facts, to provide confidence in our dataset. Beyond that, our goal is to discuss features that we find interesting, with some balance between summarizing prior art and suggesting directions for future efforts.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have addressed the following items in the revised manuscript (either in the Discussion or the Results section) to better fulfill the reviewers’ wishes:</p><p>1) We have further elaborated on the relationship between our clear cell data, and particularly the Amylin-positive clear cell subset, and both narrow and apical cells. Based on the localization of our Amylin-positive clear cells (extending into the proximal corpus) as well as the presence of Amylin-negative cells with narrow cell morphology in the initial segment, we do not favor the hypothesis that Amylin is a marker for narrow or apical cells. As the other two clear cell clusters include representatives from throughout the epididymis, we therefore conclude that our dataset does not include molecular evidence of specific markers for narrow or apical cells.</p><p>2) We have modestly expanded on the balance between oxidation and reduction activities, as requested</p><p>3) We have added a paragraph noting the similarities between cellular organization in the kidney and in the epididymis, as requested in other comments</p><p>4) We have added a half paragraph describing the new analysis of cell to cell variation, as requested in other comments</p><p>5) We have explored the question of the relationship between basal cells and mononuclear phagocytes with new data, and we have attempted to better contextualize our findings regarding immune populations in the epididymis in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the speculation in the Discussion on the highly segmental expression of several large multigene families and its relative importance is &quot;epididymocentric&quot;. It could be argued that this is a feature of any tubular structure in the body and the authors are encouraged to examine (for example) the single cell data from the mouse kidney before making the assumption that this is an epididymis-specific feature.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point, as many features of the epididymis are indeed also observed in kidney tubular epithelium. As requested, we now add a Discussion paragraph comparing epididymal gene expression patterns along the tubule to gene regulation in the kidney.</p></body></sub-article></article>
