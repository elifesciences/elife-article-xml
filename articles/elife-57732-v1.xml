homeostasis and adjusted to tissue demands. Although fluid uptake by lymphatic capillaries is a critical attribute of the lymphatic vasculature, the barrier function of collecting lymphatic vessels is also important by ensuring efficient fluid drainage as well as lymph node delivery of antigens and immune cells. Here, we identified the transmembrane ligand EphrinB2 and its receptor EphB4 as critical homeostatic regulators of collecting lymphatic vessel integrity. Conditional gene deletion in mice revealed that EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling is dispensable for blood endothelial barrier function, but required for stabilization of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) junctions in different organs of juvenile and adult mice. Studies in primary human LECs further showed that basal EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling controls junctional localisation of the tight junction protein CLDN5 and junction stability via Rac1/Rho-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal contractility. EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling therefore provides a potential therapeutic target to selectively modulate lymphatic vessel permeability and function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lymph vessels are thin walled tubes that, similar to blood vessels, carry white blood cells, fluids and waste. Unlike veins and arteries, however, lymph vessels do not carry red blood cells and their main function is to remove excess fluid from tissues. The cells that line vessels in the body are called endothelial cells, and they are tightly linked together by proteins to control what goes into and comes out of the vessels. The chemical, physical and mechanical signals that control the junctions between endothelial cells are often the same in different vessel types, but their effects can vary.</p><p>The endothelial cells of both blood and lymph vessels have two interacting proteins on their membrane known as EphrinB2 and its receptor, EphB4. When these two proteins interact, the EphB4 receptor becomes activated, which leads to changes in the junctions that link endothelial cells together. Frye et al. examined the role of EphrinB2 and EphB4 in the lymphatic system of mice. When either EphrinB2 or EphB4 are genetically removed in newborn or adult mice, lymph vessels become disrupted, but no significant effect is observed on blood vessels. The reason for the different responses in blood and lymph vessels is unknown.</p><p>The results further showed that lymphatic endothelial cells need EphB4 and EphrinB2 to be constantly interacting to maintain the integrity of the lymph vessels. Further examination of human endothelial cells grown in the laboratory revealed that this constant signalling controls the internal protein scaffold that determines a cell’s shape and integrity. Changes in the internal scaffold affect the organization of the junctions that link neighboring lymphatic endothelial cells together.</p><p>The loss of signalling between EphrinB2 and EphB4 in lymph vessels reflects the increase in vessel leakage seen in response to bacterial infections and in some genetic conditions such as lymphoedema. Finding ways to control the signalling between these two proteins could help treat these conditions by developing drugs that improve endothelial cell integrity in lymph vessels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lymphatic endothelium</kwd><kwd>ephrin</kwd><kwd>cell-cell junction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2013/387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäkinen</surname><given-names>Taija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015.0030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäkinen</surname><given-names>Taija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund12"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018.0218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäkinen</surname><given-names>Taija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>542-2014-3535</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäkinen</surname><given-names>Taija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund11"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2014-CoG-646849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäkinen</surname><given-names>Taija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006542</institution-id><institution>Lymphatic Education &amp;

The barrier function of endothelial cells (ECs) varies among different organs and vessel types. The blood brain barrier (BBB), for example, is formed of a continuous layer of ECs connected by specialized tight junctions and adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, blood vessels of the kidney and small intestine are lined by fenestrated ECs to facilitate rapid exchange, uptake and secretion of fluids, solutes and molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aird, 2012</xref>). The architecture of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) junctions also differs between the different vessel types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baluk et al., 2007</xref>). Highly permeable button-like junctions of lymphatic capillaries allow uptake of fluid from the interstitium. The lymph is then drained and transported via collecting lymphatic vessels that are equipped with continuous zipper-like junctions preventing excessive leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baluk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Potente and Mäkinen, 2017</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that establish and maintain such functionally specialised junctional features of different vessel types are poorly understood.</p><p>Vascular integrity is regulated by junctional adhesion molecules, of which the adherens junction molecule vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and the tight junction molecule Claudin 5 (CLDN5) have received particular attention. Dysregulation of VE-cadherin can result in junctional disruption, increased vessel permeability and severe (lymph)edema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hägerling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, different effects of gene disruption in mice have been observed depending on the organ and the vessel type. For example, endothelial loss of VE-cadherin in adult mice results in junctional disruption and increased vascular permeability in the heart and lung, but not the skin and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frye et al., 2015</xref>). LEC-specific deletion of VE-cadherin in adult mice similarly leads to organ-specific disruption of endothelial junctions affecting the mesenteric collecting vessels but not dermal lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hägerling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike VE-cadherin expressed in all ECs, CLDN5 is absent from certain phenotypically ‘leaky’ vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benz et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, in the skin, CLDN5 is not expressed in blood vessels that are permissive to VEGF-induced vascular leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honkura et al., 2018</xref>). In line with a function in junctional stabilization, CLDN5 is critical for the establishment and maintenance of the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>). CLDN5 is however highly expressed in the phenotypically ‘permeable’ lymphatic endothelium including lymphatic capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baluk et al., 2007</xref>), where its function is not known.</p><p>The junctional adhesion molecules are intracellularly associated to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dejana et al., 2009</xref>). The molecular control of endothelial cytoskeletal dynamics presents therefore a second important leverage point that regulates vascular integrity. Quiescent endothelia are characterized by a balance of actin stabilization and myosin-based actin pulling forces that are constantly applied to endothelial junctions. Elevation of myosin-based actin contractility activates endothelial junctions. Rho GTPases are key regulators of such cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorland and Huveneers, 2017</xref>). Differential expression and function of Rho GTPase regulators, such as the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor Vav3, has been proposed to contribute to barrier diversity across different blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hilfenhaus et al., 2018</xref>). Upstream regulators of Rho GTPases may provide another level for organ- and vessel-type specific barrier regulation.</p><p>Here, we identified EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling as a critical and selective regulator of collecting lymphatic vessel integrity. Inducible EC-specific deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> or <italic>Ephb4</italic> disrupted lymphatic endothelial junctions in several organs while dermal and pulmonary blood vessel barrier function was not compromised. Studies in primary human LECs further showed that inhibition of EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling led to reduction in junctional CLDN5 while VE-cadherin was not affected. LEC-specific deletion of <italic>Cldn5</italic> in postnatal mice did not however fully recapitulate the junctional phenotype observed in <italic>Efnb2/Ephb4</italic>-deficient vessels. Interestingly, we found that basal EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling regulates junctional localisation of CLDN5 and junction stability via Rac1/Rho-mediated control of cytoskeletal contractility in primary LECs. Our results suggest that EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling provides a potential therapeutic target for intervention of diseases associated with abnormal lymphatic vessel permeability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><bold>Endothelial deletion of</bold> <italic><bold>Ephb4</bold></italic> <bold>or <italic>Efnb2</italic> disrupts cell-cell junctions selectively in lymphatic vessels of the skin</bold></title><p>EphrinB2 and EphB4 play important roles in the embryonicand early postnatal development of blood and lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerety et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mäkinen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).

Fluid uptake function of lymphatic capillaries is known as a critical attribute of the lymphatic vasculature and mediated via specialized highly permeable button-like junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baluk et al., 2007</xref>). The collecting lymphatic vessels are instead equipped with continuous zipper-like junctions, similar to those found in most blood vessels, that prevent excessive leakage and thus ensure efficient lymph transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baluk et al., 2007</xref>). Altered collecting lymphatic vessel permeability has been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, highlighting the need to understand the underlying mechanisms. For example, collecting vessel permeability is increased upon infection with <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>), which results in development of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivanov et al., 2016</xref>), increased inflammation and compromised immunity due to reduced flow of lymph and immune cell transport to the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuan et al., 2015</xref>). Excessive leakage of lymph, caused by dysfunctional lymphatic endothelial junctions in the regions of collecting vessel valves, may also contribute to primary (inherited) lymphedema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahamud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>EphrinB2 and EphB4 are critical regulators of both blood and lymphatic vessel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1999</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerety et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mäkinen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), and they show continuous expression in endothelial cells of both vessel types in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luxán et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mäkinen et al., 2005</xref>).

The different requirements of BECs and LECs for junctional stability may be related to different dependencies on cell-cell <italic>vs.</italic> cell-matrix adhesions and substrate stiffness. In contrast to arteries and veins, collecting lymphatic vessels lack an elastic lamina, have a thinner basement membrane and less mural cell support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Potente and Mäkinen, 2017</xref>). Collecting vessel LECs may thus experience a less rigid extracellular matrix (ECM), which has been associated with an increase in cell-cell coupling in favour of cell-ECM adhesions that are strengthened on stiffer matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Polio et al., 2019</xref>). Although this hypothesis would need to be tested experimentally, it is interesting to note that <italic>Efnb2</italic> is upregulated in LECs grown on soft in comparison to stiff matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frye et al., 2018</xref>). However, blood endothelial progenitors showed an increase in expression of the arterial marker EphrinB2 cultured on stiff (arterial) matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that upregulation of <italic>Efnb2</italic> on soft matrices is an LEC-specific phenomenon.</p><p>Although disruption of LEC junctions was observed in both <italic>Efnb2</italic> and <italic>Ephb4</italic> deficient vessels, the phenotype appeared stronger and developed more rapidly upon <italic>Efnb2</italic> deletion. It is possible that EphrinB2 reverse signalling plays a role and accounts for this difference. Our previous work showed that genetic deletion of the PDZ binding domain of EphrinB2 led to defects in developmental lymphatic vessel remodeling and collecting vessel maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mäkinen et al., 2005</xref>). Although this suggested a role for EphrinB2 reverse signalling, it was later shown that the PDZ mutation affects not only the ligand-mediated reverse but also dampens receptor-mediated forward signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Genetic deletion and antibody-mediated inhibition of EphB4 further established the forward signalling through the receptor as being the main Ephrin signalling pathway for collecting vessel and valve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The basal EphrinB2-dependent phosphorylation of EphB4 we observed in LECs supports, although does not prove this notion. It is also possible that the turnover of EphrinB2 and EphB4 proteins is different, such that faster depletion of EphrinB2 upon genetic deletion could explain the rapid development of a severe phenotype.</p><p>Although we did not observe blood vessel defects in the skin and lung of <italic>Efnb2</italic> or <italic>Ephb4</italic> deleted mice, a role for EphB4 in maintaining vascular integrity in the heart was recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luxán et al., 2019</xref>). Endothelial-specific deletion of <italic>Ephb4</italic> in blood vessels in adult mice resulted in a hypertrophic cardiac phenotype that was attributed to a dysfunctional caveolae-mediated recycling of focal adhesion and junctional molecules specifically in coronary capillaries but not in skeletal muscle capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luxán et al., 2019</xref>). It has been suggested that organ-specific differences exist in the susceptibility to disruption of vascular integrity due to differences in the magnitude of mechanical stress they constantly have to resist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hägerling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luxán et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore possible that junctional alterations occur at a later time-point in <italic>Efnb2/Ephb4</italic>-deficient dermal or pulmonary blood vessels and/or in context of specific pathological conditions. However, it is also interesting to note that LEC-specific deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> or <italic>Ephb4</italic> using the <italic>Prox1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice led to global disruption of junctional integrity of collecting lymphatic vessels in all tissues analysed (skin, mesentery and lymph node), suggesting a general role of this pathway in LEC junction maintenance. It would be of interest to assess the effect of disruption of collecting vessel junctions on the ability of the vessels to take up and transport fluid, but also to study the long-term functional consequences in the context of pathology such as adult-onset obesity or inflammation.</p><p>ECs are subjected to fluid shear stress (FSS) due to the friction between the ECs and the blood or lymph. FSS has been extensively described to regulate endothelial junctions and lymphatic valve morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mäkinen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), we found that loss of EphrinB2-EphB4 signalling resulted in lymphatic valve defects. This raised the possibility that altered flow patterns contribute to disruption of EC junctions on the collecting vessel wall. Interestingly, genetic inactivation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor <italic>Foxc2</italic> also results in degeneration of lymphatic valves and disruption of LEC junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). The junctional phenotype in the <italic>Foxc2</italic>-deficient vessels is however restricted to the valve sinus, where flow recirculation maintains high FOXC2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). Expression of <italic>Efnb2</italic> in all LECs of collecting vessels instead suggested a role beyond valve areas. In agreement with this, LEC-specific deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> using the <italic>Prox1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> resulted in junctional disruption in collecting vessels both upstream and downstream of the valve. In further support of a cell-autonomous function of EphrinB2 in all collecting vessel LECs, valve-specific deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> using the <italic>Cldn11-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> resulted in valve disruption but cell-cell junctions of the lymphatic vessel wall were not affected. Lymphatic capillaries also express <italic>Efnb2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazigou et al., 2011</xref>). However, we were not able to assess the potential cell-autonomous role of EphrinB2 in the formation and maintenance of button junctions in lymphatic capillaries because they were affected secondary to deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> in collecting vessels. Interestingly, LEC-specific deletion of VE-cadherin was previously shown to result in junctional defects in and fragmentation of lacteal lymphatic capillaries in the intestinal villi secondary to defects in the mesenteric collecting lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hägerling et al., 2018</xref>). These observations suggests that normal function of collecting vessels, ensuring efficient lymph flow, is critical for the maintenance of LEC junctions in lymphatic capillaries.</p><p>ECs are interconnected via VE-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions that have important roles in the development and maintenance of lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dartsch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hägerling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, however, organ-specific differences exist in the role of VE-cadherin in vessel maintenance. LEC-specific deletion of <italic>Cdh5</italic> (encoding VE-cadherin) in adult mice resulted in deterioration of mesenteric collecting vessels, while dermal lymphatic vessels were not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hägerling et al., 2018</xref>). This is different from the phenotype in both vascular beds observed upon loss of EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling, which suggests the involvement of VE-cadherin-independent mechanisms of junction disruption. The role of other molecular players was further supported by lack of effect of EphrinB2/EphB4 inhibition on VE-cadherin localisation or levels in HDLECs in vitro. Instead, we found that EphrinB2/EphB4 blockade resulted in reduction in the junctional localisation of CLDN5. Genetic deletion of <italic>Cldn5</italic> in LECs in vivo did not however fully recapitulate the phenotype observed in <italic>Efnb2/Ephb4</italic>-deficient lymphatic vessels. Although the morphology of cell junctions was altered, we could not observe a complete breakdown of the junctions as in the <italic>Efnb2/Ephb4</italic> mutants. Although our data suggest a more prominent role of CLDN5 in controlling LEC junction integrity compared to VE-cadherin, cross-talk and compensation between CLDN5 and VE-cadherin is likely to occur.</p><p>Quiescent endothelia are characterized by a balance of actin stabilization and myosin-based actin pulling forces that are constantly applied to endothelial junctions. Elevation of myosin-based actin contractility activates endothelial junctions, but abnormally increased contractility can ultimately lead to adherens junction disruption and loss of vascular integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faurobert et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with previous findings in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abéngozar et al., 2012</xref>), we found that loss of EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling in primary LECs led to an increase in actin stress fibres that was attributed to increased Rho activity. Although in vivo validation remains to be done, our findings support a concept that continuous basal activation of EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling provides a homeostatic control of Rac1/Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility to regulate LEC junction integrity. Interestingly, loss of (valve-specific) FOXC2 and FOXC1 in LECs was recently shown to result in increased actin stress fibre formation and Rho activity, suggesting similar mechanisms of junctional regulation in valve LECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Norden et al., 2020</xref>). It may therefore not be surprising that ablation of the adhesion molecule CLDN5 was not sufficient to induce a breakdown of LEC junctions in the absence of activation of the cytoskeleton. A similar concept has been suggested in established blood vessels, whereby basal Tie2 receptor signalling mediates stabilization of pulmonary endothelial junctions via the actin cytoskeleton even in the absence of VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frye et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we show that continuous basal activation of EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling provides a critical homeostatic mechanism regulating Rac1/Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility in LECs and integrity of cell junctions in collecting lymphatic vessels in vivo. Activation of the EphB4 receptor or downstream signalling components may thus provide an opportunity to overcome pathological hyperpermeability and restore basal permeability of collecting lymphatic vessels, thereby presenting a potential strategy for selective modulation of lymphatic vessel function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Efnb2<sup>flox</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grunwald et al., 2004</xref></td><td><italic>Efnb2<sup>tm4Kln</sup></italic>;

Wild type LECs of the inguinal lymph node capsule showed a more irregular junctional morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), therefore we defined three junctional categories: linear/thick/reticular, jagged and discontinuous junctions. Six images (80 µm<sup>2</sup>) per genotype were acquired from two independent experiments and each image was divided into 25 patches. Classification of each patch into the three categories was done manually. To quantify valve morphology in the <italic>Efnb2<sup>flox</sup>;Cldn11-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice, we analysed the organization and alignment of PROX1<sup>high</sup> nuclei within the valve region of Cre-targeted (GFP positive) P11 <italic>Efnb2<sup>flox</sup>;R26-mTmG;Cldn11-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mesenteries. We defined two categories: normal alignment of PROX1<sup>high</sup> nuclei and disorganized alignment of PROX1<sup>high</sup> nuclei along valve leaflets as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Classification of valves was done manually with 10–11 valves per mesentery from three littermate mice.</p><p>All other quantifications were done using Fiji ImageJ. For quantification of intercellular gaps and junctional overlap from TEM micrographs, 12–16 lymphatic vessels with 6 to 28 junctions per vessel were measured. The total number of junctions was 194 from three heterozygous control mice and 250 junctions from two <italic>Efnb2</italic> mutant mice. For quantification of central actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,F</xref>), we applied a threshold for junctional VE-cadherin staining, created a threshold-based mask and pixel intensities of the junctional actin fraction and overall actin pixel intensity was subtracted. 6–11 images (250 µm<sup>2</sup>, maximum intensity projection images with 12 z-stacks) were acquired from 2 to 3 independent experiments. For junctional CLDN5 immunostaining pixel intensity measurements, we applied a defined threshold for junctional VE-cadherin staining, created a threshold-based mask and analysed pixel intensities of CLDN5 immunostaining in the junctions. CLDN5 pixel intensities (integrated density) were detected from 6 to 7 images (250 µm<sup>2</sup>, maximum intensity projection images with 12 z-stacks) from three independent experiments. Detailed number of experiments are indicated in figure legends. Western blot signal quantifications were done using BioRad Image Lab Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistics</title><p>GraphPad Prism was used for graphic representation and statistical analysis of the data. We used 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test to compare between two means, assuming equal variance, multiple t-tests (with correction for multiple comparison using the Holm-Sidak method) to compare between multiple conditions and One-sample t-test to compare sample mean with a normalized control value = 1 or 100. Differences were considered statistically significant when p or adjusted p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ralf Adams (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Münster) for the <italic>Cdh5-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice, Marcus Fruttiger (University College London, London) for the <italic>Pdgfb-iCreER<sup>T2</sup>iresGFP</italic> mice and Rüdiger Klein (Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried) for the <italic>Efnb2<sup>flox</sup></italic> mice.

experiments to complement the in vivo data. The lymphatic vasculature exhibits heterogeneity that has been largely overlooked, but likely is important for understanding the impact of therapeutics, so the focus on collecting tubules is timely. This work uses elegant genetic tools and readouts to examine how the Ephrinb2-EphB4 signaling axis affects different types of lymphatic endothelial cell-cell junctions, and places this signaling axis upstream of Rho-Rac signaling that affects the cytoskeleton.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;EphrinB2-EphB4 signalling provides Rho-mediated homeostatic control of lymphatic endothelial cell junction integrity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Victoria L Bautch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest but additional experiments are requested before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In a study that is overall elegant and rigorous, Frye et al. report novel and interesting effects of the EphrinB2-EphB4 ligand-receptor signaling pathway in maintaining the integrity of collecting lymphatic vessel junctions. The authors had previously revealed that this pathway controls lymphatic valve formation. Here they extend these studies to show that the pathway maintains the integrity of collecting vessel junctions independently of the effects on valves. in vitro experiments complement those findings and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that are at play when EphrinB2 and EphB4 signaling is prevented. The data reveal a striking decrease in Claudin5 in endothelial junctions, due to altered cytoskeletal adaptations, but not involving the canonical endothelial adhesion receptor VE-cadherin. The manuscript covers a timely topic and is well written. Overall the experiments have been well controlled and represent interesting new findings that are of importance for the vascular biology field, since leaky collecting lymphatic vessel junctions have been implicated in inflammatory diseases and obesity, and our understanding of the regulation of these junctions is still rudimentary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Functional data for aberrant LEC junctions in vivo: The in vivo effects of manipulating <italic>Efnb2-Ephb4</italic> signaling on lymphatics relies primarily on histological analysis.

Dye uptake studies in the ear skin cannot distinguish between dye absorption (capillaries) and transport (collecting vessels) defects, but, as suggested by the reviewers, collecting vessel-specific deletion driven by the <italic>Pdgfb-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> transgene should circumvent this problem. Unexpectedly, however, we found that LEC junctions in lymphatic capillaries were also affected in the <italic>Efnb2<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Pdgfb-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). We did not study this phenotype in detail since it developed secondary to disruption of collecting vessels. Interestingly, a similar observation was made in the gut vasculature upon LEC-specific deletion of VE-cadherin that led to junctional changes in and fragmentation of lacteal lymphatic capillaries in the intestinal villa secondary to defects in the mesenteric collecting lymphatic vessels (Hagerling et al., 2018). This is now discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>We also considered assays on dissected collecting vessels as done by Prof. Michael Davis (School of Medicine, University of Missouri, US) or Dr. Joshua Scallan (Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, University of South Florida, US), which would be valuable in assessing dye leakage from the collecting vessels. At this point it would however take a significant time to organise the collaboration. To acknowledge the lack of functional assessment of dye uptake/transport, we have added the following sentence in the text:</p><p>“It would be of interest to assess the effect of disruption of collecting vessel junctions on the ability of the vessels to take up and transport fluid, but also to study the long-term functional consequences in the context of pathology such as adult-onset obesity or inflammation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Evidence that Rac1/Rho signaling is involved in vivo: The authors observe a reduction of Claudin5 expression in LEC junctions after blocking EphrinB2 function, but Claudin5 knockout did not mimic the junctional defects seen in Efnb2 or Ephb4 mutants.

We first administered <italic>Efnb2<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Prox1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> litters with a single intraperitoneal injection of 4-OHT, followed by 4 consecutive intraperitoneal injections of Y27632 at P4, P6, P8 and P10 to cover the period of 7 days during which we found junctional defects to develop. We found that under these conditions, chylothorax formation and junctional defects were not prevented in Y27632-treated P11 <italic>Efnb2<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Prox1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice. It is possible that administration at 48 h intervals is not sufficient to provide a constant level of ROCK inhibition, considering that Y27632 has a half-life of 12-16 h (Mertsch et al., 2013). However, to achieve a complete long term ROCK inhibition would not be desirable during early postnatal development as it is likely to cause dysregulation of other pathways important for organ development.</p><p>To acknowledge the limitation of our data regarding the role of Rho signaling in the <italic>Efnb2</italic> mutant phenotype in vivo, we have revised the text in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“In agreement with previous findings in HUVECs (Abengozar et al., 2012), we found that loss of EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling in primary LECs led to an increase in actin stress fibers that was attributed to increased Rho activity. Although in vivo validation remains to be done, our findings support a concept that continuous basal activation of EphrinB2/EphB4 signalling provides a homeostatic control of Rac1/Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility to regulate LEC junction integrity.”</p><p>We have also changed the wording throughout the text to ensure that findings related to the role of Rho signaling refer to in vitro experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Antibody validation and comparison: have the authors validated the specificity and/or selectivity of the B11 function blocking antibody?

How do the LECs and the junctions look like after EphrinB2 and EphB4 siRNA knock down?</p></disp-quote><p>The B11 EphrinB2 blocking antibody has been extensively characterized by our collaborator Jorge L. Martínez-Torrecuadrada (who is also co-author of the current study), and validated by others (Krusche et al., 2016; Lennon et al., 2019). Dr. Martínez-Torrecuadrada’s group has previously demonstrated that EphrinB2-mediated phosphorylation of the EPHB4 receptor is prevented by pre-incubation with the B11 blocking antibody (Abengozar et al., 2012; Kwak et al., 2016). To provide further support for the role of EphrinB2 in regulating LEC junctions, and following the reviewers’ suggestion, we additionally show that siRNA-mediated <italic>EFNB2</italic> knock-down leads to similar disruption of VE-cadherin<sup>+</sup> LEC junctions and downregulation of CLDN5 than observed after B11 treatment (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B). We also provide the data showing more pronounced junctional disruption and reduction of CLDN5 upon extended (16 h) time of B11 incubation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
