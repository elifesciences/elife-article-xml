In eukaryotes, regulation of gene induction includes changing chromatin states at target genes and recruiting the transcriptional machinery that includes transcription factors. As one of the most potent defense compounds in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, camalexin can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. Though several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been characterized, how the rapid activation of genes in this pathway upon a pathogen signal is enabled remains unknown. By combining publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping, we found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression, trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) (repression) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3K18ac) (activation), to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. Our study indicates that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin, which we name as kairostat, plays an important role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the fight against harmful fungi and bacteria, plants have an arsenal of chemicals at their disposal. For instance, species in the crucifer family – which includes mustard, cabbages and the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> – can defend themselves with camalexin, a compound produced soon after the plant receives signals from its attacker. What controls this precise timing, however, is still unclear.</p><p>For the genes that rule the production of camalexin to be ‘read’, interpreted, and ultimately converted into proteins, their DNA sequences first need to be physically accessible to the cell. This availability is controlled, in part, by adding or removing chemical groups onto histones, the spool-like structures which DNA wraps around. These precisely controlled modifications ultimately help to activate or repress a gene. Sometimes, activating and inhibiting chemical groups can be present in the same location, creating what is known as a bivalent chromatin domain.</p><p>Zhao et al. investigated whether histone modifications regulate when <italic>A. thaliana</italic> produces camalexin in response to an attack. A combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches highlighted two chemical modifications (one repressive, the other activating) which were present on the same histone, forming a previously unknown bivalent chromatin domain. Mutant plants which did not carry these modifications could not produce camalexin at the right time. Further experiments showed that under normal conditions, both histone modifications were present. However, when the plant was under attack, the level of repressive and activating modifications respectively decreased and increased, leading to gene activation.</p><p>Together, the results by Zhao et al. suggest that both histone modifications are required for camalexin genes to respond appropriately to signals from a harmful agent. A deeper understanding of this new mechanism could, in turn, allow scientists to engineer crops that are better at resisting disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bivalent chromatin</kwd><kwd>regulation of gene expression</kwd><kwd>biotic stress response</kwd><kwd>plant metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1546838 and IOS-1026003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Kangmei</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Seung Yon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U01GM110699-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Kangmei</given-names></name><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Deze</given-names></name><name><surname>Smolke</surname><given-names>Christina D</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Seung Yon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0018277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Kangmei</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Seung Yon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Carnegie Institution for Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Endowment</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Kangmei</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Seung Yon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0008769</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Seung Yon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0020366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Seung Yon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin plays an important role controlling the timely induction of genes involved in making a potent defense metabolite upon a pathogen signal in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants produce many metabolites that are essential for responding to environmental cues, the expression of which requires tight temporal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barco and Clay, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grotewold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2010</xref>). One of the most prominent defense metabolites from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is camalexin. Camalexin is an indole alkaloid derived from tryptophan and can be induced rapidly by various biotic and abiotic stimuli in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stotz et al., 2011</xref>). Essential biosynthetic enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 family, including <italic>CYP79B2/3</italic>, <italic>CYP71A12/13, and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 3 (PAD3)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schuhegger et al., 2006</xref>). The expression of these enzymatic genes can be rapidly induced by various abiotic and biotic stresses, and pathogen-derived substances such as flagellin 22 (FLG22) and oligogalacturonides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denoux et al., 2008</xref>). Previous studies revealed complex transcriptional and translational control of camalexin biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frerigmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frerigmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). At the transcriptional regulation level, transcription factors from the MYB family, including MYB34, MYB51, and MYB122, promote camalexin biosynthesis in response to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frerigmann et al., 2015</xref>). WRKY33 functions as an activator and directly binds to the promoters of camalexin biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>). Besides transcription factors, CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE (CPK)5/6 and MAPK3/6 can phosphorylate WRKY33 to enhance promoter binding and transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). At the translational level, ribosome footprinting showed that genes involved in camalexin biosynthesis, CYP79B2 and CYP79B3, also increased translational efficiency under pattern triggered immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the rich knowledge of these upstream regulators of the camalexin biosynthetic pathway, it remains unknown how the rapid induction upon a pathogen signal is enabled.</p><p>The accessibility of target gene regions to transcription factors is determined by the dynamics of chromatin states in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stricker et al., 2017</xref>). Chromatin states are controlled by epigenetic modifications that influence nucleosome accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vihervaara et al., 2018</xref>). Epigenetic modifications constitute various covalent decoration of chemical groups to histones and DNA, which are associated with promoting or repressing gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stricker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henikoff and Greally, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Venkatesh and Workman, 2015</xref>). For example, trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3), established by the polycomb repressive complex 2, is associated with repressing gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2018</xref>). H3K27me3 represses gene expression by increasing chromatin condensation and limiting the recruitment of transcription factors and other components of the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aranda et al., 2015</xref>). Trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) is marked at actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), which activates gene expression by promoting the recruitment of transcription initiation factors to promoters of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lauberth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Epigenetic marks that play opposite roles on gene expression can co-localize at the same gene regions to form bivalent chromatins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). Bivalent chromatins were initially observed to be associated with genes involved in cell differentiation in human embryonic stem cells and the most reported variant is formed by H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dattani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sachs et al., 2013</xref>). Bivalent chromatins also exist in other mammalian cell types and can be formed by other epigenetic marks, including additional activating (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K36me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K14ac, H4K18ac) and repressive (H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H4K20me3, 5Mc) marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van der Velde et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu and Kidder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charlet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsumura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roy and Sridharan, 2017</xref>). In plants, the H3K27m3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin has been observed at <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>) in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and genes associated with cold stress in potato tuber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, a novel bivalent chromatin formed by H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 was identified in <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, bivalent chromatins can be formed by different pairs of epigenetic marks.</p><p>Despite many reports on the existence of bivalent chromatins, much less is known about their biological roles. The only function that has been proposed for a bivalent chromatin is to poise the expression of developmental genes in stem cells for rapid activation into differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). This hypothesis has been tested and supported by studies only on mammalian embryonic stem cells or cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lima-Fernandes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). The ‘poise genes for transcriptional activation’ role of bivalent chromatin has not yet been tested on a whole organism. And, to our knowledge, no other role has been implicated for bivalent chromatins.</p><p>Here, by integrating epigenomic profiles with a genome-wide metabolic network in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we found that two epigenetic marks playing opposite roles on gene expression, H3K27me3 and H3K18ac, were enriched at camalexin biosynthesis and several other specialized metabolic pathways. Focusing on the camalexin biosynthesis pathway in this study, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (SeqChIP)-PCR confirmed that these two marks were co-localized in vivo and formed a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants defective in H3K27m3 and H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timely induction of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression and camalexin accumulation under FLG22 treatment. This study revealed a new type of bivalent chromatin whose function may be to determine the timely induction of defense-compound biosynthesis in response to a pathogen signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Camalexin biosynthesis pathway is one of the best characterized pathways associated with specialized metabolism in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stotz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frerigmann et al., 2016</xref>). We identified epigenetic marks enriched in the camalexin biosynthesis pathway using an omics data-driven approach by integrating 16 publicly available epigenomic profiles with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome-scale metabolic network annotation. High-resolution epigenomic profiles including histone variants, DNA methylation and histone modifications were obtained from seedlings grown under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roudier et al., 2011</xref>). To map these epigenetic marks on metabolic domains, pathways, and genes, we used genome-wide functional annotations of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schläpfer et al., 2017</xref>). Enrichment analysis at the metabolic domain level revealed distinct patterns, including specialized metabolism being enriched with both a repression mark H3K27me3 and an activation mark H3K18ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Correlation of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac marks on the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome had been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2013</xref>), which we also observed using total metabolic genes (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.36, t-test p-value 4.6E-11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine if specialized metabolic genes drove the correlation of these two marks on metabolic genes, we removed specialized metabolic genes from the total metabolic genes and reanalyzed the correlation patterns. We observed decreased correlation between H3K27me3 and H3K18ac, indicating that specialized metabolic genes substantially contributed to the correlation of these two marks on metabolic genes (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.11, t-test p-value 3.5E-02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To determine how prevalent the H3K27me3-H3K18ac association was for specialized metabolic genes, we counted the number of genes marked by both modifications. We found that 37% (324 out of 887) of specialized metabolic genes were marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K81ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then asked in which specialized metabolic pathways these two marks were significantly enriched by selecting the pathways that were annotated to specialized metabolism based on the Plant Metabolic Network database. To increase the statistical power, we only included the specialized metabolic pathways containing at least 10 genes, which resulted in 42 pathways. Among them, we found several pathways, including camalexin and glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways, to be significantly enriched with both epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To decipher the nature and function of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac dual association on controlling gene expression, we focused our investigation on the camalexin biosynthetic genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patterns of epigenetic modification across metabolism in Arabidopsis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enrichment analysis shows different epigenetic modification patterns across metabolic domains.

Plants with reduced H3K27me3 marks, <italic>clf28 and pkl-1</italic>, started to accumulate more camalexin earlier, 1 and 3 hr after FLG22 treatment, and continued to increase at later time points. On the other hand, for mutants with reduced H3K18ac marks, <italic>idm1</italic> and <italic>idm2</italic>, camalexin accumulated much later, at 6 hr after the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We examined the effect of genotype, FLG22 treatment, and duration of the treatment on camalexin accumulation using three-way ANOVA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Each of the three factors affected camalexin content significantly (p-values = 1.57E-05, 7.71E-09, 2.00E-16). However, the interaction between genotype and treatment and the three-way interaction, genotype × FLG22 × duration of treatment, were not significant (p-values = 6.20E-02 and 9.50E-01). One possibility is that the kinetics of metabolite changes might be different from transcripts since significant accumulation of camalexin was detected at later time points. Another possibility is metabolite data being noisier than gene expression data. In summary, the transcriptional kinetics analysis suggests that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin might control the timing of camalexin production in response to FLG22, which is partially corroborated with metabolite accumulation patterns.</p><p>We next asked whether FLG22 treatment changed the relative amount of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac marks on the camalexin biosynthetic genes. To address this question, we quantified the abundance of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on the camalexin biosynthetic genes with or without FLG22 treatment using ChIP-qPCR. For each gene tested, primers were designed to cover a genomic region that included 1 kb upstream and the entire transcribed region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Moreover, the abundance of H3K27me3 modification was significantly lower in the regions of these genes in response to FLG22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggest that the FLG22-induced changes of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression involve remodeling of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin. Taken together, this study demonstrates that a novel bivalent chromatin formed by H3K27me3 and H3K18ac controls the timing of induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes upon stress, with H3K18ac expediting and H3K27me3 attenuating expression to hit the presumed ‘sweet spot’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

We examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin on the induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes by combining publicly available epigenomics data with genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. In wild-type (Col-0) plants, camalexin biosynthesis genes were activated at 30 min to 1 hr of FLG22 treatment and continued to increase their expression at later time points of the treatment. This is consistent with the previous study on induction kinetics of defense pathways, including camalexin, under FLG22 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denoux et al., 2008</xref>). In mutants with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed, respectively.</p><p>Our results provide new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin may be regulated at the epigenetic level. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other known mechanisms regulating camalexin genes may also affect transcriptional kinetics and metabolite accumulation. For example, H3K27me3 affects gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aranda et al., 2015</xref>). Removing this repression mark may create a permissive environment and facilitate transcription factors, such as WRKY33, to bind to promoters of camalexin genes. At the translational level, camalexin biosynthesis genes can alter translational efficiency controlled by a highly enriched messenger RNA consensus sequence, R-motif, during pattern triggered immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Additional studies are needed to unravel how different regulatory machineries work together to enable the rapid induction of camalexin genes upon stress signals.</p><p>In this study, we attempted to reveal the biological function of bivalent chromatin, which has long been hypothesized to poise developmental genes in embryonic stem cells for rapid activation upon a cell differentiation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Only few studies directly tested this hypothesis and all of them focused on mammalian stem cells or cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lima-Fernandes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). For example, in embryonic stem cells, H3K27me3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin was associated with <italic>HoxB4</italic>, one of the key regulators controlling development. Inhibition of H3K4 methyltransferase, hSET1A, repressed the expression of <italic>HoxB4</italic> and blocked the differentiation of blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, H3K27me3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin was observed in cancer-initiating cells. Disruption of the bivalent state through inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 inhibited the self-renewal of cancer cells through de-repression of a key canonical marker of normal colonocyte differentiation, named Indian Hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lima-Fernandes et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this knowledge, the role of bivalent chromatin on regulating metabolism remains unknown. In this study, we reported the co-localization of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on camalexin biosynthesis genes and functionally examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The results suggest that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin maintains the proper timing of camalexin gene induction upon a pathogen signal.</p><p>To fully elucidate how bivalent chromatin integrates environmental cues to regulate gene expression, it would be critical to understand how bivalent chromatin is established and maintained and how different epigenetic marks function cooperatively to control gene expression. To achieve these goals, it is required to characterize all the proteins involved in establishing different epigenetic marks. Mechanisms that enable histone modification protein complexes to alter the abundance of each mark upon stress signals also remains to be elucidated. A recent study showed that NF-Y transcription factors can interact with histone modification protein REF6 to reduce H3K27me3 at the <italic>SOC1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2014</xref>). It would be interesting to examine whether transcription factors that directly bind to promoters of camalexin biosynthesis genes interact with proteins that can deposit or remove both epigenetic marks forming bivalent chromatin upon stress signals. The H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin and its role on the camalexin biosynthesis genes described here provide the molecular handle with which to open these lines of investigations in the future. With these knowledge gaps filled, kairostats can be engineered to function as a regulatory cassette to control the expression of target genes under specific tissues and conditions. This capability will provide novel routes to re-program biological processes involved in development and stress response, which have far-reaching implications in agriculture, engineering, and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Annotation of metabolic genes, pathways, and domains</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> metabolic enzymes and pathways were extracted from Plant Metabolic Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcyc.org/">http://www.plantcyc.org/</ext-link>).

To obtain sufficient chromatin for immunoprecipitation, 200 seedlings (about 2 g) were pooled for each ChIP reaction. Plant tissues were fixed with crosslinking buffer containing 1% formaldehyde for 20 min by vacuum infiltration at room temperature and quenched with glycine (final concentration 100 mM) for 5 min. After grinding, the cross-linked chromatin was isolated using ice-cold nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor) and disrupted by sonication to yield DNA fragments of 200–600 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saleh et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To examine the abundance of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac 30 min after 1 µM FLG22 treatment, ChIP-qPCR was used to quantify their abundance throughout the genomic region and 1 kb upstream of the three essential camalexin biosynthesis genes. After chromatin crosslinking and shearing, DNA/protein complexes were equally divided and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against H3K27me3 (Millipore, Cat No 07–449), H3K18ac (Abcam, Cat No ab1191), or IgG as antibody control (Millipore, Cat No 12–370) by referring the ChIP protocol established using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saleh et al., 2008</xref>). DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Cat No 28104). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 System (Roche) with the SensiFAST Sybr No-Rox mix (Bioline, Cat No BIO98020) from Bioline. Three biological replicates were used in each experiment. The ChIP experiments were performed twice with different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tissues and revealed similar results.

Chromatin crosslinking and shearing followed the protocol described above for ChIP-qPCR. For each ChIP/re-ChIP assay, 20 µg DNA/protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, Cat No 07–449) and anti-H3K18ac (Abcam, Cat No ab1191) antibodies using the Re-ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Cat No 53016). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 System (Roche) with the SensiFAST Sybr No-Rox mix (Bioline, Cat No BIO98020) from Bioline. To represent final results after two-step chromatin immunoprecipitation, the pull-down efficiency was calculated as the percent of first ChIP using the equation: 1st ChIP = 2<sup>^(Cq_2nd ChIP – Cq_1st ChIP)</sup>. Three biological replicates were used in each experiment. The SeqChIP was performed twice using different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tissues and altering the order of antibodies in two rounds of pull-down showed similar results.

FLG22, a short peptide of 22 amino acids (sequence: QRLSTGSRINSAKDDAAGLQIA), was synthesized at Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid (PAN) Facility. To induce the expression of camalexin biosynthesis genes, seedlings were sprayed with 1 µM FLG22 dissolved in deionized (DI) water. Control samples were sprayed with the same volume of DI water. FLG22 and water-treated tissues were sampled at 5 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 3 hr, and 6 hr after treatment and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>After grinding in liquid nitrogen, RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat No 74904) and 2 µg RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher, Cat No 18080051).

Primers used in this experiment are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. A housekeeping gene, Actin 2 (AT3G18780), was used as the reference gene in the qPCR experiments. Three biological replicates were used in each experiment by polling 10 seedlings per replicate.

Tissues were treated with FLG22 or DI water as described in the &quot;Transcriptional kinetics analysis&quot; section. Metabolites were extracted using a 75% methanol solution with 0.1% formic acid. For each sample, 150 mg of ground plant tissue was dissolved in 200 µL extraction solution. The extracted samples were vortexed at room temperature for 40 min and centrifuged at 32,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to pellet plant debris. The supernatant was analyzed by an Agilent 1260 Infinity Binary HPLC paired with an Agilent 6420 Triple Quadrupole LC-MS/MS, with a reversed-phase column (Agilent EclipsePlus C18, 2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm), water with 0.1% formic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B, at a constant flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and an injection volume of 10 µL. The following gradient was used for metabolite separation: 0–0.5 min, 10–50% B; 0.5–5.5 min, 50–98% B; 5.5–6 min, 98% B; 6.00–6.01 min, 98–10% B; 2 min post-time equilibration with 10% B. The LC eluent was subjected to MS for 0.01–6.01 min with the ESI source in positive mode, gas temperature at 350°C, gas flow rate at 11 L/min, and nebulizer pressure at 40 psi. To detect camalexin, we set the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) ion transition to be 201.26 → 59.2, fragmentor at 135 V, and collision energy at 40 V. The MRM ion transitions in this work were derived from product ion scan with precursor ion set at 201.26 and the most abundant product ion was chosen for MRM transition quantification. LC-MS/MS data files were analyzed using Agilent MassHunter Workstation software v.B.06.00. Metabolite content was quantified by integrating peak area under the ion count curve. The ion counts were calibrated to camalexin chemical standard (Cat Num Sigma SML1016) and converted to measurements of titer in molar concentrations (nM). Three biological replicates were used in each experiment by polling 50 seedlings per replicate. The experiments were conducted twice with different plant samples and showed similar results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Log2 fold change in the enrichment analysis to identify specialized metabolic pathways associated with both trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and H3K18ac.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69508-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Primers used to quantify the abundance of trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and H3K18ac in the genomic regions of camalexin biosynthesis genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR in wild-type and mutant plants with or without flagellin 22 (FLG22) treatment.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69508-supp2-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Primers used in the sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR experiment to examine the co-localization of trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and H3K18ac within camalexin biosynthesis genes.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69508-supp3-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Primers used to examine the expression of camalexin biosynthesis genes under flagellin 22 (FLG22) induction using qPCR.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69508-supp4-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>The effect of genotype, flagellin 22 (FLG22) treatment, and time point on the expression change of camalexin genes.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69508-supp5-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>The effect of genotype, flagellin 22 (FLG22) treatment, and time on camalexin accumulation.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69508-supp6-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69508-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available within the article and its supplementary information files.

The data show that both H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are required to determine the timing of gene expression.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present data showing that changes to H3K27me3/H3K18ac marks help regulate the main Arabidopsis phytoalexin. While the chromatin states of these specific genes have not previously been reported on directly, this form of regulation is known to occur in plants and H3K27me3 and H3K18ac have previously been shown to colocalize in a large number of genes in the Arabidopsis genome. Further, H3K27me3 marked genes are known to be targets of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and, therefore, the changes in the regulation of such genes in H3K27me3 defective mutants are as expected. The term bivalent chromatin has been misused in this manuscript to describe overlapping chromatin marks, which has led to the formation of confusing and incorrect hypotheses. In addition, concerns were raised about the pathway enrichment analysis and if this allows extension to specialized metabolism pathways in general. There is a potential for over-counting pathways when a metabolic pathway is inaccurately described by hierarchical database design. The phenomenon appears limited to fewer pathways than suggested and some statistical analysis are needed to support the broader claims. Finally, the changes to metabolite levels should be interpreted with reference to previously published data showing that post-translational mechanisms play a role in their regulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The focus of the manuscript is to investigate changes in chromatin state. The series of experiments to identify and examine changes in chromatin marks in response to flgg22 treatments investigate clearly defined hypotheses and the results are clear and accurately interpreted. Where the manuscript needs to be improved is the wider interpretation of the results in relation to changes in overall metabolite levels. The finding of bivalent chromatin and its role in gene regulation in response to biotic stress is interesting. However, the data is presented within a very narrow focus and interpretation of the findings within the wider background of literature about plant metabolic responses to pathogen infection is too limited. The manuscript would be improved by the inclusion of introductory sentences and a Discussion section focussing on how these new discoveries fit into the wider understanding of camalexin expression in response to pathogen infection. Though clearly chromatin state plays a role, it is one part of a multi-layered response that also includes changes in the rate of translation calcium-dependent phosphorylation of WRKY33 to enable to initiate transcription.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Technical suggestions.</p><p>In a number of cases, the pathway enrichment analysis gives the impression that there are a number of different pathways being linked to bivalent chromatin. However, it isn't clear if these are really different pathways or a construct of the categorization system. For example, in Figure 4B, Quercetin and Rutin biosynthesis each have two genes but Rutin is simply a Quercetin glycoside and so it is likely that these two genes are the same and this isn't two different pathways. There are other groupings like (Simple coumarins, Scopolin and phenylpropanoid; and Glucosinolate, indole glucosinolate and camalexin) where the separate genes are not really finding multiple different pathways but simply the same genes are finding different hierarchical categorizations. There is a similar complexity with at least six glucosinolate from Xmethionine treated as independent pathways as well as aliphatic glucosinolate, an overarching category encompassing these other terms. Yet these pathways are an artifact of glucosinolates involving a cyclic step that is determined by one enzyme (MAM1/2) adding a carbon and a second enzyme (CYP79F1/F2) having specificity for the chain length. Other than those two steps the rest of genes in these pathways. The complexity is that this cyclic structure can't be shown in a hierarchical construction. Thus to make the programming work they are broken into different &quot;pathways&quot;. In general this makes it unclear if the specialized pathway enrichment analysis is being driven by an actual enrichment for all of specialized metabolism or did the identified genes just happen to track with these artificial pathways that can create the impression of all specialized metabolism. The key to this is to dissect how much the enrichment is driven by the same gene driving the identification of multiple pathways.

It doesn't change the results of this work but it does lay out a more complicated view then is being proposed. For example, the PAD mutants from Jane Glazebrook were isolated based on the accumulation of camalexin. A result of this work was the fact that the regulatory mutants (e.g. PAD4, etc) were highly specific to the stimulus being applied and often did not affect camalexin regulation in response to other stimuli. There is also work showing that the camalexin pathway has post-transcriptional regulation where the transcripts can accumulate to a high level with no metabolite accumulation. Finally, the FLG22 ability to induce camalexin is age dependent and is not seen in older soil grown plants based on the MAPK studies. Thus, the upstream and downstream regulatory processes around camalexin are significantly more complicated than the intro and discussion lays out by describing a couple of TFs. It would help to expand the discussion and introduction to convey this full complexity that is present in the established literature as it is critical to place the bivalent chromatin into the full context of camalexin regulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The genes being studied are targeted by the PRC2 complex and this is why they have H3K27me3.

The series of experiments to identify and examine changes in chromatin marks in response to flgg22 treatments investigate clearly defined hypotheses and the results are clear and accurately interpreted. Where the manuscript needs to be improved is the wider interpretation of the results in relation to changes in overall metabolite levels. The finding of bivalent chromatin and its role in gene regulation in response to biotic stress is interesting. However, the data is presented within a very narrow focus and interpretation of the findings within the wider background of literature about plant metabolic responses to pathogen infection is too limited. The manuscript would be improved by the inclusion of introductory sentences and a Discussion section focussing on how these new discoveries fit into the wider understanding of camalexin expression in response to pathogen infection. Though clearly chromatin state plays a role, it is one part of a multi-layered response that also includes changes in the rate of translation calcium-dependent phosphorylation of WRKY33 to enable to initiate transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and helping us improve the manuscript by providing a more holistic context of camalexin regulation. We revised Introduction and Discussion to include current understanding of post-transcriptional regulation on camalexin pathway and interpret the results in a more holistic view. Revisions in the Introduction:</p><p>“Previous studies revealed complex transcriptional and translational control of camalexin biosynthesis genes<sup>8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</sup>.

WRKY33 functions as an activator and directly binds to the promoters of camalexin biosynthesis genes<sup>11</sup>. Besides transcription factors, CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE (CPK)5/6 and MAPK3/6 can phosphorylate WRKY33 to enhance promoter binding and transactivation<sup>10, 13</sup>. At the translational level, ribosome footprinting showed that genes involved in camalexin biosynthesis, CYP79B2 and CYP79B3, also increased translational efficiency under pattern triggered immunity<sup>14, 15</sup>.

Removing this repression mark may create a permissive environment and facilitate transcription factors, such as WRKY33, to bind to promoters of camalexin genes.

Additional studies are needed to unravel how different regulatory machineries work together to enable the rapid induction of camalexin genes upon stress signals.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Technical suggestions.</p><p>In a number of cases, the pathway enrichment analysis gives the impression that there are a number of different pathways being linked to bivalent chromatin. However, it isn't clear if these are really different pathways or a construct of the categorization system. For example, in Figure 4B, Quercetin and Rutin biosynthesis each have two genes but Rutin is simply a Quercetin glycoside and so it is likely that these two genes are the same and this isn't two different pathways. There are other groupings like (Simple coumarins, Scopolin and phenylpropanoid; and Glucosinolate, indole glucosinolate and camalexin) where the separate genes are not really finding multiple different pathways but simply the same genes are finding different hierarchical categorizations. There is a similar complexity with at least six glucosinolate from Xmethionine treated as independent pathways as well as aliphatic glucosinolate, an overarching category encompassing these other terms. Yet these pathways are an artifact of glucosinolates involving a cyclic step that is determined by one enzyme (MAM1/2) adding a carbon and a second enzyme (CYP79F1/F2) having specificity for the chain length. Other than those two steps the rest of genes in these pathways. The complexity is that this cyclic structure can't be shown in a hierarchical construction. Thus to make the programming work they are broken into different &quot;pathways&quot;. In general this makes it unclear if the specialized pathway enrichment analysis is being driven by an actual enrichment for all of specialized metabolism or did the identified genes just happen to track with these artificial pathways that can create the impression of all specialized metabolism. The key to this is to dissect how much the enrichment is driven by the same gene driving the identification of multiple pathways. Right now, it seems that this is not an enrichment with 23 independent specialized metabolism pathways but instead being driven by the issues of hierarchical programming and non-linear pathways in the original databases.</p><p>I should be clear that the above concern does not affect the specific camalexin molecular analysis, it simply suggests that the generalizations to all of specialized metabolism might be unsupported.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, we really appreciate the technical comments from reviewer #2 and believe our manuscript was improved by addressing their comments. This comment makes two points: (1) redundancy of reaction mapping to pathways in specialized metabolism and potential inflation of pathway enrichment in specialized metabolism and (2) the claim of the bivalent chromatin being generalized to specialized metabolism.</p><p>The reviewer brought up an important point regarding the gene redundancy in pathway enrichment analysis. This made us re-evaluate the pathway organization in Plant Metabolic Network databases. We are now exploring different strategies to organize pathways to address the shared reaction issue for enrichment analysis, which will require a substantial effort and we feel is out of the scope of this manuscript. Nonetheless, we feel this is an important caveat of the pathway enrichment analyses of metabolic pathway databases.</p><p>To address the comment more directly, we reported the number of metabolic genes marked by both marks by stating:</p><p>“To determine how prevalent the H3K27me3-H3K18ac association was for specialized metabolic genes, we counted the number of genes marked by both modifications. We found that 37% (324 out of 887) of specialized metabolic genes were marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K81ac (Figure 1B).”</p><p>Enrichment analyses show increased propensity for the occurrence of a phenomenon to a specific group (e.g. specialized metabolism vs total metabolism), but does not imply the occurrence to all members of the enriched group (Reimand et al., (2019) Nature Protocol). To see which additional pathways might be regulated similarly as camalexin pathway, we used RNA-seq and untargeted metabolomics to measure gene expression and metabolites change in different genotypes under FLG22 treatment. Several pathways were identified using enrichment analysis with metabolic genes showing similar gene expression patterns as camalexin genes. However, we feel that these are preliminary at best and divert attention away from the major discovery of a new type of bivalent chromatin and its potential biological role on camalexin biosynthesis pathway. Thus, we removed sections reporting these results in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some missing statistical analysis. In Figure 3A-C, there should be some statistical analysis of the transcsript data as camalexin transcripts can easily have 3-4x biological variation so simply showing the fold-change doesn't provide information about what differences are meaningful in this pathway.

To better understand the effect of genotype, FLG22 treatment, and time points on gene expression, we conducted three-way ANOVA using raw transcripts of camalexin genes. Supplementary File 5 summarized whether each variable or interactions between variables significantly contributed to the variance among groups. The results showed that genotype, treatment, time point, and their pairwise interaction significantly contributes to the expression change of camalexin genes. The three-way interaction term Genotype: Treatment: Time was significant for CYP71A13 and PAD3 but not for CYP79B2.</p><p>To better reflect the effect of genotype and treatment on camalexin gene expression, we generated boxplots for these genes and compared the difference between mock and FLG22 treated samples using two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test.

In mutant defective of H3K18ac, the significant induction of camalexin genes was detected at 1h after FLG22 treatment.</p><p>For camalexin accumulation, as the reviewer suggested, we examined the effect of genotype, FLG22 treatment, and time point on camalexin gene expression using three-way ANOVA by combining all technical and biological replicates from two independent experiments.

The interaction between genotype and treatment was marginally significant with p value 0.062. This may be because metabolite data is nosier than the gene expression data. Another possibility is that the kinetics of metabolites might be different from transcripts since the significant accumulation of metabolite was detected at fairly late time points. We added theses caveats to the Result section reporting camalexin accumulation in response to FLG22 treatment. The interaction between treatment and time is statistically significant, which indicates the effect of FLG22 on camalexin gene induction varies based on the time of treatment. The variable Trial represents the two rounds of measurements of camalexin content in each sample. The p value for Trial is larger than 0.05, which suggests the rounds of experiments detected similar results. We further analyzed the difference of camalexin content between mock and FLG22 treated samples in different genotype by running two-way ANOVA with genotype and treatment as variables followed by Dunnett’s test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think the literature provides sufficient resolution to say that only CYP79B2 is involved in camalexin as is proposed in Figure 2.

In the original submission, we discussed the observation of bivalent chromatin in the literature and its biological function discovered this study in the second paragraph of Discussion. To better highlight the knowledge gap filled in this study in understanding the function of bivalent chromatin, we rewrote this section to discuss the known knowledge on bivalent chromatin function and the main discovery of this manuscript. Here are the revised paragraphs:</p><p>“The function of bivalent chromatin has long been hypothesized to poise developmental genes in embryonic stem cells for rapid activation upon a cell differentiation signal<sup>22</sup>. Only few studies directly tested this hypothesis and all of them were focusing on stem cells or cancer cells<sup>47,48,49</sup>. For example, in embryonic stem cells, H3K27me3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin was associated with <italic>HoxB4</italic>, one of the key regulators controlling development. Inhibition of H3K4me methyltransferase, hSET1A, repressed the expression of HoxB4 and led to a block in the differentiation of blood cells<sup>47</sup>. In addition, H3K27me3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin was observed in cancer-initiating cells. Disruption of the bivalent state through inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 inhibited the self-renewal of cancer cells through de-repression of a key canonical marker of normal colonocyte differentiation, named Indian Hedgehog<sup>48</sup>. Despite this knowledge, the role of bivalent chromatin on regulating metabolism remains unknown. In this study, we reported the colocalized of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on camalexin genes and functionally examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin in Arabidopsis. The results suggest that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin maintains the proper timing of camalexin gene induction upon a pathogen signal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the general idea of bivalent chromatin and camalexin, there are some complications around this pathway that aren't being integrated into the discussion.

In mammalian embryonic stem cells and neural progenitors, H2A.Z is deposited at promoters marked by H3K4me3-H3K27me3 bivalent chromatin and at active promoters solely marked by H3K4me3, but not the chromatin solely associated with only H3K27me3 (Ku et al., (2012) Genome Biology). In mouse embryonic stem cells, H3K27me3 enrichment correlates strongly with H2A.Z based on ChIP-seq profiles, which indicates the co-localization of H2A.Z and H3K27me3 (Wang et al.

In Arabidopsis, H2A.Z and H3K27me3 have overlapping targets, such as genes associated with thalianol biosynthesis, but the co-localized has not been experimentally examined (Sequeira-Mendes et al., (2014) Plant Cell, Carter et al., (2018) Plant Cell, Nützmann et al., (2015) New Phytologist).

In one of the follow-up studies from the same group that discovered IDM1 (Nie et al., (2019) PNAS), H3K18ac was profiled genome-wide using <italic>imd1</italic> mutant in the background overexpressing SUC2. There, this dataset is also not appropriate for our study.</p><p>IDM1 is a histone acetyltransferase, which binds to DNA methylated region to initiate DNA demethylation process by recruiting SWR1 and ROS1 protein complexes (Qian et al., (2014) Molecular Cell, Nie et al., (2019) PNAS). We checked the DNA methylation pattern of camalexin genes using the methylome profiles generated by 1001 genomes project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neomorph.salk.edu/1001.aj.php">http://neomorph.salk.edu/1001.aj.php</ext-link>) and the three genes we tested in this study have DNA methylation in the gene body. This suggests that camalexin genes can be targets of IDM1.</p><p>In addition, the enzyme complex required to establish H3K18ac is not well characterized, which limits the genetic resources we can use. We revised the text to reflect the challenge and limitations to dissect the function of H3K18ac on the induction of camalexin genes: “The protein complex involved in establishing H3K18ac has not been well characterized in Arabidopsis, which limits the mutant lines that can be utilized to study the function of this epigenetic modification. The functionally characterized mutant lines associated with establishing H3K18ac are increased DNA methylation 1 and 2 (idm1 and idm2)<sup>33, 34</sup>. IDM1 is the histone acetyltransferase and IDM2 is a heat shock protein that functions in the same protein complex as IDM1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The term bivalent chromatin should be more carefully used in this study. Bivalent chromatin specifically refers to H3K4me3/H3K27me3. It should not be used to described H3K27me3/H3K18ac. There are numerous examples where bivalent chromatin is referring to the classic definition (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) to set up rationale for proposed experiments on H3K27me3/H3K18ac. This leads to incorrect hypotheses and is confusing to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer that bivalent chromatin specifically refers to H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and we cited several references that support our definition used in the manuscript: “the bivalent domains (BDs) – that are distinguished for having two histone marks that are associated with both positive and negative transcriptional events”.

(2016) Molecular Cell. To avoid any confusion, we revised the title and the manuscript to clarify that we are reporting a novel type of bivalent chromatin instead of the well-studied variant formed by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
