variable, and dependent on many factors. This has a major impact on nutrition research as it foundationally aﬀects our ability to adequately assess the actual intake of nutrients and other compounds. In spite of this, accurate data on nutrient intake are key for investigating the associations and causal relationships between intake, health, and disease risk at the service of developing evidence-based dietary guidance that enables improvements in population health. Here, we exemplify the importance of this challenge by investigating the impact of food content variability on nutrition research using three bioactives as model: ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate. Our results show that common approaches aimed at addressing the high compositional variability of even the same foods impede the accurate assessment of nutrient intake generally. This suggests that the results of many nutrition studies using food composition data are potentially unreliable and carry greater limitations than commonly appreciated, consequently resulting in dietary recommendations with signiﬁcant limitations and unreliable impact on public health. Thus, current challenges related to nutrient intake assessments need to be addressed and mitigated by the development of improved dietary assessment methods involving the use of nutritional biomarkers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Studies about the health benefits of foods or nutrients are often inconsistent. One study may find a health benefit of a particular food and may recommend that people increase their consumption of this food to reduce their disease risk. Yet another study may find the opposite. Inconsistent study results fuel confusion and frustration, and reduce trust in research.</p><p>Limitations in the studies’ designs are likely to be blamed for the inconsistent findings. For example, many studies rely on participants to self-report their food intake and on databases of the nutritional content of food. But people may not accurately report their food intake. Foods vary in their nutritional content, even between two items of the same food such as two apples. And how individuals metabolize foods can further affect the nutrients they receive.</p><p>Nutritional biomarkers are a potential alternative to measuring dietary intake of specific nutrients. Biomarkers are compounds the body produces when it metabolizes a specific nutrient.

They analyzed data from a nutrition study that involved over 18,000 participants. The experiments used computer modelling to assess study results using self-reported food intake in combination with food composition database information, or measures of three biomarkers estimating the intake of flavan-3-ols, epicatechin, and nitrates. The models showed that self-reported intake and food database information often led to inaccurate results that did not align well with biomarker measurements.</p><p>Measuring nutritional biomarkers provides a more accurate and unbiased assessment of nutritional intake. Using these measurements instead of traditional methods for measuring nutrient intake may help increase the reliability of nutrition research. Scientists must work to identify and confirm biomarkers of nutrients to facilitate this work. Using these more precise nutrient measurements in studies may result in more consistent results. It may also lead to more trustworthy recommendations for consumers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nutritional epidemiology</kwd><kwd>dietary assessment</kwd><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>flavanols</kwd><kwd>epicatechin</kwd><kwd>nitrate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007246</institution-id><institution>Mars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhnle</surname><given-names>Gunter GC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The reliance on food composition databases for the assessment of dietary intake is unreliable and results in a large bias when investigating the associations between diet and disease risk.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nutrition is a crucial factor for public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">The National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and Medicine Health, 2017</xref>). However, despite considerable methodological progress, nutrition research still relies mostly on self-reported dietary information and limited food composition data to investigate the links between health and nutrition. Indeed, food composition data is the bedrock on which nutrition research rests today: it allows us to estimate the intake of speciﬁc nutrients and other dietary compounds, and thus enables investigations into the associations between nutrient intake and health outcomes. Such data inform policymakers in the development of dietary recommendations and risk assessments, and support the development of guidance for the general public and the food industry. However, this approach is not without signiﬁcant challenges and limitations. One key challenge is the construction and maintenance of food composition data that underpin intake assessments for speciﬁc nutrients as foods are highly complex and widely variable in their chemical makeup. Multiple factors aﬀect the ultimate nutrient content of foods, including cultivar or breed, climate, growing and harvest conditions, storage, processing, and methods of culinary preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenﬁeld and Southgate, 2003</xref>). Even apples harvested at the same time from the self-same tree show more than a twofold diﬀerence in the amount of many micronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkinson and Perring, 1961</xref>). Moreover, processed foods are usually not standardised for composition but taste, texture, and consumer preferences, and thus vary in their chemical composition. Signiﬁcant eﬀorts have been made to generate extensive and detailed food composition tables, and complex sampling paradigms are used to obtain representative samples. Despite all these eﬀorts, food composition data are generally used by relying on single-point estimates, the mean food composition, de facto assuming that foods have a consistent composition. This approach introduces a considerable degree of error, bias, and uncertainty – and these are exacerbated by the limitations of self-reported dietary data which are known to carry substantial bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Subar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, current approaches also assume that intake directly correlates with the systemic presence of a given nutrient as it is through their systemic presence that many nutrients mediate much of their health-related biological eﬀects. This introduces even more complexity when assessing true nutrient intake as inter- and intra-individual aspects of absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion, processes also impacted by the gut microbiome and other potentially highly variable and individual modulators of nutrient levels in the human body, should ideally be taken into account.</p><p>While all of this is well known in the nutrition expert community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibney et al., 2020</xref>), the impact on both the interpretation of research ﬁndings and the development of dietary guidance and advice has been largely neglected, and there are only limited data exploring the impact on research outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kipnis et al., 2002</xref>). It seems to be tenable that these limitations are a key contributor to the inconsistent and often contradictory outcomes of nutrition research and dietary guidance, which have received a high level of public attention and signiﬁcant criticism in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ioannidis, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk study (n = 25,618, data available for 18,684; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Day et al., 1999</xref>) is ideally suited to investigate the impact of the variability in bioactive content on nutritional research because it has detailed dietary data based on the combination of self-reporting and food composition data, nutritional biomarkers, as well as health endpoints collected at the same time. Bioactives are food constituents that are not considered essential to human life but can aﬀect health and are therefore extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ottaviani et al., 2022</xref>). We used three dietary bioactives as model compounds, including ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) as (i) there are widely used food composition data tables used to estimate their dietary intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); (ii) there exist suitable nutritional biomarkers, which can provide accurate information on actual intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaaks et al., 1997</xref>; and (iii) there are data from dietary intervention studies that support associations between intake and health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ottaviani et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For the purpose of this investigation, we determined bioactive intakes in a single cohort using data and samples collected at the same time. We used two diﬀerent methods: the commonly deployed approach based on combing self-reported dietary intake with data from food composition tables (DD-FCT) as well as a method based on measuring nutritional biomarkers in urine samples (biomarker method). In the context of the ﬁrst approach, we also considered taking into consideration nutrient content variability data provided by current food content tables. This was achieved by not only using single-point estimates (mean values) as is common practice, but also by considering reported content ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blekkenhorst et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothwell et al., 2013</xref>), using a probabilistic-type modelling approach. While our study focuses on bioactives, it is likely that the results will also apply to nutrients and other food constituents with high variability such as minerals, where more than twofold variabilities were previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkinson and Perring, 1961</xref>), and other nutrients, including macronutrients such as fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwendel et al., 2015</xref>). The ﬁndings of our study aim to test whether current approaches most often relying on the standardised, single-point food content estimates obtained from food composition data can provide useful estimates of actual dietary intake and allow the investigation and meaningful interpretation of associations with health.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Variability in ﬂavan-3-ol, (–)-epicatechin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothwell et al., 2013</xref>), and nitrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blekkenhorst et al., 2017</xref>) content of foods commonly eaten.</title><p>Data show the range of food content (black) and mean (red).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92941-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of dietary bioactives used as model system of dietary compounds to investigate the limitation of using single-point estimates to assess intake and investigate health outcomes in nutrition research.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Dietary compound</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Dietary distribution</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Factors for variability</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Biomarker of intake</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Potential health eﬀect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Flavan-3-ols</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tea, apple, and cocoa-derived products</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cultivar, agricultural conditions, storage, and processing</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Urinary concentrations of gut microbiome-derived ﬂavan-3-ol metabolites (phenyl-γ-valerolactone metabolites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ottaviani et al., 2018a</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reduce cardiovascular events and deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sesso et al., 2022</xref>.

While the high variability in food composition is well known and recognised as a source of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">National Research Council et al., 1986</xref>), this is rarely acknowledged in such estimates and often assumed to have only a little impact due to a regression to the mean. However, there is a paucity of data investigating the actual impact of this variability on estimated intakes. We estimated the potential impact of the variability in ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate food content on estimated intakes of the respective compounds and compound classes in 18,684 participants of EPIC Norfolk for whom all relevant data were available (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> shows a comparison of estimated intakes when calculated using the DD-FCT approach with mean food content, as is current practice, as well as minimum and maximum reported food content. These results demonstrate a large uncertainty in estimating actual intake when taking the large variability in bioactive content into consideration. In comparison to the uncertainty introduced by the variability in food composition, the uncertainty associated with the use of self-reported methods of 2–25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stubbs et al., 2014</xref>) appears to be small. There is an overlap in the possible range of bioactive intake between study participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), making it diﬃcult to identify low and high consumers or to rank participants by intake (see also below). These results show that bioactive content variability signiﬁcantly contributes to the uncertainty in the estimation of dietary intake, even more than the error incurred by self-report methods that have attracted a lot of attention and discussion in nutritional research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Subar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Possible intake ranges of ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate in each individual study participant displayed from low to high possible bioactive intake level.</title><p>Range of bioactive intake was calculated using an approach similar to probabilistic modelling by sampling randomly from the distribution of possible food composition (n = 10,000 iterations).

We therefore investigated how the ranking of participants is aﬀected by the variability in bioactive content and compared the relative intake of participants with low (p25 – based on mean bioactive content), medium (p50), and high (p75) intake. Bioactive content variability was introduced in the analysis using an approach similar to probabilistic modelling by sampling randomly from the distribution of possible food composition for each food consumed by each participant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the result of 10,000 of such simulations.

However, it is not known whether this aﬀects estimated associations between intake and health endpoints. Here, we use simulations to explore how the variability in food compositions aﬀects such estimates in a ‘vibration of eﬀects’-type approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patel et al., 2015</xref>) and compare these with the results derived from biomarker-estimated intakes.

Each estimate shown is based on identical dietary data and thus represents a possible true association between bioactive intake and blood pressure, depending on the actual bioactive content. It is noticeable that we observe a Janus eﬀect with the DD-FCT method-estimated associations being in opposing positions. This is very noticeable for nitrate, where the estimated diﬀerences in blood pressure range from –1.0 (95% CI –1.6 to –0.4) mmHg between the bottom and top decile of intake, suggesting a potentially beneﬁcial, to 0.8 (0.2; 1.4) mmHg, suggesting a potentially detrimental eﬀect on health. As the actual food composition is unknown, it is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of this association or even identify the likely direction of such an association. Using the mean bioactive content, as is common practice, does not resolve this challenge. Biomarker-derived data, while not deprived of limitations but certainly not aﬀected by the factors that modulate variability in food content in the DD-FCT method, show a strong and signiﬁcant inverse association between intake and blood pressure, and this association would have been missed when relying exclusively on dietary data.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Association between estimated bioactive intake (ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate, based on the 24 hr dietary recall and food composition data [DD-FCT method]) and systolic blood pressure at baseline (estimated diﬀerence between low [p10] and high [p90] intake and p-value for Wald-test (as -log10(p)) in men [purple], women [green], and all participants [red]).</title><p>Data are based on 10,000 simulations and adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), plasma vitamin C, smoking status, physical activity, and self-reported health at baseline; additionally for menopausal status for women and sex for nitrate.

Our results, based on three bioactives, show that the variability in food composition represents a signiﬁcant factor that needs to be taken into consideration. The use of single-point estimates of food composition data represents a signiﬁcant oversimpliﬁcation that yields unreliable data as the actual intake can be considerably diﬀerent from the estimated intake. This is often exacerbated by errors that arise from imputing data into food composition tables from analyses conducted in diﬀerent countries or by changes in the formulation of foods from food manufacturers. These ﬁndings are not only important for observational studies, but also for dietary intervention studies, where such methods are often used to estimate background dietary intake and the trial designs of a given intervention. Our results show that the variability in food composition makes reliable estimates of both absolute and relative intake of bioactives challenging and potentially highly unreliable when solely relying on a combination of self-reported dietary data and food composition databases. This signiﬁcant limitation is further applied by the bias introduced through limitations of dietary assessment itself (e.g., reporting bias). Thus, any associations between intake and health outcomes derived from using many current approaches are unreliable. Indeed, for the three food constituents under investigation, we found a Janus-like eﬀect with negative and positive associations using the self-same food consumption data and food content within the reported range. This might help explain why nutritional advice given to the general public can feel inconstant, and even contradictory, at times, especially when observing the evolution of advisory statements on the same foods, food groups, or nutrients over time.</p><p>Validated nutritional biomarkers, especially recovery biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaaks et al., 1997</xref>), can provide a reliable estimate of nutrient and bioactive intake as they are based on their systemic presence and do not rely on assumptions about food composition data. In contrast to the duplicate diet method, which relies on the full analysis of all foods consumed, biomarkers provide better information to investigate the associations between intake and health biomarkers as they reﬂect not just consumption but also nutrient–nutrient interactions and bioavailability, which can aﬀect the systemic presence of many bioactives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ottaviani et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The application of biomarkers to assess nutrient intakes is not without limitations; however, these limitations can be addressed today. Doing so is often of greater technical feasibility and tenably delivers greater overall improvements than to address the limitations of current non-biomarker-based approaches, including self-report bias and the imprecisions and other limitations of today’s food composition databases. This is due to the fact that even successfully mitigating limitations related to reporting bias and food composition analyses does not address the inherent shortfalls of non-biomarker-based methods. These include the unknown impact of pre- and postprandial nutrient–nutrient interactions, inter-subject variations in absorption and metabolism, and the often unknown eﬀects of food processing, preparation, and storage on nutrient composition of foods, which can be addressed through the use of biomarkers.</p><p>An important challenge when developing biomarker-based methods for assessing intake is related to the inter-subject variance in the absorption and metabolism of a speciﬁc nutrient or bioactive. It is therefore important to establish a physiological link as well as a strong statistical association between intake and biomarker, such as has been done for the biomarkers used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ottaviani et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ottaviani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pannala et al., 2003</xref>). Biomarkers need to be evaluated using data of actual bioactive intake and should not rely on published food composition data due to the limitations described above. Except for recovery biomarkers in 24 hr urine, most biomarkers are used to provide relative intake data in order to rank participants according to intake. Our results however show that biomarker-based ranking of intake is much more reliable than the rankings based on methods relying on self-reported data and food composition databases.</p><p>High variability in food composition has been described for a range of compounds, for example, for the fatty acid composition of dairy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moate et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stergiadis et al., 2019</xref>) or vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips et al., 2018</xref>). There is also a longitudinal variation in food composition, in particular due to changes to cultivars, production practices, and distribution and processing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2004</xref>), and climate change is likely to exaggerate this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macdiarmid and Whybrow, 2019</xref>). Thus, bioactive and nutrient content variability must be taken into consideration when choosing the tools to investigate not only dietary bioactives but also micro- and macronutrients.</p><p>The methods commonly used to address measurement error in nutritional research, such as regression calibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spiegelman et al., 1997</xref>), are not suitable to address the limitations introduced by the high variabilty. These methods rely on a known relationship between reported and actual intake in a calibration study to predict the actual intake in a larger cohort. However, the composition of the food actually consumed by participants is impossible to predict as it depends on a range of factors, many of which are unknown to consumers and researchers as outlined in the introduction.</p><p>There are of course also other sources of bias and variability that aﬀect dietary assessment. We excluded those from our study as much as possible by using the self-same dietary data for all analyses using only acute intake data (24 hr dietary recall and spot urine samples) and an endpoint that is aﬀected directly by intake. This allows us to attribute our ﬁndings mainly to the variability in food composition.</p><p>In our study, we used the identical dietary data to investigate the impact of the variability in food content. This allowed us to exclude other sources of variability in dietary assessment, in particular misreporting of dietary intake. We also used measures of acute intake (24 hr dietary recalls and spot urine samples) and used a health endpoint that is directly aﬀected by intake.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Prospective studies</title><p>In our study, we focused on cross-sectional associations between bioactives and blood pressure as the acute eﬀect of these compounds is well established. It is expected that the variability in food composition aﬀects prospective analyses more than cross-sectional analyses: in addition to the variability in food content, the composition of foods changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White and Broadley, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Biomarker-predicted dietary patterns</title><p>The high variability in the content of dietary compounds in food has also implications for the development of biomarkers for individual foods or dietary patterns. A number of biomarkers have been proposed to estimate the intake of individual foods, for example, proline-betaine as biomarker of citrus fruit intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbons et al., 2017</xref>), but the content in citrus fruits is highly variable (14.3—110 mg/100 mL in various citrus fruit juice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2017</xref>), and it is thus not possible to estimate actual food intake without using foods in which the content of the dietary compound to use as a biomarker is standardised.</p><p>The same applies to metabolomics-based biomarkers of dietary patterns. They are usually developed under highly standardised conditions and reﬂect the composition of the foods consumed during these studies. Changes in the composition of these foods aﬀect the concentration of metabolites and thereby reduce the reliability of metabolite-based biomarkers of individual foods or dietary pattern. This diminishes the suitability of such markers for longitudinal or multicentre studies where a high variability in food composition is likely. These limitations do not apply to the development of biomarkers of speciﬁc bioactives or other nutrients as the variability of bioactive and nutrient content is reﬂected in the variation of biomarker levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Eﬀect on dietary recommendations and risk assessment</title><p>The ﬁndings presented in this work have a considerable impact on dietary recommendations and guidelines. Our data clearly show that the results based on the DD-FCT method are likely to be biased and unreliable. Dietary recommendation based on such data emanating from that approach are therefore also likely to be unreliable and misleading. However, the high variability in food composition also has an impact on the translation of health-based guidance values into food-based dietary recommendations. For example, the amount of ﬂavan-3-ols required to achieve a vasculoprotective eﬀect according to the EFSA health claim is 200 mg/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies, 2014</xref>). When using mean food composition data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothwell et al., 2013</xref>), this could be achieved by five cups of tea. However, when using the lowest reported food content, at least 22 cups of tea would have to be consumed to meet the recommended intake. Similarly, 5–6 apples would be suﬃcient to consume the 50 mg/day (–)-epicatechin assumed to be suﬃcient to improve vascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ellinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>) when using mean food content, but it could be up to 27 when assuming a low content in food. In this manner, it would not be possible to determine whether or not a population is already meeting dietary recommendation for ﬂavan-3-ols without the development of biomarker-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crowe-White et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>These ﬁndings also have an impact on the risk assessment of food components, in particular those that are naturally present in foods and used as additives such as nitrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mortensen et al., 2017</xref>) or phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Younes et al., 2019</xref>). Results from observational studies and intervention studies relying on food content data will be aﬀected by inaccurate assessment of intake as described above. More importantly, however, the exposure assessment will be aﬀected by the variability of data, with consequences for consumers and food producers as an overestimation of exposure could result in unnecessary restrictions in use, whereas an underestimation could put consumers at risk. For example, in EPIC Norfolk, none or only a very few study participants exceed the ADI (acceptable daily intake) of 3.7 mg/kg BW/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mortensen et al., 2017</xref>) for nitrate when estimating intake with minimum and mean food content, respectively. However, when using the maximum food content, one-third of study participants exceed the ADI for nitrate, and almost 10% exceed it twofold. Each of these scenarios would result in very diﬀerent actions by risk managers due to the diﬀerent impact on population health, and in the latter case more stringent restrictions were necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that the results of many interventional and observational nutrition studies using dietary surveys in combination with food composition data are potentially unreliable and carry greater limitations than commonly appreciated. As these studies are used to derive evidence-based dietary recommendations and disease risk assessments, their limitations could have a considerable impact on public health. We demonstrated that the results relying solely on food composition data not only failed to identify beneﬁcial associations between three bioactives and blood pressure, but even suggested possible adverse associations. It is highly likely that the ﬁndings of this nature are not limited to the model compounds that served as examples in our investigation here but broadly apply to other dietary components as well. Given the importance of diet in the maintenance of health and disease risk reduction, it is crucial to address this limitation: both by revisiting previous studies and by taking these limitations into consideration in future studies. We think it is essential to develop and use nutritional biomarkers to determine actual nutrient intakes that ensure more reliable and actionable insights. This means that the development of more and better biomarkers for accurate dietary assessment remains crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prentice, 2018</xref>). The challenges associated with developing biomarker-based approaches are not insigniﬁcant, but the technical capabilities required are broadly available today, and the advantages of deploying improved approaches to establishing the links between diet and health are so signiﬁcant, timely, and needed that it should become a standard tool in nutrition research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Between 1993 and 1997, 30,447 women and men aged between 40 and 79 years were recruited for the Norfolk cohort of the EPIC study, and 25,639 attended a health examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Day et al., 1999</xref>).

Analyses were adjusted by age (continuous; years), body mass index (BMI) (continuous, kg/m<sup>2</sup>), plasma vitamin C, smoking status (categorical; never, ever, former), physical activity (categorical; inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, active), and health at baseline (self-reported diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident). Analyses with ﬂavan-3-ol and (–)-epicatechin as independent variable were stratiﬁed by sex, and analyses for women additionally adjusted by menopausal status; analyses with nitrate as independent variable were adjusted by sex and menopausal status.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>employed by Mars, Inc, a company engaged in flavanol research and flavanol-related commercial activities</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has received an unrestricted research grant from Mars, Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-92941-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data used in this study is from the EPIC Norfolk cohort.

The authors found that using food composition data to assess dietary intake of specific bioactives and the impact consumption has on systolic blood pressure provided vastly different outcomes depending on the method used. These findings demonstrate the difficulty in elucidating the relationship between diet and health outcomes and the need for more stringent research in the development of dietary biomarkers.</p><p>The primary strength of the study is the use of a large cohort in which dietary data and the measurement of three specific bioactives and blood pressure were collected on the same day. The bioactives selected have been extensively researched for their health effects. Another strength is that the authors controlled for as many variables as possible when running the simulations to get a more accurate account of how the variability in food composition can impact research findings that associate the intake of certain food components with health outcomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92941.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ottaviani</surname><given-names>Javier I</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Mars, Inc.</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">McLean</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sagi-Kiss</surname><given-names>Virag</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Imperial College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schroeter</surname><given-names>Hagen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Mars, Inc.</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">McLean, VA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kuhnle</surname><given-names>Gunter Georg Christian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Reading</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Reading</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We would like to thank the editors and reviewers for their encouraging comments. Reviewer 1 raises an important question regarding the translation of biomarker derived data into dietary recommendations, taking the high variability in food composition into consideration. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward answer as the high variability in food composition means that the number of cups of tea for 200mg of flavan-3-ols will depend on the flavanol content of the tea. A probabilistic modelling approach, as we have used to investigate the impact of food content variability on estimated associations with health outcomes, would be a possible solution. This could provide food based recommendations that would meet a defined intake with a certain probability. However, developing and exploring such models is beyond the scope of this manuscript and we have therefore decided not to include this in our response. We have stated in the manuscript that such a method needs to be developed.</p><p>We have addressed the typographical errors and the other comments as follows:</p><p>• Line 126 - this is the first mention of DR-FCT and as such it needs to be defined. This was a typo and it was corrected throughout the manuscript. The actual abbreviation is DD-FCT and it is defined in line 78.</p><p>• Figure 4 - what exactly is this figure trying to convey to the reader? A better explanation about this figure is needed. Figure legend was updated and extent hoping to increase clarity.</p><p>• Figure 5 - Why are the graphs presented differently, meaning why are the data for the flavan-3-ols and epicatechin differentiated for men and women and not nitrate. The sample size for nitrate was too small to stratify in the same way as for flavan-3-ols.</p><p>• Line 365 - more information is needed, I am assuming the authors are stating ”The tableone package for R ...”. As requested by the reviewer, additional details are now included.</p><p>We have also revised the abstract, the conclusion and the discussion of limitations of the biomarker approach to improve readabilty of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
