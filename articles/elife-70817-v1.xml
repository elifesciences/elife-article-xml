improve rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research, the U.S. National Institutes of Health now requires the consideration of sex as a biological variable in preclinical studies. This new policy has been interpreted by some as a call to compare males and females with each other. Researchers testing for sex differences may not be trained to do so, however, increasing risk for misinterpretation of results. Using a list of recently published articles curated by Woitowich et al. (eLife, 2020; 9:e56344), we examined reports of sex differences and non-differences across nine biological disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the 147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence supporting those differences was often missing. For example, when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed, authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and males responded differently. Thus, sex-specific effects may be over-reported. In contrast, we also encountered practices that could mask sex differences, such as pooling the sexes without first testing for a difference. Our findings support the need for continuing efforts to train researchers how to test for and report sex differences in order to promote rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Biomedical research has a long history of including only men or male laboratory animals in studies. To address this disparity, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) rolled out a policy in 2016 called Sex as a Biological Variable (or SABV). The policy requires researchers funded by the NIH to include males and females in every experiment unless there is a strong justification not to, such as studies of ovarian cancer. Since then, the number of research papers including both sexes has continued to grow.</p><p>Although the NIH does not require investigators to compare males and females, many researchers have interpreted the SABV policy as a call to do so. This has led to reports of sex differences that would otherwise have been unrecognized or ignored. However, researchers may not be trained on how best to test for sex differences in their data, and if the data are not analyzed appropriately this may lead to misleading interpretations.</p><p>Here, Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney have examined the methods of 147 papers published in 2019 that included both males and females. They discovered that more than half of these studies had reported sex differences, but these claims were not always backed by statistical evidence. Indeed, in a large majority (more than 70%) of the papers describing differences in how males and females responded to a treatment, the impact of the treatment was not actually statistically compared between the sexes. This suggests that sex-specific effects may be over-reported. In contrast, Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney also encountered instances where an effect may have been masked due to data from males and females being pooled together without testing for a difference first.</p><p>These findings reveal how easy it is to draw misleading conclusions from sex-based data.

Including only one sex in preclinical studies—or not reporting sex at all—is a widespread issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sugimoto et al., 2019</xref>). In a cross-disciplinary, quantitative assessment of the 2009 biomedical literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>, found a concerning bias toward the use of males only. As awareness of this issue increased, in 2016 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a policy requiring consideration of SABV in the design, analysis, and reporting of all NIH-funded preclinical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">NIH, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clayton, 2018</xref>). By addressing the long-standing over-representation of male non-human animals and cells, the policy was intended not only to ameliorate health inequities but to improve rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clayton and Collins, 2014</xref>). Since 2016, NIH has made available a number of resources, including training modules, administrative funding supplements, and a center program focused on sex differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnegard et al., 2020</xref>). These efforts have resulted in the discovery of new sex differences across a wide spectrum of research fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnegard et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although the NIH policy does not explicitly require that males and females be compared directly with each other, the fact that more NIH-funded researchers must now study both sexes should lead to an increase in the frequency of such comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maney, 2016</xref>). For example, there should be more testing for sex-specific responses to experimental treatments. However, in a follow-up to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>, study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>, showed evidence to the contrary. Their analysis revealed that between 2011 and 2019, although the proportion of articles that included both sexes significantly increased (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Will et al., 2017</xref>), the proportion that treated sex as a variable did not. This finding contrasts sharply with expectations, given not only the NIH mandate but also numerous calls over the past decade to disaggregate all preclinical data by sex and to test for sex differences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Potluri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shansky and Murphy, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tannenbaum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Woitowich and Woodruff, 2019</xref>).</p><p>One potential barrier to SABV implementation is a lack of relevant resources; for example, not all researchers have received training in experimental design and data analysis that would allow them to test for sex differences using appropriate statistical approaches. This barrier is quite important not only because it prevents rigorous consideration of sex in the first place, but also because any less-than-rigorous test for sex differences creates risk for misinterpretation of results and dissemination of misinformation to other scientists and to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maney, 2016</xref>). In other words, simply calling for the sexes to be compared is not enough if researchers are not trained to do so; if SABV is implemented haphazardly, it has the potential to decrease, rather than increase, rigor and reproducibility.</p><p>In this study, our goal was to analyze recently published articles to determine how often sex differences are being reported and what statistical evidence is most often used to support findings of difference. To conduct this assessment, we leveraged the collection of articles originally curated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>, for their analysis of the extent to which SABV is being implemented. Their original list, which was itself generated using criteria developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>, included 720 articles published in 2019 in 34 scholarly journals within nine biological disciplines. Of those, Woitowich et al. identified 151 articles that included females and males and that analyzed data disaggregated by sex or with sex as fixed factor or covariate. Working with that list of 151 articles, we asked the following questions for each: First, was a sex difference reported? If so, what statistical approaches were used to support the claim? We focused in particular on studies with factorial designs in which the authors reported that the effect of one factor, for example treatment, depended on sex. Next, we asked whether data from males and females were kept separate throughout the article, and if they were pooled, whether the authors tested for a sex difference before pooling. Finally, we noted whether the authors used the term ‘sex’ or ‘gender’, particularly in the context of preclinical (non-human animal) studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We began with 151 articles, published in 2019, that were determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>, to have (1) included both males and females and (2) reported data by sex (disaggregated or with sex included in the statistical model). Of those, we identified four that contained data from only one sex (e.g., animals of the other sex had been used only as stimulus animals or to calculate sex ratios). After excluding those articles, our final sample size was 147. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for the sample sizes of articles from each discipline.

Sex differences were least likely to be emphasized in the title or abstract in the fields of General Biology and Neuroscience (11% each).</p><p>Although a sex difference was claimed in a majority of articles (57%), not all of these differences were supported with statistical evidence. In more than a quarter of the articles reporting a sex difference, or 24/83 articles, the sexes were never actually compared statistically. In these cases, the authors claimed that the sexes responded differentially to a treatment when the effect of treatment was not statistically compared across sex. This issue is explored in more detail under <italic>Question 2</italic>, below. Finally, we noted at least five articles in which the authors claimed that there was no sex difference, but did not appear to have tested statistically for one.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Question 2: Did the study have a factorial design with sex as a factor, and if so, did the authors test statistically whether the effect of other factors depended on sex?</title><p>For each article, we asked whether it contained a study with a factorial design in which sex was one of the factors. This design is common when researchers are interested in testing whether the sexes respond differently to a manipulation such as a drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Below, we use the term ‘treatment’ to refer to any non-sex factor in a factorial design. Such factors were not limited to treatment, however; they also included variables such as genotype, season, age, exposure to stimuli, etc. Hypothetical results of a study with such a design are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In order to draw a conclusion about whether responses to treatment differed between females and males, the effect of the treatment must be compared across sex. Although there are several ways of making such a comparison (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cumming, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gelman and Stern, 2006</xref>), it is typically done by testing for an interaction between sex and treatment. If the interaction is significant, then a claim can be made that the sexes responded differently to the treatment. Comparing the treated and control groups within each sex, in other words disaggregating the data by sex and testing for effects of treatment separately in females and males, does not test whether the sexes responded differently; that is, it does not test whether the magnitude of the response differs between females and males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gelman and Stern, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Radke et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Factorial designs and sex-specific effects.</title><p>For each article, we noted whether it contained a study with a factorial design with sex as a factor (<bold>A</bold>), for example, males and females nested inside treated and control groups.

That is, authors tested statistically for a sex difference in the responses to other factor(s) less than one-third of the time. Testing for interactions with sex varied by discipline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Authors were most likely to test for and report the results of interactions in the field of Behavioral Physiology (54% of relevant articles) and least likely in the fields of Physiology (0%) and Reproduction (0%).</p><p>Of the studies with a factorial design, 58% reported that the sexes responded differently to one or more other factors. The language used to state these conclusions often included the phrase ‘sex difference’ but could also include ‘sex-specific effect’ or that a treatment had an effect ‘in males but not females’ or vice versa. Of the 53 articles containing such conclusions, the authors presented statistics showing a significant interaction, in other words appropriate evidence that females and males responded differently, in only 16 (30%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, blue color in first column). In an additional article, the authors presented statistical evidence that the interaction was non-significant, yet claimed a sex-specific effect nonetheless. In five other articles, the authors mentioned testing for interactions but presented no results or statistics (e.g., p values) for those interactions. In the remainder of articles containing claims of sex-specific effects, the authors took one of two approaches; neither approach included testing for interactions. Instead, authors proceeded to what would normally be the post hoc tests conducted after finding a significant interaction. In 24 articles (45% of articles with claims of sex-specific effects), authors reported the effect of treatment within each sex and, reaching different conclusions for each sex (e.g., finding a p value below 0.05 in one sex but not the other), inappropriately argued that the response to treatment differed between females and males (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In seven other articles claiming a sex-specific effect (13%), the sexes were compared within treatment; for example, authors compared the treated males with the treated females, not considering the control animals. Neither approach tests whether the treatment had different effects in females and males. Thus, a substantial majority of articles containing claims of sex-specific effects (70%) did not present statistical evidence to support those claims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, red color in first column); further, in the majority of articles without such evidence (24/37), the sexes were never compared statistically at all.</p><p>The omission of tests for interactions was related to whether researchers were claiming sex differences or not. Among the articles that were missing tests for interactions and yet contained conclusions about the presence or absence of sex-specific effects (41 articles), those claims were in favor of sex differences 88% of the time, compared with only 12% claiming that the responses in females and males were similar. Of all of the articles claiming similar responses to treatment, authors tested for interactions in the majority of cases (67%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> blue color in second column).</p><p>The prevalence of reporting sex-specific effects is broken down by discipline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. The field with the lowest percentage of sex-specific effects was Behavior (18%), and that field also had the highest rate of backing up such claims with statistical evidence (71%).

In 62 (42%) of the articles, males and females were analyzed in the same statistical models, but in those cases sex was included as a fixed factor or a covariate. In most cases when sex was a covariate, authors reported the results of the effect of sex rather than simply controlling for sex.

Here, we have taken a closer look at the studies determined by those authors to have reported data by sex, that is, to have conformed to NIH guidelines on SABV. We found that in this subset of studies, authors typically also compared the sexes either statistically or by assertion (&gt;80% of cases). Thus, the authors that complied with NIH guidelines to disaggregate data usually went <italic>beyond</italic> NIH guidelines to explicitly compare the sexes with each other. This finding is consistent with a larger analysis of articles in the field of Neuroscience from 2010 to 2014; when authors disaggregated data by sex, they usually proceeded to compare the sexes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Will et al., 2017</xref>). It is important to note, however, that both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Will et al., 2017</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>, found that data were not analyzed by sex in the majority of articles that included both sexes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, our current finding that the sexes were usually compared should be interpreted in the context of the subset of articles following NIH guidelines. In the set of articles analyzed here, sex differences were claimed in a majority and were often highlighted in the title or abstract. We therefore found little evidence that researchers—at least those who comply with NIH guidelines—are uninterested in sex differences. We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that the researchers following NIH guidelines are primarily those that are interested in sex differences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Testing for interactions in a factorial design</title><p>Testing whether the sexes respond differently to a treatment requires statistical comparison between the two effects, which is typically done by testing for a sex × treatment interaction. In our analysis, however, tests for interactions were done only 29% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In the remaining 71%, the most common method for detecting differential effects of treatment was to compare qualitatively the conclusions drawn for each sex; that is, to assert that a p value below 0.05 for one sex but not the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) represents a meaningful difference between the effects. But null hypothesis significance testing does not allow for such conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cumming, 2012</xref>). This error, and the frequency with which it is made, has been covered in multiple publications; for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gelman and Stern, 2006</xref>, titled their commentary “The difference between ‘significant’ and ‘not significant’ is not itself statistically significant.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019</xref>, included the error in their ‘Top ten list of common statistical mistakes’. In an analysis of 520 articles in the field of Neuroscience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011</xref>, found that the error was committed in about half of articles containing a factorial design. The current analysis showed that, even a decade later, the frequency of this error in the field of Neuroscience has not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), at least when sex is one of the factors under consideration. The frequency of the error was high in most of the other disciplines as well, particularly Physiology and Reproduction, for which we found that authors never tested for interactions even though doing so was necessary to test their hypotheses about sex.</p><p>Statements such as the following, usually made without statistical evidence, were common: ‘The treatment increased expression of gene X in a sex-dependent manner’; ‘Our results demonstrate that deletion of gene X produces a male-specific increase in the behavior’; ‘Our findings indicate that females are more sensitive to the drug than males’. In some of these cases, the terms ‘sex-specific’, ‘sex-dependent’, or ‘sexual dimorphism’ were used in the title of the article despite a lack of statistical evidence supporting the claim. In many of these articles, some of which stated that finding a sex difference was the major goal of the study, the sexes were not statistically compared at all. Thus, a lack of statistical evidence for sex-specific effects did not prevent authors from asserting such effects. Authors failing to test for interactions were far more likely to claim sex-specific effects than not (88% vs. 12%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>); they were also more likely to do so than were authors that did test for interactions (88% vs. 63%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Statistical analysis of these data showed that, in fact, sex-specific effects were reported significantly more often when no tests for interactions were reported (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.84; p = 0.016). Together, these results suggest a bias toward finding sex differences. In the absence of evidence, differences were claimed more often than not. A bias toward finding sex differences, where there are none, could artificially inflate the importance of sex in the reporting of biological data. Given that findings of sex × treatment interactions are rare in the human clinical literature, with false positives outnumbering false negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>), and given also that sex differences are often reported in the media and used to shape education and health policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Maney, 2014</xref>), it is especially important to base conclusions from preclinical research on solid statistical evidence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pooling across sex</title><p>The set of articles we analyzed was pre-screened by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>, to include only studies in which sex was considered as a variable. Nonetheless, even in this sample, data were often pooled across sex for some of the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In a majority of these articles, authors did not test for a sex difference before pooling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, for at least some analyses represented here, the data were not disaggregated by sex, sex was not a factor in those analyses, and we do not know whether there might have been a sex difference. Even when authors did test for a sex difference before pooling, the relevant statistics were often not presented. Finding and reporting a significant sex difference did not seem to reduce the likelihood that the sexes would be pooled. Note that the original sample of 720 articles in the study by Woitowich et al. included 251 articles in which sex was either not specified or the sexes were pooled for all analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the issue is more widespread than is represented in the current study. Pooling is not consistent with the NIH mandate to disaggregate data by sex and can prevent detection of meaningful differences. We note further that effect sizes were generally not reported before pooling; in addition to p values, effect sizes would be valuable for any assessment of whether data from males and females can be pooled without masking a potentially important difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diester et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Correcting for multiple comparisons</title><p>In their article on ‘Ten statistical mistakes…,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019</xref>, list another issue that is likely to be relevant to the study of sex differences: comparing multiple dependent variables across sex without correcting for multiple comparisons. The omission of such a correction increases the risk of false positives, that is, making a type I error, which would result in over-reporting of significant effects. This risk is particularly important for researchers trying to comply with SABV, who may feel compelled to test for sex differences in every measured variable. In the current study, we found this issue to be prevalent. For example, we noted articles in which researchers measured expression of multiple genes in multiple tissues at multiple time points, resulting in a large number of comparisons across sex. In one such study, authors made 90 separate comparisons in the same set of animals and found five significant differences, which is exactly the number one would expect to find by chance. Although opinions vary about when corrections are necessary, omitting them when they are clearly needed is likely contributing to over-reporting of sex differences broadly across disciplines.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Usage of ‘sex’ and ‘gender’</title><p>We found that a large majority of studies on non-human animals used ‘sex’ to refer to the categorical variable comprising females and males. In eight articles, we noted usage of the word ‘gender’ for non-human animals. This usage appears to conflict with current recommendations regarding usage of ‘gender’, that is, gender should refer to socially constructed identities or behaviors rather than biological attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clayton and Tannenbaum, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holmes and Monks, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Woitowich and Woodruff, 2019</xref>). We did not, however, investigate the authors’ intended meaning of either term. Although definitions of ‘gender’ vary, the term might be appropriate for non-human animals under certain circumstances, such as when the influence of social interactions is a main point of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortes et al., 2019</xref>). Operational definitions, even for the term ‘sex’, are important and, in our experience conducting this study, almost never included in publications. As others have done (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duchesne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holmes and Monks, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>), we emphasize the importance of clear operational definitions while recognizing the limitations of binary categories.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>The categorization of each article into a particular discipline was defined exclusively by the journal in which it appeared, in order to be consistent with the original categorizations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>. For most disciplines, fewer than a dozen articles were in our starting sample; for Neuroscience and Reproduction, only nine. As a result, after we coded the articles, some categories contained few or no articles in a given discipline (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). The within-discipline analyses, particularly the pie charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, should therefore be interpreted with caution.

We believe our sample size, particularly in the overall analyses across disciplines, was sufficient to reveal the important trends.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>SABV has been hailed as a game-changing policy that is already bringing previously ignored sex-specific factors to light, particularly for females. In this study, we have shown that a substantial proportion of claimed sex differences, particularly sex-specific effects of experimental manipulations, are not supported by sufficient statistical evidence. Although only a minority of studies that include both sexes actually report data by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>), our findings suggest that when data <italic>are</italic> reported by sex, critical statistical analyses are often missing and the findings likely to be interpreted in misleading ways.

Our results emphasize the need for resources and training, particularly those relevant to the study designs and analyses that are commonly used to detect sex differences. Such training would benefit not only the researchers doing the work, but also the peer reviewers, journal editors, and program officers who have the power to hold researchers to a higher standard. Without better awareness of what can and cannot be concluded from separate analysis of males and females, SABV may have the undesired effect of reducing, rather than enhancing, rigor and reproducibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We conducted our analysis using journal articles from a list published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>. In their study, which was itself based on a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>, the authors selected 720 articles from 34 journals in nine biological disciplines. The disciplines were defined by Beery and Zucker and were each represented by four journals, with the exception of Reproduction, which was represented by two (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To be included, articles needed to be primary research articles not part of a special issue, describe studies conducted on mammals, and be published in English. For each journal, Woitowich et al. selected the first 20 articles meeting these criteria published in 2019 (40 articles for Reproduction). For most disciplines, all articles were published between January and April, 2019; for others, articles could have been published as late as June, August, or October for Endocrinology, Behavioral Physiology, and Behavior, respectively.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>, coded each article with respect to whether it contained data analyzed by sex, defined as either that the sexes were kept separate throughout the analysis or that sex was included as a fixed factor or covariate. Of the original 720 articles analyzed, 151 met this criterion. We began our study with this list of 151 articles. Four articles were excluded because they contained data from only one sex, with animals of the other sex used as stimulus animals or to calculate sex ratios.</p><p>Our coding strategy was collaborative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Saldana, 2021</xref>). The majority of the articles (n = 131 out of 151) were read by the first author (YGS) to ascertain the basic experimental designs in the dataset. A subset of the articles (n = 34), spanning a variety of designs, was then discussed between the authors to develop an analysis strategy. This strategy consisted of decision trees used to assign articles to hierarchical categories pertaining to each of four central questions (see below). Once the authors agreed on a set of categories that would effectively capture the variables of interest, the second author (DLM) coded all of the articles, assigning each to one category per question. During coding, articles for which the most appropriate category was not immediately obvious were discussed between the authors until agreement was reached. This process resulted in the modification of some of the categories, which improved conceptual clarity and strengthened the analysis. Once the decision tree was finalized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) and all articles were coded accordingly, the first author then independently coded three articles from each discipline to assess reliability of the method (Q1-Q4 for each of 27 articles). Interrater reliability, calculated as the number of agreements divided by the number of agreements plus disagreements, was 93%. During the subsequent discussion, the categorization was changed to that of the first author for approximately half of the discrepancies (3% of the total number of decisions); the other 3% remained the same. The final categorizations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> represent consensus between the authors after all readings and discussions.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Question 1: Was a sex difference reported?</title><p>Because we were interested in the frequency with which sex differences were found, we first identified articles in which the sexes were explicitly compared. We counted as a comparison any of the following: (1) sex was a fixed factor in a statistical model; (2) sex was included as a covariate in a statistical model <italic>and</italic> a p value for the effect of sex was reported; (3) a p value for a comparison of means between males and females was presented; (4) the article contained wording suggestive of a comparison, for example, ‘males were larger than females’. We also included articles with wording suggestive of a sex difference in response to a treatment, for example, ‘the treatment affected males <italic>but not</italic> females’ or ‘the males responded to treatment, <italic>whereas</italic> the females did not’, or ‘the treatment had a <italic>sex-specific</italic> effect’. Similarly, we included here articles with language referring to a non-difference, for example, ‘we detected no sex differences in size’ or ‘the response to treatment was similar in males and females’. Articles in which sex was included as a covariate for the purposes of controlling for sex, rather than comparing the sexes, were not coded as having compared the sexes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltz et al., 2019</xref>). When the sexes were compared but no results of those comparisons, for example, p values, were reported, that omission was noted and the article was coded accordingly. Each article in which the sexes were compared was then further coded as either reporting a sex difference or not, and if so, whether a sex difference was mentioned in the title or abstract. If mentioned in the title or abstract, the sex difference was coded as a ‘major finding’; otherwise, sex differences mentioned in the body of the paper, figures, or tables were coded as ‘minor’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Question 2: Did the article contain a study with a factorial design?</title><p>We looked for studies with a 2 × 2 factorial design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in which sex was one of the factors. Sex did not need to be explicitly identified as a fixed factor; we included here all studies comparing across levels of one factor that comprised females and males with each of those levels. In some cases that factor was a manipulation, such as a drug treatment or a gene knockout. Non-sex factors also included variables such as age, season, presentation of a stimulus, etc. For simplicity, we refer to the other factor as ‘treatment’. Any article containing at least one such study was coded as having a factorial design. The other articles were coded as containing no comparisons across sex or as containing only group comparisons across sex. The latter category included studies with sex as a covariate of interest in a model such as a multiple regression, if the authors were not making any claims about potential interactions between sex and other variables.</p><p>For studies with a factorial design, we further coded the authors’ strategy of data analysis. First, we noted whether authors tested for an interaction between sex and treatment; that is, they tested whether the effect of treatment depended on sex. We coded as 'yes' one study in which the magnitude of the differences between treated and control groups was explicitly compared across sex. For articles containing tests for interactions, we noted the outcome of that test and the interpretation. Articles containing no tests for interactions were assigned to one of several sub-categories in the following order (coded as the first category on this list for which the description was met for any analysis in the article): tested for effects of treatment within sex, tested for effects of sex within at least one level of treatment, or tested for main effects of sex only. Within each of those categories we further coded the outcome/interpretation, for example, sex difference or no sex difference. Any articles containing statements that the sexes responded differently to treatment or that the response was ‘sex-specific’ were coded as reporting a sex-specific effect. We also noted when authors reported an absence of such a result. Articles not comparing across sex at all, with statistical evidence or by assertion, were coded accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Question 3: Did the authors pool males and females?</title><p>We assigned articles to one of three categories: analyzed males and females separately throughout, included sex in the statistical model for at least some analyses (with the rest analyzed separately), or pooled for at least some analyses. The second category, included sex in the model, included articles in which AIC or similar statistic was used to choose among models that included sex, although sex may not have been in the model ultimately chosen. This category did not distinguish between analyses including sex as a fixed factor vs. a covariate; this distinction is noted where relevant in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>. Any article containing pooled data was coded as pooled, even if some analyses were conducted separately or with sex in the model.

The relevant sections of the Results and Methods have been rewritten so that this definition is more explicitly stated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>River plots should have counts/percentages included with them.</p></disp-quote><p>The counts have been added to both river plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B – Why are the percentages not out of 100%? If the remainders are &quot;Sexes not compared&quot; then that should be included as a fourth category in the plot.</p></disp-quote><p>“Sexes not compared” has been added to Figure 1B to bring the totals in each column up to 100%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 2D-F – Same concern as with 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2E (formerly 2F) already goes to 100% in both columns. Figures 2D and 2F (formerly 2E) plot the percentages of papers with a factorial design and the percentages making claims of a sex-specific-effect, respectively. The latter two categories are then broken down into whether the authors tested for or reported an interaction, which can be done only for the articles that are actually in the graph. It would not be appropriate, for example, to test for an interaction when the design is not factorial, so those papers do not appear in Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The difference between Figures 2D and 2E is not well explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the figure caption what is shown in each panel. We have also swapped the order of Figures 2E and 2F, since 2D was more closely related to what is now 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;We found that a large majority of studies on non-human animals used &quot;sex&quot; to refer to the categorical variable comprising females and males (Figure 4).&quot; Are the counts in Figure 4 for the subset of non-human studies? The description in the Results section and figure caption do not mention that earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>The counts in Figure 4 pertain to all 151 of the papers in the study, not just the non-human ones. This has been clarified in the caption. The reference to Figure 4 has been deleted in the sentence the reviewer is referring to – we thank the reviewer for pointing out that the figure did not contain information relevant to the point being made there. We have added to the Results the proportion of articles on non-humans that used “sex”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;…we have shown that a substantial proportion of claimed sex differences, particularly sex-specific effects of experimental manipulations, are not supported by statistical evidence.&quot; This refers to my earlier comment. Ironically given the subject matter, I don't feel like a single proportion was given to this characterization of articles.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is asking for two different statistics. First, they pointed out above that we “did not report overall percentages of articles that &quot;did it right&quot; (e.g., the original authors appropriately reported on and correctly interpreted the results of an interaction).” This statistic, in other words the proportion of articles that did it right, was originally reported in the first paragraph about Question 2 in the Results. A sentence has been added to reiterate and clarify this statement. The same point was also in the Discussion, although there we gave only the percentage that did it “wrong”. The number that did it right (% wrong subtracted from 1) is now also included there.</p><p>Second, the reviewer wants to know, out of the studies that claimed sex-specific effects, what proportion actually showed statistical evidence for such effects. This statistic was given in Figure 2F (now Figure 2E), the first column, which shows that ~30% of the articles reporting sex-specific effects tested for such. The statistic was also given in the text, under Question 2. References to the relevant figure have been added to these sentences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Please describe the methods used to classify the articles by discipline. If this method was not objective, consider discussing that as a limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Articles were categorized according to the journal in which they appeared. We followed the categorization used by Beery et al., (2011) and Woitowich et al., (2020) for the sake of consistency with those studies. This has been clarified in Table 1 and in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The studies were coded only by one author (author 2) and this may compromise the validity of the findings. To mitigate this limitation, a second coder could rate all the studies (or at least a random sample of the studies) using the same criteria and the inter-rater reliability could be presented. If this is not possible, the impact of this major limitation on the conclusions needs to be discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above in our response to R1, we have expanded our description in the Methods of how coding was handled among the two reviewers and how we are confident in each decision. We have calculated interrater reliability as greater than 90%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please consider revising the following statements:</p><p>a. &quot;our finding could indicate that researchers interested in sex differences are primarily the ones following NIH guidelines.&quot; – this statement is not supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that in the subset of studies in which data were disaggregated, in other words</p><p>NIH guidelines were followed, the sexes were usually also compared. There are two</p><p>possible explanations for this finding – first, researchers who follow NIH guidelines went a step beyond to compare the sexes; second, that researchers interested in sex</p><p>differences are primarily the ones following the guidelines. These are slightly different</p><p>conclusions and our data do not distinguish between them. We have rephrased this</p><p>statement so that we do not claim that our data led us to any particular conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. &quot;The prevalence of this issue is difficult to estimate because opinions vary about when corrections are necessary&quot; (regarding correcting for multiple comparisons) – the prevalence of the problem could be objectively estimated irrespective of one's opinion about the need to adjust to conserve FWER.</p></disp-quote><p>Any estimation of the prevalence of an error requires a clear definition of the error. Without such a definition, it is not possible to categorize articles as having committed vs. not committed the error. In this case, the conditions under which corrections are necessary, and the type of correction that is needed, are extremely variable. For example, some researchers argue that a correction is necessary even when sex is included in an omnibus test; others argue that the omnibus test itself obviates the need for corrections. Some researchers argue that corrections are necessary when multiple tests are done in the same set of animals, others insist that the correction must be applied to all experiments in the same manuscript even when separate samples are analyzed. Some point out that in order to implement a correction logically and consistently it must be applied over all studies for a PI’s entire career, so it is therefore overkill in all cases and should never be done. As we do not wish to claim authority regarding what is acceptable or not in this particular area, we decided not to categorize articles according to whether they corrected for multiple comparisons in an acceptable way. Instead, we mention in the Discussion a few extreme cases in order to call attention to the issue. The sentence the reviewer referred to has been omitted in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. &quot;This study was underpowered for examining these issues within any particular discipline&quot; – since statistical tests were not performed, it is best to avoid the term &quot;underpowered&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please consider presenting the proportions and / or percentages in the river plots. This will substantially facilitate comprehension of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The counts have been added to both river plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please consider reporting the reference of each article in Table S2 to enhance transparency and reproducibility. It is not possible to track most of the reviewed articles using the information presented in the manuscript or the supplementary material.</p></disp-quote><p>A column has been added to the table for the title of the article, to follow the precedent set by Woitowich et al. (2020).</p></body></sub-article></article>
