virus (PRRSV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are two highly infectious and lethal viruses causing major economic losses to pig production. Here, we report generation of double-gene-knockout (DKO) pigs harboring edited knockout alleles for known receptor proteins CD163 and pAPN and show that DKO pigs are completely resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV and TGEV. We found no differences in meat-production or reproductive-performance traits between wild-type and DKO pigs, but detected increased iron in DKO muscle. Additional infection challenge experiments showed that DKO pigs exhibited decreased susceptibility to porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), thus offering unprecedented in vivo evidence of pAPN as one of PDCoV receptors. Beyond showing that multiple gene edits can be combined in a livestock animal to achieve simultaneous resistance to two major viruses, our study introduces a valuable model for investigating infection mechanisms of porcine pathogenic viruses that exploit pAPN or CD163 for entry.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pig epidemics are the biggest threat to the pork industry. In 2019 alone, hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide were lost due to various pig diseases, many of them caused by viruses. The porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRS virus for short), for instance, leads to reproductive disorders such as stillbirths and premature labor. Two coronaviruses – the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (or TGEV) and the porcine delta coronavirus – cause deadly diarrhea and could potentially cross over into humans. Unfortunately, there are still no safe and effective methods to prevent or control these pig illnesses, but growing disease-resistant pigs could reduce both financial and animal losses.</p><p>Traditionally, breeding pigs to have a particular trait is a slow process that can take many years. But with gene editing technology, it is possible to change or remove specific genes in a single generation of animals. When viruses infect a host, they use certain proteins on the surface of the host’s cells to find their inside: the PRRS virus relies a protein called CD163, and TGEV uses pAPN.</p><p>Xu, Zhou, Mu et al. used gene editing technology to delete the genes that encode the CD163 and pAPN proteins in pigs. When the animals were infected with PRRS virus or TGEV, the non-edited pigs got sick but the gene-edited animals remained healthy. Unexpectedly, pigs without CD163 and pAPN also coped better with porcine delta coronavirus infections, suggesting that CD163 and pAPN may also help this coronavirus infect cells. Finally, the gene-edited pigs reproduced and produced meat as well as the control pigs.</p><p>These experiments show that gene editing can be a powerful technology for producing animals with desirable traits. The gene-edited pigs also provide new knowledge about how porcine viruses infect pigs, and may offer a starting point to breed disease-resistant animals on a larger scale.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>PRRSV</kwd><kwd>TGEV</kwd><kwd>PDCoV</kwd><kwd>pig</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Transgenic Breeding Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016ZX08010-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Yulian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005196</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Major Scientific Research Tasks for Scientific and Technological Innovation Project CAAS-ZDRW202006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Yulian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shandong Landsee Genetics Co., Ltd.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kh17134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Kui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U1704231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Liurong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012156</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Key Technology Projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JSGG20180507182028625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shang</surname><given-names>Haitao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Transgenic Breeding Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016ZX08006-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Kui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31490602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Shaobo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The double-gene-knockout pig is a valuable model to help understand the mechanisms of CD163 and pAPN in the infection of multiple viruses and offers excellent breeding materials for disease-resistant pigs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a highly infectious viral disease characterized by reproductive disorders including premature birth, late abortion, stillbirth, weak and mummy fetuses, and respiratory dysfunction in piglets and in growing pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wensvoort et al., 1991</xref>). Since its discovery in the United States in 1987, PRRS has rapidly spread worldwide, with frequent outbreaks causing large economic losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holtkamp et al., 2013</xref>). Three surface receptors on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) have been shown to function in PRRSV invasion in vivo: heparin sulphate (HS), sialoadhesin (Sn), and CD163 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calvert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crocker and Gordon, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jusa et al., 1997</xref>). Multiple studies have reported that CD163 is an essential receptor for PRRSV infection, with scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) serving as the core domain for virus recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calvert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Van Gorp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patton et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Gene editing technology has been emerging as an important approach of livestock animal and plant germplasm improvement. The technology makes possible for precise modification of more than one gene simultaneously, which is particularly desirable for obtaining important economic traits that are controlled by multiple genes. In 2016, Prather's group was the first to use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate SRCR5 domain-targeted <italic>CD163</italic> knockout pigs. They demonstrated that a <italic>CD163</italic> knockout line was completely resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Whitworth et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, several laboratories have generated anti-PRRSV pigs targeting <italic>CD163</italic>. For example, the <italic>CD163</italic> SRCR5 domain was replaced with human <italic>CD163</italic>-Like SRCR8 domain to generate PRRSV genotype 1 resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2018</xref> reported homozygous gene-edited Large White pigs with a 50 bp deletion in exon 7 of the <italic>CD163</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2018</xref>) that are fully resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV. There are also examples of deletion of the SRCR5 domain seeking resistance to both PRRSV genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkard et al., 2017</xref>), or introducing a premature termination in the <italic>CD163</italic> SRCR5 domain to generate HP-PRRSV (highly pathogenic PRRSV)-resistant Duroc pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Deleting the SRCR5 LBP region has also been reported to generate a PRRSV genotype 2 resistant pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). All these studies demonstrate that PRRSV-resistant pig breeds can be generated by editing the <italic>CD163</italic> gene, enabling alleviation of the severity of PRRSV.</p><p>In addition to PRRSV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an acute high-contact infectious virus, is known to frequently occur to co-infect with other porcine diarrhea-associated viruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine rotavirus (PoRV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). TGEV is globally distributed and causes tremendous economic losses in pork production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017</xref>). Characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and dehydration, the mortality rate of TGEV-infected piglets under the age of 14 days approaches 100%. TGEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA coronavirus which targets pig intestinal epithelium for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brierley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wesley and Lager, 2003</xref>). Studies have shown that the pAPN protein acts as a receptor in mediating TGEV infection. The viral glycoproteins bind to pAPN receptors on the surface of small intestinal epithelial cells and mediate membrane fusion, thus resulting in the virus entering into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delmas et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al., 1998</xref>). Inhibition or direct knockout of <italic>pAPN</italic> in small intestinal epithelial cells can mitigate TGEV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pigs are resistant to TGEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Whitworth et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>PDCoV is a highly virulent porcine coronavirus discovered in 2012 that causes watery diarrhea and vomiting in sows and piglets, with piglet mortality rates of 30% to 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woo et al., 2012</xref>). There is controversy about whether or not pAPN is a functional receptor for PDCoV. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2018</xref> showed that pAPN functions as a receptor to promote PDCoV entry into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2018</xref> confirmed its involvement but showed that pAPN was an unnecessary important functional receptor for PDCoV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2018</xref> suggested that PDCoV infection may require a co-receptor, in addition to pAPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Using cells isolated from <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pigs, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stoian et al., 2020</xref> showed that these pig cells were still susceptible to PDCoV infection in vitro. It was suggested that pAPN may be one of the receptors for PDCoV, and an unknown receptor or factor may compensate for pAPN function in the absence of pAPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stoian et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pigs may be resistant to PDCoV infection in vivo remains unknown.</p><p>Although gene-edited <italic>CD163</italic> knockout (PRRV resistant) pigs and <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout (TGEV resistant) pigs have been previously generated, respectively, pigs that are resistant to the infection of both viruses are lacking. Our objectives in the present study were (1) to knockout <italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>pAPN</italic> simultaneously using a gene editing approach; (2) to verify if the resultant DKO pigs are simultaneously resistant to infection by PRRSV and TGEV; (3) to use the DKO pigs as an in vivo experimental model to test for potential pAPN-mediated resistance to PDCoV infection. We report successfully generated gene-edited Large White pigs with both <italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>pAPN</italic> gene knockouts using CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Through viral challenge experiments, we found that these DKO pigs exhibit complete resistance to genotype 2 PRRSV and TGEV, and exhibit decreased susceptibility to PDCoV infection. In addition, with the exception of meat color score and iron content, no differences in the production performance, reproductive performance, or pork nutrient content were observed between DKO pigs and WT pigs. Thus, in addition to demonstrating that our DKO pigs are robustly resistant to both PRRSV and TGEV without suffering deleterious effects for production performance, our study also provides insights into ongoing controversy about the pAPN protein as a potential receptor for PDCoV infection of pigs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>pAPN</italic> DKO cloned pigs</title><p>In order to generate <italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>pAPN</italic> DKO cloned pigs, we constructed sgRNA delivery plasmids targeting these genes, and selected successful DKO pig fetal fibroblasts (PEFs) as nuclear transfer donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of <italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>pAPN</italic> DKO pigs by CRISPR/Cas9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the generation process for DKO cloned pigs.

Since the CD163 protein is known to play a role in the degradation of haemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp), and considering that Fe is an important component of haemoglobin, we reasoned that the increased meat color score (redness) may be due to the decreased Hb metabolism as a consequence of <italic>CD163</italic> knockout, and subsequently mild accumulation of Fe containing Hb in the meat.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>DKO pigs maintain normal production performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Carcass photo of DKO and WT pigs.

Our study is the first report on how multiple gene edits can be combined in livestock animal to offer simultaneous resistance to two major viral infection. Similar to the previous reports above, double knockout efficiency using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated dual gene editing method without any drug or flow cytometry screening was high in our study, reaching 6.30% (17 DKO cell colonies out of 270 cell colonies). In this experiment, we quickly generated a large number of DKO pigs by re-cloning. We found that the re-cloning efficiency (0.9%, 20/2270) was much higher than the primary cloning efficiency (0.2%, 8/3780). A possible reason for this elevated efficiency could be that the monoclonal cells used for the primary cloning must be cultured in vitro for a long time, which has been reported to inhibit cloning efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magnani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mastromonaco et al., 2006</xref>). The donor cells used in re-cloning were ear-derived fibroblasts isolated directly from DKO pigs, eliminating the requirement for a long-term, in vitro screening process. Our findings support the notion that the efficiency of this approach is not gene specific, and may be applicable to the knockout of other genes that allow improving disease resistance or animal production.</p><p>In 2007, Calvert et al. first discovered that CD163 functions as a PRRSV receptor protein during PAMs infection, which has since been confirmed by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calvert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Gorp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patton et al., 2009</xref>).

In recent years, several groups have successfully generated PRRSV-resistant gene-edited pigs by targeting exon 7 of the pig <italic>CD163</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Whitworth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we used a single sgRNA targeting exon 7 of <italic>CD163</italic>, generated an 8 bp double-stranded deletion that terminated protein translation near the target site. Our finding on the complete resistance to PRRSV genotype 2 in our knockout line is consistent with those previous reports.</p><p>CD163 is known to play a role in promoting the clearance of plasma free haemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kristiansen et al., 2001</xref>). Our finding that the DKO pigs have higher meat Fe content and have elevated serum Hp levels is consistent with this idea, and may explain the observed darker red color in our DKO meat. Interestingly, and consistent to our finding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wells et al., 2017</xref> also reported that the serum Hp levels are elevated in <italic>CD163</italic> knockout pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the slight color score increase, no abnormal growth or reproductive performance was observed in our DKO pigs, and the meat color of both DKO pigs and WT pigs were within the normal range. Production performance evaluations and identification of pork nutritional components showed that our DKO pigs were indistinguishable from that of the WT pigs in growth rate and reproductive performances, except for the meat color score and iron content. However, the number of DKO pigs tested by us is still small, and the production performance of DKO pigs still needs to be verified in large populations in the future.</p><p>APN is known to be a receptor for many coronaviruses, and studies have shown that separate domains function in virus recognition vs. hydrolase catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reguera et al., 2012</xref>). Two research groups have recently demonstrated that <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pigs block TGEV but not PEDV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Whitworth et al., 2019</xref>). Our data showing that <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout can completely prevent TGEV virus infection are consistent with these recently published findings. In addition to TGEV and PRRSV, we also determined if <italic>pAPN</italic> deletion conferred protection against PDCoV. APN is a receptor for multiple coronaviruses and is abundantly expressed on small intestinal epithelial cells, which has led to the speculation that pAPN may also be a receptor for PDCoV. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2018</xref> proposed that pAPN functions as a receptor in mediating PDCoV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). However, another study found that knockout of <italic>pAPN</italic> in IPI-2I cells inhibited but did not completely block PDCoV infection, suggesting that pAPN was not essential for viral recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that pAPN may be involved in PDCoV infection, but PDCoV may also be able to enter cell through other pathway(s).</p><p>Our results on the delayed PDCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies production, and a reduced extent of gross and histopathological lesions on small intestine in DKO pigs compared to WT pigs are consistent with this previous suggestion that pAPN may play a role but is not the only path for PDCoV cell entry. Interestingly, a recent study showed that PAMs, but not lung fibroblast-like cells, from <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pigs showed resistance to PDCoV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stoian et al., 2020</xref>), a finding consistent with our in vitro experiments showing that DKO PAMs exhibit decreased susceptibility to PDCoV infection. In addition, <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pigs are susceptible to PDCoV when virus levels were detected using qRT-PCR, and virus neutralization activity was measured, although the extent of tissue lesions between the KO and WT groups was not compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stoian et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings are in line with this study reporting that <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pigs are still susceptible to PDCoV. However, as reflected by the delay in neutralizing antibody response, and much lighter intestine damage in the DKO pigs, the susceptibility of the <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout group to the virus is reduced compared that of the WT pigs, indicating the potential role of pAPN in mediating PDCoV infection. Additionally, the effect of <italic>CD163</italic> knockout in the delayed adaptive immune response cannot be ignored. Despite the important role of CD163 in innate immunity, an inhibiting effect of soluble CD163 on the adaptive immune system has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frings et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Connell et al., 2017</xref>). It is thus possible that the delayed adaptive immune response we observed in PDCoV-infected DKO pigs may be associated with <italic>CD163</italic> knockout-induced immunosuppression.</p><p>In summary, the DKO pigs generated in this study are simultaneously resistant to PRRSV and TEGV, and exhibit decreased susceptibility to PDCoV, while maintaining the same growth and reproductive production traits when compared to WT animals.

When the cells grew to 80% confluence, approximately 10<sup>6</sup> cells were transfected with pX330-<italic>CD163</italic> (2.5 ug) and pX330-<italic>pAPN</italic> (2.5 ug) plasmids. A Lonza 2B nuclear transfection system was used for transfection with Nucleofector program T-016. The entire transfection process was performed according to the kit instructions (Lonza, VPI-1002). Cells were cultured for 48 hr after transfection and then seeded into 10 cm dishes at a density of 150 cells/dish. The culture medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were cultured for 10 days to form single-cell colonies. Single-cell colonies were transferred to 48-well plates for expansion culture. When cells in the 48-well plates reached confluence, 1/3 of the cells were taken for genotype identification, and the remaining cells continued to expand.

Whole cell lysates of PRRSV-infected PAMs and PDCoV-infected PAMs were used to quantify the expression levels of PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein and PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein, respectively. The protein samples were separated by 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk for 2 hr, and then incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight and secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 hr. Chemiluminescent signals were developed with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluninescent Substrate (Thermos Scientific) and captured with a Tanon-520 (Tanon). CD163 rabbit polyclonal antibody (16646–1-AP; Proteintech) was used to detect porcine CD163. APN polyclonal antibody (A5662; ABclonal) was used to detect pAPN, anti-PRRSV-N antibody (made in our laboratory) was used to detect PRRSV-N protein, anti-PDCoV-N antibody (made in our laboratory) was used to detect PDCoV-N protein, GAPDH rabbit antibody (3683; Cell Signaling) or β-actin rabbit antibody (AC026; Abclonal Technology) was used to stain GAPDH or β-actin as a loading control.

The four DKO and six WT pigs used for PRRSV WUH3 viral challenge were both about 45 days old. Viral inoculation was conducted by nasal intubation drip (2 mL: 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) and intramuscular injection (2 mL: 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL). During the 14 days of PRRSV challenge, piglet rectal temperature and clinical symptoms data (feeding, breathing, defecation, mental state) were collected every morning. At the same time, piglet survival rate was recorded, blood was collected, and the piglets were weighed regularly. If any pigs died during the course of the PRRSV challenge, pictures were immediately taken and samples were collected. All surviving pigs were slaughtered at 14 days post-infection (dpi) and lung tissue was examined for disease symptoms.</p><p>Four DKO pigs and six WT pigs were used for TGEV challenge. Pigs were inoculated with a total of 10 mL of TGEV strain WH-1 (GenBank accession number HQ462571) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2014</xref>) (7 × 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) that were orally administered to each pig in two doses (day 0 and day 1, 5 mL/day). For the PDCoV challenge, two DKO pigs and four WT pigs were orally administered a total of 16 mL of PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 (2.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) divided into two doses delivered on day 0 and day 1 (8 mL/day). For both the TGEV and PDCoV groups, the rectal temperature of the pigs was measured daily for the full 14 day experiment and the diarrhea of the piglets was observed. Blood was collected and the piglets were weighed regularly. In the TGEV group, a DKO pig and a WT pig were slaughtered on day 3, and the remaining pigs in the TGEV group and all pigs in the PDCoV group were slaughtered at 14 dpi. After slaughter, the pigs were dissected to observe the gross lesions in small intestine tissue, to collect small intestine tissue samples, and to detect any pathological changes by H and E staining. Meanwhile, during these 14 days, 4 WT pigs and 2 DKO pigs were reared under the same conditions without any virus infection, and these pigs were used as the Mock group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title><p>Lung tissues of pigs in the PRRSV challenge group, and duodenum, jejunum, and ileum tissues in the TGEV and PDCoV groups were collected. The tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde fixative, dehydrated, embedded, and cut into 3 ~ 8 μm-thick sections. For histopathology, the sections were stained by H and E. For IHC, tissue sections were stained with antibodies specific to the corresponding protein antigens. Tissue sections were then observed and photographed with a fluorescence microscope. The antibodies used to detect pAPN protein were purchased from Abcam (ab108310); the antibody used to detect PRRSV-N protein was made by our laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measurement of viral antibody</title><p>The blood tissues of three experimental groups of pigs were collected at different times after viral challenge and the sera were separated. For the PRRSV group, the sera from all samples were subjected to PRRS antibody detection by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (IDEXX, ME). The antibody level was determined to be negative or positive according to the S/P value. If S/P&lt;0.4, the antibody is negative, and if S/P≥0.4, the antibody is positive. In order to detect TGEV-specific and PDCoV-specific antibody levels in serum, we used a serum neutralization test (SNT). Briefly, sera were heat inactivated by 30 min of incubation in a 56°C water bath. Then serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples in four replicates were mixed with 200 TCID<sub>50</sub> of TGEV strain WH-1 in a 1:1 ration. After incubation, 100 μl of the mixture was added into ST cells (a swine testicular cell line permissive of TGEV infection; ATCC CRL-1746) at a confluence of ~90%, seeded in 96-well cell culture plates. Appropriate serum, virus (200 TCID<sub>50</sub>, 20 TCID<sub>50</sub>, 2 TCID<sub>50</sub>, and 0.2 TCID<sub>50</sub>), and cell controls were included in this test. For about 72 hr after incubation, the cells were monitored for TGEV-specific cytopathic effects. Neutralization titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in complete neutralization. Similarly, sera were diluted mixed with 200 TCID<sub>50</sub> of PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014. In contrast, PDCoV titers were assessed using LLC-PK1 cells (a porcine kidney cell line permissive of PDCoV infection; ATCC CL-101) that were washed twice with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, CA), and supplemented with 7.5 μg/mL trypsin (Gibco, USA) prior to and after 1 hr incubation with these mixtures. Cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 7.5 μg/mL trypsin for approximately 72 hr, and the neutralization titers of sera from PDCoV group were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>qRT-PCR-based measurement of PRRSV RNA and PDCoV RNA</title><p>To quantify the copies of PRRSV and PDCoV in the infected experimental group, we extracted PRRSV RNA from PAMs, serum, lung tissue, and tonsil tissue from both the challenge and the mock-inoculated group, and extracted PDCoV RNA from DKO PAMs and WT PAMs after infected with PDCoV. RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol reagent (Omega Bio-Tek). The RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA according to the instructions for a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). The cDNA was then amplified with SYBR green real-time PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).

All testing followed the guidelines stipulated in the ‘rules for performance testing of breeding pigs’ document published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of PR China (NY/T 822–2004). Briefly, DKO pigs and control WT pigs were weighed before slaughter, euthanized after fasting for 24 hr, and hairs, heads, hoofs, and internal organs were removed after carcass dissection. The weight of carcass, length of carcass, loin eye areas, thickness of skin, and backfat thickness of carcass were all measured. Ham, skin, bone, lean, and fat were dissected from the left side of the carcass and their individual weights were determined. To evaluate meat quality, we measured muscle pH, meat color score, intramuscular fat, marbling, and drip loss of longissimus dorsi. For analysis of pork nutrition, total protein, total fat, ash, moisture, amino acid, and individual minerals, amino acids were analyzed for the longissimus dorsi. The nutritional content of the pork was tested by the Beijing Institute of Nutritional Sources.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Detection of sperm motility</title><p>Semen from DKO pigs and WT control pigs were collected and returned to the laboratory in a 17°C incubator for testing their quality.

Importantly, the authors show that DKO pigs are partially resistant to challenge by pDCoV providing functional, in vivo data highlighting the likely role of pAPN as cross-genus coronavirus receptor. Overall, this manuscript is clear, well-written and the methods are robust. It utilizes promising CRISPR technology in life stock and provides novel information on coronavirus receptor usage in vivo.

However, the resistance was only partial since antibody titers showed a delay but were similar at later time points and no significant differences were found in pathology. Effects on viral titer or weight loss were not reported. One can even argue if this merits the term &quot;partial resistance&quot; and whether &quot;decreased susceptibility&quot; would be more appropriate.

Regarding this first point, we have now softened the claims about the susceptibility of DKO pigs to PDCoV and have replaced the term &quot;partial resistance&quot; with &quot;decreased susceptibility&quot; throughout the manuscript. We have changed the title &quot;<italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>pAPN</italic> double-gene-knockout pigs are resistant to three viruses while maintaining normal production performance&quot; to &quot;<italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>pAPN</italic> double-knockout pigs are resistant to PRRSV and TGEV and exhibit decreased susceptibility to PDCoV while maintaining normal production performance&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The potential in vivo role of pAPN was only assessed in the double knockout context together with CD163 knockout.

Indeed, despite the important role of CD163 in innate immunity, an inhibiting effect of soluble CD163 on the adaptive immune system has also been reported (Frings et al., 2002; O'Connell et al., 2017). It is possible that the delayed adaptive immune response that we observed in PDCoV-infected DKO pigs may be associated with <italic>CD163</italic> knockout-induced immunosuppression. We have added this alternative explanation to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, for example adding: &quot;…indicating the potential role of <italic>pAPN</italic> in mediating PDCoV infection. Additionally, the effect of <italic>CD163</italic> knockout in the delayed adaptive immune response cannot be ignored. Despite the important role of CD163 in innate immunity, an inhibiting effect of soluble CD163 on the adaptive immune system has also been reported (Frings et al., 2002; O'Connell et al., 2017). It is thus possible that the delayed adaptive immune response we observed in PDCoV-infected DKO pigs may be associated with <italic>CD163</italic> knockout-induced immunosuppression.&quot;</p><p>Please also note that, seeking to further confirm the potential mechanisms involved in this delayed adaptive immune response, we have recently initiated a project to generate <italic>pAPN</italic> KO pigs as suggested by reviewers; we plan to use these animals to further elucidate the role of pAPN in PDCoV infection. As guided by the <italic>eLife</italic> editor notes, we plan to report this result when it is ready, either as a preprint on bioRxiv or potentially as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors make statements that go beyond what they have presented.

According to this guidance, we have added the age of the pigs in Table 1; we have also added a Supplementary file 8 in which we list the data for the birth weights and average daily gains of WT pigs and DKO pigs up to their slaughtering weight. Note that inferential statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between the two groups for these growth parameters. We have also revised the manuscript, which now states</p><p>&quot;In addition, there was no significant difference in birth weight or in the average daily gain between WT and DKO pigs (Supplementary file 8).&quot;</p><p>And</p><p>&quot;With the exception of meat color score and iron content, no differences in the production performance, reproductive performance, or pork nutrient content were observed between DKO pigs and WT pigs.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Infection of pigs. &quot;The four DKO and six WT pigs used for PRRSV WUH3 viral challenge were both about 45 days old. &quot;What was the source of the WT pigs?

This should be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We now understand the lack of clarity for this content in our originally submitted text. To clarify, the WT pigs used in the infection experiment were from natural breeding; they were matched by age and breed with the DKO pigs. We have added the source of the WT pigs to the beginning of the &quot;Infection of pigs&quot; part of Materials and methods section in the revised manuscript. The new sentence reads: &quot;All WT pigs used in the infection experiment were born from natural breeding, and they were matched by age and breed with the DKO pigs.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) The partial resistance to PDCoV is intriguing in the DKO pigs but only found in the delayed adaptive immune response.

As guided by the suggestion about &quot;isolating primary cells from the WT and DKO pigs and do an in vitro challenge with PDCoV would quantify more directly the impact of DKO on virus infection&quot;, we have now completed this experimental work and have added a description of our new findings in the revised Results and Discussion sections. The added sentences in the Results section are as follows:</p><p>&quot;In addition, we tested the resistance of PAMs derived from DKO pigs to PDCoV. DKO and WT PAMs were infected with PDCoV, and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA), tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID<sub>50</sub>) assays, qRT-PCR, and western blot analyses to assess PDCoV proliferation in PAMs all indicated that DKO PAMs exhibit significantly decreased susceptibility of PDCoV infection compared to WT PAMs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1)&quot;.</p><p>The revised sentences in the Discussion section are as follows:</p><p>&quot;Interestingly, a recent study showed that PAMs, but not lung fibroblast-like cells, from pAPN knockout pigs showed resistance to PDCoV infection (Stoian et al., 2020), a finding consistent with our in vitro experiments showing that DKO PAMs exhibit decreased susceptibility to PDCoV infection&quot;.</p><p>The figure content for these new in vitro experiments (now added to the revised manuscript) includes the following figure caption:</p><p>&quot; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 | PAMs of DKO pigs exhibit reduced susceptibility to PDCoV. (A) WT PAMs and DKO PAMs were infected or mock-infected with PDCoV (MOI = 10); at 24 hpi, PDCoV-N-specific fluorescence signals were detected by IFA. (B) WT PAMs and DKO PAMs were infected with PDCoV (MOI = 10); at 24 hpi, cells were collected and the viral titer was determined by TCID<sub>50</sub> assays (in LLC-PK1 cells). (C, D) WT PAMs and DKO PAMs were infected with PDCoV (MOI = 10); at 24 hpi, cells were harvested and analyzed using qRT-PCR (C) and western blot assays (D). The PDCoV-N protein level was quantified by ImageJ. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD.

And we have added experimental methods including &quot;IFA assay&quot; and &quot;TCID<sub>50</sub> assay&quot;. The new methods content reads as follows:</p><p>&quot;DKO PAMs and WT PAMs in 24-well cell culture plates were infected or mock-infected with PDCoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. At 24 hpi, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and permeabilized with methanol for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then blocked with bovine serum albumin (5%) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour, and incubated with a PDCoV-N-protein-specific monoclonal antibody for 1 hour and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for 1 hour. The cell nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 minutes at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the stained cells were observed with an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus IX73, Japan).&quot;</p><p>And</p><p>&quot;PDCoV-infected PAMs were frozen and thawed repeatedly to completely release viruses. Next, LLC-PK1 cells (a pig kidney cell line known to be highly permissive to PDCoV infection) were seeded in 96-well plates and were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus samples in eight replicates. At 72 hpi, PDCoV titers were calculated based on cytopathic effects and expressed as the TCID<sub>50</sub> value per milliliter, using the Reed–Muench method.&quot;</p><p>Please also note that we have now initiated work to generate <italic>pAPN</italic> single knockout pigs to exclude the effects of <italic>CD163</italic> knockout. We have obtained <italic>pAPN</italic> knockout pig fetal fibroblasts (PEFs); however, owing to the ongoing epidemics of African swine fever and COVID-19, there has been delay in our progress. The work is ongoing, and as guided by the <italic>eLife</italic> editor notes, we plan to report this result when it is ready, either as a preprint on bioRxiv or potentially as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
