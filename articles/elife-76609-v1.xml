unknown. To investigate potential changes in virus transmissibility or population susceptibility, we measured the seroprevalence of EV-D68-specific neutralising antibodies in serum samples collected in England in 2006, 2011, and 2017. Using catalytic mathematical models, we estimate an approximately 50% increase in the annual probability of infection over the 10-year study period, coinciding with the emergence of clade B around 2009. Despite such increase in transmission, seroprevalence data suggest that the virus was already widely circulating before the AFM outbreaks and the increase of infections by age cannot explain the observed number of AFM cases. Therefore, the acquisition of or an increase in neuropathogenicity would be additionally required to explain the emergence of outbreaks of AFM. Our results provide evidence that changes in enterovirus phenotypes cause major changes in disease epidemiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Enterovirus D68</kwd><kwd>seroepidemiology</kwd><kwd>mathematical model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>216427/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pons-Salort</surname><given-names>Margarita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISSF204826/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simmonds</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Contrary to most human enteroviruses, EV-D68 causes severe respiratory disease and is transmitted by the respiratory route, sharing properties with rhinoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oberste et al., 2004</xref>). Although this virus was first isolated in 1962, for decades it was only reported from isolated cases or small case clusters of respiratory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pons-Salort et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>From 2009 to 2010 onwards however, an increasing number of outbreaks of EV-D68-associated severe respiratory illness have been reported worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holm-Hansen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tokarz et al., 2012</xref>). In 2014, the US experienced the first big outbreak of respiratory disease linked to EV-D68, with &gt;1100 cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Midgley et al., 2015</xref>). In parallel with this outbreak, an unusual number of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) cases (a newly recognised condition that includes the sudden onset of flaccid limb weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021</xref>]) were also reported, and similar AFM outbreaks subsequently occurred in 2016 and 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2021</xref>). Retrospectively, it now appears, an unusual spike of ‘polio-like’ cases reported in 2012 in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayscue et al., 2014</xref>) was an early occurrence of what was subsequently defined as AFM. In the UK and elsewhere in Europe, AFM cases have also been reported in recent years associated with upsurges in EV-D68 detections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knoester et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">The United Kingdom Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Task Force, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2016</xref>). Evidence that EV-D68 is the main cause of these AFM outbreaks has been growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Messacar et al., 2018</xref>), although the role of other enterovirus serotypes such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has not been discounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McKay et al., 2018</xref>). There is no effective treatment or vaccine for EV-D68 infection yet, and residual paralysis and neurological sequelae after AFM is common and lifelong.</p><p>The mechanisms that have led to the emergence of EV-D68 outbreaks since the late 2000s remain unknown. One hypothesis is that transmission has increased as a result of evolutionary selection for increased replication fitness, or through the appearance of immune escape-associated mutations that lead to the evasion of pre-existing population immunity. Another is that the virus has become more pathogenic, and, as a consequence, the number of symptomatic (and therefore, reported) infections has increased independently of its transmissibility (i.e. the virus already circulated in the past but went mostly undetected).</p><p>As for other enterovirus serotypes, many EV-D68 infections are asymptomatic or mild and self-limiting. In addition, enterovirus surveillance is passive in most countries, based on laboratory reporting for samples submitted by clinicians for testing. It is consequently difficult to determine the true incidence of infection or whether changes in EV-D68 circulation have occurred. A recent study based on data from the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meyers et al., 2020</xref>) has shown biennial cycles of EV-D68 circulation in the US at the national level since 2014, coinciding with the years of AFM outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, in the UK, reported EV-D68 virus detections also show a biennial pattern between 2014 and 2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, these data are limited before 2014 and respiratory samples or throat swabs are infrequently tested by enterovirus surveillance programmes in the US, the UK or elsewhere. Seroprevalence surveys therefore offer an attractive potential alternative opportunity to investigate patterns of exposure to EV-D68. Detection of EV-D68 antibodies with adequate sensitivity and specificity can indicate prior infection and can be analysed using mathematical models to infer trends in the incidence of infection over time, by age-group and location.</p><p>Here, we use data on the prevalence of neutralising antibodies against EV-D68 from opportunistically collected serum samples broadly representative of the general population in England in 2006, 2011, and 2017 to reconstruct long-term changes in EV-D68 transmission. Using a mathematical model-based framework, we estimate changes in the annual force of infection (FOI) and reconstruct the estimated annual number of new infections in each age class.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Individuals are assigned an antibody titre as the highest antibody dilution (1:4, 1:8, …, 1:2048) preventing virus replication (i.e. showing neutralisation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamau et al., 2019</xref>). For EV-D68, it is unknown which neutralising antibody titre (or seropositivity cut-off) is indicative of true past infection. A simple method to determine a seropositivity cut-off is based on fitting a mixture model to the individual titre distribution, in order to differentiate between two sub-populations (seronegatives and seropositives) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hens et al., 2012</xref>). However, determining such a cut-off was not possible here, as for two of the three serosurveys and for all the data combined, the distributions did not show a bi-modal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore present our modelling analysis for two different cut-offs: a first weak cut-off of 1:16, which has been previously used in the literature to define EV-D68 seropositivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karelehto et al., 2019</xref>), and a more stringent cut-off of 1:64, which provides seroprevalence curves by age similar to an even more stringent cut-off of 1:128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Seroprevalence frequencies in different age groups from the three serosurveys of samples collected in 2006, 2011, and 2017 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. At each time point, irrespective of the cut-off antibody titre chosen to define seropositivity, seroprevalence slightly decreases from the 0 years-old (yo) to the 1–4 yo age classes, and then increases sharply with age until the 20–29 yo, when it reaches a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). As for many other viruses, higher values in the 0-yo age class are likely the result of the presence of transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies that subsequently decline. For a seropositivity cut-off of 1:16, the proportion seropositive at ages 1–4 yo ranged between 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–0.75) in 2006 and 0.92 (95% CI 0.84–0.97) in 2017. For a more stringent cut-off of 1:64, the proportion seropositive in this age group decreased to 0.29 (95% CI 0.19–0.40) in 2006 and 0.51 (95% CI 0.40–0.62) in 2017. Age-stratified seroprevalence was generally lower in 2006 compared to 2011 and 2017, which suggests individuals acquired their first infection at a lower age through the study period, leading to a decrease in the mean age of exposure. This could potentially be consistent with increased transmission (e.g. through increased viral fitness or the accumulation of susceptible) or other mechanisms (such as a change in the virus to have a higher tendency to infect children).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Seroprevalence by age.</title><p>Seroprevalence by age class in years for the three serosurveys and for two different cut-offs of neutralising antibody titre used to define positivity: (<bold>A</bold>) 1:16 and (<bold>B</bold>) 1:64.

For both cut-offs, seroprevalence in these children starts very high (92% and 70% for the 1:16 and 1:64 cut-offs, respectively, for children &lt;1 month of age) and declines with age, with a quicker decline during the first 3 months of life then followed by a plateau or slower decline. However, the small number of children per age class resulted in large 95% CIs around the mean. Seroprevalence reaches a minimum at 8 and 4 months of age for the 1:16 and 1:64 cut-offs, respectively. However, the minimum seroprevalence remains high at 50% for the 1:16 cut-off, compared to only 11% for the 1:64.</p><p>To address the question of whether transmission had increased before the first reported big outbreaks of EV-D68 in 2014, we compared the performance of two catalytic models that differed on the assumptions of how the FOI changed over time (Materials and methods). Both models assumed that a proportion of individuals are born with maternal antibodies that will subsequently decline at a constant rate, and assumed the risk of infection (becoming seropositive) was independent of age. Model 1 assumed that the FOI was constant over time, and Model 2 allowed it to vary following a random walk. The proportion of individuals born with maternal antibodies was fixed to 1.0 and 0.9 for the seropositivity cut-offs of 1:16 and 1:64, respectively, based on the proportion of adults 25–40 years old that were seropositive in the three serosurveys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><p>For both seropositivity cut-offs, Model 2 was the best model according to the leave-one-out (LOO) information criterion (see Materials and methods), which accounts for over-parameterisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Model 2 also provided a better fit to the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) than Model 1, which did not capture the observed general increase in seroprevalence between 2006 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For both seropositivity cut-offs, the 2-yo age class has the highest annual incidence of infection. The increase in the FOI between 2006 and 2017 results in an increase in the number of infections in the youngest age classes over time, and a decrease in the oldest, with and inflection point around the age of 4–6 yo. This, in turn, results in a decrease in the mean age at infection from 8.5 yo (7.0–10.4) in 2007 to 4.2 yo (3.5–5.1) in 2017 for the 1:16 cut-off, and from 14.3 yo (12.9–15.9) to 9.8 yo (8.9–10.8) for the 1:64.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The model-based analysis of individual serological data for EV-D68 from three time points (2006, 2011, and 2017) in England presented here suggests an increase in transmission of EV-D68 that occurred or started before 2011. This coincides with the increased number of outbreaks of EV-D68-associated severe respiratory diseases reported worldwide since the late 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pons-Salort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tokarz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although our results of an increase in FOI over the study period are robust to the choice of the seropositivity cut-off, we find striking differences in terms of the magnitude of the FOI and the decline of maternal antibodies depending on the seropositivity cut-off used. The results obtained with the more stringent cut-off of 1:64 seem more realistic, both for the estimated annual probabilities of infection (range 0.32–0.52 for the 1:16, and 0.13–0.20 for the 1:64, for the period 2006–2017) and rate of decline of maternal antibodies (average duration of maternal antibodies around 18 mo for the 1:16, and 5 mo for the 1:64). Furthermore, the analysis with the 1:64 cut-off infers that there has not been significant changes in the FOI since 2011; however, with the 1:16 cut-off, the FOI continues to increase until 2017. These results therefore raise the question of what is a suitable seropositivity cut-off to define previous exposure to EV-D68. That said, most EV-D68 seroepidemiology studies published to date present results for a cut-off of 1:8 (as classically used for polioviruses) or 1:16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karelehto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>One strength of our analysis is that we account for the decline of maternal antibodies in the catalytic models and are able to estimate the rate of this decline, thanks to the availability of data in the &lt;1 yo. Only one study has reported detailed seroprevalence in the &lt;1 yo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2018b</xref>). This study was conducted in China in 2010, and the data reported are for a seropositivity cut-off of 1:8. Although they found 100% seroprevalence in neonates, close to the observations in our study when using the 1:16 cut-off, this declined to only 28% in the 9–11 months old, which is much lower than the 64% in the same age class in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The discrepancy may be partly due to differences in the time of data collection. Indeed, we show data for the three cross-sectional serosurveys combined (2006, 2011, and 2017), given that the number of individuals in each age class was very small, but data for individual years suggest lower seroprevalence in 2006 compared to 2011 and 2017 in the 9–11 mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Our findings point to a clear increase in transmission as measured by the estimated annual probability of infection (approximately, 50% higher in 2017 compared to 2006). However, the reconstructed annual number of new infections in each age class suggests that this increase is mostly driven by an increase in the total number of infections in children aged 1–5 yo. Increased transmission in the youngest age groups may be consistent with observed data showing higher and increasing numbers of respiratory illnesses associated with EV-D68 in these age groups (&lt;5 yo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bubba et al., 2020</xref>). However, these results on their own are unlikely to explain the worldwide emergence of AFM outbreaks reported since 2014. First, the high overall seroprevalence observed in 2006 suggests that EV-D68 was already widely circulating before 2014. Second, AFM cases do not exclusively or predominantly occur in the youngest age groups. In the US, for example, AFM cases reported in 2014 had a median age of 7.1 yo (interquartile range [IQR], 4.8–12.1 yo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sejvar et al., 2016</xref>). In the UK, a study from 2018 reported 40 cases, of which only 22 were 0–5 yo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">The United Kingdom Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Task Force, 2019</xref>). A study from European countries (2016) reported a median age of cases of 3.8 yo and a range of 1.6–9.0 yo. In Japan, a case series study of an AFM cluster reported an overall median age of cases of 4.4 yo (IQR, 2.6–7.7 yo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2018</xref>). Although susceptibility to EV-D68-related AFM may vary with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hixon et al., 2019</xref>) (making it difficult to make a link between the inferred number of infections by age class and the observed number of cases by age), our model-based results suggest that incidence of infections in some of the age groups affected by AFM has not increased, but rather decreased, despite the general increase in transmission. Therefore, the acquisition of or an increase in neuropathogenicity (independent of the described increase in transmission) seems necessary to explain the emergence of AFM through an as-yet unidentified biological mechanism.</p><p>The prediction of an increase in the number of infections in the youngest age classes (1–5 yo) is due to the high seroprevalence observed in these age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and also the fact that we do not allow for re-infections. As a consequence, only a small number of infections occur at older ages. Although the extremely high seropositivity rates at ages below 5 yo are not generally found with other enteroviruses, they have been reported for EV-D68 in other places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vogt and Crowe, 2018</xref>), for example the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>), the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karelehto et al., 2019</xref>), and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). Clarifying the origin and the meaning of this high prevalence of neutralising antibodies at this young age (the role of serum neutralising antibodies in protection against infection and diseases) should be a priority for EV-D68 research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vogt and Crowe, 2018</xref>). In particular, it is unclear whether cross-reactivity with other enteroviruses contributes to these high seropositivity and general increase in antibody titres with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamau et al., 2019</xref>). If serum neutralising antibodies are not a good correlate of protection against infection, the models may not capture well the age at which infections have increased, and it could be that the increase in infections is across age groups. Indeed, increased transmission may have also been associated with re-infections (and subsequent boosting of antibodies) in older age groups, consistent with the observed rise in geometric mean titres with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamau et al., 2019</xref>). However, it seems unlikely that secondary infections can lead to paralysis, based on data for poliovirus.</p><p>Whether antigenic escape can explain re-infections in older children is not fully understood. There is evidence of amino acid changes in the BC and DE loop regions of the VP1 (which are thought to be epitopes for neutralising antibodies) that might have resulted in altered antigenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dyrdak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imamura et al., 2014</xref>). However, although neutralisation assays conducted against different EV-D68 strains found some differences in neutralisation titres, study results have been inconsistent and their clinical and epidemiological significance unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is important to interpret well the results for the estimates of the FOI over time from our analysis under the assumptions of the models. First, as the best model uses a random walk on the FOI, the change in transmission that we infer happens continuously over several years. In reality, this may have occurred differently (e.g. in a shorter period of time). Our ability to recover more complex changes in transmission is limited by the data available. It would not be surprising if EV-D68 has exhibited biennial (or longer) cycles of transmission in England over the last few years, as it has been shown in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2021</xref>) and is common for other enteroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pons-Salort and Grassly, 2018</xref>). However, it is difficult to recover changes at this finer time scale with serology data unless sampling is very frequent (at least annual). Therefore, our study can only reveal broader long-term secular changes. Second, interpretation of the results before 2006 must be avoided for two resasons. On the one hand, as we go backwards in time, there is more uncertaintly about the time of seroconversion of the individuals informing the estimates of the FOI. On the other hand, because age and time are confounded in cross-sectional seroprevalence measurements, the random walk on time may account for possible differences in the FOI through age (possibly higher in the youngest age classes, and lowest in the oldest), which are note explicitly accounted for here. This may explain the decline in FOI when going backwards in time before the first cross-sectional study in 2006. Third, allowing for a higher FOI in younger age classes would result in a shorter duration of maternal antibodies, which would make the results for the 1:16 cut-off more realistic in terms of decline of maternal antibodies. That said, these two parameters (rate of maternal antibodies decline and increase in FOI in younger age classes) would certainly be highly correlated and difficult to be jointly estimated.</p><p>Three major co-circulating EV-D68 clades (A–C) emerged globally in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tokarz et al., 2012</xref>) and have subsequently diversified, with only one monophyletic group (B1 and B3 genotypes) with a common ancestor in 2009 so far associated with AFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hadfield et al., 2018</xref>) (with the exception of one case associated with D1 [sometimes called A2] in 2018 in France; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bal et al., 2019</xref>). Individual viral lineages show rapid global spread, with recent outbreaks synchronised across Europe and the US representing circulation of the same dominant genotypes. Reported EV-D68 outbreaks in 2014 and 2016 were due to clade B viruses, while the 2018 outbreaks were reported to be linked to both B3 and A2 clade viruses in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">The United Kingdom Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Task Force, 2019</xref>), France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bal et al., 2019</xref>), and elsewhere. In vitro studies of the neurotropism of these viruses compared with the ancestral strains have yielded conflicting results as to whether neurotropism has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hixon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenfeld et al., 2019</xref>). The timing of the increase in transmission estimated here (sometime before 2011) based on the analysis of the serology data may roughly correspond to the genetic emergence of clade B around 2007, and thus one could hypothesise that increased virus transmissibility is a trait associated with this clade. More efficient viral replication may enhance transmission as well as the probability of virus reaching the central nervous system, although changes in receptor usage could also play a role.</p><p>This work shows the value of modelling age-stratified seroprevalence data from consecutive cross-sectional studies in the understanding of the epidemiology of diseases caused by emerging human enteroviruses. The dynamics of most enterovirus serotypes over relatively long time scales have been shown to be driven by population immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pons-Salort and Grassly, 2018</xref>). However, in rare instances, enterovirus serotypes have emerged as important causes of diseases after many years of circulation causing diseases at a much lower rate or even silently circulating. For example, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) has emerged as the main serotype causing HFMD worldwide over the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, this work also shows the need to better understand and interpret individual serological data in terms of previous exposure and protection against infection and disease. This would help refining analytical approaches such as those used here to infer population-level processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Serological data</title><p>We use data from three retrospective cross-sectional studies analysing serum samples representative of England’s population in 2006 (<italic>n</italic> = 516), 2011 (<italic>n</italic> = 504), and 2017 (<italic>n</italic> = 566) and available through the National Seroepidemiology Programme at Public Health England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osborne et al., 2000</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors use data from 3 cross-sectional age-stratified serosurveys on Enterovirus D68 from England between 2006 and 2017 to examine the transmission dynamics of this pathogen in this setting. Understanding these dynamics, including how it changes over time, may help uncover potential changes in the transmissibility of the virus. While the topic is relevant, interpretation of the results challenging largely due to the great uncertainty around how to interpret the serological (serostatus) data, and the impact this has on the inferences made. We ask the authors to perform some additional analyses and to provide more intuition to understand some of the key findings of this analysis.</p><p>1. We struggle to reconcile the evidence of a stable or even small drop in FoI after 2010 in the 1:64 models in contrast to the continued increase using the 1:16 cut-point.</p><p>2. It is hard to reconcile evidence of drops in FoI in the 1:64 (models 4 and 5 from 2010/11 (Figure 3)) with steadily increasing R0 in this period (Figure 4). Is this due to changes in the susceptibility proportion. It would be good to understand if there are important assumptions in the Farrington approach that may also contribute to this discrepancy.</p><p>3. One of the major findings of the paper is that there is a steadily increasing R0 (using the 1:64 cut-point).

We have changed the catalytic models and now use a model that includes individuals with maternal antibodies at birth. With this new model, we no longer need to make extra hypothesis about differences in FOI at age 1. We now estimate both the rate of decline of maternal antibodies and the FOI (that we assume constant through age). We have substantially revised the Methods section to describe the new approach, updated all the results accordingly. These includes the model fit (new Figure 2) and the estimates of the FOI over time (new Figure 3A). We also show the decline of the estimated proportion of individuals with maternal antibodies through age (new Figure 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. We struggle to reconcile the evidence of a stable or even small drop in FoI after 2010 in the 1:64 models in contrast to the continued increase using the 1:16 cut-point.</p></disp-quote><p>With the new model (i.e. with maternal antibodies) the difference in the “trajectory” of the FOI over time for the two cut-off persists. We think this is driven by the difference in seroprevalence between the youngest age classes in 2011 vs. 2017 for the two cut-offs (see Figures 1A and 1B). For the 1:16 cut-off, seroprevalence in the young age classes increases over time between the first serosurvey in 2006 and the last one in 2017 (Figure 1A). However, for the 1:64 cut-off, seroprevalence in the young age classes is very similar for the 2011 and 2017 serosurveys. The serocatalytic models therefore do not estimate a change in the FOI between those two time points.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this point, which we did not discuss before. We have now added the following text to the Results:</p><p>“The best model (Model 2) estimated an increase in transmission over time during the study period (2006-2017) for both seropositivity cut-offs, as shown by the estimated FOI in Figure 3A. For the cut-off of 1:16, the FOI continued to increase until the end of the study period, in 2017. However, for the more stringent cut-off of 1:64, the FOI plateaued from around 2011. These differences reflect the differences in seroprevalence observed in the young age classes (1 – 20 yo) between 2011 and 2017 for the two cut-offs (Figure 1).”</p><p>And we have also added the following paragraph to the Discussion presenting the main differences in the results for the two cut-offs:</p><p>“Although our results of an increase in FOI over the study period are robust to the choice of the seropositivity cut-off, we find striking differences in terms of the magnitude of the FOI and the decline of maternal antibodies depending on the seropositivity cut-off used. The results obtained with the more stringent cut-off of 1:64 seem more realistic, both for the estimated annual probabilities of infection (range 0.32-0.52 for the 1:16, and 0.13-0.20 for the 1:64, for the period 2006-2017) and rate of decline of maternal antibodies (average duration of maternal antibodies around 18 mo for the 1:16, and 5 mo for the 1:64). Furthermore, the analysis with the 1:64 cut-off infers that there has not been significant changes in the FOI since 2011; however, with the 1:16 cut-off, the FOI continuous to increase until 2017. These results therefore raise the question of what is a suitable seropositivity cut-off to define previous exposure to EV-D68. That said, most EV-D68 seroepidemiology studies published to date present results for a cut-off of 1:8 (as classically used for polioviruses) or 1:16 (17, 19-21).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is hard to reconcile evidence of drops in FoI in the 1:64 (models 4 and 5 from 2010/11 (Figure 3)) with steadily increasing R0 in this period (Figure 4). Is this due to changes in the susceptibility proportion. It would be good to understand if there are important assumptions in the Farrington approach that may also contribute to this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the estimates of R0 from the manuscript and only present the reconstruction of the annual number of new infections per age class and year (new Figure 5). We think this measure is more adapted to the discussion of the results.</p><p>In addition, when using the classical expression R{0t}=1/(1-S(t)), with S(t) the annual proportion seropositive, the high seroprevalence estimates (new Figure 4) result in extremely high estimates of the basic reproduction number (median ranges: 11.6 – 29.7 for 1:16 and 3.3 – 7.6 for 1:64 during the period 2006 to 2017).</p><p>We had previously used the Farrington approach as it is adapted to cases when the force of infections is different for different age classes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We therefore kept the simple random-walk over the whole period and added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“It is important to interpret well the results for the estimates of the FOI over time from our analysis under the assumptions of the models. First, as the best model uses a random walk on the FOI, the change in transmission that we infer happens continuously over several years. In reality, this may have occurred differently (e.g. in a shorter period of time). Our ability to recover more complex changes in transmission is limited by the data available. It would not be surprising if EV-D68 has exhibited biennial (or longer) cycles of transmission in England over the last few years, as it has been shown in the US (7) and is common for other enteroviruses (30). However, it is difficult to recover changes at this finer time scale with serology data unless sampling is very frequent (at least annual). Therefore, our study can only reveal broader long-term secular changes. Second, interpretation of the results before 2006 must be avoided for two reasons. On the one hand, as we go backwards in time, there is more uncertainty about the time of seroconversion of the individuals informing the estimates of the FOI. On the other hand, because age and time are confounded in cross sectional seroprevalence measurements, the random walk on time may account for possible differences in the FOI through age (possibly higher in the youngest age classes, and lowest in the oldest), which are note explicitly accounted for here. This may explain the decline in FOI when going backwards in time before the first cross-sectional study in 2006.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Actually, we believe that all the results (including also FOI estimates) are more realistic for the 1:64 cutoff than for the 1:16, and we already discuss this in the second paragraph of the Discussion. We think it is important to show the results obtained with both cut-offs, as studies reporting EVD68 seroprevalence published so far have used a seropositivity cut-off of 1:8 or 1:16, which we think may not be the most suitable for this enterovirus serotype.</p><p>A main observation of our and other studies is that seroprevalence is very high in the 12-23 months old for the 1:16 cut-off and this is discussed at several points in the Discussion. In our approach, the rate of decline of maternal antibodies (parameter omega) is estimated, and therefore, informed by the seroprevalence data. If we fixed it and “forced it to go to zero by a certain age”, as suggested by the reviewer, we would need to consider a higher FOI in the younger age classes to be able to explain the high seroprevalence observed in those. We have now added the following sentence to the Discussion to acknowledge the limitation:</p><p>“Third, allowing for a higher FOI in younger age classes would result in a shorter duration of maternal antibodies, which would make the results for the 1:16 cut-off more realistic in terms of decline of maternal antibodies.

I had made a comment in the previous round of review about extending the x-axis to the start of the time period of estimation: this was in reference to FOI, not seroprevalence. The FOI estimates in Figure 3A begin in 1990, but the oldest cohort in this analysis are 40 y in 2006, and it's not clear what is assumed about FOI between 1966 and 1990.

First, we are interested on seeing whether there has been an increase in transmission in the few years before the first large EV-D68 outbreaks in 2014. This is, between a few years before 2006 (our first time point with data) and 2014. Second, because our first time point of observations is 2006 and seroprevalence increases quickly with age, the FOI estimates going backwards in time are informed by older, mostly seropositive individuals, which results in a basically flat or not well estimated FOI. This is clearer for the 1:16 cut-off, for which we observe a large increase in the credible intervals. This is because seroprevalence quickly reaches 100% (around the age of 20) and therefore, there is not much signal in the data to inform the FOI going backwards in time, i.e. before 2006-20=1986 approximately.</p></body></sub-article></article>
