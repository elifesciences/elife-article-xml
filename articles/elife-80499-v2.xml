Although variation in reproductive effort often affects the number of offspring, adjustments of propagule size are also found in numerous species, including the Western honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. However, the proximate causes of these adjustments are insufficiently understood, especially in oviparous species with complex social organization in which adaptive evolution is shaped by kin selection. Here, we show in a series of experiments that queens predictably and reversibly increase egg size in small colonies and decrease egg size in large colonies, while their ovary size changes in the opposite direction. Additional results suggest that these effects cannot be solely explained by egg-laying rate and are due to the queens’ perception of colony size. Egg-size plasticity is associated with quantitative changes of 290 ovarian proteins, most of which relate to energy metabolism, protein transport, and cytoskeleton. Based on functional and network analyses, we further study the small GTPase Rho1 as a candidate regulator of egg size. Spatio-temporal expression analysis via RNAscope and qPCR supports an important role of <italic>Rho1</italic> in egg-size determination, and subsequent RNAi-mediated gene knockdown confirmed that <italic>Rho1</italic> has a major effect on egg size in honey bees. These results elucidate how the social environment of the honey bee colony may be translated into a specific cellular process to adjust maternal investment into eggs. It remains to be studied how widespread this mechanism is and whether it has consequences for population dynamics and epigenetic influences on offspring phenotype in honey bees and other species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Honey bees are social insects that live in large colonies containing tens of thousands of individuals. The vast majority of bees are sterile females known as worker bees. They perform most of the activities essential for the survival of the colony, including foraging for pollen and nectar and taking care of eggs and larvae.</p><p>An individual known as the queen bee is the mother of the colony and is normally the only female who reproduces. She has two massive ovaries and can produce up to two thousand eggs per day. Previous studies indicate that the number and size of the eggs vary according to the conditions inside the colony and in the surrounding environment. Larger eggs contain more nutrients so the resulting embryos may have a better chance of survival. However, producing bigger eggs requires the queen to invest more resources, which is costly to the colony as a whole.</p><p>It remains unclear which mechanisms regulate the size of honey bee eggs. To address this question, Han, Wei, Amiri et al. carried out a series of experiments on the Western honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. The experiments showed that queen bees in small colonies had smaller ovaries and produced bigger eggs than those in large colonies. The difference in egg size appeared to be due to the queen bee’s perception of the size of the colony, rather than its actual size.</p><p>An approach called proteomics revealed that 290 ovarian proteins were produced at different levels in big-egg producing ovaries compared to small-egg producing ovaries. Further experiments suggested that a protein known as Rho1 regulates the size of the eggs the queen bees produce.</p><p>These findings provide an explanation for how the social environment of the Western honey bee colony may influence the queen bee’s reproductive investment at the molecular level. Further studies to confirm and expand on this work may help to improve honey bee health and also contribute to our general understanding of this life stage in bees and other insects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Apis mellifera</italic></kwd><kwd>social evolution</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>resource

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life history trade-offs are a pervasive attribute of life, and how organisms balance growth, reproduction, and survival governs much of their evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stearns, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flatt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonsall et al., 2004</xref>). Simultaneous optimization of all traits is impossible as all individuals are limited by time, resources, or other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Noordwijk and de Jong, 1986</xref>). Optimization of offspring provisioning has resulted in a wide variety of reproductive strategies that are characterized by species-specific trade-offs between offspring size and number. Numerous studies have analyzed a possible trade-off between offspring number and size across and within many different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith and Fretwell, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dani and Kodandaramaiah, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berrigan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Church et al., 2021</xref>), while social insects have received little attention despite the exceptional reproductive specialization of their female castes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Church et al., 2021</xref>). The topic has gained additional interest due to its implications for inter-generational effects that can profoundly affect organismal phenotypes and evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasanen and Kruuk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sánchez‐Tójar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bebbington and Groothuis, 2021</xref>). Environmental conditions typically lead to plastic responses, most often in the form of variation in offspring number. However, propagule size evolves according to life history and environmental selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Church et al., 2019</xref>) and can also be flexibly adjusted, particularly in plants and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dani and Kodandaramaiah, 2017</xref>) and in some bird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christians, 2002</xref>). While the fitness consequences of egg-size variation have been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azevedo et al., 1997</xref>), little is known about the proximate regulation of egg size, which is equally important for our understanding of this fundamental, complex life history trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flatt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jha et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Social evolution changes selection pressures and adaptive evolution due to kin selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbot et al., 2011</xref>), particularly in eusocial insects with colonies that form a distinct level of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boomsma and Gawne, 2018</xref>). In these species, many individuals contribute to a homeostatically regulated colony environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oster and Wilson, 1978</xref>), pronounced phenotypic plasticity results in individuals specialized for particular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flatt et al., 2013</xref>), and resource transfers among kin influence reproductive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee, 2003</xref>). Thus, life history evolution in eusocial insects differs fundamentally from that of other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Negroni et al., 2016</xref>) and has generated some extraordinary trait combinations that defy traditional life history trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller and Genoud, 1997</xref>). Specifically, the reproductively specialized queen caste is typically well-provisioned and cared for by nonreproductive workers, which also perform all of the intensive brood care that is characteristic of eusocial insects. As such, social insect queens may not be resource-limited despite their very high reproductive effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schrempf et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, honey bee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) queens display plasticity in egg size that is consistent with patterns in solitary species and corresponds to an adaptive investment hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 2020</xref>; egg size is relatively small under favorable conditions, such as food abundance and a large colony (&gt;6000 workers), and is relatively large when food availability or colony size declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>). As in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>), larger eggs have been associated with a survival advantage for the resulting honey bee worker offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>). One honey bee queen typically serves as the sole reproductive in her colony regardless of colony size. The queen is fed and cared for by her workers, although it is unknown how much food she receives and how queen care changes with colony size. Only one, native queen is typically found in a honey bee colony, but queens can be experimentally transferred between colonies, although some may be rejected and killed during this process. Queen condition also affects egg size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Lawati and Bienefeld, 2009</xref>), and egg size differs between worker- and queen-destined eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2019</xref>) with important consequences for caste determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Kahtani and Bienefeld, 2021</xref>) and queen reproductive potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). However, none of these phenomena has been explored further to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern variation in egg size.</p><p>Here, we report our findings of an in-depth investigation of how egg-size plasticity in honey bee queens is regulated and contribute knowledge of the molecular regulation of insect egg size in general, which has been difficult to determine because hundreds of genes may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jha et al., 2015</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the previously identified effects of colony size on queen egg size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>) are reversible and not fixed. We further establish that egg size is actively regulated and not simply a passive consequence of egg-laying rate, although egg size and egg-laying rate can be negatively correlated. This correlation may explain why smaller ovaries can produce larger eggs. We further show that the social cue triggering changes in egg size within the queen does not require physical contact. Proteome comparisons between queen ovaries producing small versus large eggs indicate a central role of protein localization and cytoskeleton organization. We additionally demonstrate that the knockdown of the central cytoskeletal regulator <italic>Rho1</italic> significantly decreases egg size. Our data thus suggest that social cues can be translated into specific molecular processes to control plastic reproductive provisioning, which presumably evolved as an adaptation to the colonial life cycle of honey bees.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Honey bee queens reversibly adjust egg size in response to colony-size changes</title><p>The first experiment involved repeated transfers of queens among colonies of different sizes, which was designed to expand our previous findings that honey bee queens can regulate their egg size in response to colony conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>). Sister queens that were housed in medium-sized colonies at the start of our first experiment produced a range of intermediate egg sizes with significant inter-individual differences (ANOVA: F<sub>(10,219)</sub> = 31.5, p&lt;0.001). Over the course of the first week, egg sizes significantly increased (t = 5.8, df = 10, p&lt;0.001) while egg number did not differ significantly (t = 0.7, df = 10, p&lt;0.482). The first and second measurements were correlated for egg size (R<sub>P</sub> = 0.80, n = 11, p=0.003), indicating consistent differences among queens, but not egg number (R<sub>P</sub> = 0.31, n = 11, p=0.350). After transfer from medium to small colonies, the egg size of all six queens increased significantly (for each queen: F<sub>(1,38)</sub> = 23.7–153.3, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, egg size significantly decreased for all five queens that were transferred from medium to large colonies (F<sub>(1,38)</sub> = 8.9–53.2, all p&lt;0.005). Our reciprocal transfers after the fourth week showed that egg-size adjustments were reversible because all three queens successfully transferred from large to small colonies significantly increased their egg sizes (F<sub>(1,38)</sub> = 143.8–1001.8, all p&lt;0.001) and all five queens transferred from small to large colonies significantly decreased the size of their eggs (F<sub>(1,38)</sub> = 123.0–699.4, all p&lt;0.001). The egg size of most queens did not significantly change between separate measures in the same-sized colonies (third versus fourth or fifth versus sixth week). While egg size and number were not significantly correlated while all queens were housed in medium colonies, there was a negative correlation between size and number in weeks 3–6, although this relation was only significant in week 3 (R<sub>P</sub> = –0.83, n = 11, p=0.002), week 5 (R<sub>P</sub> = –0.95, n = 8, p&lt;0.001), and week 6 (R<sub>P</sub> = –0.90, n = 8, p=0.003). Thus, honey bee queens consistently adjust the number and size of their eggs in response to colony size despite inter-individual differences in egg size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Honey bee queens reversibly adjust egg size according to colony size.</title><p>The egg size (n = 20 for each data point) of individual queens (each depicted by a unique symbol ± SEM) was measured for 6 weeks while they were moved from medium to small to large (light symbols with dark lines) or from medium to large to small colonies (dark symbols with light lines).

Despite its importance and its considerable inter- and intra-specific variability, the egg remains a poorly studied life history stage. Here, we provide evidence that egg size – a quantitative measure of maternal provisioning – is actively adjusted by honey bee queens in response to social cues that relate to colony size. We also find that queens in smaller colonies have smaller ovaries, presumably because they produce fewer but larger eggs. We find that protein localization, cytoskeleton organization, and energy generation are key proteomic changes in the ovary that mediate the production of large eggs. Finally, we identify the cytoskeleton organizer <italic>Rho1</italic> as a potentially important regulator of the active egg-size adjustment of honey bee queens.</p><p>Egg-size variation has been linked to parental or environmental conditions in numerous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dani and Kodandaramaiah, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sánchez‐Tójar et al., 2020</xref>), and we have previously provided evidence that honey bee queens also predictably adjust the size of produced eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>). The direction of egg-size adjustments is consistent between solitary species and honey bees; egg size is typically increased under unpredictable or unfavorable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Einum and Fleming, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rollinson and Hutchings, 2013</xref>) and positively correlated to maternal condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). The first pattern holds in honey bees because egg size is decreased by the queen upon perception of a large colony. Larger eggs improve survival and offspring quality in honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Small colonies may select for increased individual survival because each individual is proportionally more significant to the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rueppell et al., 2009</xref>), but large egg size in small colonies could also be directly related to less consistent brood care and overall colony-level resource availability. Conversely, smaller eggs in large colonies may be beneficial because invariably high levels of brood care do not require well-provisioned eggs. Although we do not know how feeding rates of queens change with colony size, maternal condition may also influence egg size in honey bees. For example, older queens produce smaller eggs than young queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Lawati and Bienefeld, 2009</xref>). However, our finding that queens in small colonies with reduced ovary size produce larger eggs suggests that an inverse relationship between individual condition and egg size can also exist in honey bees. Such a negative relationship between maternal condition and egg size may also exist in other social insects where colony-level instead of individual-level resource availability influences maternal resources and brood care performed by the workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amdam and Omholt, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The conventional trade-off between egg size and number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith and Fretwell, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dani and Kodandaramaiah, 2017</xref>) may not apply to honey bees because resources can be distributed from other colony members to the queen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schrempf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amdam and Omholt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rueppell et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, little evidence for a trade-off between egg size and number was found in a previous study of honey bee queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, a negative relation between egg size and number was found here, at least in the majority of comparisons between queens in small and large colonies. Queens in large colonies typically produce more eggs than queens in small colonies. Our finding that queens in large colonies have heavier ovaries indicates a physiological adaptation to satisfy the egg-laying demand in large colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Khafaji et al., 2009</xref>). However, this result cannot explain why queens in smaller colonies produce larger eggs, why a temporary cessation of egg laying by queens in large colonies does not lead to an increase in egg size, and why queens decrease egg size upon their perception of being in a larger colony. Thus, a simultaneous regulation of egg size and egg number in response to perceived colony size is more likely than a direct trade-off between these two variables. However, further studies of resource flows to queens in colonies of different sizes are necessary to ultimately distinguish regulation from physiological or resource-based trade-offs. Quantitatively restricting egg-laying rates instead of preventing all egg laying is an additional experiment that can elucidate the relation between egg size, egg number, and colony size. The proposed active regulation seems more likely and is also more compatible with short-term egg-size adjustments in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2019</xref>) and can explain why queens in food-restricted colonies also produce larger eggs than queens with ample food supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our study further demonstrates that direct resource availability cannot explain the differences in egg size produced by honey bee queens in small versus large colonies. We find that connecting small colonies to another, larger colony without any physical contact leads to a reduction in egg size that is similar to the effect seen when queens are transferred between these colony types. Thus, our results suggest that the perception of colony size by the queen is sufficient for her to adjust the size of her eggs. We can exclude direct physical contact among individuals, which is used by worker honey bees to assess colony size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2017</xref>), and thus we report a new modality by which honey bees perceive colony size. Multiple cues that travel through a double-screened tunnel could prompt the egg-size adjustment in queens, including sound, temperature, or pheromones and other semiochemicals. Future distinction among these possibilities will permit a subsequent investigation of the mechanisms by which social cues are translated into the physiological adjustments inside the ovary that we document here.</p><p>Broad comparisons find pronounced influences of social structure and behavior on egg size because variation in parental care is intricately linked to the initial investment in eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Summers et al., 2007</xref>). Much less is known about social factors that lead to individual egg-size plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maeno et al., 2020</xref>, particularly in cases that are as dynamic and reversible as illustrated here. We have not attempted to measure the speed at which queens adjust their egg size, but it could be much faster than the 1–2 weeks provided to queens in our experiments. Adjustments may even be made instantaneously, as queen- and worker-destined eggs differ in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2019</xref>) even though they are presumably produced at almost the same time. The advantageous caste bias of larger eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Kahtani and Bienefeld, 2021</xref>) should select for paternal effects to increase egg size, in contrast to other polyandrous species in which males predominantly manipulate female fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollis et al., 2019</xref>). Egg-size variation due to paternal manipulation remains to be investigated in honey bees in the context of the strong maternal control over egg size that we demonstrate in this study.</p><p>Due to the general paucity of a priori information on molecular mechanisms that determine egg size in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jha et al., 2015</xref>), we used a naïve, quantitative proteomic comparison to identify the molecular causes of the egg-size plasticity in honey bee queens. The quantity of numerous proteins is associated with the production of either large or small eggs. Plod, which controls egg length in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lerner et al., 2013</xref>), is not among these proteins, but collagen IV, which may influence egg size in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2021</xref>), is found more abundantly in large-egg-producing ovaries. The vast majority (almost 95%) of differently abundant proteins are found at higher levels in ovaries that produce large eggs. Thus, the anatomically smaller ovaries are physiologically more active in several key processes than the larger ovaries that produce smaller eggs. The GO enrichment analysis indicates the prominence of two upregulated processes in large-egg-producing ovaries – ‘protein localization’ and ‘cytoskeletal regulation’ – while several energy metabolic processes are highlighted by the KEGG pathway analysis. These functional categories indicate that egg-size variation is not a simple increase of egg volume but reflects real differences in offspring provisioning, although the proteome of small and large eggs remains to be characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McDonough-Goldstein et al., 2021</xref>). Higher energy generation may be needed to produce more costly large eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wheeler, 1996</xref>), and the cytoskeleton and protein localization processes are key to loading the eggs with nutrients in polytrophic ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Several of the other GO terms, such as ‘multicellular organism development’ and ‘oocyte construction,’ are further plausible candidates to explain some of the observed variation in egg size.</p><p>Among all involved processes, we considered ‘cytoskeletal organization’ as the most likely regulatory mechanism, while other processes are more likely involved in downstream effector functions. Thus, we identified Rho1 as a potential candidate because it was centrally located in the PPI network of proteins related to cytoskeletal organization that were abundant in large-egg-producing ovaries. <italic>Rho1</italic> is a small, conserved GTPase with a likely role in egg-size regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy and Montell, 1996</xref>) and thus also a plausible functional candidate. <italic>Rho1</italic> has multiple functions but generally plays an important role in cell morphogenesis by regulating the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall, 1998</xref>). It primarily has been implicated in actin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall, 1998</xref>), which is itself important for insect oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sokolova et al., 2018</xref>) but can also indirectly influence the microtubule network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pimm and Henty-Ridilla, 2021</xref>). The regulation of <italic>Rho1</italic> activity is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denk-Lobnig and Martin, 2019</xref>), and multiple participating signaling pathways could transduce extracellular signals in the ovary into cytoskeletal reorganization of the eggs.</p><p>The observed spatio-temporal expression of <italic>Rho1</italic> observed in our RNAscope experiment conforms well with the hypothesis that <italic>Rho1</italic> influences egg growth in the vitellarium. <italic>Rho1</italic> expression appeared to be focused in the cortex of oocytes close to the follicle cells, which mediate vitellogenin uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fleig, 1995</xref>) and can influence egg size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Vitellogenesis is the period of rapid egg growth, and small differences during this time may cause significant differences in the size of the mature egg. However, the molecular function of <italic>Rho1</italic> remains to be elucidated. The role of <italic>Rho1</italic> in egg-size determination is further supported by the consistent decrease of egg size when <italic>Rho1</italic> is knocked down via siRNA injection. This specific effect occurs robustly in small- and large-egg-producing queens. Resulting eggs only differed in size, suggesting that the knockdown of <italic>Rho1</italic> does not cause pathological effects. The practical difficulties of genetic engineering in honey bees prohibited a complementary gain-of-function experiment. The almost perfect correlation between <italic>Rho1</italic> expression and egg size of queens across two different colony sizes and RNAi treatment groups strengthens the interpretation that social conditions, inter-individual differences, and RNAi manipulation all act through <italic>Rho1</italic> in a comparable manner to influence egg size. The tight correlation between egg size and <italic>Rho1</italic> expression was confirmed in a second data set.</p><p>Honey bee queens also adjust their egg size depending on whether a worker- or queen-destined egg is laid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2019</xref>), and egg size influences the probability that an egg is raised into a future queen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Kahtani and Bienefeld, 2021</xref>) and her reproductive quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Our comparative results of the ovary proteome suggest that larger eggs are indeed of superior quality, but a comparison of the actual egg content remains to be performed to substantiate this argument. Stronger support than what we present here to tie egg-size regulation to <italic>Rho1</italic> may be difficult to obtain, but it can be tested whether <italic>Rho1</italic> relates to egg-size variation in honey bees in other contexts, such as maternal genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>) or age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Lawati and Bienefeld, 2009</xref>). If so, <italic>Rho1</italic> may become an important indicator of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>) and maternal quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2022</xref>) in the ongoing efforts to sustain honey bee health. Comparative studies in models with a full suite of functional genomic tools, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, may be warranted to test the more general idea of <italic>Rho1</italic> as a key egg-size regulator in insects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

mellifera</italic>, using colonies of mixed origin and derived from commercial populations, which were kept in the research apiary of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, NC, USA (UNCG: 2020) or in the research apiary of the Institute of Apicultural Research in Beijing, China (IAR: 2021). We used standard husbandry methods to house experimental colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laidlaw and Page, 1997</xref>), monitoring and adjusting colony size and food status but refraining from any other treatments during the experiments. We defined three distinct colony sizes: ‘small’ colonies contained 500–700 worker bees and housed in mating hives (nucs) equipped with three half-frames of medium depth, ‘medium’ colonies contained 6000–8000 workers bees housed in a 5-frame Langstroth hive box with standard frames, and ‘large’ colonies with 16,000–20,000 worker bees in a standard 8-frame (UNCG) and 10-frame (IAR) Langstroth hive. Thus, all colony sizes were below the size of apicultural production colonies. Each separate experiment was conducted with a set of sister queens that we raised from offspring of a single mother to reduce genetic variation within experiments. Queen rearing followed standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laidlaw and Page, 1997</xref>), and queens were allowed to mate naturally.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Repeated transfer experiments</title><p>As an extension of our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>), an experiment was set up in the UNCG apiary to transfer one group of queens from ‘medium’ to ‘small’ to ‘large’ colonies and simultaneously transfer another group from ‘medium’ to ‘large’ to ‘small’ colonies. During each stage, egg size was measured from 20 eggs per queen twice (1 week apart). The measurements followed our previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>), where eggs produced overnight were randomly selected in the next morning and transferred with a grafting tool from standard worker brood cells onto a 0.01 mm stage micrometer (Olympus, Japan). Eggs were laterally photographed under threefold magnification while ensuring that the egg was completely level. Each photo was then processed with the open-source ImageJ software (version 1.52p; National Institutes of Health, USA) by manually tracing the egg’s outline using the polygon-selection tool. The selected area was measured in mm<sup>2</sup> (note that in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>], a simple conversion mistake led to erroneous μm<sup>2</sup> units) as a representation of egg size. This two-dimensional measure of egg size directly corresponds to egg mass, assuming a cylindrical egg shape, and is more precise than weight determination on any scale available to us. During our measures of hundreds of eggs, we did not observe any obvious deviations from a cylindrical egg shape, but any such deviations would make our measures imprecise.</p><p>From an original 16 queens, 11 were successfully mated and started egg laying in their respective ‘medium’ colonies. After 2 weeks and two egg-size measurements (on June 12 and 19, 2020), six of these queens were transferred to ‘small’ colonies, while the remaining five were transferred to ‘large’ colonies. After 2 weeks of acclimation, another two egg-size measurements from each queen were performed (on July 7 and 14, 2020, = week 3 and week 4) before reciprocally transferring queens between ‘small’ and ‘large’ colonies. This transfer was survived by five queens ending up in ‘small’ colonies and three queens in ‘large’ colonies. After another 2 weeks of acclimation, egg size of these remaining queens was measured as before (on August 4 and 11, 2020, = week 5 and week 6). In addition to egg size, the number of eggs laid over 15 hr by queens was determined.</p><p>Egg-size differences among queens at the beginning of the experiment were tested by simple ANOVA across all queens. Overall changes in average egg size and number between the first and second week of the experiment were assessed by a paired <italic>t</italic>-tests, which also assessed individual consistency by correlation. Subsequent egg-size changes were assessed separately for each queen between sample points by simple ANOVA. The relation between average egg size and egg number was assessed by Pearson’s correlation at each sample point separately. All statistical tests were performed in IBM’s SPSS 28.0, and significance values were determined by bootstrapping.</p><p>At the conclusion of this experiment, all surviving queens were weighed and sacrificed for determination of their body size and ovary weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and subsequent analyses of the ovary proteome. To increase sample size, two additional queens were transferred from ‘medium’ colonies and housed in ‘small’ colonies for 2 weeks before including them in these analyses. Queens were captured alive and weighed in a pre-weighed 1.5 ml tube centrifuge tube to the nearest microgram. We determine fresh weight because this measure is often used in practice even though it varies on a short-term basis with feeding, defecation, and oviposition. After cold anesthetization, both forewings were detached from the queens and mounted on a microscope slide to determine the distance between the distal end of the marginal cell and the intersection of the Cu1 and 2m-cu veins as a representative size measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Waddington, 1989</xref>). The values from both wings were averaged. This measure provides a well-defined and highly repeatable measure of wing size, which integrates length and width and is largely unaffected by wing wear. Subsequently, the ovary was dissected from the chilled abdomen, weighed, and frozen at –80°C for proteome profiling (see below). Great care was taken to avoid contamination with other tissues, and we cannot exclude the possibility that small parts of the ovary were discarded with the surrounding tissue, although the relatively large size of the honey bee queen ovary makes gross mistakes in determining ovary weight due to such errors negligible.</p><p>A simpler, additional experiment was conducted to perform another comparison of queen- and ovary weight between queens in ‘small’ and ‘large’ colonies in order to gather more ovaries from these treatment groups for proteome profiling. Accordingly, sister queens were reared from a randomly selected mother in the UNCG apiary. After their maturation into ovipositing queens in ‘medium’ colonies, four were successfully introduced into ‘small’ colonies and four others into ‘large’ colonies. After 2 weeks, the production of large and small eggs respectively was confirmed for all eight accepted queens and queens were compared with regard to their body weight, body size, and ovary weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The ovaries of these queen were also collected and stored at –80°C for proteome profiling.</p><p>A third study of ovary size was performed with all queens at the end of the RNAi knockdown experiment (see below). For this purpose, the body weight, wing size, and ovary weight of the 12 queens were measured as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In this instance, the body weight was measured before injection, while the wing size and ovary weight were measured after injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Oviposition restriction experiment</title><p>Prompted by the equivocal evidence for a negative correlation between egg size and egg-laying rate in the first experiment and the lack of such a correlation in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amiri et al., 2020</xref>), we explicitly tested the hypothesis that egg size is an invariant consequence of the egg-laying rate of honey bee queens. Eight sister queens were reared from a randomly selected source in the IAR apiary in July 2021, introduced as mature queen cells to ‘medium’ colonies for emergence, mating, and initiation of oviposition. Subsequently, the queens were transferred into ‘large’ colonies, and 2 weeks after acceptance their egg sizes were measured as described above. Subsequently, queens were randomly split into an oviposition restriction group and an unmanipulated control group. Queens in the oviposition restriction group were caged in push-in queen cages (36 cm × 18 cm) on top of capped brood combs without empty cells as egg-laying opportunities. Thus, queens in this treatment group experienced normal colony conditions without an opportunity to lay eggs, while the control queens were left unmanipulated. Immediately after these 2 weeks, all queens were caged on identical sections of comb with empty cells to measure their egg sizes again. Each queen was evaluated separately for significant differences in egg size between the start and end of the experiment with a simple ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Colony extension experiment</title><p>To clarify how colony size influences queen oviposition, we tested whether physical contact or material transfers are necessary to alter the size of eggs produced by the queen. Six sister queens were reared from a randomly selected mother in the IAR apiary in July 2021. After maturation (as described above), these queens were introduced into ‘small’ colonies. After an acclimation period of 2 weeks, egg sizes produced by all queens were determined twice as described above (15<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> of August 2021). The colonies were randomly divided into two groups and connected via a double-screened tunnel to a ‘medium’ hive that contained either empty comb (control) or a ‘mMedium’ colony with corresponding amounts of food, brood, and workers, but no queen (treatment). Tunnels were 3 cm long, 10 cm wide, and 20 cm high. Both ends were screened with fine wire mesh to prevent any physical contact among the workers in opposing hives. Worker drifting between hives was prevented by pointing the hive entrances of the two connected units to opposite directions, as well as coloring and designing the entrances differently. One week later, egg-size measurements were performed (30<sup>th</sup> of August) and repeated once after an additional week (4<sup>th</sup> of September).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ovary proteome analysis</title><p>In an unbiased search for differences, the protein content of ovaries that produce small eggs (from queens in ‘large’ colonies) and ovaries that produce large eggs (from queens in ‘small’ colonies) was studied with a label-free LC-MS/MS approach. A total of 18 ovaries, collected during the two UNCG experiments described above, were included. For both groups (small-egg-producing queens and large-egg-producing queens), nine ovaries were pooled randomly into three biological replicates.</p><p>Total protein was extracted using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay, and the general quality of extracted proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. An aliquot of 200 μg of protein from each pool was reduced with DTT (final concentration 10 mM) for 1 hr, then alkalized with iodoacetamide (final concentration 50 mM) for 1 hr in the dark. Thereafter, protein samples were digested at 37°C overnight with sequencing-grade trypsin (enzyme: protein (w/w) = 1:50). The digestion was stopped by adding 1 μl of formic acid then desalted using C18 columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The desalted peptide samples were dried and dissolved in 0.1% formic acid in distilled water, then quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at –80°C for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Buﬀer A (0.1% formic acid/water) and buﬀer B (0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile in water) were used as mobile phase buffers. Peptides were separated using a reversed-phase trap column (2 cm long, 100 μm inner diameter, filled with 5.0 μm Aqua C18 beads; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an analytical column (15 cm long, 75 μm inner diameter, filled with 3 μm Aqua C18 beads; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 350 nl/min with the following 120 min gradients: from 3 to 8% buffer B in 5 min, from 8 to 20% buffer B in 80 min, from 20 to 30% buffer B in 20 min, from 30 to 90% buffer B in 5 min, and remaining at 90% buffer B for 10 min. The eluted peptides were injected into the mass spectrometer via a nano-ESI source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ion signals were collected in a data-dependent mode and run with the following settings: scan range: m/z 300–1800; full scan resolution: 70,000; AGC target: 3E6; MIT: 20 ms. For MS/MS mode, the following settings were used. Scan resolution: 17,500; AGC target: 1E5; MIT: 60 ms; isolation window: 2 m/z; normalized collision energy: 27; loop count 10; dynamic exclusion: 30 s; dynamic exclusion with a repeated count: 1; charge exclusion: unassigned, 1, 8, &gt;8; peptide match: preferred; exclude isotopes: on. The corresponding raw data were retrieved using Xcalibur 3.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>The extracted MS/MS spectra were searched against the protein database of <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (23,430 sequences, from NCBI) appended with the common repository of adventitious proteins (cRAP, 115 sequences, from The Global Proteome Machine Organization) using PEAKS 8.5 software (Bioinformatics Solutions, Canada). The search parameters were ion mass tolerance, 20.0 ppm using monoisotopic mass; fragment ion mass tolerance, 0.05 Da; enzyme, trypsin; allow nonspecific cleavage at none end of the peptide; maximum missed cleavages per peptide, 2; fixed modification, carbamidomethylation (C, +57.02); variable modifications, oxidation (M, +15.99); maximum allowed variable PTM per peptide, 3. A fusion target-decoy approach was used for the estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) and controlled at ≤1.0% (−10 log p≥20.0) both at peptide and protein levels. Proteins were identified based on at least one unique peptide.</p><p>Quantitative comparison of the egg proteome between the two experimental groups was performed by the label-free approach embedded in PEAKS Q module. Feature detection was performed separately on each sample by using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The features of the same peptide from different samples were reliably aligned together using a high-performance retention time alignment algorithm. Significance was calculated by ANOVA, using a threshold of p≤0.01. Results were visualized as a heatmap using TBtools software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), clustering based on Euclidean distance and the ‘complete’ method.

Two-sided hypergeometric test (enrichment/depletion) with p-value≤0.05 was used followed by Bonferroni correction. The GO tree interval was set between 3 and 8, with minimum of five genes and 1% of genes. Kappa score ≥ 0.4 was applied to generate term–term interrelations and functional groups based on shared genes between the terms. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was done in Metascape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metascape.org/">http://metascape.org/</ext-link>) with default settings: minimum overlap, 3; p-value cutoff, 0.01; minimum enrichment, 1.5.</p><p>For the exploration of functional protein connections involved in the major enriched biological process terms, PPI networks were constructed among the differing proteins in STRING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>). A full STRING network was built with medium confidence (0.4) and FDR &lt; 5%. The PPI networks were visualized using Cytoscape (version 3.8.2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Examination of expression patterns of <italic>Rho1</italic></title><p>Based on the proteomic analyses, the small GTPase <italic>Rho1</italic> emerged as a candidate regulator of egg size during honey bee oogenesis, which motivated us to study its expression patterns in the ovary and inside the oocyte by RNAscope in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The probes were designed and prepared by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD, Inc, Hayward, USA), and an RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent kit (ACD) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. Immediately following dissection, the ovary tissues of randomly selected, mature queens from the IAR apiary were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 32 hr at room temperature (RT). Thereafter, the samples were dehydrated using a standard ethanol series, followed by xylene. The dehydrated samples were embedded in paraffin and then cut into 1 µm sections using an RM2235 microtome (Leica, Germany) that were gently deposited onto glass microscope slides. The slides were then baked for 1 hr at 60°C and deparaffinized at RT. The sections were treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at RT and then washed with fresh distilled water.</p><p>Subsequently, the target retrieval step was performed using 1× RNAscope target retrieval reagent. The slides were air-dried briefly and then boundaries were drawn around each section using a hydrophobic pen (ImmEdge pen; Vector Laboratories, USA). After hydrophobic boundaries had dried, the sections were incubated in protease IV reagent for 2 min, followed by a 1× PBS wash. Each slide was then placed in a prewarmed humidity control tray (ACD) containing dampened filter paper and incubated in a mixture of Channel 1 probes (<italic>Rho1</italic>, ACD Cat #1061331-C1) for 2 hr in the HybEZ oven (ACD) at 40°C. Following probe incubation, the slides were washed two times in 1× RNAscope wash buffer and returned to the oven for 30 min after submersion in AMP-1 reagent. Washes and hybridization were repeated using AMP-2, AMP-3, and HRP-C1 reagents with a 30 min, 15 min, and 15 min incubation period, respectively. The slides were then submerged in TSA Plus FITC and returned to the oven for 30 min. After washing two times in 1× RNAscope wash buffer, the slides were incubated with HRP blocker for 15 min in the oven at 40°C. Finally, the slides were washed two times in 1× RNAscope wash buffer and incubated with DAPI for 1 min. The images were visualized with a Leica SP8 (Leica) confocal microscope and acquired with the sequence program of the Leica LAS X software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNAi-mediated downregulation of <italic>Rho1</italic></title><p>To test the hypothesis that <italic>Rho1</italic> expression controls the size of the eggs that honey bee queens produce, we investigated the effects of RNAi-mediated downregulation of <italic>Rho1</italic>. Four specific siRNAs targeting Rho1 of <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (GenBank: LOC409910) were designed and synthesized by GenePharma RNAi Company (Shanghai, China). Scrambled siRNA of random sequence was used as a negative control (GenePharma). For all siRNA sequences, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>.</p><p>Twelve sister queens were produced from a random source hives of the IAR apiary. They were introduced into ‘medium’ colonies to mate and establish egg laying. When a regular laying pattern was established, the size of the eggs produced by all queens was measured as described above. Then, queens were randomly divided into two groups of six that were either introduced into ‘small’ or ‘large’ colonies. Two weeks after queen acceptance, egg-size measurements were repeated. One day later, three queens in each group were randomly selected and injected with 1 µl/queen of <italic>Rho1</italic>-siRNA mix (mixture of the four <italic>Rho1</italic>-siRNAs, 1 µg/µl), and the other three were injected with 1 µl/queen of scrambled siRNA (1 µg/µl). The queens were transferred to the laboratory and narcotized with CO<sub>2</sub> before injection. Injections were made dorsally between the fourth and fifth abdominal segment of queens using a microliter syringe (NanoFil; World Precision Instruments, USA) coupled with a 35G needle (NF35BV-2; World Precision Instruments). Injected queens were given time to recover and placed back into their original colonies. Egg-size measurements for each queen were performed 3 days after injection, and control or treatment effects on egg size were tested separately for each queen by comparing the sizes produced before and after RNAi injection.</p><p>To assess the efficacy of RNAi knockdown of <italic>Rho1</italic> and investigate the correlation between ovary size and <italic>Rho1</italic> expression, the expression of <italic>Rho1</italic> was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Queens were anesthetized before dissection of the ovary for weight measurement (see above) and subsequent RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and RT-qPCR according to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2021</xref>). The average of three technical replicates were computed and used in subsequent analyses. Reference genes were evaluated by GeNorm analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vandesompele et al., 2002</xref>) that indicated all evaluated reference genes (<italic>Arfgap3</italic>, <italic>CylD</italic>, <italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>Keap1</italic>, <italic>Kto</italic>, <italic>mRPL44</italic>, <italic>RpA-70</italic>, <italic>Rpn2</italic>) had high expression stability expression across samples (M-values &lt; 0.4). Following GeNorm’s recommendation, we used <italic>Arfgap3</italic> and <italic>CylD</italic> to calculate relative gene expression as 2^-ΔΔCt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>). A corresponding analysis to confirm the correlation between <italic>Rho1</italic> and egg size was performed in a second set of 12 queens without RNAi exposure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Egg-size measurements from queen ovary comparison experiments.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Proteins of difference abundance.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology results of upregulated proteins in large-egg-producing ovaries.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp3-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>KEGG pathway results of upregulated proteins in large-egg-producing ovaries.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp4-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Protein–protein interaction analysis of cytoskeleton organization proteins.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp5-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title><italic>Rho1</italic> expression and egg-size correlation analysis from the RNAi experiment.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp6-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title><italic>Rho1</italic> expression and egg-size correlation analysis using an independent dataset.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp7-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp8"><label>Supplementary file 8.</label><caption><title>Sequence information for RNAi and qPCR.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80499-supp8-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80499-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The LC-MS/MS data and search results were deposited in ProteomeXchange Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org">http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org</ext-link>) under accession number PXD029859.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editorss, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Seth Donoughe (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted the comments below to help you prepare a revised submission if you choose to do resubmit your work to <italic>eLife</italic>. Overall the reviewers agreed that your study was interesting, but that extensive revisions and/or additional data are needed to justify the current conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise and qualify the conclusions on the role of Rho1 as a key regulator for egg size, in line with comments from Reviewers 2 and 3. Specifically, there is a need to better justify the idea that Rho1 is a &quot;social mediator&quot; of egg size as proposed in the title.</p><p>2) Revise the section describing an effort to investigate the effects of egg-laying rate on egg size. To test this, you would need to compare queens in which egg-laying rate was experimentally increased or decreased to those where it was not. The presented manipulation instead compares queens in which egg-laying was ceased completely. If more appropriate data for this key question can be added please do so. Or the conclusions must be revised to better reflect the actual manipulation.</p><p>3) A table or other system to allow readers to better keep track of the experimental manipulations of each queen and their use in the proteomic analyses (see Reviewer 2 comment 2).</p><p>4) Greater clarity on the relationship between body size and egg size. You may follow the recommendation of Reviewer 2 (Comment 3): &quot;Please add a scatter plot of wing size vs. baseline ovary size and wing size vs. baseline egg size (one point per queen). This will help your readership to better understand what is giving rise to the individual-level and species-level variation in egg and ovary size. Also, please add a few sentences to the Results to explain why you selected these traits to measure from each queen: that particular landmark to landmark distance on the wings, ovary weight, and this method of egg size measurement; also please include a sentence or two to summarize any important limitations of these selected measures.&quot;</p><p>5) More data or justification on the fate of larger vs smaller eggs in honey bees, so that the likely ecological and evolutionary significance of the reported changes in egg size is clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study makes several new contributions to our understanding of maternal control of egg size in honey bees. It seems reasonable to assume that larger eggs compensate in some way for smaller colonies (e.g. offset in some way the better provisioning given to newly-hatched larva in larger colonies?) but the actual significance of egg size is not much discussed in this study. I was left wondering whether larger worker eggs have been previously established to have higher survival in honey bees (if so, citations of those studies are needed) or whether this remains an assumed outcome of differences in egg size. Either way, I recommend more in the Intro or Discussion reflecting on the possible importance of egg size for fitness in the context of the honey bee life cycle.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>80: &quot;..an adaptation to the colonial life cycle of honey bees but maybe more generally applicable to other oviparous animals.&quot; How might social cues affect oviparous animals that do not live in social groups?</p><p>86: Cite your previous study here when you refer to it.</p><p>88: Give N here and elsewhere in Results when treatments are first introduced (several times I had to scroll down to Methods in order to find information about sample sizes).</p><p>119-126: I appreciate the effort here to experimentally investigate whether egg size is affected by egg-laying rate, but the question does not seem to be entirely answered. In this experiment, queens from large colonies are restricted from any egg-laying and then have their eggs measured again once egg-laying resumes. This is not really the same as simulating ongoing lower egg-laying rate (as might be experienced by a queen in a small colony). Your conclusion from this section is that egg size is not a by-product of higher or lower egg number, but is that saying that the two (number and size) are unrelated? Overall, I think the question of whether this important trade-off exists in honey bees warrants more discussion.</p><p>187: &quot;All eggs appeared to be viable and differed phenotypically only in size&quot; – was the viability of at least some eggs confirmed?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) Explanations for general readers. Given the broad readership of this journal, and the wide interest that there will be for this topic and your findings, we ask that you make the Results more approachable to readers who are not familiar with culturing honeybees. For instance at the beginning of the Results section, please give a general explanation of how these experiments are done. Some questions that a non-specialist reader will have: Can queens be moved between colonies that they did not found? When a queen was moved into a new colony, did the previous queen need to be removed first? What are sister queens, and is it important that sister queens be used for this sort of experiment? Also please give a few sentences of explanation to contextualize the categories of small, medium, and large colonies. How do these sizes compare to average/healthy colony sizes? Does the number of queens in a colony increase with colony size, is it controlled here?</p><p>(2) Clarity in how you refer to treatments. I had some difficulty keeping track of the different treatments. Please add a table in which each row represents a distinct treatment. Make a unique text label for each unique treatment, and then give the relevant treatment details (E.g. &quot;R1&quot; : &quot;Queen spent A days in colony of B size, then spent C days in colony of D size, then spent E days in colony of F size&quot;). Then in the text you can use the labels to refer readers to the exact treatments (&quot;We did proteomic analysis on queens from groups R1 and R2&quot;), and then you can use more colloquial language to describe the results (&quot;The ovaries that made large eggs were enriched with…&quot;). Once this has been done, use these labels to make the figures clearer. Namely, in a given figure, all points that were from the same treatment group should be given the same color, and each individual queen from that treatment group should have a distinct symbol shape.</p><p>(3) Wing size, ovary size, and interindividual variation. The data that have been collected-wing size, ovary size, and egg size for all the queens-can help to shed light on sources of egg size variation. Wing size cannot change during adulthood and so it can be treated as a measure of overall size/nutrition during initial queen maturation, while ovary size and egg size are the factors that respond to the environmental condition. Please add a scatter plot of wing size vs. baseline ovary size and wing size vs. baseline egg size (one point per queen). This will help your readership to better understand what is giving rise to the individual-level and species-level variation in egg and ovary size. Also, please add a few sentences to the Results to explain why you selected these traits to measure from each queen: that particular landmark to landmark distance on the wings, ovary weight, and this method of egg size measurement; also please include a sentence or two to summarize any important limitations of these selected measures.</p><p>(4) How does the shape of eggs change when egg size changes?</p><p>(5) Do you have data on the number of ovarioles for any of the queens? If so, please add a plot showing the relationship between ovariole number and baseline egg size.</p><p>(6) This is a more detailed explanation for a comment I made in the Public Review. The experiment that is described as studying &quot;egg laying rate&quot; does not really address egg laying rate. As I understand it, the queens are moved to a place where there are no suitable places to lay eggs. It seems that the authors are saying that even if the queen can't lay eggs, the eggs don't just get bigger and bigger in the ovaries while they wait, and this is evidence that there isn't a relationship between laying rate and size. Based on the existing literature, I don't think there is any reason to think that restricting oviposition would or could cause an increase in egg size. In general, when insects don't have a good oviposition site, they pause oogenesis, resorb the eggs, or lay the eggs anyway (in a non-suitable oviposition site). The cleaner way to ask if there is a relationship between egg size and laying rate is to start by quantifying it in your size-manipulation experiments. Why not just count how many eggs the queens are laying per [unit of time] in the big and small colonies? If you do not have the data for that, that's fine, but that is certainly what researchers generally do when studying egg laying rate. Bottom line: this experiment does answer some other interesting questions, but not about egg-laying rate. Please re-frame this section in terms of &quot;restricted oviposition&quot; or some other phrase that you prefer.</p><p>(7) Please be sure sample sizes are included throughout the text and in figure legends (egg measurements and individual queens), and in the new table recommended in Major Point (2).</p><p>(8) Include some discussion of the stages of oogenesis in the Results and/or Discussion. When an adult is increasing or decreasing the size of the eggs she lays, this is most likely happening by changing the amount of time that the developing eggs spend in one or more stages of oogenesis (and the leading candidate would be the period of vitellogenesis, presumably). This is also the simplest explanation for the differences in protein expression levels. In the sections on proteomics, gene expression patterns, and/or RNAi, consider if any discussion of this topic might be informative and if so include it. It is probably beyond the scope of this project to carefully analyze the process of oogenesis that gives rise to the various sizes, but that would be a very interesting future direction. On a related point, I am quite confused by the ovary weight finding. How does the ovary weigh less with bigger eggs? Are there fewer eggs? That is what I assumed but I could be wrong. Please include a bit more discussion of this surprising finding, in the Results or Discussion.</p><p>(9) I am excited about the authors' idea that this is life history without the nutrition limitations, but it will be helpful to give readers a little information about queen nutrition (in the Results and/or Discussion). How would her amount of food differ between small and large colonies? Do 10x more workers means she eats 10x as much?</p><p>(10) A few relevant sources to cite. There is another instance of plastic changes to eggs during insect oogenesis in response to perception: Abram, Paul K., et al. &quot;An insect with selective control of egg coloration.&quot; Current Biology 25.15 (2015): 2007-2011. Also there was a recent effort to determine if egg size is related to egg number (or other things), and it does include social insects (see lines 41-42): Church, Samuel H., et al. &quot;Repeated loss of variation in insect ovary morphology highlights the role of development in life-history evolution.&quot; Proceedings of the Royal Society B 288.1950 (2021): 20210150.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Two major conclusions are drawn in the manuscript by Han et al.: (1) that queens predictably and reversibly increase egg size in small colonies and decrease egg size in large colonies, while their ovary size changes in the opposite direction; and (2) that Rho1 is a candidate regulator of egg size. The Authors interpret these two findings in the following way (Lines 201 and 202): &quot;we identify the cytoskeleton organizer Rho1 as a key regulator of the active egg size adjustment of honey bee queens.&quot; While I admire the work that Authors have done here, I have the following major concerns:</p><p>Major Concern # 1: The authors knock down Rho1 using RNAi and find that it reduces egg size in both large and small colony sizes relative to those observed in medium colony sizes. The Authors interpret this finding in two subtly different ways. The first is that Rho1 is a candidate regulator of egg size. This I agree with, although it is not surprising that Rho1 may be one of many factors regulating egg size given its role in cytoskeletal organization. The second interpretation is that &quot;Rho1 as a key regulator of the active egg size adjustment of honey bee queens.&quot; This interpretation suggests that Rho1 is responsive to and &quot;mediates&quot; social cues from the queen and adjusts egg size accordingly. This would be a more exciting interpretation (one that would be worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>), but in my view, the data do not support this second interpretation / conclusion. What I mean is that the data do not support a role for Rho1 as a 'plasticity gene' that mediates the responsiveness of eggs to social cues from the queen and then determines egg size according to colony size. If this were the case, I would have expected knockdown of Rho1 to reduce eggsize in small colonies and to INCREASE egg size in large colonies similar to that observed in medium colony sizes. Instead, Rho1 decreases egg size regardless of social circumstance, indicating that it only plays a role in regulating egg size, regardless of any social regulation. The Authors could have used their finding that egg size is reversible in response to colony size to see if knockdown of Rho1 would halt this reversibility. In summary, I do not believe that the Authors have sufficiently demonstrated that Rho1 &quot;mediates&quot; social regulation of egg size plasticity as their title suggests &quot;Social Regulation of Egg Size Plasticity in the Honey Bee is Mediated by Cytoskeleton Organizer Rho1.&quot;</p><p>Major Concern # 2: I found the reported correlation between egg size and colony size very exciting and arresting, but this has already been published in this excellent article: Amiri, E., Le, K., Melendez, C.V., Strand, M.K., Tarpy, D.R., and Rueppell, O. (2020). Egg-size plasticity in <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>: Honey bee queens alter egg size in response to both genetic and environmental factors. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 33, 534-543. The results added to this manuscript (reversibility of egg size plasticity and induction of egg size plasticity in response to queen perception) are very interesting, but I would classify them as incremental additions.</p><p>Major Concern # 3: Finally, the evolutionary significance of egg size plasticity in response to colony size remains unclear. The Authors claim that these size differences are a result of differences in maternal provisioning. But can they really make such an interpretation without knowing if smaller eggs (large colonies) develop into smaller adult workers and if larger eggs (small colonies) develop into larger adult workers? In other social insects, like fire ants, the size of adult workers tends to increase with colony size. The logic is that as colonies increase in size, they bring more resources to the colonies and they can invest more in each individual. However, without knowing the final adult body sizes, it would be difficult to make strong inferences about what is happening exactly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80499.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise and qualify the conclusions on the role of Rho1 as a key regulator for egg size, in line with comments from Reviewers 2 and 3.

In addition, we have extracted additional data on the queens’ egg laying rate in our first experiment. These results show indeed a negative correlation between egg size and egg number in some circumstances but not in others. Thus, they complicate the interpretation of our findings and partially contradict our earlier study. However, we think that they are important to present in light of the reviewers’ concerns and for a comprehensive view of the reproductive behavior of honey bee queens. We have revised the discussion and conclusions accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A table or other system to allow readers to better keep track of the experimental manipulations of each queen and their use in the proteomic analyses (see Reviewer 2 comment 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 1 to better explain the experimental manipulations and give the readers an intuitive and immediate overview of the experimental manipulations. We have also added clarification of which exact samples were used in the proteomic analysis. However, a comprehensive table or other system to label treatment and control groups across all experiments would not help readers in our opinion, as explained in more detail below (reviewer 2 comment 2).

We have also investigated the relationship between body size (measured as wing size) and egg size. We conducted correlation analyses separately for eggs produced in small, medium, and large colonies and report these results now at the end of the first section in the “Results”. However, in light of our results that there is no relation between queen size and egg size (all correlations are non-significant), we do not think that an additional figure is warranted. The additionally suggested graph of baseline ovary size vs body size could not be generated because baseline ovary size could not be determined: The required destructive assay (dissection) was only performed at the end of the experiments, when queens were either in small or large colonies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) More data or justification on the fate of larger vs smaller eggs in honey bees, so that the likely ecological and evolutionary significance of the reported changes in egg size is clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Our initial discovery of the egg size plasticity in honey bees (Amiri et al. 2020) and work by other authors that we cite (e.g., Al-Kahtani and Bienefeld 2021) already document positive effects of large eggs.

For example, the proteomic comparison was performed between queens housed in small and large colonies (producing large and small eggs correspondingly), mixing queens from the first experiment (that had been transferred repeatedly) and queens from the second experiment (with only one transfer) to increase sample size. How long these queens were kept in which colony is described in the Methods section and is also depicted on the x-axis of Figure 1, 3, 4, and 8, but a letter designation (as suggested) is not possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Wing size, ovary size, and interindividual variation. The data that have been collected-wing size, ovary size, and egg size for all the queens-can help to shed light on sources of egg size variation. Wing size cannot change during adulthood and so it can be treated as a measure of overall size/nutrition during initial queen maturation, while ovary size and egg size are the factors that respond to the environmental condition. Please add a scatter plot of wing size vs. baseline ovary size and wing size vs. baseline egg size (one point per queen). This will help your readership to better understand what is giving rise to the individual-level and species-level variation in egg and ovary size. Also, please add a few sentences to the Results to explain why you selected these traits to measure from each queen: that particular landmark to landmark distance on the wings, ovary weight, and this method of egg size measurement; also please include a sentence or two to summarize any important limitations of these selected measures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional analyses to show that individual body size variation is unrelated to egg size. In light of the non-significant results, we do not think that an additional figure is warranted. We have added justification for each of the measures in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) How does the shape of eggs change when egg size changes?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not notice any size-dependent shape changes. However, we did not specifically investigate this and therefore cannot speculate on possibly subtle allometries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Do you have data on the number of ovarioles for any of the queens? If so, please add a plot showing the relationship between ovariole number and baseline egg size.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not determine the ovariole numbers of the queens involved in this study. To the best of our knowledge, the ovariole number does not change during adult life and thus this trait was not considered important for egg size plasticity, the key aspect of our study. We understand that this trait is very important in comparative context (e.g., Church et al. 2021), social insect caste polymorphism (Wilson 1971) and social organization of honey bee workers (Page et al. 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) This is a more detailed explanation for a comment I made in the Public Review. The experiment that is described as studying &quot;egg laying rate&quot; does not really address egg laying rate. As I understand it, the queens are moved to a place where there are no suitable places to lay eggs. It seems that the authors are saying that even if the queen can't lay eggs, the eggs don't just get bigger and bigger in the ovaries while they wait, and this is evidence that there isn't a relationship between laying rate and size. Based on the existing literature, I don't think there is any reason to think that restricting oviposition would or could cause an increase in egg size. In general, when insects don't have a good oviposition site, they pause oogenesis, resorb the eggs, or lay the eggs anyway (in a non-suitable oviposition site). The cleaner way to ask if there is a relationship between egg size and laying rate is to start by quantifying it in your size-manipulation experiments. Why not just count how many eggs the queens are laying per [unit of time] in the big and small colonies? If you do not have the data for that, that's fine, but that is certainly what researchers generally do when studying egg laying rate. Bottom line: this experiment does answer some other interesting questions, but not about egg-laying rate. Please re-frame this section in terms of &quot;restricted oviposition&quot; or some other phrase that you prefer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have followed it by retrieving the data of how many eggs were actually produced in the first experiment while queens were housed in different sized colonies. In contrast to our previous study, these data show indeed a negative relation between egg size and egg number, at least in 3 out of the 6 experimental weeks. We have added this result and modified the manuscript accordingly. However, we want to note here that the negative relation between the two does not mean that they are causally linked. Instead, they could be co-regulated by an upstream process. In this context, the experimental restriction of oviposition is a valuable addition because this experiment shows that egg laying rate and egg size can be decoupled even if this occurs under unnatural circumstances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Please be sure sample sizes are included throughout the text and in figure legends (egg measurements and individual queens), and in the new table recommended in Major Point (2).</p></disp-quote><p>In the text, we now specify sample sizes when they cannot be inferred from the degrees of freedom in the test statistics. We also now indicate sample sizes in the legend for figures 2 and 8, where summary statistics instead of individual data points are shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Include some discussion of the stages of oogenesis in the Results and/or Discussion. When an adult is increasing or decreasing the size of the eggs she lays, this is most likely happening by changing the amount of time that the developing eggs spend in one or more stages of oogenesis (and the leading candidate would be the period of vitellogenesis, presumably). This is also the simplest explanation for the differences in protein expression levels. In the sections on proteomics, gene expression patterns, and/or RNAi, consider if any discussion of this topic might be informative and if so include it. It is probably beyond the scope of this project to carefully analyze the process of oogenesis that gives rise to the various sizes, but that would be a very interesting future direction. On a related point, I am quite confused by the ovary weight finding. How does the ovary weigh less with bigger eggs? Are there fewer eggs? That is what I assumed but I could be wrong. Please include a bit more discussion of this surprising finding, in the Results or Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that vitellogenesis is the most likely period in oogenesis to affect egg size and have now added this statement to the discussion. Whether the effect is achieved by a temporal delay during maturation, physiological upregulation of metabolism and transport mechanisms, or other regulatory processes is speculative, but we think that our proteomic results suggest a physiological upregulation instead of a retardation of the egg during vitellogenesis. Additional follow-up studies are needed…</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) I am excited about the authors' idea that this is life history without the nutrition limitations, but it will be helpful to give readers a little information about queen nutrition (in the Results and/or Discussion). How would her amount of food differ between small and large colonies? Do 10x more workers means she eats 10x as much?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an exciting research topic. Unfortunately, not much is known yet and we have now included that statement in the text to stimulate further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) A few relevant sources to cite. There is another instance of plastic changes to eggs during insect oogenesis in response to perception: Abram, Paul K., et al. &quot;An insect with selective control of egg coloration.&quot; Current Biology 25.15 (2015): 2007-2011. Also there was a recent effort to determine if egg size is related to egg number (or other things), and it does include social insects (see lines 41-42): Church, Samuel H., et al. &quot;Repeated loss of variation in insect ovary morphology highlights the role of development in life-history evolution.&quot; Proceedings of the Royal Society B 288.1950 (2021): 20210150.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for those suggestions. The plastic modulation of egg coloration by stinkbugs is certainly an exciting finding but we had trouble finding a relevant connection to our study and thus did not incorporate it. However, the Church et al. study is highly relevant (but wasn’t published when our manuscript was first written) and thus is now cited to put our study into this broader context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Two major conclusions are drawn in the manuscript by Han et al.: (1) that queens predictably and reversibly increase egg size in small colonies and decrease egg size in large colonies, while their ovary size changes in the opposite direction; and (2) that Rho1 is a candidate regulator of egg size. The Authors interpret these two findings in the following way (Lines 201 and 202): &quot;we identify the cytoskeleton organizer Rho1 as a key regulator of the active egg size adjustment of honey bee queens.&quot; While I admire the work that Authors have done here, I have the following major concerns:</p><p>Major Concern # 1: The authors knock down Rho1 using RNAi and find that it reduces egg size in both large and small colony sizes relative to those observed in medium colony sizes. The Authors interpret this finding in two subtly different ways. The first is that Rho1 is a candidate regulator of egg size. This I agree with, although it is not surprising that Rho1 may be one of many factors regulating egg size given its role in cytoskeletal organization. The second interpretation is that &quot;Rho1 as a key regulator of the active egg size adjustment of honey bee queens.&quot; This interpretation suggests that Rho1 is responsive to and &quot;mediates&quot; social cues from the queen and adjusts egg size accordingly. This would be a more exciting interpretation (one that would be worthy of publication in eLife), but in my view, the data do not support this second interpretation / conclusion. What I mean is that the data do not support a role for Rho1 as a 'plasticity gene' that mediates the responsiveness of eggs to social cues from the queen and then determines egg size according to colony size. If this were the case, I would have expected knockdown of Rho1 to reduce eggsize in small colonies and to INCREASE egg size in large colonies similar to that observed in medium colony sizes. Instead, Rho1 decreases egg size regardless of social circumstance, indicating that it only plays a role in regulating egg size, regardless of any social regulation. The Authors could have used their finding that egg size is reversible in response to colony size to see if knockdown of Rho1 would halt this reversibility. In summary, I do not believe that the Authors have sufficiently demonstrated that Rho1 &quot;mediates&quot; social regulation of egg size plasticity as their title suggests &quot;Social Regulation of Egg Size Plasticity in the Honey Bee is Mediated by Cytoskeleton Organizer Rho1.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the clarification, understand the distinction made by the reviewer, and agree that we need to be more precise about which conclusions can and which cannot be drawn based on our results. However, we do not understand the argument that Rho1 knockdown should increase egg size in large colonies and reduce egg size in small colonies to be involved in egg size determination. In our view such context-dependency could be a possibility but is not a requirement of Rho1 regulating egg size in response to colony size. Nevertheless, we have generally cautioned our conclusions with regard to Rho1 as explained above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Concern # 2: I found the reported correlation between egg size and colony size very exciting and arresting, but this has already been published in this excellent article: Amiri, E., Le, K., Melendez, C.V., Strand, M.K., Tarpy, D.R., and Rueppell, O. (2020). Egg-size plasticity in Apis mellifera: Honey bee queens alter egg size in response to both genetic and environmental factors. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 33, 534-543. The results added to this manuscript (reversibility of egg size plasticity and induction of egg size plasticity in response to queen perception) are very interesting, but I would classify them as incremental additions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of our initial discovery. However, we disagree with the assessment that the reported results are just an incremental addition to our previous study because we report several important and novel findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Concern # 3: Finally, the evolutionary significance of egg size plasticity in response to colony size remains unclear. The Authors claim that these size differences are a result of differences in maternal provisioning. But can they really make such an interpretation without knowing if smaller eggs (large colonies) develop into smaller adult workers and if larger eggs (small colonies) develop into larger adult workers? In other social insects, like fire ants, the size of adult workers tends to increase with colony size. The logic is that as colonies increase in size, they bring more resources to the colonies and they can invest more in each individual. However, without knowing the final adult body sizes, it would be difficult to make strong inferences about what is happening exactly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the evolutionary significance of the plasticity (or its adaptive value) is important. In our previous work that is cited by the reviewer above, we found that a larger egg size is associated with reduced offspring mortality. Work by other authors that we cite in the manuscript relates egg size to caste, with larger eggs more likely developing into queens and also into “better” queens. Both of these lines of evidence indicate a beneficial effect of egg size but more studies on the consequences are certainly needed. The study that we present here is focused on the causation and not additional consequences of egg size variation. Thus, we rely on our previous results and inferences from the literature that large eggs are generally advantageous. Our operational hypothesis of the evolutionary significance is that the reported egg size plasticity is an adaptation to the annual colony cycle of honey bees that entails colony size fluctuations and reproductive swarming. However, we find it too speculative to elaborate on these ideas here in this manuscript, which is focused on the proximate causes of the plasticity instead. In contrast to fire ants and some other social insects, the workers of honey bees are quite uniform in size and therefore adult size variation within the worker caste seems an unlikely evolutionary explanation. However, we cannot rule it out and shall investigate this hypothesis in future studies on the consequences of egg size variation in honey bees.</p></body></sub-article></article>
