integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Activated by talin, it interacts with diverse adhesome components, enabling mechanical coupling between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Here we studied the interactions of activated full-length vinculin with actin and the way it regulates the organization and dynamics of the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin network. Through a combination of surface patterning and light microscopy experiments we show that vinculin can bundle dendritic actin networks through rapid binding and filament crosslinking. We show that vinculin promotes stable but flexible actin bundles having a mixed-polarity organization, as confirmed by cryo-electron tomography. Adhesion-like synthetic design of vinculin activation by surface-bound talin revealed that clustered vinculin can initiate and immobilize bundles from mobile Arp2/3-branched networks. Our results provide a molecular basis for coordinate actin bundle formation at nascent adhesions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vinculin</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>cryo-elecron tomography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_179418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medalia</surname><given-names>Ohad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Maxi Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LMAN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medalia</surname><given-names>Ohad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiger</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007316</institution-id><institution>Klaus Tschira Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiger</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>At adhesion sites, talin-activated vinculin promotes interactions with the actin network that initiates bundles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrin-based cell adhesions mediate the interactions of the actin cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (ECM), enabling cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Vinculin, a key adapter protein regulating cell adhesion signaling, contributes to tissue homeostasis, cell morphogenesis, immune processes, and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carisey and Ballestrem, 2011</xref>). Composed of multiple ‘adhesome’ scaffolding and signaling components, integrin adhesions, for example focal adhesions (FAs), are associated with the termini of contractile actin and myosin-rich stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Geiger, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007a</xref>). These assemblies develop in response to external or internal (mostly cytoskeletal) traction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balaban et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Livne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). The mechanism whereby integrin activation leads to FA formation is rather complex, and involves a cascade of conformational transitions of key mechanoresponsive proteins such as talin, vinculin, and FA kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burridge and Connell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carisey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Grashoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Legate et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Roberts and Critchley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Webb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>). During nascent adhesion formation, talin changes its conformation to enable integrin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wegener et al., 2007</xref>). Next, force-sensing proteins such as vinculin are recruited and activated through its tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burridge and Mangeat, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hemmings et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hu et al., 2016</xref>), leading to a series of molecular interactions involving adhesome scaffolding and signaling components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007a</xref>). Furthermore, the association of vinculin with both talin and the actin cytoskeleton generates tension that, in turn, induces conformational changes in vinculin, further activating it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Grashoff et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, vinculin is thought to act as a molecular clutch that couples the actin network to nascent adhesions and FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Case and Waterman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thievessen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Particularly intriguing is the mode of interaction of vinculin with the actin cytoskeleton. In motile cells, vinculin is believed to be involved in the coupling of the retrograde flow of the lamellipodial branched actin network to nascent integrin adhesions, which controls their initiation, maturation and disassembly dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Case et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giannone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Oakes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thievessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007a</xref>). Vinculin was shown to be a mechanosensitive partner involved in FA maturation at the lamellipodium-lamellum border, where it responds to actomyosin-induced tension by increasing growth and robustness of FAs and their associated stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balaban et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Humphries et al., 2007</xref>). Vinculin is a component not only of nascent adhesions and FAs, but also of adherens-type cell-cell junctions, where it also acts as a mechanosensing component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Seddiki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Vinculin is a flexible multidomain protein comprising a seven-helical head domain, a proline-rich linker, and a five-helical bundle tail domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakolitsa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borgon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Molony and Burridge, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Winkler et al., 1996</xref>). In its inactive state, it exists in an auto-inhibitory conformation in which the head interacts with the tail domain of the protein, thus masking many of its functional binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borgon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chorev et al., 2018</xref>). Interaction of vinculin with activated talin, coupled with mechanical perturbation, results in an open vinculin conformation, which enables its binding to various adhesome and cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bois et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brindle et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carisey and Ballestrem, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Case et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">DeMali et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hüttelmaier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jockusch and Isenberg, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Johnson and Craig, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>). While a large body of evidence confirms the pivotal role of vinculin as a mechanosensor and a transducer of actin-generated tension to integrin adhesions throughout their functional states, little is known of how vinculin interacts with and organizes the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton at these sites.</p><p>Here we designed an experimental system to assess interactions of dynamic actin networks with full-length vinculin, in solution and upon vinculin interaction with immobilized talin fragment, resembling an adhesion site. We utilized in vitro reconstitutions of purified proteins to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying vinculin-mediated bundle initiation from branched actin networks. Next, we analyzed the effects of soluble activated vinculin on both dense actin organizations and sparse filament networks, to resolve the effect of actin crowding on vinculin crosslinking. Using reconstituted patterned actin organizations, we showed that activated full-length vinculin slows down lamellipodial branched networks growth and binds cellular-like actin organizations with comparable affinities. Through single filament total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we provide evidence that vinculin remodels Arp2/3 complex-mediated dendritic actin networks. These interactions are dominated by rapid binding of vinculin and fast crosslinking of actin filaments (F-actin) into stable and flexible bundles. Spatial restriction on vinculin activation by surface-bound talin, indicated its ability to interact with mobile Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin networks, modify their organization and to initiate a complex bundle formation. Therefore, our results highlight the ability of vinculin to connect filaments from various actin organizational states and suggest that talin-associated vinculin engages lamellipodial branched networks, from which it can initiate the formation of a stable network of actin bundles at the integrin nascent adhesion sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Talin-activated vinculin alters the organization and dynamics of lamellipodium-like Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin networks</title><p>The lamellipodial actin network is a dynamic and dense mesh made of short and branched filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Svitkina and Borisy, 1999</xref>) capable of opposing the front-edge membrane tension and inducing protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>).

The lamellipodial actin treadmills centripetally and was proposed to be coupled via vinculin to early stages of nascent adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Case and Waterman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thievessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2003</xref>). Yet, how vinculin-F-actin interactions modulate branched network dynamics remains unclear.</p><p>First, we expressed the full-length version of human vinculin in insect cells, since post-translational modifications might be relevant for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Golji et al., 2012</xref>). The activation of the full-length vinculin by the constitutively active vinculin-binding site 1 (VBS1, residues 482–636) of talin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cohen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Papagrigoriou et al., 2004</xref>) allowed its binding to F-actin. Next, we investigated the effect of vinculin-F-actin interactions with branched networks at a density and stiffness that resembles the cellular environment. Using two-dimensional patterns printed on a protein-repellent glass coverslip and functionalized with a nucleation promoting factor (NPF), a C-terminal fragment of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP-pWA), which activates Arp2/3 complex-mediated nucleation of dendritic actin networks. Due to its fast and stable interactions with the actin barbed end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schafer et al., 1996</xref>), CP prevents the expansion of Arp2/3-mediated branches away from the nucleation patterns. Capped actin branches host de novo nucleation by Arp2/3 complex, thereby ensuring the formation of a rigid branched meshwork, the growth of which results in a backward motion of the entire network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boujemaa-Paterski et al., 2017</xref>).

Our findings were in agreement with Leclainche and collaborators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Le Clainche et al., 2010</xref> who used bacterially expressed full-length vinculin.

Since we detected no apparent lag time between filament polymerization and vinculin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), an on-rate constant of vinculin can be approximated to 10 ± 1 µM<sup>−1</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>, as both proteins were used at similar concentrations.

These studies support the current model requiring actin-generated force to unveil key regulatory domains that potentiate their role in adhesion initiation and maturation. However, recent studies propose an alternative pathway to the force-dependent relief of auto-inhibition in talin and vinculin. Vinculin binding site R3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Izard et al., 2004</xref>) was found to be available for vinculin binding in soluble closed talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dedden et al., 2019</xref>), while Paxillin was shown to promote efficient targeting of vinculin to the adhesion site prior to its activation by talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Case et al., 2015</xref>). Recent in vivo reconstitutions confirmed the key role of R3 in the binding of vinculin to talin in a force-independent regime, as well as paxillin association to closed vinculin and talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atherton et al., 2020</xref>). These interactions may form precomplexes at an early-stage nascent adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, in vivo cross-correlated fluctuations analysis producing high-resolution spatial and temporal maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Digman et al., 2009</xref>) showed that talin-vinculin association precedes their recruitment to nascent adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachir et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, Kelley and colleagues showed that phosphoinositides enable talin-vinculin-actin association in a force independent-regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kelley et al., 2020</xref>). The work presented here supports these findings and shows that vinculin, activated in a force-independent regime, can reorganize Arp2/3 complex dendritic networks.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Vinculin bundling properties</title><p>Quantitative and structural analyses of talin VBS1-activated vinculin-induced reorganization of patterned actin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and single filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) revealed fundamental features of vinculin-actin interactions: (i) activated vinculin binds to uniform, mixed-polarity and intermeshed branched actin organizations with a similar affinity; (ii) three-dimensional bundles assembled were characterized by a random polarity neighborhood; (iii) activated vinculin displayed an association rate constant resembling that of actin polymerization and filaments zippering rate of ~0.6 µm/sec.

Vinculin engages the actin retrograde flow, applying tension to the mechanoresponsive components of the adhesion, enabling adhesion self-sustained assembly dynamics and recruitment of additional FA components such as myosin II, α-actinin, and zyxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Case et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thievessen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53990-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Beside vinculin, other actin crosslinkers, for example α-actinin 1, could concomitantly be recruited and function during the formation of nascent adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Otey et al., 1990</xref>).

The microfluidic channel inlet was connected to a PHD 2000Infusion/Withdraw pump (Harvard Apparatus, USA). The flow was set to 25 µL per min. Typically, (1) 0.8–1 µM actin with 18% Alexa568-labeled monomers, 0.5–1 µM vinculin with 30% Alexa488-labeled monomers, 2–4 µM talin VBS1, were supplied in the above-mentioned polymerization buffer from the inlet. (2) At steady state of actin assembly, all soluble components are washed away with five channel volumes, and (3) a solution of a pre-assembled branched actin networks is injected.

Time-lapse imaging of vinculin-actin bundles and branched network started as soon as step (3) was completed.

For each sample, we measured the rates of barbed end elongation of at least ~10 filaments, typically from at least 20–40 frames of imaging over a span of ~200–400 s, using TIRFM. The growth rate of actin filaments was calculated using Multikymograph Fiji software plugins or a matrix-to-8-bit-image conversion program written in MATLAB, Kymographs were generated over the time course of actin assembly along the actin filament or bundle trace. For filaments or bundles that were stable in the observation field, traces were automatically picked using Multikymograph Fiji software plugins. For mobile structures, traces were manually picked. The alignment of filament pointed-end and internal fluorescence speckles of actin filaments in MATLAB-generated kymograghs accounted for the accuracy of the method.</p><p>To measure the zippering velocity of vinculin-induced crosslinking, the length of the zippered region of single filaments was measured over time for in three different experiments where 0.7 to 1.1 µM actin was polymerized in the presence of 600 nM vinculin and 2 µM Talin VBS1, or 300 nM vinculin and 1 µM Talin VBS1, or 300 nM vinculin, 1 µM Talin VBS1, 12 nM Arp2/3 complex and 80 nM WAVE WA. In all three experiments, measured velocities varied within the same range. Determining the number of filaments per vinculin-mediated bundle was conducted by analyzing the fluorescence intensity of bundles using the line-scan tool in Fiji software, and subsequently normalized to the fluorescence intensity of a single actin filament from the same experiment and that was as many times illuminated as the bundle. Additionally, in most cases, time-lapse videos provided bundle formation history hence an evidence from the calculated number of filaments.</p><p>To determine the fluorescence ratio of vinculin to actin within patterned actin networks, we analyzed two color widefield fluorescence images taken after 60 min of actin assembly. (1), we piled, separately, the images for each channel (568 for actin or 488 for vinculin signals) and for each patterned geometry, namely continuous circles and dotted circles where the dot-to-dot distance was 6, 11, or 18 µm. (2), Piled images were then aligned according to the patterned geometry using ‘Template Matching’ plugins of Fiji software. (3), By thresholding the vinculin channel images, we created binary masks to isolate the vinculin-decorated network and filter out the background fluorescence for each channel (568 for actin or 488 for vinculin signals). (4) We then generated ratiometric images (488 fluorescence intensity/568 fluorescence intensity, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), using the default plugins in Fiji. (5) Since we kept constant all illumination parameters and all biochemical parameters of the reconstituted assays (except vinculin concentration that was 0.25 or 0.5 µM), we were able to perform quantitative analyses. For all patterns (&gt;1000), the fluorescence density of actin (from actin fluorescence images) and related vinculin to actin fluorescence ratio (from ratiometric images) were measured for each network along the pixel selections presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. For data analyses, we wrote a MATLAB program to correlate, for each pixel, the vinculin/actin fluorescence ratio to the actin fluorescence density. For each series of pattern geometry (repeated 29 to 70 times), we computed the distribution and the mean value of each network (branched, uniform or mixed polarity) separately. In final statistics, we characterized each type of network by pooling the mean ratio values related to the same actin density value, and calculated their mean and standard deviation, which were plotted as a function of actin fluorescence density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To estimate the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of vinculin to actin networks, we calibrated the fluorescence intensities to the protein concentration using labelled actin or labelled vinculin. Mean fluorescence intensities for 3–5 known protein concentrations were measured and averaged. Calibrations were carried out using pegylated glass and coverslips using the same reaction chamber, volumes and composition as for the experiments. The mean fluorescence intensities were converted into protein concentration in the networks. This allowed to determine a steady state saturation curve showing local concentration of bound vinculin, which represents the local concentration vinculin-actin complex, as a function of local actin concentration. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant was then obtained by fitting the steady state saturation curve using Graphpad software and assuming mass-action binding at equilibrium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Synthesis of tiopronin Monolayer-Protected AuNPs</title><p>Water-soluble tiopronin-protected gold nanoparticles (AuNP-TP) were synthesized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dahan et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, 0.1 g of Gold(III) chloride trihydrate (Sigma–Aldrich) and 0.11 g of N-(2-mercaptopropionyl) glycine (Tiopronin, Cayman Chemical) were dissolved in 13 mL methanol:acetic acid solution (6:1 v/v) and gently stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. 1 mL of 1M sodium borohydride (Acros Organics) in deionized water was prepared and immediately added to the solution. The solution was vigorously stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. The solution was dialyzed against deionized water for 72 hr with a 8–10 kDa Float-a-Lyzer G2 (Spectrum). Dialyzed solution was stored at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Functionalization of tiopronin Monolayer-Protected AuNPs</title><p>AuNP-TPs were coupled to GST-VBS1 in a two-step reaction. First, a concentrated solution of AuNP-TPs (OD = 1 at 520 nm) in 0.1M, pH6 MES buffer were ‘activated’ by incubating with 40 mM EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride, Sigma–Aldrich) and 80 mM sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide, Thermo) in 0.1M pH6 MES buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The volume was increased to 1 mL with 0.1M pH6 MES buffer and concentrated using a 30 kDA MWCO centricon (Millipore). This was repeated twice with 0.1M pH6 MES and twice with 2 mM pH 7.4 sodium phosphate buffer.

In a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ATP, 10 µM Mg-ATP actin monomers were preassembled in the presence 50 nM capping protein α1β2. Thus, the ratio CP:actin monomers was 1:200 yielding filaments of ~0.7 µm in average, unable of end-to-end annealing. Subsequently, 0.5 µM capped actin filaments were incubated for 30 min at 25°C with 1.2 µM full-length vinculin in the presence of 3 µM talin VBS1. When GFP-VBS1 was used, 0.3 µM capped actin filaments were incubated for 1 hr at 25°C with 2 µM vinculin and 8 µM GFP-VBS1. Gold nanoparticles labeling was conducted as followed: 0.3 µM capped actin filaments were incubated for 1 hr at 25°C with 2 µM vinculin, 0.8 µM AuNP-GST-VBS1, and 7.2 µM GST-VBS1. For the experiments using vinculin tail fragment, 0.3 µM capped actin filaments were incubated for 30 min at 25°C with 2.2 µM tail fragment. Next, 4 µL of the reconstituted solution and 1 µL of a 10 nm fiducial gold marker solution (Aurion, Netherlands) was applied onto glow-discharged EM grids coated with a holey carbon mesh (Cu R2/1, 200 mesh, Quantifoil). Finally, the EM grids were manually blotted and plunge frozen in liquid ethane. The EM grids were stored in liquid N<sub>2</sub> until used for cryo-ET data acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cryo-ET data collection</title><p>Cryo-ET data was acquired on a FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, USA) equipped with a GIF Quantum energy filter and a K2-Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, Pleasanton, USA).

Based on the segmentations, 3D coordinates of actin segments were chosen along the filaments with a spacing of 16.5 nm. Next, actin segments were reconstructed into sub-tomograms of 144 × 144×144 voxels, corresponding to a box size of ~50 nm and pixel size of 3.4 Å. A total number of 39,231 actin segments were extracted. The 3D coordinate extraction from segmentations was performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick) and the sub-tomogram reconstruction was performed using the TOM Toolbox.</p><p>Next, the sub-tomograms were aligned parallel to the x-axis. A 22 nm thick central section of the aligned sub-tomograms was projected and an 11 nm thick filamentous mask along the x-axis was applied.</p><p>Subsequently, we performed one round of 2D classification with the pre-aligned using RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Thereby, we removed low-quality particles and false positive particles (e.g. gold markers, background), resulting in a cleaned particle set of 29,643 actin segments. Representative 2D classes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>.</p><p>Next, we subjected these particles to a helical 3D-refinement using RELION, using a cylinder as an initial template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">He and Scheres, 2017</xref>), a helical rise of 27.6 Å and a helical twist of 166.7 degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Galkin et al., 2015</xref>).

The inverted transformations describe how an actin segment is oriented at the position of its extraction in the tomograms. In particular, the first Euler rotation of a segment around the z-axis (termed psi angle) resolves the segments polarity, given that the barbed- and pointed ends can be identified in the reconstructed structure. As expected, histograms of the psi angles show two peaks per bundle, 180° apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>In the next step, we connected the segments back to filaments. In principle, this information is contained in the initial segmentations. However, the automatic segmentation procedure tends to fuse filaments, if they run parallel or cross each other with small distances. Therefore, we manually combined the segments into filaments. When filament continuity within the tomogram was questionable, we kept the smaller pieces, so that an unambiguous assignment was possible. Therefore, this procedure underestimates the length of certain filaments. However, it has no influence on the parameter we investigated in this work, namely the polarity and distances between actin filaments.</p><p>In order to determine the polarity of filaments we plot the segments belonging to each filament as columns of circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The color was assigned according to segment transformation, left (blue) or right (red) psi angle. The columns show a clear tendency to be either blue or red, confirming that we determined the direction of actin segments belonging to the same filaments in a consistent manner. Since the procedure did not consider which segment belongs to which filament, this result serves as an internal control. Since an actin filament can only have a single polarity, we decided the final direction of a filament based on the majority of its segments and mapped the direction of a filament accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>A confidence score measurement providing an additional confirmation to the reliability of determining the polarity of each filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>). We termed this score the ‘majority confidence score’. It is defined as the maximum number of segments pointing in a similar direction divided by the total number of segments of the respective filament. In this study we extracted 606 filaments from 16 tomograms. Around 20% of the filaments had a majority confidence score &lt;2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>). These filaments were excluded from further analysis, for example the black filaments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>. In order to measure the distance between the filaments and to quantify the distribution of uniform polarity and mixed polarity regions within the bundles, we performed a 3D neighborhood analysis that described in details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martins et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>In brief, for every actin segment we extracted the polarities of the (up to) three nearest segments of neighboring filaments, within a 3D distance of 40 nm, defining its neighborhood. Based on that we determined for each segment the degree of uniform polarity (UP) and mixed polarity (MP) of its neighborhood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6C</xref>). Next, we defined a score (MPs-UPs)/(MPs+UPs) to characterize the overall polarity of each bundle.</p><p>The calculated scores range from −1 to 1, for example if all filaments in a bundle point in the same direction the score is −1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E</xref>). The 3D neighborhood analysis was programmed in MATLAB.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Swiss National Foundation, grant no. 31003A_179418, and the Mäxi Foundation (to OM), the Israel Science Foundation (to BG) and the Klaus Tschira Foundation (to BG).

While some of the points raised below might be addressed with new experiments or even more detailed explanations, it was felt that the scope of the revisions needed were outside of the bounds of what is required for an <italic>eLife</italic> resubmission. We realize that this decision will be disappointing but hope that you will find these reviews helpful in planning your next experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a rather complicated study that aims to provide new insights into how talin and vinculin interact with actin to form bundles in cells. The work done is purely in vitro, which is necessary to simplify and control the system. While some aspects appear novel, I will need to defer to other reviewers in terms of the biological significance of the results. I am not bothered at all about the seeming conflicts with Janssen et al., 2006, since Kim et al., 2016, came to very different conclusions. The work on actin polarity appears to have been done well and is convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The finding that vinculin does not decorate actin without vinculin activation is not novel and thus not surprising. The finding that the addition of talin VBS1, which activates vinculin, results in vinculin binding to polymerizing actin filaments is also neither new and thus not surprising. The quantification of the speed of active vinculin binding to the cytoskeleton is a new detail in the field and perhaps of importance from a mechanistic point of view of nascent adhesion formation.</p><p>Likewise, the observations about the robustness of these vinculin-actin interactions is interesting while again the idea that filament elongation and vinculin binding occurring simultaneously have also already been known.</p><p>The α-actinin observations with regards to simultaneous binding with vinculin to actin are interesting but perhaps not fully explored and characterized.</p><p>How were &quot;rather short filaments&quot; generated?</p><p>The analysis of the bundled actin seems problematic where &quot;bridging densities&quot; might be over interpreted as vinculin dimers. Given that the vinculin tail domain binds to actin, I assume the authors are suggesting that the vinculin head domain dimerizes which has not been demonstrated biochemically or structurally. What would cause the vinculin head domain to dimerize? Thompson et al., 2013, suggested that the vinculin tail domain dimerizes but the &quot;bridging densities&quot; do not seem to correlate with such a dimer.</p><p>Figure 1A, why 0.6 and 9.3 micromoles of vinculin instead no vinculin at all?</p><p>Figure 2A-C is actin alone but 2E analyzes vinculin, where are those actin-vinculin images please?</p><p>Figure 2F leaves room for several interpretations.</p><p>Figure 3, there seems to be a crucial control missing, actin plus Arp2/3 without vinculin to exclude the possibility that the observed effects are solely due to Arp2/3.</p><p>Figure 6, the dimerization is debatable and without any integrin experiments this is also speculative while much of the rest of the model has been published by Waterman's lab although some of her key findings are ignored.</p><p>As a side note, the supplementary figures are not labeled and take an effort to track</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2, (G) and (H) pull-downs – are all lanes in (G) pellet and are lanes in (H) supernatant and its suggested that only lanes 1-8 are but then what are the other lanes – if they all are pellet (G) and all supernatant (H) then with some actin in the supernatant and vinculin in the pellet, any interpretation would be tricky</p><p>I am not certain if Arp2/3 and vinculin binding are sterically hindering each other, surely this depends on the affinity. Arp2/3 is supposed to (biochemical data are missing in the literature) bind the proline-rich region connecting the vinculin head and tail of severed vinculin while the vinculin tail domain binds actin, i.e. two different regions on vinculin harbor the Arp2/3 and actin binding sites.</p><p>This study does, however, have some interesting novel aspects. For example, the authors use vinculin that they generated in insect cells which is a plus and new for the field that used to use <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed vinculin. I wonder if there are any remaining residues on this C-terminus after cleavage of the tag and if the C-terminal tag would prevent the closed vinculin conformer.</p><p>Videos – what are the arrows pointing to? Without a legend they are difficult to follow.</p><p>I am left with the feeling that this manuscript is hard to follow because of too many tangential experiments while a lot has already been published which dilutes the novelty here, that I mentioned above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Talin-activated vinculin interacts with branched actin networks to initiate bundles&quot; by Paterski et al., describes studies characterizing the underlying mechanism of actin network reorganization and bundling by talin-activated vinculin. Interactions between full-length vinculin and F-actin are monitored, using a simplified in vitro experimental setup to recapitulate actin reorganization in the early events of adhesion assembly. The investigators observe that talin-activated vinculin crosslinks actin filaments into stable and flexible bundles with uniform and mixed polarity using cryo-electron tomography and micro-patterned surface approaches. Further, talin-bound active vinculin is also observed to promote Arp2/3 complex-induced branched actin network organization and dynamics.</p><p>Vinculin is a scaffolding protein that localizes to focal adhesions (FA) and adherens junctions where it links the actin cytoskeleton to the adhesive super-structure. It is an abundant and ubiquitously expressed cell adhesion protein that plays a key role in mediating cell adhesion, motility, and cellular response to force. Understanding how talin-mediated activation of full length vinculin promotes actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and how other interacting proteins such as Arp2/3 and actinin modulate these actin networks, will aid in deciphering how vinculin couples the extracellular matrix with the actin cytoskeleton to regulate morphology, motility and mechano-transduction. However, concerns exist with the manuscript, as key controls are missing and some of the data presented does not agree with the existing data/literature. Some of the discrepancies are not acknowledged and discussed.</p><p>Detailed comments are listed below:</p><p>1) The investigators find that the mean distance between F-actin filaments within the F-actin bundle is 21 +/- 6 nm. This is twice as large as inter-filament distance previously measured by Cryo-electron tomography experiments using isolated Vt domain (10.5 nm) (Janssen, et al., 2006). In the Discussion, authors cite this previous paper without bringing the actual numbers for comparison, and do not elaborate on this difference. However, this difference is crucial for the mechanism of vinculin-mediated F-actin bundling. If the distance between F-actin filaments is increased 2-fold, two Vt domains cannot interact. This would imply that vinculin in the assays should mediate bundling through interaction with linker region or head domain. Indeed, the authors speculate: &quot;Thus, the ~21 nm interspace within vinculin-mediated bundles may represent the length of an open vinculin protein suggesting that vinculin's head domain may play a role in the dimerization process to produce an activated full-length vinculin dimers.&quot; However, this is counter to an abundance of evidence in the literature which support actin binding and dimerization primarily through the tail domain.</p><p>The disconnect with published literature raises the following concerns:</p><p>i) Does Alexa88-modified full length vinculin alter actin bundling and/or other vinculin interactions? Actin binding but surprisingly not bundling controls are reported for baculovirus expressed full length vinculin but not the fluorescent-tagged protein. A comparison of actin binding and bundling is needed for both non-modified baculovirus expressed and fluorescently-tagged vinculin, in the absence and presence of the talin VBS1 peptide.</p><p>ii) Alternatively, could the actin &quot;bundling&quot; observed be due to non-specific association of vinculin head domains (Vh) and linkers connecting Vh to Vt? In cells, the position of Vh is strongly restrained by its binding to cell membrane through talin. The experiments herein are performed on a 2D coverslip, where Vh is free to move and potentially create gel-like structures, bridging F-actin filaments together. As a result, Vh domains may be forced between actin filaments (since they cannot escape in 3D) and may prevent F-actin fibers from coming close enough for Vt domains to interact?</p><p>2) The authors observe that vinculin and a-actinin colocalize within F-actin bundles. In support of this observation the authors argue that a-actinin and vinculin supposedly have compatible inter-filaments spacing (~20 nm). This conclusion contradicts published literature (P. Kanchanawong, et al., Nanoscale architecture of integrin-based cell adhesions. Nature 468, 580-4 (2010); L. B. Case, et al., Molecular mechanism of vinculin activation and nanoscale spatial organization in focal adhesions. Nat. Cell Biol. 17, 880-892 (2015)), in which a-actinin and vinculin mostly occupy distinct layers, consisting of a membrane-associated integrin signaling layer, a force transduction layer containing talin and vinculin, and an actin-regulatory layer containing a-actinin as well as zyxin and VASP.</p><p>3) Known vinculin activation, actin binding and bundling mechanisms should be discussed, to put the data into context. For example, upon vinculin activation (which is still not completely understood), actin binding to Vt promotes a conformational change in the tail domain that facilitates actin dimerization and bundling. Moreover, actinin engages the head domain and can promote Vt activation in a manner similar to talin (Bois et al., JBC, 2006), which may be why these activating ligands localize to different “layers” within the focal adhesion. Arp2/3 engages the proline rich domain and may not compete with direct actin binding interactions through the tail domain. As mentioned above, in cells, vinculin has been shown to localize to different pools, which are “lost” in the simplified in vitro system used here. Thus, the investigators need to extrapolate their findings to a physiologically relevant system whereby vinculin localization occurs with distinct ligands.</p><p>4) The authors state that vinculin-mediated F-actin bundles have mixed polarity. The quantity plotted at Figure 2E is (MPs-UPs)/(MPs+UPs), where MPs describes degree of mixed polarity of neighboring fibers, and UPs describe degree of uniform polarity. However, the investigators do not adequately provide a definition of MPs and UPs. Figure 2F depicts crosslinking bridge between the actin filaments. Can the authors elaborate on the orientation of vinculin at these crossing junctions? If bundling is mediated by the tail domain, it is unclear how Vt can dimerize to form a mixed bundle. Moreover, while the mixed polarity observation is intriguing, it is unclear how this fits with published findings that vinculin forms directionally asymmetric catch bonds with F-actin (Huang et al, 2017). Such &quot;mixed polarity bundles&quot; should be very unstable in vivo and shear apart under force.</p><p>5) It is apparent from Figure 2D that the actin bundles, except bundle-5, show mixed polarities. However, Figure 2E shows bundles 4,5, and 7 that exhibit uniform polarity. It would be helpful to clarify the apparent discrepancy between Figure 2D and 2E. Moreover, bundles 5 and 7 in Figure 2D depict long and uniform filaments of actin in sharp contrast to bundles 4 and 16. Some discussion is needed to explain these differences.</p><p>6) The authors observe that vinculin doesn't enhance F-actin polymerization rate. This observation is also in contradiction with previously published results (Wen et al, 2009; Jannie et al., 2015) which showed that vinculin promotes F-actin polymerization.</p><p>7) The vinculin-actin interaction model presented in the Figure 6 seems a bit misleading as it gives the impression that vinculin forms a dimer at the talin interface through its head domain. Actin binding to vinculin has been shown to be mediated primarily through the tail domain. Some discussion is needed here.</p><p>8) All proteins are conjugated with covalent fluorophores with varying degree of labeling. And since various parameters noted in the paper are calculated based on the fluorescence quantification coming from these fluorophores, it would be helpful if the authors tabulate the protein with respective fluorophore and degree of labelling and their effective percentages used in fluorescence ratio calculation for each experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Boujemaa-Paterski and colleagues use a minimal in vitro system to mimic situations in cells where initial adhesion complexes become linked to the branched actin network in protruding lamellipodia of migrating cells.</p><p>Major findings are that only vinculin activated by talin is able to bind and bundle actin filaments of mixed population; another focal adhesion protein, a-actinin1, is attracted at later stages. When immobilised on micropatterns, activated vinculin traps and organises (bundles) Arp2/3 induced branched actin filaments. At first, many of these individual aspects may not seem entirely novel but the comprehensive way of combining cutting edge technology reveals in a very clear manner how individual components, following specific activation steps, act together to tether initial adhesion complexes to the actin network.</p><p>Points to consider:</p><p>1) Authors speculate that vinculin dimerization involving its head domain may be important for the bundling function but they do not show this. A potential experiment to clarify could be to use the actin binding vinculin tail only for their experiments.</p><p>2) Vinculin itself binds to the Arp2/3 complex. Does this interaction have a role in trapping the Arp2/3 induced branched network?</p><p>3) A limitation of the study may be it has not included talin itself, which binds and organises actin prior to vinculin. The presence of talin could change protein binding kinetics and aspects of actin organisation. New experiments may be beyond the scope of this study but this matter requires discussion in the relevant section (see comment point 5).</p><p>4) There is no statistics to the histogram in Figure 3A.</p><p>5) The Discussion remains superficial in relevant aspects:</p><p>a) In a somewhat similar study, Ciobanasu et al., 2014, have shown how the talin-vinculin complex leads to actin anchoring and a-actinin contributes to the crosslinking (bundling) of the initial network. Questions arising are, whether for example kinetics of a-actinin (and vinculin) binding to filaments or the distance between filaments etc. would change in presence of full-length talin?</p><p>b) A recent study (Atherton et al. JCB) shows that the release of an autoinhibition motif in talin unmasks VBSs that recruit and activate vinculin. The finding seems in line with the present study showing that an isolated VBS can activate vinculin to bind to actin and should be discussed.</p><p>c) There is little discussion about the potential role of Arp2/3 binding to vinculin (DeMali et al., 2002 and other manuscripts). Could the Arp2/3 binding site in vinculin contribute to the connection to the actin meshwork?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Talin-activated vinculin interacts with branched actin networks to initiate bundles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The reviewers have agreed that the revised paper is a substantial improvement over the original submission, and is close to being ready for acceptance in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, in a somewhat unusual move, the reviewers thought that the final paper should contain less data than what is currently shown (rather than more), due to the major concerns about Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Since it was felt that the biochemistry shown here is not essential to the paper, the easiest path is simply to have you remove it rather than asking for a major revision where this work would be redone.</p><p>One reviewer stated:</p><p>Panels F and H cannot be unambiguously interpreted:</p><p>Their pull-down shows that their vinculin aggregates and thus pellets so one cannot say anything about vinculin binding to F-actin if the readout is its pelleting, as it pellets in the absence of F-actin also. More complications are caused by F-actin not completely being polymerized as they also have actin in the supernatant. To me, these data are thus uninterpretable. However, they get the assay to work in panel G where vinculin is not aggregating, and actin does not seem to be unpolymerized.</p><p>Since the other reviewers are positive about this manuscript and since these panels are not even mentioned in the manuscript, one way to reconcile the three reviewers would be to take those panels out.</p><p>Also please correct this issue and clarify the text as needed:</p><p>With regard to Figure 3—figure supplement 2, it is concerning that full length vinculin pellets in the presence of VBS1 but in the absence of actin (vinculin oligomerization, stability issues?), and that actin is present in the soluble fraction upon polymerization. This raises additional concerns on my end regarding use of purified vinculin for their assays. Also, in Materials and methods, it is stated that the pelleting speed is 380,000, but in the figure legend, the pelleting speed is stated as 80,000.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53990.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

However, our revised manuscript stressed the fact that Thievessen et al., 2013 have shown that vinculin tail interacts with lamellipodial actin and affects nascent adhesions turnover. We also highlighted that due to actin-generated tension vinculin adopts an extended conformation (Case et al., 2015). This can be found in the revised manuscript. Here, we show direct interactions between the proteins, while inside cells it is much more challenging to identify such direct interactions.</p><p>Moreover, Thievessen et al. paper stated that “…As the resolution of our TFM was not sufficient to analyze nascent FA, we restricted our analysis to mature FA…”. In addition, Xu et al. 2012 Nat. Methods, reported that investigation of the lamellipodial actin was hindered due to actin density and diffraction-limited scale of nascent adhesions.</p><p>While cellular study is of a major importance, biochemical and dynamics properties in vitro are fundamental to understand cellular behavior in details. In our study, vinculin interactions with actin are investigated in in vitro systems that may be relevant for the early-stage of nascent adhesion formation. As discussed in the revised manuscript, several lines of evidence (Bachir et al., 2014 ; Atherton et al., 2020; Dedden et al., 2020 ; Kelley et al., 2020) show that talin-vinculin precomplex can form before associating with integrins. On the basis of our reconstitution experiments, we propose that these precomplexes may stably interact with branched lamellipodial actin, and bundles can be initiated in a force independent manner. The formation of bundles from lamellipodial actin may stabilize nascent adhesions, which is necessary for their maturation into focal adhesions. Additionally, our in vitro reconstitution experiments unambiguously demonstrate that the reorganization of the lamellipodial network induced by vinculin slow down its progression (Figure1, in agreement with in vivo reports by Choi et al., 2008 and Thievessen et al., 2013) which may serve as a key step for the formation of a stable connection between actin – talin-vinculin, at nascent adhesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a side note, the supplementary figures are not labeled and take an effort to track</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2, (G) and (H) pull-downs – are all lanes in (G) pellet and are lanes in (H) supernatant and its suggested that only lanes 1-8 are but then what are the other lanes – if they all are pellet (G) and all supernatant (H) then with some actin in the supernatant and vinculin in the pellet, any interpretation would be tricky.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the inconvenience.

Arp2/3 is supposed to (biochemical data are missing in the literature) bind the proline-rich region connecting the vinculin head and tail of severed vinculin while the vinculin tail domain binds actin, i.e. two different regions on vinculin harbor the Arp2/3 and actin binding sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Our quantifications of the binding of Arp2/3 and vinculin alone or together indicated that the differences fall within the standard deviation of measurements.

Interactions between full-length vinculin and F-actin are monitored, using a simplified in vitro experimental setup to recapitulate actin reorganization in the early events of adhesion assembly. The investigators observe that talin-activated vinculin crosslinks actin filaments into stable and flexible bundles with uniform and mixed polarity using cryo-electron tomography and micro-patterned surface approaches. Further, talin-bound active vinculin is also observed to promote Arp2/3 complex-induced branched actin network organization and dynamics.</p><p>Vinculin is a scaffolding protein that localizes to focal adhesions (FA) and adherens junctions where it links the actin cytoskeleton to the adhesive super-structure. It is an abundant and ubiquitously expressed cell adhesion protein that plays a key role in mediating cell adhesion, motility, and cellular response to force. Understanding how talin-mediated activation of full length vinculin promotes actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and how other interacting proteins such as Arp2/3 and actinin modulate these actin networks, will aid in deciphering how vinculin couples the extracellular matrix with the actin cytoskeleton to regulate morphology, motility and mechano-transduction. However, concerns exist with the manuscript, as key controls are missing and some of the data presented does not agree with the existing data/literature. Some of the discrepancies are not acknowledged and discussed.</p><p>Detailed comments are listed below:</p><p>1) The investigators find that the mean distance between F-actin filaments within the F-actin bundle is 21 +/- 6 nm. This is twice as large as inter-filament distance previously measured by Cryo-electron tomography experiments using isolated Vt domain (10.5 nm) (Janssen et al., 2006). In the Discussion, authors cite this previous paper without bringing the actual numbers for comparison, and do not elaborate on this difference. However, this difference is crucial for the mechanism of vinculin-mediated F-actin bundling. If the distance between F-actin filaments is increased 2-fold, two Vt domains cannot interact. This would imply that vinculin in the assays should mediate bundling through interaction with linker region or head domain. Indeed, the authors speculate: &quot;Thus, the ~21 nm interspace within vinculin-mediated bundles may represent the length of an open vinculin protein suggesting that vinculin's head domain may play a role in the dimerization process to produce an activated full-length vinculin dimers.&quot; However, this is counter to an abundance of evidence in the literature which support actin binding and dimerization primarily through the tail domain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer comments, although one should take into consideration that a small part/domain of a protein (Vt,187aa) may not fully reflect the structure and dynamics of a large protein (Vinculin, 1066aa). Therefore, studying the full-length protein, ~117 kDa, is of major importance and relevance in comparison to a ~21 kDa protein segment, the Vt. Moreover, we would like to remind the reviewer here that the ability of vinculin to interact and bundle a branched actin network is the major focus of our work and therefore the actin bundles characterization is moved into the supplementary information.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have now reconstituted bundles with Vt and obtained an inter-filament distance of 10 nm, matching the value reported by Janssen et al. We have also developed two additional strategies: increasing the density of vinculin density by activating vinculin with GFP-talin-VBS1 construct, and by using 2-3 nm Gold-nanoparticles that were coupled to talin-VBS1 and used to activate vinculin. This information is added as Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Material and methods section.</p><p>In the context of reconstitution using F-actin and soluble, activated VBS1-vinculin, the inter-filament spacing was 29 nm, and depicted an intrinsic property of activated vinculin. Similarly, the 10 nm inter-filament spacing obtained with the tail is an intrinsic property of the isolated Vt.</p><p>We agree that a wealth of evidence extensively characterized in vitro the dimerization of isolated Vt (Johnson and Craig, 1995, Kim et al., 2016, and as reviewed in Thompson et al., 2013). in vivo characterizations measured the conformational change in vinculin (Johnson and Craig, 2000, Case et al., 2015), showing that the open, extended state of vinculin correlates with focal adhesion maturation state. Yet, the dynamics of vinculin’s opening upon its activation by talin as well as its stretching remains unclarified.</p><p>Therefore, the inter-filament spacing we reported here might be of interest as it describes an intrinsic property of the full-length protein. Yet, our result does not determine whether the spacing represents a transient intermediate state of vinculin-mediated bundles at the onset of the adhesion formation, nor describe the structure and dynamics of the reconstituted bridges. That is beyond the scope of our study and needs further investigation, although in a recent cryo-ET of analysis (Martins et al., 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987263v2">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987263v2</ext-link>) we measure a mean distance of 28 nm between filaments at FAs in intact cells.</p><p>We clarified our statement as mentioned in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have also moved this information in the supplementary information of Figure 3, which describes the branched network reorganization at the single-filament scale. The revised figure label is Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The disconnect with published literature raises the following concerns:</p><p>i) Does Alexa88-modified full length vinculin alter actin bundling and/or other vinculin interactions? Actin binding but surprisingly not bundling controls are reported for baculovirus expressed full length vinculin but not the fluorescent-tagged protein. A comparison of actin binding and bundling is needed for both non-modified baculovirus expressed and fluorescently-tagged vinculin, in the absence and presence of the talin VBS1 peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a time-lapse sequence showing that unlabeled vinculin expressed insect was unable to bundle actin filaments in the absence of the talin VBS1 domain, while addition of talin-VBS1 activated its bundling activity.</p><p>As we reported bundling activity also with unlabeled proteins, we concluded that the bundling observed with labeled vinculin was not due to any perturbation resulting from chemical labeling by Alexa-488.</p><p>This information is provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The reviewer would agree that expressing vinculin (a eukaryotic protein) in eukaryotic expression system is much more reliable than the expression of mammalian protein in prokaryotes, as previously done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Alternatively, could the actin &quot;bundling&quot; observed be due to non-specific association of vinculin head domains (Vh) and linkers connecting Vh to Vt? In cells, the position of Vh is strongly restrained by its binding to cell membrane through talin. The experiments herein are performed on a 2D coverslip, where Vh is free to move and potentially create gel-like structures, bridging F-actin filaments together. As a result, Vh domains may be forced between actin filaments (since they cannot escape in 3D) and may prevent F-actin fibers from coming close enough for Vt domains to interact?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments in solution are designed to characterize the basic properties of full-length vinculin. In physiological conditions, vinculin binds activated talin, which is attached to integrin (Case and Waterman, 2015) or membrane-associated PIP2 (Kelley et al., 2020), and therefore it is only activated close to the membrane. This property is demonstrated in Figure 4, which shows that bundling of actin occurs when vinculin is indirectly attached to the surface (via talin VBS1). At FAs, the close proximity of vinculin binding domain in talin may force the head domains to be very close to each other, as well as the localization of many talin proteins in close proximity. Therefore, the spatial proximity of the Vh domain at adhesion sites is dictated, while the bulk experiments may force such a proximity in another manner. In any case, in the revised manuscript we removed the claim that Vh-Vh form a dimer, despite the electron microscopy images provided by Molony and Burridge, 1985</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the interactions and affinity between Vh-Vh domains is of prime interest but it is beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors observe that vinculin and a-actinin colocalize within F-actin bundles. In support of this observation the authors argue that a-actinin and vinculin supposedly have compatible inter-filaments spacing (~20 nm). This conclusion contradicts published literature (Kanchanawong et al., 2010; Case, et al., 2015), in which a-actinin and vinculin mostly occupy distinct layers, consisting of a membrane-associated integrin signaling layer, a force transduction layer containing talin and vinculin, and an actin-regulatory layer containing a-actinin as well as zyxin and VASP.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the comments from reviewer #1 we removed the a-actinin experiments. However, our data does not contradict Dr. Waterman’s findings. In fact, several studies have detected α-actinin at the onset of adhesion assembly, at the stage of nascent ones. Choi et al., 2008 and Bachir et al., 2014, show that α-actinin, concomitantly to vinculin and talin, transiently associates to nascent adhesions during their stabilization and growth phases. These findings do not exclude nor contradict a later recruitment of α-actinin to the acto-myosin associated fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Known vinculin activation, actin binding and bundling mechanisms should be discussed, to put the data into context. For example, upon vinculin activation (which is still not completely understood), actin binding to Vt promotes a conformational change in the tail domain that facilitates actin dimerization and bundling. Moreover, actinin engages the head domain and can promote Vt activation in a manner similar to talin (Bois et al., 2006), which may be why these activating ligands localize to different “layers” within the focal adhesion. Arp2/3 engages the proline rich domain and may not compete with direct actin binding interactions through the tail domain. As mentioned above, in cells, vinculin has been shown to localize to different pools, which are “lost” in the simplified in vitro system used here. Thus, the investigators need to extrapolate their findings to a physiologically relevant system whereby vinculin localization occurs with distinct ligands.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this remark. Following these suggestions, we extrapolated our findings to physiologically relevant scenarios and extended our discussion, as mentioned in the revised manuscript, Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that vinculin-mediated F-actin bundles have mixed polarity. The quantity plotted at Figure 2E is (MPs-UPs)/(MPs+UPs), where MPs describes degree of mixed polarity of neighboring fibers, and UPs describe degree of uniform polarity. However, the investigators do not adequately provide a definition of MPs and UPs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the unclear term. We have properly defined it in the revised manuscript. Uniform-polarity score (UPs) and mixed-polarity score (MPs) are now provided in the Materials and methods section and in the figure legend Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2F depicts crosslinking bridge between the actin filaments. Can the authors elaborate on the orientation of vinculin at these crossing junctions?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to reveal the orientation of vinculin along actin, a uniform interaction (binding) along actin filaments is needed. However, it seems that full-length vinculin cannot saturate all sites on actin presumably because of the size of the protein, therefore our trials to determine the structure were unsuccessful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If bundling is mediated by the tail domain, it is unclear how Vt can dimerize to form a mixed bundle. Moreover, while the mixed polarity observation is intriguing, it is unclear how this fits with published findings that vinculin forms directionally asymmetric catch bonds with F-actin (Huang et al, 2017). Such &quot;mixed polarity bundles&quot; should be very unstable in vivo and shear apart under force.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer’s comment and with this respect we have expanded our Discussion, as mentioned in our revised manuscript.</p><p>We speculate that vinculin’s early interactions with the branched network (which comprises branches randomly oriented to each other) are fast and enable the protein to assemble random-polarity bundles. This may be a key mechanism that potentiate the connection to mobile lamellipodial network, which in turn applies a selection pressure reinforcing only uniform polarity bundles and further stabilization and maturation of the nascent adhesions.</p><p>Moreover, we have found that in intact cells focal adhesion-associated actin has non-uniform polarity (Martins et al., 2020)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is apparent from Figure 2D that the actin bundles, except bundle-5, show mixed polarities. However, Figure 2E shows bundles 4,5, and 7 that exhibit uniform polarity. It would be helpful to clarify the apparent discrepancy between Figure 2D and 2E. Moreover, bundles 5 and 7 in Figure 2D depict long and uniform filaments of actin in sharp contrast to bundles 4 and 16. Some discussion is needed to explain these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for being unclear. We now better defined MPs and UPs scores in our revised manuscript. A clearer information is provided in the Materials and methods section and in the figure legend Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><p>The histogram initially Figure 2E, in the revised manuscript Figure 3—figure supplement 4E, shows a polarity score of filament’s neighborhood. While in most bundles non-uniform polarity was found, the score between the different polarities was variable, covering all possibilities.</p><p>In brief, for every actin segment we extracted the polarities of the (up to) three nearest segments of neighboring filaments, within a 3D distance of 40 nm, defining its neighborhood. Based on that we determined for each segment the degree of uniform polarity (UP) and mixed polarity (MP) of its neighborhood (Figure 3—figure supplement 5C). This describes the microenvironment of an actin segment. Next, we defined a score (MPs-UPs)/(MPs+UPs) to characterize the overall polarity of each bundle.</p><p>The histogram shows that bundles 4 and 5 have a polarity ratio ≈ -0.2 meaning that ~20% of the segments display an opposite polarity with their closest neighbors (alternance blue/red filaments) and ~80% of them have a uniform polarity (packing blue/blue or red/red filaments), as depicted the directionality maps of these bundles in panel D. Thus, both polarities were detected in most bundles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors observe that vinculin doesn't enhance F-actin polymerization rate. This observation is also in contradiction with previously published results (Wen et al., 2009); Jannie et al., 2015) which showed that vinculin promotes F-actin polymerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The two papers mentioned used only the tail (187aa out of 1066aa). Therefore, it may not be not surprising that using a full-length protein, expressed in eukaryotic system represent a more realistic system.</p><p>Moreover, Leclainche et al., 2010 already contradicted the above-mentioned literature.</p><p>We acknowledged the discrepancy in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The vinculin-actin interaction model presented in the Figure 6 seems a bit misleading as it gives the impression that vinculin forms a dimer at the talin interface through its head domain. Actin binding to vinculin has been shown to be mediated primarily through the tail domain. Some discussion is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We modified the model accordingly and expanded our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) All proteins are conjugated with covalent fluorophores with varying degree of labeling. And since various parameters noted in the paper are calculated based on the fluorescence quantification coming from these fluorophores, it would be helpful if the authors tabulate the protein with respective fluorophore and degree of labelling and their effective percentages used in fluorescence ratio calculation for each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. Accordingly, we calibrated the fluorescence intensities and we are now able to provide apparent equilibrium dissociation constant that better characterize the affinity of vinculin to the different actin organizations. This information is provided in revised Figures 1 and 2, and the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Moreover, the cryo-ET measurements were conducted with unlabeled proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Boujemaa-Paterski and colleagues use a minimal in vitro system to mimic situations in cells where initial adhesion complexes become linked to the branched actin network in protruding lamellipodia of migrating cells.</p><p>Major findings are that only vinculin activated by talin is able to bind and bundle actin filaments of mixed population; another focal adhesion protein, a-actinin1, is attracted at later stages. When immobilised on micropatterns, activated vinculin traps and organises (bundles) Arp2/3 induced branched actin filaments. At first, many of these individual aspects may not seem entirely novel but the comprehensive way of combining cutting edge technology reveals in a very clear manner how individual components, following specific activation steps, act together to tether initial adhesion complexes to the actin network.</p><p>Points to consider:</p><p>1) Authors speculate that vinculin dimerization involving its head domain may be important for the bundling function but they do not show this. A potential experiment to clarify could be to use the actin binding vinculin tail only for their experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer with this comment.</p><p>Although we tuned down this part of the manuscript and discussed in greater details the bundling of branched actin network, we cloned the tail (879-1066) from our human vinculin construct. Reconstitution of actin bundles and structural analysis by cryo-ET showed bundles with an inter-filament spacing of 10 ± 1 nm (Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and 4), in agreement with previous reports (Janssen et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2016).</p><p>These experiments clearly demonstrated that Vt (187aa) behaves differently than the full-length vinculin (1066aa). There are several vinculin binding domains in talin that would anyhow force Vh domains to be very adjacent to each other. This would result in actin bundling, and is demonstrated in Figure 4.</p><p>Additional experiments revealed increased densities, mediated by talin-VBS1-activated full-length vinculin as well as gold labeling, indicating that bundling by vinculin does not form homogeneous structures as the Vt does. As we now discuss in the revised manuscript these observed bridge densities may also reflect an early, transient state of activated vinculin prior to its extension between the integrin and actin layers, and maybe that actin-generated force is needed to fully extent the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Vinculin itself binds to the Arp2/3 complex. Does this interaction have a role in trapping the Arp2/3 induced branched network?</p></disp-quote><p>Using TIRFM assays we did not record any activation of Arp2/3 complex by vinculin. This information is added in revised Figure 3.</p><p>We speculate that either vinculin interacts with a cellular subpopulation of Arp2/3, as Chorev et al. have identified using mass-spectroscopy analysis (Chorev et al., 2014), or additional factors are needed to mediate the interaction. In Chorev et al., the Arp2/3 complex that contained vinculin was missing the p41-ARC protein. The Arp2/3 complex used in our assays comprises 7 subunits and was purified using a WAVE-WA affinity column chromatography.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A limitation of the study may be it has not included talin itself, which binds and organises actin prior to vinculin. The presence of talin could change protein binding kinetics and aspects of actin organisation. New experiments may be beyond the scope of this study but this matter requires discussion in the relevant section (see comment point 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and we have expanded our discussed accordingly, as mentioned the revised manuscript. In Figure 4, we synthetically mimic a situation in which several VBS domains are in close proximity to each other. This better resembles the full-length talin and its increased concentration at FAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is no statistics to the histogram in Figure 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed implemented our quantifications and the differences falls now within the standard deviation of measurements. The information is provided in revised Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Discussion remains superficial in relevant aspects:</p><p>a) In a somewhat similar study, Ciobanasu et al., 2014 have shown how the talin-vinculin complex leads to actin anchoring and a-actinin contributes to the crosslinking (bundling) of the initial network. Questions arising are, whether for example kinetics of a-actinin (and vinculin) binding to filaments or the distance between filaments etc. would change in presence of full-length talin?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment and have expanded our Discussion accordingly, as mentioned in the revised manuscript. Interestingly, the distances measured between actin filament in FAs, by means of cryo-ET (Martins et al., 2020 , doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.987263), resemble the measure distances in this work.</p><p>However, we tuned down our initial work of α-actinin 1, since it was felt insufficient by the other reviewers. We do agree that an in-depth comparison of the dynamics of vinculin and α-actinin 1 is of prime interest, but beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) A recent study (Atherton et al. JCB) shows that the release of an autoinhibition motif in talin unmasks VBSs that recruit and activate vinculin. The finding seems in line with the present study showing that an isolated VBS can activate vinculin to bind to actin and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and we have expanded our Discussion accordingly, as mentioned in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, during the revision of our manuscript, Kelley and colleagues (Kelley et al., 2020) used phosphoinositide to assemble in vitro activated talin-vinculin precomplexes in absence of tensile forces. These data are in line with our results and were discussed too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) There is little discussion about the potential role of Arp2/3 binding to vinculin (DeMali et al., 2002 and other manuscripts). Could the Arp2/3 binding site in vinculin contribute to the connection to the actin meshwork?</p></disp-quote><p>There might be several paths that would allow the interaction between Arp2/3 and vilnculin, however, such interactions were not detected in our experimental setup.</p><p>The results shown here and in previous studies by Chorev et al. suggest that lamellipodial actin- associated Arp2/3 and adhesion-associated Arp may be two distinct species.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have agreed that the revised paper is a substantial improvement over the original submission, and is close to being ready for acceptance in eLife. However, in a somewhat unusual move, the reviewers thought that the final paper should contain less data than what is currently shown (rather than more), due to the major concerns about Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Since it was felt that the biochemistry shown here is not essential to the paper, the easiest path is simply to have you remove it rather than asking for a major revision where this work would be redone.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer assessment that the biochemical experiments aimed at determining the affinity of vinculin to actin filaments are not central to this study.</p><p>Additionally, we thank the reviewers for their suggestion and believe that it is fully justified.</p><p>Therefore, we have removed panels F to H from Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and have revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One reviewer stated:</p><p>Panels F and H cannot be unambiguously interpreted:</p><p>Their pull-down shows that their vinculin aggregates and thus pellets so one cannot say anything about vinculin binding to F-actin if the readout is its pelleting, as it pellets in the absence of F-actin also.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed these panels and agree with the reviewers that the experiments could have been improved, however, we would like to clarify the following.</p><p>When vinculin was incubated with VBS1 in the absence of actin, a fraction of vinculin pelleted using high-speed centrifugation (380,000 g), while vinculin alone cannot be pelleted.</p><p>These observations may represent oligomerization of activated vinculin, as previously reported by Molony and Burridge, 1985.</p><p>During data analysis we considered these activated vinculin polymers as our background and subtracted it for the purpose of Kd calculations. In any case it was removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More complications are caused by F-actin not completely being polymerized as they also have actin in the supernatant. To me, these data are thus uninterpretable. However, they get the assay to work in panel G where vinculin is not aggregating, and actin does not seem to be unpolymerized.</p></disp-quote><p>Unpolymerized actin that remained in the supernatants is a fundamental property of actin and will always be observed due to the equilibrium between F-actin and the critical concentration of actin (G-actin). Densitometric measurements showed that the unpolymerized actin ranged between 0.08 to 0.1 µM (as was shown in the first eight lanes where actin was incubated with increasing amount of VBS1-activated vinculin). This is the critical concentration of actin (Pollard, Analytical Biochemistry, 1983) that remains unpolymerized and is in equilibrium with polymerized filaments.</p><p>Similarly, sedimentation of filamentous actin in panel G showed unpolymerized actin corresponding to the critical concentration (as was shown in the last two lanes of “Pellets” and “Supernatants” gels). Most of the actin (filaments) went to the pellet except the critical concentration that remained unpolymerized, therefore staying in the supernatant. Thus, the intrinsic property of actin to polymerize above its critical concentration was not affected by the presence of vinculin in the absence or in the presence of VBS1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the other reviewers are positive about this manuscript and since these panels are not even mentioned in the manuscript, one way to reconcile the three reviewers would be to take those panels out.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.
