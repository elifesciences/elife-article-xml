thermogenic cells that convert chemical energy into heat to maintain a constant body temperature and counteract metabolic disease. The metabolic adaptations required for thermogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we explore how steady state levels of metabolic intermediates are altered in brown adipose tissue in response to cold exposure. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed changes in pathways involved in amino acid, glucose, and TCA cycle metabolism. Using isotopic labeling experiments, we found that activated brown adipocytes increased labeling of pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates from U<sup>13</sup>C-glucose. Although glucose oxidation has been implicated as being essential for thermogenesis, its requirement for efficient thermogenesis has not been directly tested. We show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is essential for optimal thermogenesis, as conditional deletion of <italic>Mpc1</italic> in brown adipocytes leads to impaired cold adaptation. Isotopic labeling experiments using U<sup>13</sup>C-glucose showed that loss of MPC1 led to impaired labeling of TCA cycle intermediates. Loss of MPC1 in BAT increased 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in blood and BAT in response to the cold, suggesting that ketogenesis provides an alternative fuel source to compensate. Collectively, these studies highlight that complete glucose oxidation is essential for optimal brown fat thermogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pyruvate</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>glucose oxidations</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>ketones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DK103930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villanueva</surname><given-names>Claudio J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial pyruvate transport is required for brown fat thermogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to thermoregulate has allowed mammals to thrive in cold regions of the world. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is an energy demanding process that has been key to the evolution and survival of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaudry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oelkrug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnett and Dickson, 1989</xref>). With the excess calorie intake associated with a western diet, mechanisms that promote energy expenditure in the cold will provide attractive therapeutic interventions to treating metabolic diseases associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vijgen et al., 2011</xref>). Cold exposure triggers the activation of the sympathetic nervous system to secrete norepinephrine, which signals through the Î²3-adrenergic receptor (Î²3-AR) and stimulates production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Townsend and Tseng, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Londos et al., 1985</xref>). cAMP promotes the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn upregulates transcription of thermogenic pathways and leads to the activation of lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Free fatty acids released can directly activate Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1), which uncouples the electron transport chain to generate heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klaus et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busiello et al., 2015</xref>). Cold exposure stimulates uptake of both glucose, triglyceride(TG)-rich lipoproteins and free fatty acids from the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LabbÃ© et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">FerrÃ© et al., 1986</xref>). While the relative contribution and importance of FFA as a BAT fuel source has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Khedoe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Townsend and Tseng, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), our understanding of metabolic fate of glucose and the importance of its catabolism in thermogenesis in vivo remains unknown.</p><p>Human brown fat was only believed to be found in newborns, but now we appreciate that adults have brown adipose tissue, a discovery that was made through use of glucose tracer (<sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose) and positron-emission tomographic and computed tomographic (PETâCT) scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Virtanen et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, it was previously recognized that cold exposure could lower blood glucose levels in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martineau and Jacobs, 1989</xref>). The role of glucose uptake on metabolism has been explored in vitro using immortalized brown adipocytes where siRNAs targeting <italic>Slc2a1</italic> (GLUT1), <italic>Slc2a4</italic> (GLUT4), <italic>Hk2</italic> (hexokinase2), or <italic>Pkm</italic> (pyruvate kinase, muscle) (enzymes catalyzing the first and the last step of glycolysis) demonstrated the importance of glycolysis, as Î²3-AR agonist failed to increase glucose uptake and oxygen consumption in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winther et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is no adequate in vivo model demonstrating the importance of BAT glycolysis or glucose oxidation on adaptive thermogenesis. We will address this question in vivo by blocking pyruvate import into mitochondria of brown adipocytes by knocking out the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).</p><p>MPC is a multimeric complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane that consists of MPC1 and MPC2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schell et al., 2014</xref>). Deletion of either subunit leads to instability of a functional MPC complex. MPC links the end product of glycolysis to glucose oxidation by transporting pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mowbray, 1975</xref>). Loss-of-function studies targeting MPC1 or MPC2 has been shown to limit mitochondrial pyruvate transport in yeast, flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>). Once in the mitochondria, pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA for further processing in the TCA cycle to generate NADH and fuel ATP production by OXPHOS complexes. Alternatively, cytosolic pyruvate can be reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase complex A (LDHA), a process commonly upregulated in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). While it is clear that cold exposure or direct stimulation of Î²3-AR stimulates glucose utilization by BAT in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2009</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mirbolooki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vallerand et al., 1990</xref>), it is not clear how important glucose oxidation is during thermogenesis nor what the metabolic fate of glucose is in activated BAT. Recently, comparative metabolomics analysis has shown that activation of BAT led to increased levels of the TCA cycle intermediate succinate; however, itÂ is unclear whether glucose-derived TCA cycle intermediates are required for thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mills et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we use comprehensive metabolomics analysis of BAT and serum from mice housed at different temperatures, to gain insight into the metabolic pathways altered with cold exposure. We find changes in glucose, amino acid, and TCA cycle intermediates in BAT. Using [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose, we found increased glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolism during BAT stimulation. To test whether glucose oxidation is required for thermogenesis, we generated mice lacking mitochondrial pyruvate carrier one subunit (MPC1) in brown adipose tissue. We found that mice lacking MPC1 in BAT are cold sensitive, indicating that pyruvate import into the mitochondria is essential for efficient thermogenesis. Furthermore, when we profiled serum and BAT metabolites of MPC1-null mice, we found elevated 3-hydroxybutyrate levels. Prior studies supporting a role for ketogenesis in thermogenesis, suggests an alternative carbon source that compensates for the loss of pyruvate transport. Together this study provides new insights into the metabolic fate of glucose in brown adipose tissue during activation of thermogenesis in response to acute cold exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cold-induced changes in transcriptome and metabolite profiling of BAT</title><p>To systematically profile the transcriptional changes that are altered in response to acute cold exposure, we measured steady state levels of RNA in BAT from mice at room temperature (24Â°C) or cold (4Â°C) for 5 hr.

Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we found that cold exposure stimulated distinct transcriptional changes in BAT that involve various aspects of metabolism. Notable changes include induction of glucose metabolic process, sphingolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and cellular respiration, while pathways involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and glycoprotein metabolism were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome and metabolomics analysis of brown fat shows increased carbohydrate metabolism and glycolytic metabolism during cold exposure.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Network visualization of enriched biological pathways altered with cold exposure in BAT (NÂ =Â 5).

The BAT metabolome showed elevated levels of glycolytic intermediates, TCA cycle intermediates, ketone bodies, and branched chain amino acids when mice were challenged with the cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, amino acids like tyrosine, alanine, threonine, and tryptophan were increased in BAT, while their levels decreased in serum with cold exposure. Perhaps, BAT uptake could lead to their depletion in the blood. Similar to a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoneshiro et al., 2019</xref>), we observed that branched chain amino acids, including Valine, Leucine, and Isoleucine were elevated in BAT, while only Leucine and Valine were upregulated in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). To identify metabolic pathways that changed with cold exposure, we used Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) to compare metabolomes of BAT and serum from mice at room temperature (24Â°C) and cold (4Â°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). Both BAT and serum were enriched for pathways involved in amino acid, fatty acid, nucleotide, and glucose metabolism. Notably, glucose and pyruvate levels in BAT were elevated in response to 4Â°C, while both glucose and pyruvate levels were similar between mice housed at 30Â°C and 23Â°C. This finding would suggest that there is an increase in the rate of pyruvate synthesis in response to the cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

This prompted further analysis of glucose catabolism in brown adipocytes under aerobic conditions in response to a Î²3-AR agonist CL-316,243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In vitro tracing experiments using [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-Glucose showed that activation of brown adipocytes treated with CL-316,243 had significant <sup>13</sup>C-glucose-derived M+3 isotopologues of <sup>13</sup>C-Pyruvate, <sup>13</sup>C-Lactate and <sup>13</sup>C-Glycerol-3-Phosphate. Differentiated brown adipocytes that were treated with CL-316,243 had more than 50% of pyruvate and lactate labeled. Surprisingly, there was little alanine labeling from [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose, despite the rise in M+3 <sup>13</sup>C-Alanine in response to Î²3-AR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). During incubation with [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-Glucose, there was depletion of M+6 glucose in the media after CL-316,243 administration, while M+3 pyruvate in the media increased, but did not respond to CL-316,243 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To test whether M+3 lactate derived from [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-Glucose was being released into the media, we measured media M+3 lactate, and found that CL-316,243 increased the release of M+3 lactate into the media when compared to vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

However, it has been demonstrated in the past that cold activation of BAT leads to utilization of other substrates besides fatty acids, such as glucose, amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LÃ³pez-Soriano et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoneshiro et al., 2019</xref>) and acylcarnitines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simcox et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we address a fundamental question in BAT thermogenesis: What is the role of glucose oxidation in short-term non-shivering thermogenesis? Is glycolysis or glucose-derived TCA cycle intermediates needed for efficient thermogenesis in BAT? Thus far, there have not been adequate in vivo models to address these questions. In this study, we combined in vitro U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing experiments with comprehensive in vivo transcriptome and metabolome analysis of activated brown fat to address these questions.</p><p>Gene expression profiling of brown adipose tissue showed that mice exposed to short-term cold exposure exhibit evidence of activated cellular respiration, amino acid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. Similar, but distinct findings have been reported with prolonged cold exposure (2â4 days and 10 days respectively)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosell et al., 2014</xref>). In order to see how acute cold exposure affected the metabolome in mice, we followed up these studies by performing GC-MS metabolomics analysis on serum and BAT of mice housed at 30Â°C, 23Â°C, and 4Â°C for 5 hours. This analyses revealed increased branched chain amino acids, ketones, glucose, and TCA cycle metabolites in BAT with decreased temperatures. These results confirmed the previously proposed idea that BAT is a highly metabolically active tissue that upregulates uptake of various fuels to support the energy demand needed to adapt during cold stress. When stimulated with CL-316,243 for 5 hoursand given [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-labeled glucose, brown adipocytes significantly upregulated <sup>13</sup>C incorporation into pyruvate, lactate, and TCA cycle intermediates, suggesting that glucose catabolism occurs early in BAT activation. These results are an important complement to recent studies that have described the metabolic response to chronic cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosell et al., 2014</xref>). It is not surprising that acute activation of BAT leads to uptake of most substrates available to fuel the heat production process as an initial response to the cold shock. In contrast, cold acclimation or chronic cold exposure, leads to BAT remodeling and adaptive changes such as increased BAT mass, blood flow, and increased mitochondrial numberÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LÃ³pez-Soriano et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rafael et al., 1985</xref>). Our observation that branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are elevated in BAT with cold exposure is consistent with recent findings highlighting their requirement for optimal thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoneshiro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that mitochondrial pyruvate transport, presumably by its utilization in the TCA cycle, is essential for efficient thermogenesis. In wild type mice challenged with short-term cold exposure, we observe higher levels of MPC1 and MPC2 in BAT compared to that of mice housed at thermoneutrality. We propose that the induction of MPC1 and MPC2 is an adaptive mechanism to increase oxidative capacity during prolonged cold exposure. The inability to directly import pyruvate into the mitochondria for further oxidation leads to hypothermia, an indication of impaired thermogenesis. This was observed in our <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>::<italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mouse model where animals had lower core body temperatures during the cold challenge. We also noted small but significant reductions in thermogenic gene expression (<italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Elovl3</italic>, <italic>Pparg</italic>), but there were no compensatory changes in BAT expression of genes required for fatty acid oxidation. However, we did note that loss of MPC leads to upregulation of <italic>Cd36</italic>, which may drive increased fatty acid uptake during the cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>). An obvious alternative source of energy is fatty acids, therefore we measured fatty acid oxidation in brown adipocytes and isolated mitochondria. As noted in the intestine lacking MPC1, brown adipocytes have increased fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensard et al., 2020</xref>). These effects highlight that the inability to transport pyruvate, leads to compensatory metabolic programming towards fatty acid oxidation. The shift towardfatty acid oxidation was supported both by our tracer studies and measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption when palmitoyl-carnitine is provided as a substrate. In addition, there may be compensation through glutamine oxidation, transamination of alanine to pyruvate in the mitochondria, glutamine anaplerosis via glutamate to Î±-ketoglutarate by glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes, or conversion of glutamine-derived malate to pyruvate by mitochondrial malic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bender and Martinou, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCommis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vacanti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>One striking feature observed with cold adaptation in <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>::<italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice and their littermate controls was elevated ketone levels in the blood. <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>::<italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice had significantly elevated serum 3-hydroxybutyrate levels after 6 hr of cold challenge, but there were no measurable differences between the two groups after 6 hr at room temperature. These changes were accompanied by elevated 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in the BAT. Ketogenesis occurs primarily in the liver during exercise or prolonged fasting, and more recently was found to be a cold-induced metaboliteÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newman and Verdin, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newman and Verdin, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Ketones can be exported to extrahepatic tissues for further oxidation as they are rich energy sources. When we measured ketogenic gene expression in the liver, we found that <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>::<italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice had significantly increased <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> levels compared to control mice. Together with serum and BAT metabolomics data this suggest that <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>::<italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice compensate by activating ketone production. At first, we speculated that 3-hydroxybutyrate is utilized by BAT of <italic>Mpc1</italic>-deficient mice to compensate for the inability to oxidize pyruvate. However, in order for ketones to be catabolized in peripheral tissues they have to utilize OXCT1 for import and succinyl-CoA to donate coenzyme-A. In the BAT metabolomics analysis, <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>::<italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice had lower levels of TCA cycle intermediates compared to their littermate controls, including succinic acid, citric acid, and malic acid. This would suggest that oxidative metabolism is limited in the absence of MPC1. Further, this poses a question of why would <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F</sup>::<italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice make more 3-hydroxybutyrate and what role it might have in these mice? One likely explanation is that BAT utilizes ketones for thermogenesis. Alternatively, ketones can promote energy expenditure, mitochondrial biogenesis, and stimulate the expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> in WATÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Srivastava et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our studies aimed to gain a better understanding of the metabolic fate of glucose in BAT during short-term cold exposure. Here, we report a novel mouse model of <italic>Mpc1</italic> loss in brown adipocytes that allowed us to assess the importance of efficient pyruvate import and oxidation for thermogenesis. Understanding the metabolic pathways and key metabolites that are upregulated in brown fat during cold exposure could provide new therapeutic targets to treat metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of Utah.

Lysates were passaged through a 25-gauge needle 10 times. Snap-frozen tissues were homogenized using a TissueLyzer II (Qiagen) in the same lysis buffer. Cell/tissue lysates were centrifuged twice at 13,000 rpm at 4Â°C for 10 min. Lipid layer was removed after each centrifugation. Protein concentrations were measured using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Cat# 23225, Thermo Fisher). 20 Î¼g of total protein was denatured using Laemmli buffer and samples were heated at 50Â°C for 10 min. Protein was loaded onto 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) for 60 min at 100 V for detection with the indicated antibodies. Briefly, membranes were blocked in 5% milk/PBST for 1 hr and then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) in 5% BSA/PBST overnight at 4Â°C. Horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:4000 dilution) were given for 1 hr. Western blots were developed using WesternSure Premium Chemiluminescent substrate (Cat# C807723-02, LI-COR Biosciences) and detected by ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>MPC1 (14462), MPC2 (46141), Î²-Actin (4970), Akt (9272) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies, UCP1 (AB10983), Cytochrome C [7H8.2C12] (AB13575), HMGB1 (AB18256) were purchased from Abcam. 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) and UK5099 were purchased from Tocris.

The data was interquartile range filtered, sum normalized, log2 transformed and autoscaled. Comparison of differentially abundant plasma or BAT metabolites from 3-month-old mice in 30Â°C, 23Â°C, or 4Â°C was performed in MetaboAnalyst 3.0 by using 1-way ANOVA analysis followed by Tukeyâs HSD post hoc test. All other data are presented as meanÂ Â±Â SEM and Studentâs t-test was used to determine significance, unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>RNA sequencing and data processing</title><p>We used the standard procedure of Qiagen RNeasy kit to extract total RNA from BAT of mice. The RNA library for sequencing was prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and rRNA was removed by Ribo-Zero following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The final libraries were normalized in preparation pooling by Kapa Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Platforms and the libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform within a lane for all six samples.Â For RNA-seq data process, we used Rsubread (Bioconductor release 3.8) [23558742] to align sequence reads to reference genome and used edgeR [22287627] and Limma [25605792] R packages (Bioconductor release 3.8) to normalize gene expression level to log2 transcripts per million (TPM) [22872506]. We aligned sequence reads to GRCh38 human genome reference sequence and mapped the aligned sequences to Ensembl or Entrez Gene IDs. After normalization for every sample, we used young room temperature (five mice) and cold room exposed (five mice) samples in this study. The raw RNA-seq data files and normalized expression profile data is available through GEO (GSEOOOOOO).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Clustering analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)</title><p>We removed genes of which expression level is zero across all samples and explored the expression clusters between young room temperature and cold room exposed groups. We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We used Euclidean distance metric in hierarchical clustering, and the first three components in PCA. Furthermore, we validated this result with the supervised learning method, Random Forest. To identify biological processes whose expression differed between the clusters, we ran GSEA using Gene Ontology biological process (version 4.0) gene signatures [16199517]. In this analysis, we used all genes and calculated p-values by permuting the class labels 1000 times. Gene sets with a false discovery rate (FDR) q-valueÂ &lt;0.25 were considered significant. To visualize relationships among the top-performing gene signatures, we used EnrichmentMap [22962466].</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This work addresses the important question of what fuels are required to maintain optimal heat production by brown adipose tissue during cold exposure. The study shows that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is essential for optimal thermogenesis, as conditional deletion of Mpc1 in brown adipocytes leads to impaired cold adaptation. Loss of MPC1 protein in brown adipocytes increased blood levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in cold exposure, suggesting that fatty acids and ketones likely provide an alternative fuel source that may compensate when cytosolic pyruvate is not able to be oxidized. Importantly, the results show that complete glucose oxidation is essential for optimal brown fat thermogenesis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is required for optimal brown fat thermogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There was agreement on the importance of your data showing that cold exposure increased fuel oxidation of glucose and amino acids in brown adipocytes, and the changes were accompanied by enhanced pyruvate uptake and utilization into the brown fat mitochondria. Consistent with these observations, genetic deletion of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC1 in BAT caused cold intolerance in mice. The BAT-MPC1 KO mice exhibited modest but significant glucose intolerance, whereas no difference was seen in insulin sensitivity.</p><p>However, there are a number of issues that were deemed important for you to consider in revising the manuscript before final consideration for publication.</p><p>1) Can you exclude that there is generalized mitochondrial dysfunction in BAT leading to an inability to defend body temperature. In Figure 6B, KO BAT is depleted in a number of TCA cycle intermediates, which could be due to reduced pyruvate oxidation, but could also be due to general defects in mitochondrial metabolism or anaplerotic depletion.

Consistent with these observations, genetic deletion of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC1 in BAT caused cold intolerance in mice. The BAT-MPC1 KO mice exhibited modest but significant glucose intolerance, whereas no difference was seen in insulin sensitivity.</p><p>However, there are a number of issues that were deemed important for you to consider in revising the manuscript before final consideration for publication.</p><p>1) Can you exclude that there is generalized mitochondrial dysfunction in BAT leading to an inability to defend body temperature. In Figure 6B, KO BAT is depleted in a number of TCA cycle intermediates, which could be due to reduced pyruvate oxidation, but could also be due to general defects in mitochondrial metabolism or anaplerotic depletion. The Materials and methods indicate that labeled palmitate was used in some of the in vitro studies, but these data are not discussed or shown. Was flux of palmitate normal or increased? Do KO adipocytes show that respiration rates were normal with gene deletion rather than the acute inhibitor. Also, pyruvate carboxylation is ignored. This could be important for several reasons.

Mitochondria were analyzed using the Oroboros O2k system used for high resolution respirometry. Our findings showed that in the presence of pyruvate/malate there was reduced oxidative capacity. However, when mitochondria are incubated with palmitoyl-carnitine, we found a greater increase in oxygen consumption with the loss of MPC1. This would suggest two things, 1) mitochondria from MPC1-deficient cells have compensated by increasing fatty acid oxidation and 2) the mitochondrial respiratory capacity has not generally been impaired at this stage. In addition, when mitochondria are given ascorbate and TMPD, there is equal maximal respiratory capacity. These findings would argue against general mitochondrial impairment.</p><p><italic>âWas flux of palmitate normal or increased?â</italic> Weâve now included the palmitate labeling data. We find that both M+2 malate and M+2 Glutamate were increased in MPC1 null brown adipocytes, to levels that were achieved with CL<sup>-</sup>316,243 administration. These findings point to a compensatory mechanism that leads to enhanced fatty acid oxidation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5 is confusing because significant amounts of labeled TCA intermediates were detected in MPC1 KO cells after CL treatment.

But as noted by reviewer, there is still some labeling of the TCA pool in MPC1 KO cells.</p><p>While deletion of MPC in brown fat prevents pyruvate from directly entering the mitochondria, it does not exclude use of âback door pathwaysâ that may arise to compensate for the loss of mitochondrial pyruvate intake. Others have shown that there are a few compensatory mechanisms, for example transamination of alanine to pyruvate in the mitochondria, glutamine anaplerosis via glutamate to a-ketoglutarate, or conversion of malate that was derived from glutamine to pyruvate through malic enzyme(Bender and Martinou, 2016; Gray et al., 2015; McCommis et al., 2015; Schell et al., 2014; Vacanti et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014). While under basal conditions (no CL treatment) we see significant increase in labeled lactate in cells lacking MPC1 compared to control cells, it is possible that with the CL<sup>-</sup>316,243 treatment lactate production has already peaked, thus preventing us from seeing further differences in levels of labeled lactate. Alternatively, with CL<sup>-</sup>316,243 treatment we see increased serine labeling, potentially explaining why we do not see further increase in 13C incorporation into the lactate. Another possibility is that lactate produced in the cytosol is converted back to pyruvate in the mitochondrial matrix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) BAT-MPC1 KO mice were hypothermia even though other fuel sources, such as fatty acids and amino acids, were available in the circulation.

When RER values are typically between 0.80 and 0.88, fatty acids are considered the primary fuel. In Figure 4F, <italic>Mpc1</italic><sup>F/F UCP1-Cre</sup> mice have RER higher than 1 at the beginning of the experiment which would suggest that these mice may have higher CO<sub>2</sub> production possibly due to hyperventilation and the increased buffering of blood lactic acid (Ramos-Jimenez et al., 2008). If this is the case, the RER would reflect high lactate levels rather than substrate usage and could potentially explain why these mice have higher RER over period of 4 hours of cold exposure compared to their littermate controls. The TCA intermediates are shown with or without CL<sup>-</sup>316,243 treatment in Figure 6. In control cells, there is significant labeling in response to CL<sup>-</sup>316,243 treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
