Previous work showed that knock-in mice expressing an ASD-linked <italic>Ank2</italic> variant yielding a truncated AnkB440 product exhibit ectopic brain connectivity and behavioral abnormalities. Expression of this variant or loss of AnkB440 caused axonal hyperbranching in vitro, which implicated AnkB440 microtubule bundling activity in suppressing collateral branch formation. Leveraging multiple mouse models, cellular assays, and live microscopy, we show that AnkB440 also modulates axon collateral branching stochastically by reducing the number of F-actin-rich branch initiation points. Additionally, we show that AnkB440 enables growth cone (GC) collapse in response to chemorepellent factor semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) by stabilizing its receptor complex L1 cell adhesion molecule/neuropilin-1. ASD-linked <italic>ANK2</italic> variants failed to rescue Sema 3A-induced GC collapse. We propose that impaired response to repellent cues due to AnkB440 deficits leads to axonal targeting and branch pruning defects and may contribute to the pathogenicity of <italic>ANK2</italic> variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ankyrin</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd><kwd>ANK2</kwd><kwd>axon branching</kwd><kwd>Sema 3a</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorenzo</surname><given-names>Damaris N</given-names></name><name><surname>Creighton</surname><given-names>Blake A</given-names></name><name><surname>Afriyie</surname><given-names>Simone</given-names></name><name><surname>Ajit</surname><given-names>Deepa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 NS045892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorenzo</surname><given-names>Damaris N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 HD079124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorenzo</surname><given-names>Damaris N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS116859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casingal</surname><given-names>Cristine R</given-names></name><name><surname>Anton</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD098657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casingal</surname><given-names>Cristine R</given-names></name><name><surname>Anton</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Giant ankyrin-B enables the transduction of Sema 3A repelling cues and is important for normal axonal connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise wiring of the neural circuitry relies on a tightly regulated spatiotemporal program of axonal extension and pathfinding to form synapses with their targets. The remarkable task of correctly extending the axon through dense three-dimensional spaces such as the developing mammalian brain is driven by the growth cone (GC), the highly dynamic structure that provides the mechanical force at the tip of the growing axon. To contact targets not in their path and to maximize the number of synapses, most neurons multiply interneuron contact points through collateral axon branches, which are also extended by individual GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>). In humans, most synapses are assembled during brain development, which number is markedly reduced by adulthood via refinements that include the pruning of axons, collateral branches, dendrites, and dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Low and Cheng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moriyama et al., 1996</xref>). The growth and guidance of axonal processes and the sculpting of synaptic connections are determined by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic cellular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</xref>). Mistargeting, deficits or excess of axonal processes can lead to hypo-, hyper-, or aberrant neuronal connectivity, which in turn may underlie functional deficits associated with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holiga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taquet et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Ankyrin-B (AnkB) is an integral component of the submembrane cytoskeleton involved in the organization of specialized domains that include ion channels, membranes transporters, cell adhesion molecules, and other scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2016</xref>). AnkB has emerged as a critical determinant of structural neural connectivity through diverse and divergent roles of its two major, alternatively spliced isoforms in the brain; neuronal-specific 440 kDa (‘giant’) AnkB (AnkB440) and ubiquitously expressed 220 kDa AnkB (AnkB220) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorenzo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). AnkB knockout mice lacking expression of both AnkB220 and AnkB440 exhibit noticeable reduction in the length and number of long axon tracts in multiple brain areas and experience early neonatal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scotland et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). Correspondingly, cultured neurons from these mice fail to properly elongate their axons, in part due to reductions in the axonal transport of multiple organelles. AnkB220 enables organelle transport by coupling the retrograde motor complex to vesicles in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>) and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lorenzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzo and Bennett, 2017</xref>). Rescue with AnkB220 is sufficient to restore both normal axonal growth and organelle trafficking in vitro. In contrast, the lifespan and overall development of mice lacking only AnkB440 (AnkB440 KO) appear normal. However, AnkB440 KO mice exhibit abnormal communication and sexual behavior responses, repetitive behavior, and increased executive function in the absence of ASD-associated comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). These behavioral deficits are also present in knock-in mice bearing a frameshift mutation (AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup>) in the inserted exon unique to AnkB440 that models a human variant found in an individual diagnosed with ASD. AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup> mice have normal AnkB220 expression in the brain, and instead of full-length AnkB440, they express reduced levels of a truncated 290 kDa AnkB polypeptide lacking a portion of the neuronal-specific domain (NSD) and the entire death and C-terminal regulatory domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Diffusion tension imaging (DTI) tractography of AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup> brains revealed the presence of ectopic axon projections and stochastic alterations in axonal connectivity, consistent with a potential role of AnkB440 in modulating the formation, guidance, and refinement of axonal connections in the developing brain. In line with these findings, primary cortical neurons from both AnkB440 KO and AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup> mice exhibit increased axonal branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). AnkB440 directly binds and bundles microtubules through a bipartite microtubule-interaction site within the neuronal-specific domain, which is required to suppress ectopic axonal branching in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, AnkB440, but not AnkB220, binds L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) at axonal membranes, where AnkB440 and L1CAM collaborate to coordinate positioning and local dynamics of cortical microtubules and prevent the stabilization of nascent axonal filopodia and maturation into collateral axon branches. In agreement with this model, cultured neurons from knock-in mice bearing the L1CAM variant p.Y1229H, which lacks AnkB440 binding activity, show excess axon collateral branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ankyrin-B 440 suppresses the formation of axonal filopodia in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of the two major ankyrin-B isoforms in the mammalian brain and their functional domains.

We demonstrate that axons require AnkB440, but not AnkB220, to transduce the chemorepellent signals induced by the extrinsic factor semaphorin-3A (Sema 3 A). GCs in the primary axon and in collateral branches of cultured cortical neurons from AnkB440 KO mice fail to collapse in response to Sema 3 A. This suggests that in addition to suppressing axon collateral branch initiation, AnkB440 is involved in collateral branch pruning. However, unlike the suppression of branch point initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), GC collapse and branch retraction did not involve the interaction of AnkB440 with microtubules. On the other hand, binding activity between AnkB440 and L1CAM is necessary for normal transduction of Sema 3 A cues and for downstream actin cytoskeleton remodeling, but it does not involve AnkB partner βII-spectrin. We propose that this mechanism contributes to defects in the formation, organization, and targeting of axonal tracts observed in AnkB440 KO mouse brains. Lastly, we found that selected <italic>ANK2</italic> variants found in individuals with ASD phenocopied the loss of response to Sema 3 A, indicating a potential mechanism of pathogenicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of AnkB440, but not AnkB220, results in higher density of actin patches, filopodia, and collateral axon branches</title><p>Most collateral branches emerge from transient actin-rich nucleation sites along the axon, which give rise to branch precursor filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gallo, 2011</xref>).

AnkB440 recruits and stabilizes microtubules at the plasma membrane and its loss has been proposed to cause axonal hyperbranching in vitro by promoting microtubule unbundling and invasion of nascent branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).

We previously reported that AnkB220 promotes axonal growth and axonal transport of organelles, including mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>), which has been implicated in axonal hyperbranching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, AnkB220 associates with microtubules in biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis and Bennett, 1984</xref>). Changes in AnkB220 expression could contribute to or compensate for deficits in AnkB440 and its effects on axonal branching. Thus, we sought to determine whether AnkB220 and AnkB440 have independent roles in axonal branch formation using cortical neurons harvested from AnkB440 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) and from a novel conditional AnkB220 KO mouse model (herein referred as AnkB220 KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Furthermore, the presence of larger and more stable actin patches within the primary axon directly correlates with the formation of axon protrusions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hand et al., 2015</xref>). We found that loss of AnkB440 in day in vitro 1 (DIV1) cortical neurons resulted in increased number of actin patches relative to control and AnkB220 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These mCherry-Lifeact-labeled F-actin patches marked potential sites for emerging filopodia, some of which failed to initiate filopodia extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref><italic>, closed yellow arrowheads</italic>), while others extended filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref><italic>, open yellow arrowheads</italic>), a portion of which retracted and vanished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref><italic>, closed teal arrowheads</italic>). While the lifespan of actin patches was similar across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), a higher proportion of actin patches developed into nascent filopodia protrusions in AnkB440 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), which correlated with a higher density of both axonal filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and collateral axon branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Neurons lacking AnkB440 extended similar number of processes as control neurons prior to axon specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). However, loss of AnkB220, but not of AnkB440, resulted in shorter axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,C,D</xref>) and impaired organelle transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), which confirms our previous findings based on in vitro rescue experiments that AnkB220 is critical for axonal growth and organelle dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). Deficits in actin patch formation, axon filopodia density, and number of collateral axon branches of AnkB440 KO neurons were restored by expression of AnkB440, but not of AnkB220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 1—figure supplements 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3A-D</xref>). This indicates that while AnkB440 suppresses collateral branch formation, AnkB220 is not a cell-autonomous determinant of axon branching, and that elevations in AnkB220 do not influence organelle dynamics in AnkB440 deficient axons. Together, our data suggest that in addition to the previously proposed role of loss of AnkB440 in stabilizing axon branching by promoting microtubule invasion of nascent axonal filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), AnkB440 deficits also contribute to axonal hyperbranching stochastically by inducing the formation of a higher number of axonal filopodia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of AnkB440 results in increased axonal collateral branching in vivo and altered development of axonal tracts</title><p>DTI tractography analysis of AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup> brains, which lack full-length AnkB440 but express a truncated 290 kDa AnkB440 polypeptide, display stochastic increases in cortical axon connectivity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).

First, we established that AnkB440 loss does not alter L1CAM expression in total lysates from PND1 AnkB440 KO cortex or from AnkB440 KO cortical neuron cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Using a biotinylation assay that labels and captures surface proteins in cortical neuron cultures, we determined that AnkB440 loss markedly reduced surface levels of L1CAM relative to its membrane abundance in control neurons, while surface levels of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). These findings indicate that AnkB440 is required to maintain normal levels of L1CAM at the cell surface of neurons. L1CAM is not a Sema 3 A receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellani et al., 2000</xref>). Instead, L1CAM directly binds the Sema 3 A receptor Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1998</xref>), which due to its short cytoplasmic domain requires the formation of complexes with transmembrane co-receptors to be stably anchored at the cell surface and propagate repulsive Sema 3 A signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castellani et al., 2002</xref>). In addition to the L1CAM-Nrp1 complex, Plexin A1 also takes part in the transduction of Sema 3 A signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bechara et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we next evaluated whether these two receptors participate in AnkB440-L1CAM modulation of Sema 3 A effects. Loss of AnkB440 KO led to a slight increase of Nrp1 levels in total cortical lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>) and to a marked reduction of surface-bound Nrp1 in AnkB440 KO cortical neurons, assessed via surface biotinylation, despite its increased total expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).

This microtubule-binding activity is required to suppress ectopic axon branching in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). The site of microtubule interaction in AnkB440 comprises a module of 15 tandem imperfect 12-aa repeats that includes highly conserved residues in the third (Pro, P), fifth (Ser, S), and ninth positions (Lys, K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).

As previously observed in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizawa et al., 2001</xref>), levels of pCofilin rose rapidly (above 3-fold) in the GCs of control cortical neurons during the first minute after exposure to Sema 3 A, but underwent a sharp reduction during the next four minutes to 43 % of basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). This sharp F-actin stabilizing period followed by a fast increase in F-actin depolymerization is thought to reflect the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during GC collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizawa et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with this plausible signaling cascade and lesser GC collapse due to a diminished response to Sema 3 A, GCs of both AnkB440 KO and p.Y1229H L1CAM neurons showed a different pattern of cofilin phosphorylation. First, basal pCofilin signal per GC area was roughly 40% and 30% lower in AnkB440 KO and p.Y1229H L1CAM neurons, respectively, relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>), which is consistent with lower levels of pCofilin in AnkB440 brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>). Second, in contrast to the higher than three-fold increase in control neurons, the rise in pCofilin during the first minute of Sema 3 A treatment was below two-fold in both AnkB440 KO and p.Y1229H L1CAM GCs, which represented only 30–40% of control levels. Lastly, in AnkB440 KO and p.Y1229H L1CAM GCs the reduction of pCofilin 5 min past Sema 3 A treatment was approximately only 20 % lower than its peak at one minute and remained around 50 % above basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). These aberrant patterns of cofilin regulation indicate that AnkB440 and its association with L1CAM promote steps of the Sema 3 A signal transduction pathways upstream of changes in cofilin activation and F-actin disassembly during GC collapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Autism-linked <italic>ANK2</italic> variants affect the transduction of Sema 3A repulsive cues</title><p>The results above support a mechanism wherein AnkB440 is required to modulate the initiation, growth, and establishment of axon collateral branches and to properly respond to Sema 3 A repulsive cues that modulate GC collapse, axon guidance and targeting, and pruning.

Despite their structural similarities and degree of sequence conservation, ankyrins diverge in cell type expression, subcellular localization, and protein partners in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorenzo, 2020</xref>). For instance, AnkG preferentially localizes to the axon initial segment (AIS), where it acts as the master regulator of AIS organization, while AnkB is widely distributed throughout the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorenzo, 2020</xref>). Ankyrins achieve a second order of functional specialization through alternative splicing, which yields giant isoforms with unique inserted sequences in both AnkG and AnkB in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorenzo, 2020</xref>). ASD-linked AnkB variants fall both within the inserted region unique to AnkB440 and in domains shared by AnkB440 and AnkB220 isoforms.</p><p>The present study sheds new light into the isoform-specific functions of AnkB in modulating axonal architecture, targeting, and refinement in the developing brain and the potential contribution of AnkB deficits to ASD pathology. We previously showed that expression of the truncated product of the frameshift mutation p.P2589fs that models the human de novo p.(R2608fs) ASD variant in AnkB440 causes stochastic increases in structural cortical connectivity in mouse brains and exuberant collateral axon branching in cortical neuron cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). We confirmed the development of axon hyperbranching in cultured neurons selectively lacking AnkB440 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), but not in neurons from AnkB220 KO mice. Using Golgi staining, we determined that AnkB440 KO, but not AnkB220 KO, cortical neurons grow more collateral branches in the proximal axon, consistent with the in vitro results. We also found volumetric increases of multiple commissural and other axon tracts in AnkB440 KO mice and deficits in topographic order of midline CC axons arising from the somatosensory cortex and the targeting of their contralateral projections. These changes in cortical structural connectivity likely result from combined defects in axon branching initiation, fasciculation, guidance, and pruning of ectopic projections during development. These findings support critical and specialized roles of AnkB440 in modulating both axon collateral branch formation and refinement.</p><p>Previous results implicated AnkB440 in suppressing collateral branch formation via the stabilization of microtubule bundles near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of AnkB440 or expression of the 290 kDa truncated AnkB440 product promotes microtubule unbundling, which facilitates microtubule invasion of the nascent filopodia, a necessary step in the commitment to forming a new branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 1994</xref>). The establishment of transient actin nucleation sites marks the point of formation and precedes the emergence of the precursor filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gallo, 2011</xref>). In this study, we show that selective loss of AnkB440 KO in cultured cortical neurons results in a larger number of actin patches relative to control and AnkB220 KO neurons, which correlated with higher number of axonal filopodia and collateral branches. Thus, AnkB440 modulates collateral branch formation through a combined mechanism that suppresses the stochastic formation of collateral filopodia by lowering the density of F-actin-rich branch initiation points, as well as the invasion of microtubules into the maturing filopodia. Although F-actin patches serving as precursor to filopodia have been observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Loudon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spillane et al., 2011</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spillane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hand et al., 2015</xref>), little is known about the factors that regulate their formation and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>). How AnkB440 modulate actin patches is not clear. One possibility is that AnkB440 associates with actin regulators that suppress the availability of actin monomers and/or of branched actin required for actin nucleation, and the formation of focal F-actin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spillane et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we found that AnkB440 loss increases active levels of cofilin, a positive regulator of actin turnover and dynamics, neurite outgrowth, and axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Flynn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tedeschi et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, AnkB440 may associate with actin through their common partner βII-spectrin, although loss of βII-spectrin does not lead to axonal hyperbranching in vitro and may not affect the number or dynamics of actin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lorenzo et al., 2019</xref>). The crosstalk between actin and microtubule networks has also been proposed to orchestrate the emergence of branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dent and Kalil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pacheco and Gallo, 2016</xref>), and splaying of microtubule bundles have been observed to correlate with F-actin accumulation at branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dent and Kalil, 2001</xref>). Thus, it is possible that microtubule unbundling resulting from AnkB440 deficits promotes the seeding and growth of F-actin patches at sites of axon branch formation. While loss of AnkB220 does not affect axonal branching in vitro and in mouse brains, its expression in AnkB440 null neurons may be necessary to sustain hyperbranching. This is possibly due to the role of AnkB220 in axonal organelle and vesicle transport and growth, which are not affected by exclusive loss of AnkB440. It will be important to investigate how AnkB440 modulates actin dynamics and its effects on other actin-dependent processes during neuronal and brain development.</p><p>While cell-autonomous factors that modulate axonal branching in vitro, such as the formation of actin patches, correlate with the number of axon branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gallo, 2011</xref>), live imaging of actin dynamics during in vivo axonal development found that this correlation does not hold in projection neurons in the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hand et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, the number of collateral axon branches along the axon is determined by the cortical layer they transverse, indicating that extrinsic factors that modulate branch formation and pruning may be involved in determining the pattern of axon innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hand et al., 2015</xref>). Several reports support the activity of Sema 3 A as an extrinsic repellent cue that inhibits axon branching in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dent et al., 2004</xref>) and prunes cortical axons and collateral axon branches in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polleux et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagri et al., 2003</xref>). Nrp1-mediated Sema3A signaling also promotes the topographic order of axons from different cortical areas within the CC midline and their homotopic contralateral targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martín-Fernández et al., 2021</xref>). We show that AnkB440 is required to transduce repellent Sema 3 A signals in vitro to facilitate the collapse of GCs from the primary axon and collateral branches, which offers a plausible cellular mechanism underlying the ectopic axon connectivity, deficits in developmental axon refinement, and the axon hyperbranching observed in AnkB440-deficient mouse brains. Impaired transduction of Sema 3 A likely also contributes to the disrupted topographic organization of S1-derived callosal axons at the CC midline and their aberrant contralateral targeting. The observed CC defects do not involved oligodendrocytes, which do not express measurable amounts of AnkB440. However, neuronal loss of AnkB440 resulted in loose myelin wraps in the CC, which are possibly indicative of myelin decompaction and warrants further investigation.</p><p>AnkB440-mediated transduction of Sema 3 A during GC collapse involves AnkB440 binding to L1CAM, which in turn stabilizes the Sema 3 A holoreceptor complex L1CAM-Nrp1 at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castellani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castellani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castellani et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, GCs of neurons lacking the F-actin and AnkB partner βII-spectrin respond normally to Sema 3 A, which indicates that βII-spectrin is not required for Sema 3A-induced GC collapse. However, given βII-spectrin’s role in the development and wiring of axons in mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lorenzo et al., 2019</xref>) and the recent identification that pathogenic variants in the βII-spectrin encoding gene <italic>SPTBN1</italic> cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with deficits in cortical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousin et al., 2021</xref>), we cannot rule out its involvement in axonal guidance through alternative mechanisms. Interestingly, although AnkB440 binding to microtubules suppresses branch initiation, loss of this interaction does not affect the response to Sema 3 A during GC collapse. Instead, transduction of Sema 3 A signaling via the AnkB440-L1CAM-Nrp1 complex modulates F-actin dynamics through LIMK phosphorylation of cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of AnkB440-mediated growth cone collapse.</title><p>AnkB440 binds the cytoplasmic domain of L1CAM to stabilize the L1CAM-Nrp1 holoreceptor complex at the cell surface.

Source data files also include numerical data that are represented as graphs in the figures.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69815-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our structure-function studies in AnkB440 KO cortical neurons found that de novo ASD variants p.(R1145Q), p.(P1843S), p.R2589fs, and p.(E3429V) in AnkB440 fail to restore cellular responses to Sema 3 A during GC collapse. Interestingly, expression of the p.R2589fs variants caused axon hyperbranching in vitro and ectopic axon connectivity in vivo, and the remaining variants did not rescue normal collateral branching in AnkB440 KO neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The 290 KDa AnkB440 product of p.R2589fs is expressed at slightly reduced levels compared to full-length AnkB440 and shows reduced binding to L1CAM in vivo (assessed through PLA) despite preserving the L1CAM binding region in the membrane binding domain (MBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). This diminished AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup>-L1CAM association may result from the lower expression of the truncated AnkB440 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), although it is also possible that this truncation may induce changes in the conformation or self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) of truncated AnkB440 that might interfere with its association with L1CAM. The mechanisms by which the other ASD AnkB440 variants evaluated disrupt AnkB440 function are less clear. The p.(P1843S) might alter AnkB440 distribution. This variant also falls within the microtubule binding region of AnkB440 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) and may affect microtubule binding, which if true, may explain the axon hyperbranching phenotype, but it is not clear how it interferes with GC collapse. Both ASD variants p.(R1145Q) and p.(E3429V) in AnkB440 reside outside of the MBD and the microtubule-binding regions. p.(R1145Q) is located in the ZU5<sup>C</sup> domain shared by AnkB220 and AnkB440 and it may affect AnkB’s ability to bind PI3P lipids, given its proximity to the PI3P lipids binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). However, while AnkB220 requires binding to PI3P lipids to associate with intracellular membranes and enable axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>), AnkB440 does not modulate axonal transport. In future experiments it would be important to determine whether AnkB440 binds PI3P lipids and the significance of AnkB440-PI3P lipid binding activity for axonal development and axonal connectivity in the developing brain.</p><p>Besides the significance of <italic>ANK2</italic> in ASD, neuronal pathways involving the AnkB440-L1CAM complex are also relevant to other neurological diseases. For example, a few hundred variants in L1CAM have been described in individuals with CC hypoplasia, retardation, adducted thumbs, apasticity and hydrocephalus (CRASH) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosenthal et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jouet et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weller and Gärtner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vos et al., 2010</xref>). Pathological L1CAM variants can affect both its extra- and intracellular domains and disrupt binding to molecular partners including AnkB and Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schäfer and Altevogt, 2010</xref>). Studies in mouse models that constitutively lack L1CAM have reported CC hypoplasia, cerebellar and other brain malformations, and axon guidance defects in the corticospinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dahme et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fransen et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem (ES) cells in which expression of endogenous L1CAM was knockdown through homologous recombination showed reduced axonal length and deficient axonal branching relative to matching control neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patzke et al., 2016</xref>). These results are in contrast with the cellular phenotypes we observe in AnkB440 KO neurons, even though ES cell-derived L1CAM KO neurons showed noticeable downregulation of AnkB, which appear to have been largely driven by significant loss of AnkB440. We found that loss of AnkB440 reduces L1CAM abundance at the cell surface but does not significantly change total levels of L1CAM in the cortex or in cortical neuron cultures. L1CAM expression is also normal in brains of AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). While it is plausible that normal AnkB expression requires L1CAM, and not the reverse, it would be important to confirm whether these changes in protein expression are specific to human ES cell-derived neurons. The phenotypic differences between AnkB440- and L1CAM-deficient mice point to additional, independent pathways involving AnkB440 and L1CAM, including the functional relationship of L1CAM with other ankyrins, which collectively underscore the importance of these proteins in neuronal structure and signaling. For instance, a recent report implicates an L1CAM-AnkG association at the AIS of neocortical pyramidal neurons in their innervation by GABAergic chandelier cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tai et al., 2019</xref>). AnkB440 is widely distributed through all axonal domains, including the AIS. Further work will be needed to determine whether AnkB440-L1CAM complexes localize at the AIS and if they contribute to this specific type of pyramidal neuron innervation.</p><p>In summary, our findings unveil a critical role of AnkB440 and its binding to L1CAM in promoting the clustering of L1CAM-Nrp1 complexes at the cell surface of GCs of cortical neurons. Accordingly, we show that the AnkB440-L1CAM-Nrp1 complex enables the chemorepellent action of Sema 3 A to induce GC collapse in axons and collateral branches, thereby providing novel insight into the mechanisms of axonal guidance, topographic ordering of CC axons, contralateral callosal axon targeting, and collateral branch pruning. As we show, <italic>ANK2</italic> variants cause disruption of this signaling axis, which might lead to cortical miswiring and contribute to the neuropathology of ASD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ank2<sup>440flox</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31285321/">31285321</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MGI ID: 6784039.

In brief, the CCTop website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://crispr.cos.uni-heidelberg.de">https://crispr.cos.uni-heidelberg.de</ext-link>) was used to identify potential Cas9 guide RNAs targeting <italic>Ank2</italic> intron 35 and the 5’ end of exon 37.

Cells were selected on G418 and resistant clones were screened for homologous integration of the donor vector at the <italic>Ank2</italic> locus. PCR-positive clones were analyzed by Southern blot with 5’ and 3’ external probes and neomycin cassette internal probe. Two clones, F6 and H10, were identified with homologous integration of the donor. Targeted ES cell clones F6 and H10 were injected in Albino C57BL/6 N blastocysts for chimera production.

Cortices were dissected in Hibernate E (Life Technologies) and digested with 0.25 % trypsin in HBSS (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37 °C. Tissue was washed three times with HBSS, dissociated in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Genesee), and gently triturated through a glass pipette with a fire-polished tip. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer to remove any residual non-dissociated tissue and plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated 1.5 mm coverglasses or dishes (MatTek) at a density of 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> for transfection and imaging experiments. For all cultures, media was replaced 3 hours after plating with serum-free Neurobasal-A medium containing B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 2 mM Glutamax (Life Technologies), and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) (neuronal growth media). 5 μM cytosine-D-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) was added to the culture medium to inhibit the growth of glial cells three days after plating. Neurons were maintained at 37 °C with 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> and fed twice a week with freshly made culture medium until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Plasmid Transfection for Time-Lapse Live Imaging and Immunofluorescence Analysis</title><p>For neuronal rescue experiments, AnkB440 KO primary cortical neurons were transfected with Halo-tagged AnkB440 or GFP-tagged AnkB220 plasmids at DIV0 by lipofection (Lipofectamine 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After brain dissociation, 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml neurons were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 (12 µl/ml) and plasmid DNA (2.5 µg/ml) in suspension at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were pelleted at 200 g for 4 minutes and plated in poly-D-lysine-coated coverglasses or dishes and used for studies at 16 hours after transfection and plating (DIV1), 28–36 hours post plating (DIV1-2), 72 hours post plating (DIV3), or five days post plating (DIV5). For time-lapse imaging of organelle dynamics, DIV5 cortical neurons were co-transfected with 1 µg of pLAMP1-GFP using lipofectamine 2000 and imaged 48–96 hours after transfection. For experiments that evaluate axonal length and branching, DIV0 neurons were transfected with 500 ng of pmCherry-C1, either alone or in combination with Halo-tagged AnkB440 or GFP-tagged AnkB220 plasmids. Neurons were processed for immunofluorescence one or five days after transfection. For assessment of actin patch dynamics, neurons were transfected with 500 ng of mCherry-Lifeact plasmid at DIV0 by lipofection and evaluated at DIV1 through time-lapse microscopy. For assessment of actin dynamics during Sema 3A-induced GC collapse, neurons were transfected with 500 ng of mCherry-Lifeact plasmid at DIV0 by lipofection and evaluated at DIV3 through time-lapse microscopy upon treatment with Sema 3 A. Evaluation of L1CAM binding to GFP-tagged AnkB220 or AnkB440 through a membrane recruitment assay was conducted HEK293T in cells independently transfected with 100 ng of pcDNA3.1-L1CAM, GFP-AnkB220, or GFP-AnkB440 plasmids, or co-transfected with 100 ng of pcDNA3.1-L1CAM in combination with either GFP-AnkB220 or GFP-AnkB440 plasmids 48 hours post-transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Growth Cone Collapse Experiments</title><p>DIV3 neurons were treated with Sema 3 A (250 ng/ml, Peprotech, # 150–17 H) or Ephrin A5 (1 µg/ml, R&amp;D Systems, # 374-EA) for 1, 5, 15, or 30 min in neuronal growth media, fixed for 15 min with 4 % PFA/4 % sucrose, and washed in PBS. Neurons were permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked in antibody buffer (4 % BSA, 0.1 % Tween-20 in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature. Neurons were stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and with a mix of secondary antibodies and phalloidin for two hours at room temperature. Neurons transfected with plasmids expressing Halo-tagged AnkB440 proteins were treated with fresh media containing Sema 3 A and with the JF 549 HaloTag ligand (1:200) for 30 min. The percent of collapsed growth cones was recorded for each experimental condition, selecting for transfection when applicable. Axon growth cones were recorded as collapsed based on the presence of a pencil-like shape devoid of lamellae and with a maximum of one filopodia, or intact based on the fan-shaped morphology enriched in filopodia and/or lamellipodia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Neuron and OPC cultures cells were grown in PDL hydrobromide-coated 1.5 glass coverslips. HEK293T cells were grown in uncoated MatTek dishes. All cells were washed with cold PBS, fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 min, and permeabilized with either 0.2 % Triton-X100 in PBS for 10 min (neurons and HEK293T cells) or with 0.1 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 5 % donkey serum with 1 % BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and processed for staining as tissue sections. For F-actin labeling, Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 568-, or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated phalloidin (1:100) was added to the secondary antibody mix. To label surface Nrp1, fixed but non-permeabilized DIV3 cortical neurons, untreated and treated with Sema 3 A, were blocked as described above and incubated overnight at 44 °C with a rabbit anti-Nrp1 antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope, followed by overnight incubation with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568. Neurons were fixed again for 10 min with 4 % PFA in PBS, permeabilized for 8 minutes with 0.2 % Triton X-100 in PBS, reblocked with antibody buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies and phalloidin were applied in antibody buffer overnight at °4 C. Cells were mounted for imaging with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Life technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)</title><p>PLA was performed using the commercial Duolink kit (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Fixed and permeabilized neurons were incubated overnight with a pair of primary antibodies specific for the putative interacting partners, each produced in different species. Duolink minus- and plus-probes were used to detect antibody-labeled proteins. In the case of the detection of PLA signal between surface Nrp1 and L1CAM, fixed, but non-permeabilized neurons were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-Nrp1 antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope, followed by cell permeabilization and overnight incubation with mouse anti-L1CAM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Image Acquisition and Image Analysis</title><p>Brain sections and cultures cells stained with antibodies were imaged using a Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) and 405-, 488-, 561-, and 633 nm lasers. Single images and Z-stacks and tile scans were collected using the 10 x (0.45 NA), 20 x (0.8 NA) and Plan Apochromat 40 x oil (1.4 NA) and 63 x oil (1.4 NA) objective lenses. Images of OPCs were acquired on a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Nikon Ti2 inverted body with Yokogawa X1 spinning disk) using a scMOS camera (Hamamatsu FusionBT) run by Nikon Elements software. Images were processed, and measurements taken and analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. Three-dimensional rendering of confocal Z-stacks was performed using Imaris (Bitplane). Golgi-stained brains were imaged using a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse scope running NIS-Elements. Widefield Z-stacks were taken with 2 µm optical section in the primary somatosensory cortex with a 40 x/NA objective. To quantify CC fasciculation and targeting of contralateral projections, lines were traced through indicated regions of interest and measurements of fluorescence intensity obtained using the “Plot profile” function of ImageJ. AnkB440 staining intensity in OPCs was analyzed by drawing a circle region of interest (ROI) around the cell and quantifying the intensity within this ROI using Nikon Elements software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Time-Lapse Video Microscopy and Movie Analyses</title><p>Live microscopy of neuronal cultures was carried out using a Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a GaAsP detector and a temperature- and CO<sub>2</sub>-controlled incubation chamber as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Snouwaert et al., 2018</xref>). Movies were taken in the distal axon and captured at a rate of 1 frame/second for time intervals ranging from 60 to 300 seconds with a 40 x oil objective (1.4NA) using the zoom and definite focus functions. Movies were processed and analyzed using ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>). Kymographs were obtained using the KymoToolBox plugin for ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fabricecordelieres/IJ_KymoToolBox">https://github.com/fabricecordelieres/IJ_KymoToolBox</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zala et al., 2013</xref>). In details, space (x axis in µm) and time (y axis in sec) calibrated kymographs were generated from video files. In addition, the KymoToolBox plugin was used to manually follow a subset of particles from each kymograph and report the tracked particles on the original kymograph and video files using a color code for movement directionality (red for anterograde, green for retrograde and blue for stationary particles). Quantitative analyses were performed manually by following the trajectories of individual particles to calculate dynamic parameters including, net and directional velocities and net and directional run length, as well as time of pause or movement in a direction of transport. Anterograde and retrograde motile vesicles were defined as particles showing a net displacement &gt;3 μm in one direction. Stationary vesicles were defined as particles with a net displacement &lt;2 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size (n) for evaluations of growth cone collapse was estimated using power analyses and expected effect sizes based on preliminary data in which we used similar methodologies, specimens, and reagents.

neuronal branching and axon growth. They assess the role of the neuronal specific form of the scaffolding protein ankyrin-B, and how its depletion or autism-spectrum disorder mutations affect cortical axon branching, targeting, and developmental refinement. Overall, their work develops a new model for how ankyrin-B functions with the Sema 3A receptor complex formed by cell adhesion molecule L1CAM and neuropilin-1, and an actin severing protein (cofilin) during cortical axon development and provides insight into how this process is altered in autism spectrum disorders. This manuscript will be of interest to cell, developmental, and neuronal biologists interested in the biological mechanisms of early circuit development, and how these mechanisms relate to autism spectrum disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69815.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ori-McKenney</surname><given-names>Kassandra M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>California of University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Richards</surname><given-names>Linda J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.05.03.442401">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.03.442401v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Linda J Richards (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All of the reviewers agreed that the authors should provide more data and analyses to explain the increase in corpus callosum thickness in the AnkB440 mutant mice. The reasoning behind the corpus callosum enlargement is unclear and the reviewers suggest a number of experiments that can be performed to address this interesting observation.</p><p>2) All of the reviewers agreed that additional in vivo experiments should be performed to analyze other phenotypes of the AnkB440 mice. Are other axonal tracts increased in size or only the corpus callosum? Is myelination normal? Are the general trajectories of the cortical axons impaired? Do cultured AnkB440 mutant neurons extend a similar number of processes as wild type neurons before axon specification (presumably the authors already have this data that they can perform additional analyses on)? The results of these experiments would be very informative for this study.</p><p>3) The reviewers suggested that the authors further examine the effects of mutant AnkB440 on certain functions of the Sema3 signaling pathway. For example, is the contralateral targeting of callosal axons perturbed in the AnkB440 mutant mice (this links back to #1 as well)?</p><p>4) The reviewers suggested that the authors flesh out the role of AnkB a bit more with regards to its effects on F-actin. For example, in cultured AnkB440 mutant neurons, does the difference in F-actin patches impact process initiation or stability or both?</p><p>5) One reviewer suggested adding a working model at the end, which would nicely tie together the data and overall conclusions of the paper. Due to the involvement of AnkB in Sema3A signaling and subsequent actin remodeling, we highly recommend a cartoon to help guide the reader.</p><p>6) Please refer to the specific comments that the reviewers make about image quality, inclusion of replicate numbers and relevant statistical tests, figure labels and keys, and general text editing to improve the overall accessibility of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be helpful to provide more information about the in vivo phenotype. Are other axon tracts increased in size? Yang et al., 2019 identified other axonal tracts were also enlarged in AnkB440 KO mice. Corpus callosum hyperplasia is seen in patients with neurofibromatosis 1. In this condition, it appears to be due to alterations in oligodendrocyte development and myelination (Wang et al., 2012 Cell doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.034; Asleh et al. 2020; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2008391117). Are the authors certain that AnkB440 is not expressed in oligodendrocytes? Is myelination normal in the mutants or is there increased wrapping of the axons? If AnkB440 is only expressed by neurons, it could be that there is an effect on activity of the callosal axons which then affects oligodendrocytes in a non-cell-autonomous manner (see Mitew et al., 2018 Nature Comms doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02719-2). Nrp1-Sema3A signalling is also required for the targeting of callosal axons in the contralateral hemisphere (Zhou et al., 2013 PNAS, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310233110). It is possible that contralateral targeting of callosal axons and/or their selection of contralateral targets might be disrupted in AnkB440 mutants. This could be examined using in utero electroporation of a reporter construct to achieve sparse axonal labelling to examine the entire callosal trajectory. This would provide more compelling in vivo evidence for increased axonal branching than is presented with the Golgi staining of cell bodies with increased dendritic branching.</p><p>The poor image contrast in Figure 1 makes it difficult to identify the filopodia in the image. The figure legend mentions asterisks for panel D but there are none on the image.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several questions regarding the consequences of ANKB440 deletion on cortical connectivity. It is not clear to me how the authors link the excess branching and the defective response to Sema3A to alterations of cortical connectivity. For example, the authors report an increase of the corpus callosum thickness in ANKB440 mutants. With their analysis of the local branching pattern of cortical neurons with Golgi staining, do the authors want to suggest that CC thickness increase is due to additional collaterals that would have traveled along with the primary axon? Do they rather think that ANKB440 cortical axons elaborate more collaterals from their shaft during their navigation?</p><p>Could CC thickness increase be due to axon-axon defasciculation? L1-CAM- Nrp1 labeling could be achieved to look at how fibers are organized in the CC tract.</p><p>Is it feasible to distinguish the response of the growth cone of the main axon from that of the growth cones from the collaterals? Do the authors think that the lack of response to Sema3A of ANKB440 cortical neurons will impact in vivo on the pruning or rather on the initial number of formed collaterals?</p><p>– Given the defective response to a guidance cue, cortical axons could select wrong trajectories. Do the authors think this is the case? This could be examined at developmental stages with DiI tracing.</p><p>– Is there a reason thinking that defects in the mutant are restricted to the corpus callosum?</p><p>– Is ANKB440 deficit impacts on the early polarity of cortical neurons. In culture, do the neurons extend similar number of processes before axon specification? Is the observed difference of F-actin patches in context of ANKB440 deletion expected to impact on process initiation?</p><p>– How could they explain the maintained sensitivity to EphrinA5, since it was reported that L1-CAM is required for the response to EphrinA5 (Demyanenko et al., 2011)?</p><p>– Do the authors think that alteration of active/inactive cofilin ratio could have additional outcome in the mutant?</p><p>– The authors should indicate more clearly in the manuscript, or figures the number of replicates, the number of analyzed cases for each experiment. They should also indicate in the figure panels the developmental stage at which the observations were made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The interpretation of the results in Figure 2A/B are a bit confusing. Do the authors suggest that the corpus callosum is thicker due to branching before the corpus callosum? In Figure 2E/F they show increased branching near the cell bodies on the ipsilateral side of the cortex, but how would this relate to the callosal defect? Since the difference in callosal thickness is only close to the midline, wouldn't this suggest some defect is specifically occurring there?</p><p>Figure 3C – The middle two images (and labels) in the top row of images should be switched to be consistent with the bottom two rows.</p><p>The title of Figure 3 is that AnkB440 is enriched at axonal growth cones. This is an overinterpretation. The figure shows that AnkB440 is present in growth cones but it does not appear to be enriched there. To say it is enriched there they would have to show more convincing images and quantify the levels in the growth cone and axon shaft (normalized to cytoplasmic protein) and show enrichment.</p><p>Rescue of the AnkB440 KO phenotype is shown in Figure 4E-G with AnkB440-Halo but not AnkB220-GFP, which is a nice experiment. It shows AnkB440 is required for the Sem3A phenotype and it is specific to the neural-specific isoform. Why weren't these experiments carried out for the filopodia and branching experiments in Figure 1D-H and Figure 1 – figure supp. 2?</p><p>Figure 4 B,C and D should not be presented as line graphs, as they were not repeated measures but separate experiments for each treatment time.</p><p>The experiment in Figure 4 – Figure Supp. 4 with Ephrin-A5 still collapsing AnkB440 KO growth cones shows nice specificity to the lack of response to Sema3A and convincingly indicates the growth cones can collapse, indicating a specific, rather than general defect in growth cone response.</p><p>Figure 5B – The horizontal and vertical labels appear to be reversed based on the images of the growth cones.</p><p>It is unclear why an unpaired t-test was used in 4G but ANOVA was used in Figure 5C. ANOVA is appropriate for multiple conditions, t-tests are not. Unpaired t-test shouldn't be used in Figure 6B, D, Figure 6-Figure supp. 6, Figure 8F – for multiple conditions.</p><p>The keys are confusing in several of the figures. In Figure 2D the dots for the AnkB440 KO are one color in the key but different in the graph. In Figure 4G the bars are in the key, not the dots. In Figures 5C/E, 6H and 7E the key is again the color of the dots, not the bars. Also, the dots for AnkB440 KO and L1CAM-Y1229H are very similar color, making it confusing. To make it easier to interpret, the bar color, not the dot color, should be used in the keys.</p><p>Could the authors include a working model at the end? How is AnkB440 functioning with L1CAM, Nrp1 and cofilin to influence the actin cytoskeleton in response to Sema3A? The authors have put together many very nice experiments but in the discussion it was hard to put together a mechanistic model of how AnkB440 is functioning in growth cone collapse/branch inhibition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69815.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would be helpful to provide more information about the in vivo phenotype.

In this condition, it appears to be due to alterations in oligodendrocyte development and myelination (Wang et al., 2012 Cell doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.034; Asleh et al. 2020; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2008391117).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these questions. As a point of clarification, we would like to underscore that in the Yang et al., 2019 manuscript, the reported Diffusion Tensor Imaging data belongs to knock-in AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup> mice (referred to in that publication as ABfs/fs), which models a human ASD-linked <italic>ANK2</italic> variant within the neuronal specific region of AnkB440. As shown in Yang et al., 2019 and in Figure 9A,B of our revised manuscript, the R2589fs AnkB440 variant does not eliminate expression of AnkB440, but rather results in a truncated 290kDa fragment that retains some of the functional domains of the protein. Both AnkB440 KO and AnkB440<sup>R2589fs</sup> cortical neurons show increased axon branching in vitro (Yang et al., 2019), suggesting a common mechanism. However, the 290kDa R2589fs AnkB440 fragment alters AnkB440 distribution and is additionally likely to result in gain-of function or dominant-negative effects that might impact axon development and cortical connectivity in ways different from total loss of AnkB440. This is partly one of the motivations for assessing for the first time axon tract morphology in AnkB440 KO brains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the authors certain that AnkB440 is not expressed in oligodendrocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>We evaluated AnkB440 expression in differentiated oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) by immunofluorescence staining, western blot, and qPCR. The results of these assays (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) confirm that AnkB440 is not expressed at detectable levels in OPCs. Thus, we ruled out a cell-autonomous effect of AnkB440 loss in oligodendrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is myelination normal in the mutants or is there increased wrapping of the axons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question. We evaluated myelination in the corpus callosum of PND25 control and AnkB440 KO mice by TEM and found no differences in the g-ratio of myelinated axons or in the number of myelinated axons per area (Figure 3A-D). We also did not detect differences in the levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the CC, assessed by immunofluorescence staining in AnkB440 KO mice (Figure 3F,G). On the other hand, AnkB440 KO CC axons showed loose myelin wraps (<italic>Figure 3A, open red arrowhead</italic>) and enlarged inner tongues near the axonal membrane (<italic>Figure 3A, open blue arrowheads</italic>). Thus, AnkB440 is likely involved in contact-mediated signals between the axon and myelin wrap that promote myelin ultrastructural organization and health, which when deficient could alter CC axon organization and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If AnkB440 is only expressed by neurons, it could be that there is an effect on activity of the callosal axons which then affects oligodendrocytes in a non-cell-autonomous manner (see Mitew et al., 2018 Nature Comms doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02719-2).</p></disp-quote><p>While our studies did not directly evaluate the activity of callosal axons or the density and proliferation of immature OPCs, we found that the total count of CC cells expressing the oligodendrocyte lineage-specific marker Olig2 was preserved and that the density of Olig2+ cells/CC area was reduced in AnkB440 KO brains (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In addition, loss of AnkB440 did not alter protein levels of MBP and of other proteins associated with oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination (Figure 3H,I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nrp1-Sema3A signalling is also required for the targeting of callosal axons in the contralateral hemisphere (Zhou et al., 2013 PNAS, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310233110). It is possible that contralateral targeting of callosal axons and/or their selection of contralateral targets might be disrupted in AnkB440 mutants. This could be examined using in utero electroporation of a reporter construct to achieve sparse axonal labelling to examine the entire callosal trajectory. This would provide more compelling in vivo evidence for increased axonal branching than is presented with the Golgi staining of cell bodies with increased dendritic branching.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we labeled S1 callosal projecting axons with GFP via in utero electroporation at E15.5 and evaluated their topographic order within the CC and contralateral targeting at PND25 (Figure 4). We found that in PND25 AnkB440 KO brains GFP-labeled axons originating from S1 show a more widespread distribution at the CC midline, with a significant number of axons navigating through more dorsal CC paths. Contralateral GFP-labeled projections in AnkB440 KO brains show lack of selective targeting to the S1/S2 border, and instead were widely distributed throughout the contralateral somatosensory cortex, with a notable fraction of axons ectopically projecting to more medial S1 regions and to regions below the S1/S2 border. We also detected lack of specific targeting of contralateral LII/III and LV neurons, with increased branching and innervation of GFP axons through all contralateral cortical layers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The poor image contrast in Figure 1 makes it difficult to identify the filopodia in the image. The figure legend mentions asterisks for panel D but there are none on the image.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated Figure 1 with images derived from time-lapse images with better contrast and revised the corresponding annotations and figure legend. <italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have several questions regarding the consequences of ANKB440 deletion on cortical connectivity. It is not clear to me how the authors link the excess branching and the defective response to Sema3A to alterations of cortical connectivity. For example, the authors report an increase of the corpus callosum thickness in ANKB440 mutants. With their analysis of the local branching pattern of cortical neurons with Golgi staining, do the authors want to suggest that CC thickness increase is due to additional collaterals that would have traveled along with the primary axon? Do they rather think that ANKB440 cortical axons elaborate more collaterals from their shaft during their navigation?</p></disp-quote><p>As we show in Figure 6, the response to Sema 3A is affected in growth cones of both the primary axon and collateral branches in AnkB440 KO neurons, which likely affects targeting and refinement of primary axons and collaterals in vivo. Our expanded findings also show increases in the thickness and disorganization of multiple axonal tracts in AnkB440 KO brains, not only in the CC. In addition, we observe an increase in the number of axonal processes in the CC of PND25 AnkB440 KO brains (Figure 4), which could result from a higher density of axons entering and traveling through the CC and/or from deficits in the developmental pruning of CC axons.</p><p>We observe a more widespread dorsoventral distribution of S1 callosal axons at the midline CC, with a significant number of axons navigating through more dorsal CC paths. While developmental axon pruning corrects any alterations in topographic axon order in the CC, these deficits persist in PND25 AnkB440 KO mice, and together with axon defasciculation (see below) likely contribute to the volumetric tract changes we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could CC thickness increase be due to axon-axon defasciculation? L1-CAM- Nrp1 labeling could be achieved to look at how fibers are organized in the CC tract.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question. Our new data provides evidence of axon defasciculation.</p><p>PND25 brains stained with L1CAM or sparsely labeled axon tracts using the Thy1-GFP-M reporter showed changes in the size and organization of multiple axon tracts in AnkB440 KO brains and the presence of both defasciculated and mistargeted axons (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it feasible to distinguish the response of the growth cone of the main axon from that of the growth cones from the collaterals? Do the authors think that the lack of response to Sema3A of ANKB440 cortical neurons will impact in vivo on the pruning or rather on the initial number of formed collaterals?</p></disp-quote><p>As we show in Figure 6, the response to Sema 3A is affected in growth cones of both the primary axon and collateral branches in AnkB440 KO neurons, which in turn likely affects collateral branch pruning in vivo. As we now show, PND25 AnkB440 KO brains also have deficits in the topographic ordering of callosal axons originating from S1 in the CC, and in the targeting and developmental refinement of their contralateral projections (Figure 4), defects also observed in mice with impaired Sema 3A signaling (Zhou et al. 2013; Martín-Fernández et al., 2021). These findings support an involvement of AnkB440 in Sema 3A-mediated callosal connectivity and that deficits in developmental axon pruning contribute to the altered tract development in AnkB440 KO brains.</p><p>Our in vitro data also offers a rationale for a higher number of initial collaterals based on the higher number of actin patches that form in AnkB440 KO neurons, which correlates with more branch initiation points, which together with the previously reported mechanism of higher propensity of microtubule invasion of nascent branches and subsequent branch stabilization, are likely to also promote axon hyperbranching. Our life imaging data also suggests that loss of AnkB440 diminishes the inhibitory effects of Sema 3A in collateral branch formation (Dent et al., 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Given the defective response to a guidance cue, cortical axons could select wrong trajectories. Do the authors think this is the case? This could be examined at developmental stages with DiI tracing.</p></disp-quote><p>Our Dil tracing attempts yielded inconsistent labeling across specimens. On the other hand, GFP labeling of axon tracts via IUE or the Thy1-GFP-M reporter revealed aberrant innervation of axons in regions of the septofimbrial nucleus and the fornix (Figure 2C) as well as increases in contralateral subcerebral projections (Figure 4B) in PND25 AnkB440 KO brains, which are indicative of axon misrouting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there a reason thinking that defects in the mutant are restricted to the corpus callosum?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. We have included new data showing that changes in axon tract morphology is not restricted to the CC. As mentioned above, we sparsely labeled a subset of axon tracts using the Th1-GFP-M reporter and detected volumetric deficits in the anterior commissure, the ventral hippocampal commissure, and the septofimbrial nucleus (Figure 2C-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is ANKB440 deficit impacts on the early polarity of cortical neurons. In culture, do the neurons extend similar number of processes before axon specification? Is the observed difference of F-actin patches in context of ANKB440 deletion expected to impact on process initiation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that combined loss of AnkB isoforms does not impact axon specification or axon polarity (Lorenzo et al., 2014). We have now added new data (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C) that show that loss of AnkB440 does not change the number of neurites prior to axonal specification. On the other hand, as we discussed in the original submission, loss of AnkB440 results in higher number of actin patches, which correlate with a larger number of branch initiation points, nascent filopodia, and collateral branches. As we discuss in the manuscript, we do not understand how AnkB440 regulates the formation of actin patches and its other effects on actin dynamics, a question we plan to investigate in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How could they explain the maintained sensitivity to EphrinA5, since it was reported that L1-CAM is required for the response to EphrinA5 (Demyanenko et al., 2011)?</p></disp-quote><p>Demyanenko et al., 2011 observed a modest (18%) reduction in the growth cone collapse in L1CAM null cultured neurons in response to Ephrin A5 relative to control neurons. We have added new data (Figure 5— figure supplement 2C,D) showing that, like the AnkB440 KO neurons, mutant Y1229H L1CAM cortical neurons, in which the AnkB440-L1CAM association is disrupted, respond normally to Ephrin A5. It is possible that to elicit a noticeable difference in L1CAM-mediated GC collapse in response to Ephrin A5, a total loss of L1CAM is required, and this mechanism does not seem to be transduced through AnkB440.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Do the authors think that alteration of active/inactive cofilin ratio could have additional outcome in the mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the wide range of neuronal process involving actin dynamics, this is certainly an intriguing question worth examining in future studies. As we speculate in the manuscript, the increases in active cofilin in AnkB440 KO mice during early brain development might provide a more dynamic actin pool and could underlie the surges in axonal actin patches and emerging filopodia observed in AnkB440 KO cortical neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should indicate more clearly in the manuscript, or figures the number of replicates, the number of analyzed cases for each experiment. They should also indicate in the figure panels the developmental stage at which the observations were made.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. The revised manuscript includes the previously missing details about the experimental conditions pointed out by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The interpretation of the results in Figure 2A/B are a bit confusing. Do the authors suggest that the corpus callosum is thicker due to branching before the corpus callosum? In Figure 2E/F they show increased branching near the cell bodies on the ipsilateral side of the cortex, but how would this relate to the callosal defect? Since the difference in callosal thickness is only close to the midline, wouldn't this suggest some defect is specifically occurring there?</p></disp-quote><p>We ruled out that morphometric changes in the CC in AnkB440 KO brains are due to non-cell-autonomous effects such as increases in the proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, or in myelination (levels and wrapping) of CC axons. On the other hand, we have detected changes in axon fasciculation, which may be a contributing factor to the increase in CC thickness. As discussed above (see first response to reviewer 2), we also observe an increase in the number of callosal processes at the midline of PND25 AnkB440 KO brains (Figure 4). This increase is accompanied by a more widespread dorsoventral distribution of S1 callosal axons, with a significant number of axons navigating through more dorsal CC paths. Thus, CC hyperplasia in PND25 AnkB440 KO brains could also result from a higher density of axons entering and traveling through the CC and/or from deficits in the ordering and developmental pruning of CC axons. Our results indicate deficits in the removal of the vast majority of S1 callosal axons that travel throughout the dorsal areas of the CC at the brain midline, which are also observed in mice deficient in Sema 3A signaling (Zhou et al. 2013; Martín-Fernández et al., 2021). Increases in the number of CC axons in AnkB440 brains could reflect misrouted axons or deficient postnatal elimination of transient callosal axons derived from S1 layer IV neurons (De León Reyes et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12495-w). Lastly, it is also possible that AnkB440 KO axons respond abnormally to other midline cues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C – The middle two images (and labels) in the top row of images should be switched to be consistent with the bottom two rows.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this error.
