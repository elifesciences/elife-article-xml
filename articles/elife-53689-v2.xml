Myofibers are generated by the fusion of terminally postmitotic myocytes, which differentiate from proliferation-competent myoblasts. Due to the linear, one-way succession of proliferating myoblast to differentiated myocyte to syncytial myofiber, transitions between states are tightly regulated: either failure to progress from myoblast to myocyte or precocious differentiation from myoblast to myocyte will lead to a deficit of functional contractile muscle. Because of the syncytial nature of myofibers, in skeletal muscle there exists an additional aspect of the decision to commit to differentiation: terminally-differentiated myocytes must have a sufficient number of other fusion-competent myocytes in close proximity to fuse with, or they cannot generate a functional myofiber.</p><p>It is a common observation that sparse plating of myogenic cells in vitro delays myogenic differentiation, while cells cultured at higher confluence exhibit a much higher degree of differentiation regardless of pro-mitogenic conditions such as high serum. This has been described as a version of the ‘community effect’, a phenomenon first noted by John Gurdon in the context of amphibian muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gurdon, 1988</xref>). He found that single mesoderm cells or aggregates of less than 100 mesoderm cells will not express MyoD and differentiate into muscle even under conditions that promote myogenesis, while aggregates of 100 or more cells would differentiate efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gurdon et al., 1993</xref>); later experiments showed that the homotypic cell-cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin is responsible for at least a portion of this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holt et al., 1994</xref>). Similar studies in mouse suggested that a minimum of 30–40 cells is required for myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cossu et al., 1995</xref>). As noted earlier, skeletal muscle fibers are syncytial cells formed following permanent withdrawal of myogenic precursors from the cell cycle: it would make sense that before committing to such a course of action, a potential myocyte would like some assurances that if it ‘takes the plunge’, other differentiated cells would be available for fusion. Similarly, it seems practical for a signal conveying this information to be contact-mediated.</p><p>Ephs are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that act via juxtacrine interactions with cells presenting their ligands (ephrins) to modify cell motility, assortment, proliferation, differentiation, and survival in multiple tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>). Here we present data suggesting that EphA7, a member of this family of bidirectional signaling molecules, is a potent mediator of the community effect. EphA7 is expressed during muscle development and regeneration on differentiated myocytes and nascent myofibers; myogenic cells lacking EphA7 exhibit delayed and prolonged differentiation in vitro and in vivo; and exposing myogenic cells (with or without endogenous EphA7) to EphA7 ectodomain accelerates differentiation. We propose a model in which EphA7 expression on differentiated myocytes promotes synergistic differentiation of adjacent myoblasts. Early-expressing cells differentiate stochastically and express EphA7, which then promotes differentiation and EphA7 expression in adjacent cells, which then promote differentiation and EphA7 expression in cells adjacent to them, etc. We propose that juxtacrine signaling via EphA7 provides a mechanism to promote collective differentiation in myogenic populations, to ensure that myoblasts are in close proximity to fusion-competent myocytes before they commit to terminal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EphA7 is expressed by differentiated myocytes and nascent myofibers in vivo and in vitro</title><p>Our initial observations in an expression screen for Eph/ephrins in the context of adult skeletal muscle regeneration suggested that EphA7, while absent during muscle homeostasis, is transiently upregulated by regenerating myofibers in vivo after a barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stark et al., 2011</xref>). This expression pattern raised the possibility that EphA7 might function during satellite cell differentiation and/or fusion during the acute stages of muscle differentiation. To define when and where EphA7 is expressed during regeneration, we stained sections of uninjured adult mouse tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in parallel with sections of TAs at 3, 5, 7, 10, 16, and 21 days post injury (dpi) following BaCl<sub>2</sub> injury for EphA7, and costained with laminin to identify myofiber boundaries and embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) to identify newly-generated myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We noted that EphA7 protein was consistently expressed by nascent myofibers at all timepoints examined, and that as muscle regeneration was resolved, muscle fiber caliber increased, and eMyHC expression was lost, EphA7 expression was also extinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because multiple splice isoforms of EphA7 exist and the antibody used cannot distinguish between them, we performed RT-PCR on injured and uninjured TA muscle to identify potential alternative splice isoforms and to correlate protein expression with mRNA expression. We found that full-length EphA7 is the most abundant isoform expressed during muscle regeneration, although both truncated isoforms were also detected at varying levels.

When satellite cells were isolated and cultured in association with their host myofiber, expression of EphA7 was first detected on relatively few cells at 48 hours after isolation, but was seen on the majority of satellite cells by 96 hours in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In monoculture, EphA7 expression is detectable only in a few dispersed cells when they are initially plated under low serum conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but one day later it is present in individual cells or more often groups of cells in close association with one another and/or with bipolar morphology suggesting differentiation.

Prior work suggests that EphA7 mRNA is present by e11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Martin et al., 2016</xref>), when myogenic differentiation in the somites and limb buds will have already begun. At e11.5, we observed EphA7 protein staining in the dermomyotome on the surface of cells also expressing MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), although populations of MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells at the dorsomedial lip (which will migrate under the dermomyotome then differentiate to form the primary myotome) and the ventrolateral lip (which will migrate to the limb buds then differentiate to form the limb musculature) do not express EphA7. When costained for myogenin in equivalent sections, EphA7<sup>+</sup> cells in the somite all express myogenin, indicating that they have committed to differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This can be more easily noted in oblique sections through the developing somites, in which mononuclear, differentiated primary myotome fibers can be viewed from end to end; in these sections we see that the most recently-differentiated cells express myogenin but not yet EphA7 (arrow). Finally, EphA7 is expressed in all myosin heavy chain (MyHC)-expressing differentiated myocytes in the somite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). By e15.5, we observe EphA7 expression on differentiated, myogenin<sup>+</sup>/MyHC<sup>+</sup> myocytes and myofibers in muscles of forelimbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and trunk (diaphragm and body wall) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) as well.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>EphA7 is expressed on differentiated myogenic cells during development.</title><p>e11.5 embryos sectioned at the level of the forelimb show expression of EphA7 in differentiated myogenic cells in the somites.

EphA7 is not expressed by FAPS either during homeostasis or injury (based on bulk RNA-seq, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joe et al., 2010</xref>). Combined with the presence of the phenotype during both development and regeneration, the persistence of the phenotype in muscle cell culture ex vivo, and the recapitulation of the phenotype in myogenic cell lines carrying engineered mutations (below), we propose that expression of EphA7 by myocytes is the primary driver of the in vivo and in vitro phenotype we describe here.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Exogenous EphA7 ectodomain induces myogenic differentiation in <italic>EphA7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and WT satellite cells</title><p>While these data suggest that expression of EphA7 promotes myogenic differentiation, they do not distinguish between a cell-autonomous or a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. Eph:ephrin signaling can be either ‘forward’ (Ephs act as receptors) or ‘reverse’ (Ephs act as ligands), thus a cell-autonomous mechanism would suggest failure of <italic>EphA7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells to receive a signal, while a non-cell-autonomous mechanism would suggest loss of the signal itself. Because EphA7 expression is limited to myocytes and loss of EphA7 appears to affect myoblasts, we hypothesized that in this context EphA7 acts non-cell-autonomously via reverse signaling. If this is correct, then expression of EphA7 should be dispensable provided that exogenous EphA7 is present in the culture; furthermore, only the ectodomain (rather than the full-length protein) should be sufficient for this effect. We would therefore predict that exposure to EphA7 ectodomain would rescue the differentiation delay observed in <italic>EphA7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells and enhance differentiation of WT cells by acting as a proxy for high cell density. To test this, we plated WT and <italic>EphA7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells at equivalent densities on either laminin-coated coverslips or laminin-coated coverslips functionalized with a chimeric EphA7 ectodomain fused to human Fc (EphA7-Fc) (R&amp;D Systems).

While several other interactions mediating this effect have previously been described, we believe this study is the first to identify a heterotypic, non-cell-autonomous signal between myogenic cells at distinct stages of differentiation. As such, it provides a mechanism for rapidly amplifying the number of differentiated cells in a population once a sufficient local density has been reached and potential fusion partners are readily available. Further, the observation that cells lacking ephrin-A5 show an even more pronounced failure to differentiate than those lacking EphA7 suggests the possibility that threshold levels of ephrin-A5 stimulation may be necessary to initiate even stochastic differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Skeletal muscle is unique among vertebrate somatic tissues in that skeletal myofibers, the functional unit of the tissue, are syncytial cells formed by fusion of hundreds or thousands of terminally-differentiated mononuclear cells (myocytes). As such, skeletal muscle is particularly amenable to the use of contact-mediated signaling pathways to induce and coordinate cellular activities such as commitment to differentiation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krauss et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, cell-cell contact and adhesion-based signals have been shown to be strongly promyogenic even in the presence of soluble factors that promote myoblast proliferation and thereby inhibit myocyte differentiation. Adhesion proteins such as cadherins, their multifunctional coreceptors Cdo and Boc, and the netrin-3 receptor neogenin are necessary and sufficient to promote robust myogenesis in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krauss et al., 2005</xref>). It is important to note that the enhanced myogenesis brought about by these juxtacrine interactions is distinct from promotion of myocyte fusion, which has recently been shown to require a class of proteins in vertebrate muscle that do not appear to be related to classical contact-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Millay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quinn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), and instead appears to derive from upregulation of MyoD-dependent transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krauss et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this work we present data suggesting that contact-mediated signaling interactions between EphA7 and ephrin-A5 promote collective myogenic differentiation during mammalian muscle development and regeneration. EphA7 is one of a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are best characterized as promoting repulsion during cell migration and cell sorting at domain boundaries (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ventrella et al., 2017</xref>). However, interactions between Ephs and their ephrin ligands have also been shown to directly affect differentiation: for example, EphB2:ephrinB1 interactions within the osteoblast lineage promote osteoblast differentiation by stimulating nuclear translocation of the transcriptional coactivator TAZ, and in multiple neuronal and stem cell lineages Eph/ephrin signaling modulates cell fate choice both directly and indirectly (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). EphA7 is a particularly likely candidate for a pro-differentiation molecule because it has been characterized as a tumor suppressor in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakanishi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oricchio et al., 2011</xref>) as well as a negative regulator of proliferation through reverse signaling with ephrin-A2 in the adult stem cell niches of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holmberg et al., 2005</xref>) and hair follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Genander et al., 2010</xref>). Three different splice variants of EPHA7 have been identified, encoding one full length (FL) and two truncated (T1 and T2) proteins lacking the catalytic kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holmberg et al., 2000</xref>), as have two splice variants of ephrin-A5 (one lacking an alternate exon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 1999</xref>). All three EphA7 proteins can signal in reverse via ephrin-A5, and in some contexts such as the closing neural tube the switch from full-length to truncated (T1) EphA7 appears to mediate a switch from repulsive to adhesive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holmberg et al., 2000</xref>); differential roles for full-length vs. truncated ephrin-A5 are less well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2001</xref>). In the context of skeletal muscle regeneration, we detected mRNA expression of all three variants of EphA7 and both variants of ephrin-A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); future work will explore the potential heterogeneity within the population and its mechanistic implications during myogenesis.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model in which EphA7 non-cell-autonomously promotes rapid and coordinated differentiation in populations of myogenic cells in a density-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). An initially small number of ephrin-A5<sup>+</sup>, EphA7<sup>-</sup> myoblasts will experience a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that induce them to commit to differentiation, exit the cell cycle, and upregulate myogenin (stochastic commitment). Once this has occurred, these newly-differentiated myocytes will upregulate expression of EphA7, which will signal to adjacent ephrin-A5<sup>+</sup> myoblasts via cell-cell contact and promote their differentiation (synergistic commitment). This rapidly differentiating population of adjacent cells can subsequently fuse into myotubes/myofibers to form the functional units of skeletal muscle. In the absence of EphA7, while stochastic commitment still occurs, synergistic commitment via the community effect is lost, leading to decreased numbers of myocytes available for fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Thus, both developmental and regenerative myogenesis still occurs in muscle lacking EphA7, but it progresses more slowly and produces smaller myofibers containing fewer myonuclei. Future studies will identify the mechanism by which EphA7 stimulation is transduced in ephrin-A5 expressing myoblasts, and what the molecular consequences of this interaction are. Given that other molecules which promote specification to myogenesis by cell-cell contact act via upregulation of MyoD-dependent gene transcription, it is intriguing to speculate that upregulation of myogenin and commitment to terminal differentiation could be a direct consequence of EphA7 reverse signaling in myoblasts.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We propose a model in which initial, stochastic commitment of individual myoblasts results in their expression of EphA7, which then induces rapid, synergistic commitment of adjacent ephrin-A5-expressing myoblasts via the community effect.

The findings of this work will have implications for biologists across multiple fields.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;EphA7 promotes myogenic differentiation via cell-cell contact&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, including Andrew Brack as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The full reviews are included below for further information.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Arnold et al. report on the essential contribution that EphA7 expression on nascent myofibers makes to the completion of skeletal myogenesis during muscle regeneration. The data fairly support the author's model, in which EphA7 expression on the surface of differentiation-committed myogenic progenitors and adjacent myocytes provides a key signal that promotes formation of mature myofibers during muscle regeneration.</p><p>The authors propose that localized foci of accelerated myogenesis occurs within high-density of EphA7 expressing cells, according to a stochastic model of progressive spreading of foci of skeletal myogenesis through the &quot;so-called&quot; community effect. EphA7-null mice had lower numbers of myofibers, which were smaller in area. Regeneration was compromised/delayed in these mice. Mutation of EphA7 in mice resulted in many fewer myogenin+ cells in vitro, without affecting the percentage of MyoD+ cells. Plating EphA7-null satellite cells on an EphA7-Fc substrate rescued myogenin expression, showing that EphA7 acts in this system as a ligand, rather than a receptor (in a reverse signaling fashion). Overall, the data shown in this manuscript provide novel insights into a largely under-investigated, yet very interesting topic of investigation.</p><p>The work presented appears carefully done and the figures are of high quality. There is a lack of experimentation to explain the mechanism of how EphA7 promotes differentiation. However, identification of EphA7 as a participant in a &quot;community effect&quot; is interesting. The following comments should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Confounding variable when using germline deletion of EhrinA7:</p><p>1) The delayed regeneration process observed in EphA7 null mice suggests incomplete skeletal myogenesis in the absence of EphA7. However, given that the studies are performed in a general KO mouse model, it is unclear whether this is a cell autonomous defect of myogenic cells, or it derives from the lack of EphA7 expression in other cell types that might contribute to regeneration. These are the only in vivo data in the manuscript and therefore a key component of the manuscript.</p><p>Below we provide some possible solutions to address this limitation:</p><p>– Figure 5 shows a time course of regeneration and concludes that in the absence of EphA7, eMyHC expression persists in unfused myocytes or mononucleated fibers. A problem here is that mutation used is global, and the mice begin with only ~40% the number of satellite cells that WT mice have. It is not clear how much of the phenotype might be due to starting with fewer satellite cells vs. compromised/delayed differentiation. One way to address this might be to quantify eMyHC<sup>+</sup> nascent myofibers at earlier time points (5 dpi). The figure suggests that things may have &quot;caught up&quot; to a reasonable extent at that time point, only to be deficient again at later steps. More difficult, but perhaps more rigorous would be to use the Pax7CreER driver with the DTA system to kill off satellite cells, but only ~60% of them, so that an EphA7<sup>+</sup> mouse with a similar deficit in satellite cell numbers could be compared with EphA7-null mice.</p><p>– The central point is that extracellular EphA7 functions as a ligand to promote differentiation via cell to cell contact. Would a transplantation assay help? For example, transplanting EphA7 null SCs into EphA7 null muscle (increase SC number but no benefit of fusion) versus WT into null. Differentiation/fusion would be scored based on donor cell contribution.</p><p>– Although the optimal strategy would consist in the generation and analysis of a mouse model of cell-specific conditional genetic deletion of EphA7, or experiments of cell transplantation (e.g. EphA7 deficient satellite cells into WT muscles subjected to injury), this reviewer understands that these experiments would require a substantial amount of time. The authors could verify by qPCR that EphA7is only (or most largely) expressed in satellite cells (committed to differentiation) and nascent myofibers, but not in other cell types – e.g. macrophages, endothelial, FAPs – isolated from regenerating muscles at different time points post-injury. I also note that equivalent information could be retrieved by publicly available RNAseq datasets on muscle-derived cells isolated during muscle regeneration. Overall, providing definitive evidence that EphA7 expression is mostly confined to myoblasts and myofibers within regenerating muscles, as also suggested by immunofluorescence analysis in muscle sections (Figure 1), could in my opinion wave the request of generating mice with cell-specific conditional genetic deletion of EphA7.</p><p>Further characterization of Eph and Ehprin expression:</p><p>2) Addition of extracellular domain induces differentiation to WT and KO, suggesting EphA7 must bind to another receptor. What is the Ephin is expressed in myoblasts?

In the Discussion, it is mentioned that one of the truncated splice variants of EphA7 promotes cell adhesion, which would better fit its role in myogenic differentiation. It should be straightforward to determine which isoforms are present in differentiating satellite cell cultures, helping to explain what is presumably an adhesion, not repellent, function.</p><p>Further characterization of Ephrin A7 molecular function:</p><p>4) Does ectodomain regulate differentiation in clonal or low-density cultures (avoid cell to cell contact). It shouldn't if the authors model is correct.</p><p>5) Does the ectodomain act as a decoy receptor? Measure RTK signaling in WT, null and Ectodomain-Fc cultures.</p><p>6) Does EphrinA7 act as a soluble ligand? Add ectodomain to media or in Boyden chamber and examine phenotypes.</p><p>Need for further quantification of data:</p><p>7) Figure 1 – needs quantification and statistical analysis of% of eMyHC positive fibers that also express EphA7 expression, and vice versa, at the different timepoints. Given that expression of EphA7 seems mostly confined to nascent fibers, it would be also informative to perform a quantification of eMyHC and EphA7 by PCR in the whole muscles at each of the timepoints.

By close inspection of the pictures it seems to this reviewer that satellite cell cultures from EphA7 null mice display evident morphological differences, as compared to WT cultures, regardless of the presence of EphA7-Fc. In particular, there are several phalloidin-positive flat cells showing a phenotype reminiscent of senescent or endothelial like cells. The authors should better analyze and explain these morphological discrepancies, and understand whether they are due to FACS contamination, cultural artifacts or a reproducible acquisition of lineage heterogeneity by satellite cells, caused by EphA7 deficiency.</p><p>5) Figure 8. The proposed model is not of &quot;immediate catch&quot; by first glance. Furthermore, the understanding of this figure is limited by lack of color identity information for nuclear purple and nuclear green. I suggest that the authors substantially revise this figure to make their proposed model clearer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports on the role of EphA7 in differentiation of skeletal muscle precursor cells. This is related to the &quot;community effect&quot; first described by Gurdon, an interesting phenomenon for which few molecular regulators have been identified. The authors carefully document the expression pattern of EphA7 in developing and regenerating skeletal muscle, and also in satellite cells on isolated myofibers and in primary culture in vitro. EphA7 is induced in differentiating cells, correlating temporally with myogenin and MyHC expression. EphA7-null mice had lower numbers of myofibers, which were smaller in area. Regeneration was compromised/delayed in these mice. Mutation of EphA7 in mice resulted in many fewer myogenin+ cells in vitro, without affecting the percentage of MyoD+ cells.

The most significant change is a new figure (Figure 8) in which we show that ephrin-A5 meets the criteria for the EphA7 receptor in this system, thus providing a more complete mechanism than we had in the previous version; all major revisions are described below.</p><p>We have added a new panel to Figure 1 (Figure 1B) in which the co-expression of EphA7 and eMyHC across the timecourse is quantified. As noted in the figure legend, at later timepoints a small fraction of laminin-bounded fibers is scored positive for EphA7 but negative for eMyHC due to the thresholds determined during imaging (normalized to a no-primary control in each case). However, we believe that in actuality there are no EphA7<sup>+</sup>/eMyHC- fibers. We present the data as we do (and with this caveat) because it seems the best and most honest way to approach it, however if the reviewers have suggestions regarding either the data presentation or the text/figure legend we would be grateful for advice. As suggested, we provide an RT-PCR timecourse for all three splice isoforms of EphA7 (and both splice isoforms of ephrin-A5, see below) as well as eMyHC in a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We do not draw any mechanistic conclusions from these data in this manuscript because that would require not only protein/RNA resolution at the level of individual cells in situ but downstream signaling analyses; however, we thank the reviewers for suggesting the experiment and plan to follow up on these intriguing results if possible.</p><p>We have included a new panel in Figure 5 (G) showing average fiber size in WT and <italic>EphA7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> regenerating muscle at each timepoint (in addition to the binned areas shown previously), with statistics comparing genotypes at each timepoint.</p><p>We remade Figure 7B, to remove potential confusion regarding cell morphology and identity. We have also included additional text to clarify that except for a higher representation of proliferating cells, there is no obvious difference in the appearance of satellite cell cultures from WT and <italic>EphA7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>To provide a molecular mechanism for the activity of EphA7, we have included new data (now Figure 8) and accompanying text supporting ephrin-A5 as the EphA7 receptor on myoblasts. This figure includes data showing that ephrin-A5 protein expression is increased in <italic>EphA7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> primary satellite cells; that in C2C12 cells high density promotes differentiation in unedited but not EphA7<sup>KO</sup> or ephrin-A5<sup>KO</sup> cells, while EphA7 ectodomain promotes differentiation in unedited and EphA7<sup>KO</sup> at either high or low densities but never in ephrin-A5<sup>KO</sup> cells; and that exposure to EphA7 ectodomain rapidly induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in unedited and EphA7<sup>KO</sup> cells which is more than twofold reduced in ephrin-A5<sup>KO</sup> cells. We are very pleased with this figure and hope that it will be useful to clarify the roles of density, EphA7 as a pro-differentiation stimulus, and ephrin-A5 as the receptor for that non-cell-autonomous stimulus. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown on the MU campus, we were unable to complete the confirmation of the sequence deleted in the EphA7<sup>KO</sup> line of C2C12s; this uncertainty is indicated graphically on the figure itself.</p><p>We remade the model (now Figure 9) to clarify and to include new data. While co-expression of Pax7 and MyoD, and of MyoD and myogenin, are important transient states in myogenesis, knowing this is not necessary to understand the model. We have therefore removed the purple (red + blue) and green (yellow + blue) nuclei to make the model simpler. In addition, since our data now include ephrin-A5 as the EphA7 receptor on myoblasts, we have included this expression in the schematic although it does not change over the course of differentiation.</p><p>To address the concern that EphA7 may be expressed in nonmuscle cell types and that this might be responsible for at least some of the observed phenotype, we have consulted with Dr. Fabio Rossi who has generated bulk RNA-seq datasets for the most likely nonmuscle cell type to influence muscle differentiation (FAPs), as well as with Dr. Tom Cheung, Dr. Bradley Olwin, and Dr. Benjamin Cosgrove, who have each independently generated single cell RNA-seq datasets covering all resident cell types. Dr. Rossi confirms that EphA7 is not expressed by FAPs and we note this in the text. However, neither EphhA7 nor ephrin-A5 RNA are detectable in any cell types during muscle regeneration in any of the single-cell datasets we consulted, making interpretation of those data difficult. While we are disappointed that the best we can offer is negative data, based our primary myogenic cell cultures and C2C12 knockout experiments we remain confident that the effect we observe in vivo is primarily or entirely due to myocyte-myoblast interactions. Unfortunately, definitive proof for this will not be available for some time (we are acquiring the ephrin-A5 conditional knockout line from a collaborator as frozen sperm).</p><p>We have expanded the text to more explicitly describe the non-cell-autonomous effect we propose, and to note that exposure to the EphA7-Fc would therefore be expected to act as a proxy for high cell density. The data in new Figure 8 are also presented in a way designed to emphasize this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
