of the superfamily of pentameric Cys-loop receptors. Native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are heteromeric assemblies sensitive to many important drugs, from sedatives to anesthetics and anticonvulsant agents, with mutant forms of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors implicated in multiple neurological diseases. Despite the profound importance of heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in neuroscience and medicine, they have proven recalcitrant to structure determination. Here we present the structure of a tri-heteromeric α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in complex with GABA, determined by single particle cryo-EM at 3.1–3.8 Å resolution, elucidating molecular principles of receptor assembly and agonist binding. Remarkable N-linked glycosylation on the α1 subunit occludes the extracellular vestibule of the ion channel and is poised to modulate receptor assembly and perhaps ion channel gating. Our work provides a pathway to structural studies of heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and a framework for rational design of novel therapeutic agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd><kwd>GABA receptors</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>Cys loop receptors</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM100400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure of the triheteromeric α1β1γ2S GABAA receptor in complex with GABA illuminates the principles of receptor assembly and agonist binding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are chloride permeable, γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-gated ion channels that are responsible for the majority of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sigel and Steinmann, 2012</xref>). Because of the fundamental role that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors play in balancing excitatory signaling, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are central to the development and normal function of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu and Sun, 2015</xref>). In accord with their crucial role in brain function, mutations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor genes are directly linked to epilepsy syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirose, 2014</xref>) and are associated with schizophrenia, autism, alcohol dependence, manic depression and eating disorder syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudolph and Möhler, 2014</xref>). Moreover, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are the targets of a large number of important therapeutic drugs, from sedatives, sleep aids and anticonvulsant medications to anesthetic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braat and Kooy, 2015</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are also the target of alcohol and are implicated in alcohol dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trudell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors belong to the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>). Other members of this family are nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>, glycine, and the invertebrate GluCl and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-activated cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>). Members of the pLGIC superfamily are composed of five protein subunits and each subunit contains four transmembrane domains (M1–M4) along with extracellular N- and C- termini. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are typically found as heteromeric channels derived from a pool of 19 possible subunits: α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ɛ, θ, π, and ρ1–3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sigel and Steinmann, 2012</xref>). The large number of subunits gives rise to many possible pentameric assemblies; nevertheless, the most prevalent subunit combination in the vertebrate brain is the tri-heteromeric receptor composed of two α, two β and one γ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tretter et al., 1997</xref>), with the arrangement of subunits being β-α-β-γ-α, in a clockwise order when viewed from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baur et al., 2006</xref>). The molecular basis for selective subunit assembly of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is not well understood.</p><p>Pioneering structural studies of the paradigmatic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unwin, 2005</xref>), as well as crystallographic studies of homomeric pLGICs that include prokaryotic pLGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hilf and Dutzler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>) and the eukaryotic GluCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>), 5‐HT<sub>3A</sub> serotonin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hassaine et al., 2014</xref>), β3 GABA<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>), α3 glycine receptor (GlyR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), along with the cryo-EM structures of the zebrafish α1 GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2015</xref>) and the mouse 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2018</xref>), have helped to shape our understanding of receptor architecture and mechanism. Recent structures of diheteromeric nAChRs also further our understanding of subunit arrangement and function in heteromeric Cys-loop receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>These studies, together with a large number of biochemical and biophysical experiments, have defined the transmembrane ion channel pore, its lining by the M2 helices and likely mechanisms of ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cymes and Grosman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sine et al., 2010</xref>). The extracellular N-terminal domain harbors the orthosteric agonist binding site, located at subunit interfaces, in addition to multiple binding sites for an array of small molecules and ions that act as allosteric modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lynagh and Pless, 2014</xref>). While the mechanism by which orthosteric agonists and competitive antagonists activate or inhibit ion channel activity is well explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>), the molecular mechanisms for the action of allosteric ligands, especially those that act on heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, remain to be fully elucidated. Here we present methods for the expression and isolation of tri-heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and the cryo-EM structure of the rat α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in the presence of GABA. The structural analysis not only defines subunit organization, but it also uncovers the mode of GABA binding to the orthosteric agonist binding site and suggests a critical role of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation of the α1 subunit in governing receptor assembly and, perhaps, ion channel activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Receptor expression and structure elucidation</title><p>To enhance receptor expression we employed the M3/M4 loop deletion constructs of the α1 and β1 subunits analogous to the functional M3/M4 loop deletion constructs of GluCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>) and GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2015</xref>), together with a full-length construct of the γ2S (short splice variant) subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), yielding the α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Claxton and Gouaux, 2018</xref>). Optimization of receptor expression constructs and conditions were monitored by fluorescence-detection, size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawate and Gouaux, 2006</xref>). We included a 1D4 affinity tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacKenzie et al., 1984</xref>) on the γ2 subunit to selectively isolate the heteromeric complex from baculovirus-transduced mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>). For ensuing cryo-EM studies, we developed an α1 subunit-specific monoclonal antibody, 8E3, with the aim of using the Fab to identify the α1 subunit in the pseudo-symmetric receptor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The resulting purified α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> receptor, in the presence of the 8E3 Fab, binds muscimol, a high affinity agonist, and flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine, with affinities similar to the full-length receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> receptor also exhibits ion channel gating properties that are similar to the wild-type receptor in the presence and in the absence of the 8E3 Fab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2013</xref>). We note, however, that while the cryo-EM construct retains potentiation by diazepam, the extent of potentiation is reduced for the Fab complex.</p><p>Structure elucidation was carried out using the α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> receptor solubilized in β-dodecyl-maltoside (C12M) and cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) in the presence of 1.5 mM GABA. To enhance particle density on the cryo-EM grids in light of modest levels of receptor expression, we employed grids coated with graphene oxide. We proceeded to collect micrographs using a Titan Krios microscope and a Falcon three camera as described in the Materials and methods. Subsequent selection of particles and calculation of 2D class averages yielded projections that were readily identified as a pentameric Cys-loop receptor bound by 2 Fabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Three dimensional reconstruction, combined with judicious masking of either the Fab constant domains or, alternatively, the receptor transmembrane domain (TMD), allowed for reconstructions at ~3.8 and ~3.1 Å resolution, respectively, based on Fourier shell correlation (FSC) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We note that there is substantial preferred orientation in the particle distribution and, despite substantial efforts in exploring a wide spectrum of conditions, we were unable to obtain grids that yielded more well distributed particle orientations. Inspection of the resulting density maps were consistent with these resolution estimations, and in the case of the density in the extracellular domain (ECD), the quality of the density map is excellent, allowing for visualization of medium and large side chains, as well as glycosylation of Asn side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). By contrast, the density for the TMD is not as well defined. While the M1, M2 and M3 helices of all subunits show strong density, with density for some residues with large side chains, the M4 helices of the two α1 subunits and the γ2S subunit have weak density and thus we have not attempted to include them in the structure. To build a molecular structure into the cryo-EM density maps, we first generated homology models of the α1, β1 and γ2S subunits using the human β3 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (PDB code: 4COF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>) as a template and we then manually fit the models to the density and carried out iterative cycles of manual fitting and computational refinement, which together resulted in a structural model that fits well to the density and that has good stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39383.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Architecture of the α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> GABAA receptor.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 2D class averages.

The subunit identity is further verified by prominent <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites that are unique to each subunit.

Here, we estimate that within the ECD each subunit buries as much as 1150–1600 Å<sup>2</sup> of solvent accessible surface area within each subunit interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). There are five unique subunit interfaces in the tri-heteromeric receptor and, while we observed a similar arrangement of the ECDs at each interface, we also found subtle differences due to variations in amino acid sequences and in local protein structure. There are solvent accessible fenestrations at subunit interfaces in the ECD that ‘connect’ the extracellular solution with the extracellular vestibule, possibly providing an alternative pathway for ions to access the ion channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When comparing the various subunit interfaces one can readily identify specific interactions of amino acids that are common to all interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As examples, at the α(+)/β(-) interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), there is a conserved interaction between Tyr209 at the beginning of β10 from the α subunit at the (+) face to Arg117 at β5 in (–) face, as well as a hydrogen bond between Tyr206 from the α subunit and Gln64 from the β subunit. At the β(+)/α*(-) interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a similar interaction is observed between Tyr205 at the beginning of β10 from the β subunit of the (+) subunit and Arg117 at β5 in the (–) subunit. Furthermore, a hydrogen bond between Thr202 from the β subunit and Arg66 from the β subunit is observed even though, in comparison to the α(+)/β(-) interface, the Gln is replaced by Arg. At the α*(+)/γ(-) interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), the distance between Tyr209 from the α and Arg132 from the γ subunit is similar to that observed at the α(+)/β(-) interface. The hydrogen bond observed in α(+)/β(-), β(+)/α*(-), β*(+)/α(-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C and F</xref>) between a Thr from the (+) face and Arg/Gln at the (-) face is lost because Ala79 occupies the position corresponding to the Arg/Gln residues. At the γ(+)/β*(-) interface, Tyr220 from the γ subunit is within hydrogen bonding distance to Arg117 from the β subunit. Interestingly, with the other set of interactions seen in the α(+)/β(-), β(+)/α*(-) and β*(+)/α(-) interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C and F</xref>) between a Thr from the (+) face and a Arg/Gln at the (–) face, the Thr is replaced by a Ser and forms a hydrogen bond with the Tyr220 from the γ subunit rather than interacting with the Gln64 from the β subunit.

Neurotransmitter binding sites in Cys-loop receptors are located at the interface of two adjacent subunits and are composed of the three loops from the principle (+) face and β-strands from the complementary (-) face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nys et al., 2013</xref>). There are three substantive densities within the neurotransmitter binding sites, at the interface between the β*(+)/α(-), the α(+)/β(-) and the β(+)/α*(-) subunits, an observation that diverges from previous studies suggesting that there are only two canonical GABA binding sites located at the β*(+)/α(-) and β(+)/α*(-) interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chua and Chebib, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, other studies have pointed out that GABA may bind to interfacial binding sites in addition to the two canonical sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chua and Chebib, 2017</xref>). The oval-like densities in the two canonical sites are well fit by the chemical structure of GABA, although the density feature at the β(+)/α*(-) interface is weaker than that at the β*(+)/α(-) site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, the third feature at the α(+)/β(-) interface, with a sausage-like shape, has the strongest density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because GABA is the only small molecule present in the sample buffer that has a size and shape similar to the density feature, we speculate that the density belongs to a GABA molecule. Nevertheless, it is possible that the density at the α(+)/β(-) interface belongs to an unidentified small molecule that co-purified with the receptor. Alternatively, the density feature could be due to several ordered water molecules. Given the continuous nature of the density, however, we favor the notion that the density is attributable to non-water, small molecule. Further studies will be required to experimentally determine GABA binding stoichiometry, and higher resolution cryo-EM studies will be needed to more thoroughly define the density features.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39383.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Neurotransmitter binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top down view of the receptor looking from the extracellular side.

The amino group of GABA likely forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr157 (loop B), Glu155 (loop B) and Tyr 97 (loop A) and a cation-π interaction with Tyr205, while the carboxylate group forms possible hydrogen bonds with Thr129 (β6 strand) and Thr202 (loop C) and a salt bridge with Arg66 (β2 strand). In addition, sandwiching of the amino group of GABA between Tyr205 (loop C) and Tyr157 further increases the number of interactions between agonist and receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, Tyr97, Glu155 and Arg66 are unique in the β subunit compared to the corresponding residues in the α and γ subunits and are crucial for substrate binding, as reported in previous studies demonstrating that Tyr97 and Arg66 play an important role in the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sander et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith and Olsen, 1995</xref>). Experiments employing non native amino acids suggest that Tyr 97 forms a cation-π interaction with GABA instead of Tyr 205 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Padgett et al., 2007</xref>). We note, however, that the aromatic ring of Tyr 97 is sandwiched between Arg 131 of the adjacent α subunit and Glu 155 of β and thus, in this structure, it is not well positioned to form a cation-π interaction with GABA. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that there are changes in the conformation of the binding pocket that allow for cation-π interactions between GABA and Tyr 97. Mutation of Tyr157, a highly conserved residue in the α, β and γ subunits, significantly reduces the binding affinity for agonist and antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lummis, 2009</xref>). Similar neurotransmitter binding interactions have previously been reported in the other Cys-loop members, including GluCl and GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>). Superposing this canonical binding site with the putative third ‘GABA’ binding site at the interface of the α(+)/β(-) site shows that there are fewer interactions between ‘GABA’ and the surrounding residues, such as the cation-π interactions with Tyr209 and contacts with Thr206 and the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr159 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We thus emphasize that, while the density feature is unambiguous, the identification of this site as a bona fide GABA binding site will require additional investigation.</p><p>We also superposed the canonical GABA binding site at the β*(+)/α(-) interface with the homologous sites at the γ(+)/β(-) and α*(+)/γ(-) interfaces, finding differences among the residues that play important roles in binding GABA, differences that may lead to weak or no GABA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). In inspecting these sites that include the γ2S subunit, we have attempted to better understand the binding site of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, which function as allosteric potentiators of the γ-subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that diazepam binds to the α*(+)/γ(-) interface with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with previous studies, we speculate that α*His101 could provide aromatic or hydrophobic interactions with the pendant phenyl ring of diazepam. Additionally, α*Tyr209, α*Phe99, α*Tyr159 and γPhe77 likely also contribute to hydrophobic interactions with diazepam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). All these key structural residues surrounding the diazepam site have been identified in homology models and functional experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teissére and Czajkowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wongsamitkul et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, mutation of α*His101, α*Tyr209 and α*Tyr159 markedly impairs the modulation by diazepam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 1997</xref>), while mutation of γPhe77 results in decreased binding affinity.</p><p>Agonist binding has been proposed to induce loop C closure in the open, ion conducting state and antagonist binding to stabilize an ‘open’ configuration of loop C in the closed, non-conducting state of the ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mukhtasimova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purohit and Auerbach, 2013</xref>). To probe the relationship between agonist binding and the position of loop C, we superposed the β* subunit with GABA bound onto the α* and γ subunits and found that loop C in the β* subunit is in an ‘open’ conformation relative to that in the α* and γ subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, superposition of the ECD of the β*/α subunit with the human β3 GABA<sub>A</sub>, GlyR-open and GlyR-closed structures suggests that the position of loop C in the β* subunit closely approximates that in the GlyR-closed non-conducting state, while loop C in the human β3 GABA<sub>A</sub> is in a more ‘open’ configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, this interpretation is subject to caveats because it is derived from the comparison of different subunits and different receptors. It would be more persuasive to define the relationship between loop C and the functional state of the receptor using the same receptor in different ligand bound/functional states, as well as in the absence of bound Fab.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Glycosylation within the extracellular vestibule</title><p>There is a well-defined glycosylation site at Asn110 of the α subunit, within the extracellular vestibule of the receptor, at a site of post-translational modification that is distinct from the other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and not observed before in any Cys-loop receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These glycosylation sites are located in the ECD at the center of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and they occupy a substantial portion of the ECD cavity. The volume of glycosylation in the vestibule is approximately 700 Å<sup>3</sup> at the contour level of 6 σ, which occupies nearly 18% of the total volume of the ECD vestibule. Because it is likely that each carbohydrate chain has sugar residues that are not resolved in the density map, we predict that the volume of the ECD vestibule occupied by these carbohydrate groups is actually larger than our estimation. There are extensive and specific interactions observed between the sugar groups and the γ2S subunit involving residues Asn101, Lys112 and Trp123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the glycosylation at Asn110 of the α subunits is important for subunit assembly, effectively blocking the formation of pentamers with more than two α subunits, due to the fact that more than two carbohydrate chains would engage in sterically prohibitive van der Waals clashes. Moreover, we speculate that the contacts between the carbohydrate at position Asn110 of the α subunit and, for example, the Trp123 of the γ2S subunit, favor the inclusion of the γsubunit as the last subunit in the formation of the heteropentamer. This is consistent with prior studies which showed that glycosylation of the α subunit is essential for proper receptor assembly in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buller et al., 1994</xref>), as well as the important role of tryptophan residues in interacting with carbohydrates in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maenaka et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stewart et al., 2008</xref>). We further suggest that these carbohydrate chains within the extracellular vestibule may also modulate receptor gating and, perhaps, ion channel block by large ion channel blockers. Indeed, it is intriguing that a post-translational modification such as N-linked glycosylation occupies such an important and ‘internal’ site in a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conformation and asymmetry of the TMD</title><p>In the GABA<sub>A</sub> structure, the intrinsic flexibility of the TMD or the presence of the detergent micelle prevents us from accurately placing residues in each TM helix, especially in the M4 helices. Nevertheless, the density of the M1, M2 and M3 helices is well defined, allowing us to reliably position the helices. We note that in this receptor composed of α, β and γ subunits there is a breakdown in 5-fold symmetry observed in the homomeric or di-heteromeric Cys-loop receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nys et al., 2013</xref>). While the distances between the center of mass (COM) of two adjacent subunits are similar, where the COMs were calculated using the M1, M2 and M3 helices of each subunit, varying from 17.6 Å to 19 Å, the angles in the pentagon range from 94° to 124° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Looking at the top-down views of five central M2 helices, the two α M2 helices are located away from the other three TM helices. Superposition of the two β subunits with the human β3 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor shows that there are rotations of each TM helix in the α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> receptor structure relative to corresponding TM helices in the human β3 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, further demonstrating the asymmetric structure of the TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39383.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Asymmetry in the TMD.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) View of the TMD from the extracellular (left panel) side or from the intracellular side (right panel) of the membrane.

Because of the asymmetric structure of the TMD and the fact that the structure was solved using a receptor embedded in a detergent micelle, the TMD structure may represent a non-native conformation. Future structural studies using different detergents and lipids, or using lipid-filled nanodiscs, will be important in elucidating structures in specific functional states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we directly visualize the subunit stoichiometry and subunit arrangement for a tri-heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. While previous studies have suggested that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor assembly occurs via defined pathways that limit the receptor diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sarto-Jackson and Sieghart, 2008</xref>), precise molecular mechanisms regarding assembly are unknown. If we consider how heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors form from α, β and γ subunits, we speculate that the larger contact areas in the ECD region makes formation of the β(+)/α(-) interface favorable, thus leading to α/β assembly intermediates, which then transition to (α/β)<sub>2</sub> intermediates. The crucial glycosylation site on the α subunit at Asn110 disfavors addition of a third α subunit, due to steric clashes, and that either a β or a γ subunit will be incorporated to complete the heteropentamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

We refer to this map as the ‘whole map’. The ‘whole map’ was sharpened using Localscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakobi et al., 2017</xref>). To further refine the ECD of the receptor, another mask focused on the ECD of the receptor and the variable domains of the Fabs was created, omitting the transmembrane domain and the micelle. Unbinned particles belonging to class 2 and class 3 were re-extracted and used in refinement, along with the ECD-variable domain mask, yielding a map at ~3.1 Å resolution (ECD map; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The ECD map was sharpened using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Terwilliger et al., 2018</xref>). Local resolution was estimated using blocres as implemented in Bsoft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heymann and Belnap, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Overall estimations of the resolutions of the reconstructions were carried out by Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>). The local resolution for the whole map varies about from 3.5 Å to 7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) where the low resolution areas are in the flexible or disordered regions of the TMD and constant domains of the Fabs. The local resolution for ECD map varies from about 3 to 4 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Model building</title><p>Homology models for the α1, β1 and γ2S subunit were generated using SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biasini et al., 2014</xref>). The ‘initial model’ for the pentamer was generated via rigid body fitting of the subunit models to the density map using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The high quality of ECD map facilitated building of the ECD structure by way of iterative cycles of manual adjustment in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) and refinement using phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>). After phenix refinement, the map correlation coefficient (CC) between the map and the ECD model was 0.80, indicative of a good fit between the ECD model and the ECD map.</p><p>To build the ‘whole model’ using the whole map, the TMD derived from the ‘initial model’ was combined with the ECD model using Coot. Due to the lower resolution of the density in the TMD, it was only possible to fit the helices to their associated density and some of the residues with large side chains. α−Helical secondary structure restraints were placed on the TMD helices throughout refinement. Due to the weak density associated with the loop between helices M3-M4 (M3/M4 loop) for all of the subunits, and with the M4 helixes for the two α subunits and the γ subunit, the M4 helixes together with the M3/M4 loop were not included in the whole model. After phenix refinement, the CC between the whole map model and whole map was 0.74. The final model has good stereochemistry as evaluated by MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank David Weiss for the gift of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor constructs, Dan Cawley for monoclonal antibody production, Cynthia Czajkowski and Dennis Dougherty for helpful comments, Avinash Patel and Eva Nogales for the graphene oxide protocol, and Heidi Owen for assistance with manuscript preparation.

Your article has been reviewed by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Mark L Mayer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a new GABA-bound cryo-EM structure of the rat α1β1γ2S triheteropentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABAR) resolved at 3.1 – 3.8 Å. The new structure captures a GABA-bound channel structure in the presence of a Fab fragments attached to the α subunits. The structure also reveals a novel N-linked glycosylation on the α subunit that surprisingly lies inside the ECD channel vestibule, which may partially block ion permeation and regulate receptor subunit assembly. The M3-M4 cytoplasmic regions were removed from the α and β subunits in the construct used for cryo-EM experiments and thus, no structural details about this important region were obtained. The manuscript is clear and well written. The approach is valid and the quality of data is good. The work is exciting and provides one of the first high-resolution structures of a heteropentameric GABAR. The structure adds significant new details about intersubunit interactions and provides a template for understanding GABA and allosteric drug modulator actions. It provides additional insight and complements the recent cryo-EM structure of the human GABAR solved in the presence of GABA and a BZD site antagonist (3.9 resolution) that was published in Nature (June 28) from the lab of Ryan Hibbs. Both structures reveal the N-linked glycosylation in the ECD channel vestibule, and somewhat poorer resolution of the TMD domain suggesting that in the heteropentameric protein this domain is dynamic. Specifics of some intersubunit residue interactions and potential numbers of GABA binding sites are different between the structures, which due to their resolution and different ligands present is not surprising. Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field and we have no major concerns. Each of the reviewers has identified issues that can readily be addressed by carefully revising the text. For clarity, we refer you to the individual reviews below. There are no requests for additional experiments.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper reports the first structure of a tri-heteromeric α1β1γ2S GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor solved by single particle cryo-EM that is an exciting advance appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> without major revision.</p><p>An α subunit selective monoclonal antibody Fab fragment was used to break quasi 5-fold symmetry and identify subunit arrangement in 2D class averages. The structure was solved to 3.1 to 3.8 Å overall resolution, allowing atomic models to be built and refined using density maps for the extracellular domain, but with substantially lower resolution for the α-helical TM domains that was impacted by preferred orientation which the authors were unable to overcome after exploring multiple conditions for sample preparation. Despite this, the paper represents a tour de force study of challenging membrane protein biochemistry, coupled with state of the art cryo-EM data processing, and substantially increases our understanding of pentameric ion channels and in particular GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor structural biology. With one exception, all of the features reported here are confirmed in two recent papers on closely related GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor structures, leaving zero doubt that the work is sound.</p><p>Key findings from the study include the first clues and structural information on mechanisms controlling assembly of heteromeric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors; discovery of an unanticipated glycosylation site that partially occludes the outer vestibule of the ion channel, for which compelling structural data is provided, and that is unique to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α subunits; and insights into ligand binding. Unexpectedly, the strongest ligand density is found at a non-canonical site, which the authors interpret with reasonable caution.</p><p>Although many details revealed by the structure were anticipated by extensive prior mutagenesis studies coupled with functional and biochemical analysis, the direct visualization of these mechanisms is a major advance, and refreshingly the authors do a reasonable job of discussing the structure in context of prior work, although this could be improved. Also, appropriately acknowledged is the fact that it is unclear whether the present agonist bound structure represents an open, desensitized, or preactivated state, along with possible issues that could impact this, but as discussed below this needs elaboration.</p><p>I have no major issues with the paper, but the following point could be better addressed during revision. In subsection “Conformation and asymmetry of the TMD”, the authors note that sample preparation conditions could potentially impact the observed structural asymmetry in subunit arrangement around the central pore that differs from the more symmetric arrangement in prior homomeric and di-heteromeric pentameric ligand gated ion channel structures. This is a frequent caveat for studies of detergent solubilized membrane proteins extracted from the lipid bilayer, and two recent papers on closely α1β2γ2 (Hibbs et al., 2018) and α1β3γ2 (Aricescu lab, https://www.biorxiv.org/ content/early/2018/06/05/338343) GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors directly address this, revealing alternative, symmetric TMD conformations (Hibbs) and major changes in TMD structure depending on lipids added during purification (Aricescu). I believe that the authors should explicitly state that it is possible that the observed structural asymmetry in the TMD may represent a non-native conformation.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system, responding to GABA binding with opening of a chloride permeable channel. Their dysfunction is associated with conditions including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are members of the diverse pLGIC family which has been the subject of considerable structural work across prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, which has defined core structural features. In the central nervous system, the most prevalent GABA<sub>A</sub> assembly bears 2x α subunits, 2x β subunits, and 1x γ subunit, arranged as β-α-β-γ-α when viewed extracellularly. Despite the centrality of this receptor to human biology, basic questions including the basis of tri-heteromeric assembly and GABA binding have been incompletely explored.</p><p>To address this gap in fundamental understanding of GABA<sub>A</sub> biology, Phulera and colleagues pursued the structure of the tri-heteromeric rat α1β1γ2 isoform, with M3/M4 loop deletions in α1 and β1 subunits (α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub>). They heroically expressed and purified this receptor and raised the 8E3 antibody specific to the α1 subunit. Before pursuing the structure of the receptor in complex with Fab 8E3, the authors established that Fab binding does not hinder receptor activity, while noting some reduction of diazepam potentiation. The GABA-bound structure was solved with the receptor solubilized in C12M-CHS, on grids coated with graphene oxide. This condition gave a preferred orientation but permitted resolution to a reported 3.8 Å for the full receptor, or 3.1 Å for the ECD with masking. They use these results for analysis of the subunit arrangement, subunit interfaces, the GABA binding site, glycosylation sites, and to conclude that the receptor is in an agonist/allosteric modulator bound, activated-like state.</p><p>The study involves impressive biochemical work to provide a look at the organization of a biologically and clinically significant receptor. The α1β1γ2S<sub>EM</sub> construct was functionally validated, the cryo-EM work was well done, and the structural interpretations seem reasonable. The observed glycosylations and speculation about how they influence receptor assembly is particularly exciting and adds to an important foundation for future interrogation. Overall, the text and figures are clear and professional and I have no major concerns.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript presents a new GABA-bound cryo-EM structure of the rat α1β2γ2 triheteropentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABAR) resolved at 3.1 – 3.8 Å. The new structure captures a GABA-bound channel structure in the presence of a Fab fragments attached to the α subunits. The structure also reveals a novel N-linked glycosylation on the α subunit that surprisingly lies inside the ECD channel vestibule, which may partially block ion permeation and regulate receptor subunit assembly. The M3-M4 cytoplasmic regions were removed from the α and β subunits in the construct used for cryo-EM experiments and thus, no structural details about this important region were obtained. The manuscript is clear and well written. The approach is valid and the quality of data is good. The work is exciting and provides one of the first high-resolution structures of a heteropentameric GABAR. The structure adds significant new details about intersubunit interactions and provides a template for understanding GABA and allosteric drug modulator actions. It provides additional insight and complements the recent cryo-EM structure of the human GABAR solved in the presence of GABA and a BZD site antagonist (3.9 resolution) that was published in Nature (June 28) from the lab of Ryan Hibbs. Both structures reveal the N-linked glycosylation in the ECD channel vestibule, and somewhat poorer resolution of the TMD domain suggesting that in the heteropentameric protein this domain is dynamic. Specifics of some intersubunit residue interactions and potential numbers of GABA binding sites are different between the structures, which due to their resolution and different ligands present is not surprising. Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field and I have no major concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39383.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I have no major issues with the paper, but the following point could be better addressed during revision.
