able to form giant ring-shaped pores that perforate and ultimately lyse mammalian cell membranes. To resolve the kinetics of all steps in the assembly pathway, we have used single-molecule fluorescence imaging to follow the dynamics of PFO on dye-loaded liposomes that lead to opening of a pore and release of the encapsulated dye. Formation of a long-lived membrane-bound PFO dimer nucleates the growth of an irreversible oligomer. The growing oligomer can insert into the membrane and open a pore at stoichiometries ranging from tetramers to full rings (~35 mers), whereby the rate of insertion increases linearly with the number of subunits. Oligomers that insert before the ring is complete continue to grow by monomer addition post insertion. Overall, our observations suggest that PFO membrane insertion is kinetically controlled.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholesterol dependent cytolysin</kwd><kwd>membrane pore</kwd><kwd>assembly kinetics</kwd><kwd>single-molecule fluorescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1182212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böcking</surname><given-names>Till</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT150100049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunstone</surname><given-names>Michelle A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1194263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP160101874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP200102871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morton</surname><given-names>Craig J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Arc-shaped PFO oligomers consisting of at least four subunits can insert into the membrane in a kinetically controlled process opening a transmembrane pore, whereby post-insertion growth may ultimately lead to formation of a complete ring.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pore-forming proteins (PFPs) possess an ancient and ubiquitous mechanism for forming aqueous channels in the membranes surrounding cells and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnstone et al., 2021</xref>). The largest and most sequence diverse class of PFPs is the membrane attack complex-perforin (MACPF)/cholesterol dependent cytolysin (CDC) superfamily with thousands of members now identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunstone and Tweten, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosado et al., 2008</xref>). Members of the MACPF family are found in all kingdoms of life but are most well characterised as effectors in the vertebrate immune system. Conversely, CDCs are bacterial virulence and defence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tweten, 2005</xref>). While these two families differ greatly in sequence, they are linked together by a highly conserved 3D fold, which drives oligomerisation into rings of 12–40 PFP monomers and subsequent membrane insertion, ultimately forming a membrane-spanning β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shatursky et al., 1999</xref>). The open pore has an unusually large lumen of ~25–30 nm in the case of CDCs, allowing the passive transport of folded proteins across membranes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tweten et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Perfringolysin O (PFO), a prototypical example of a CDC, is secreted by the anaerobic bacterium <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tweten et al., 2001</xref>), which is involved in the development of gas gangrene and necrohemorrhagic enteritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verherstraeten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verherstraeten et al., 2013</xref>). As with the majority of CDCs, PFO binds to cholesterol-rich membranes and oligomerises to form large (25–30 nm) doughnut-shaped pores, ultimately leading to cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>). A small subset of CDCs do not require cholesterol for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giddings et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ragaliauskas et al., 2019</xref>); however, it remains necessary for membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polekhina et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The steps in canonical CDC pore-formation have been well characterised; the proteins are secreted as soluble monomers, monomers bind to and then oligomerise on target membranes to form a ring-shaped prepore complex, the prepore complex then undergoes a concerted conformational change and inserts in the membrane to form a large (25–30 nm) amphipathic β-barrel bilayer-spanning pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morton et al., 2019</xref>). To resolve these steps, point mutations of PFO have been used to investigate kinetically trapped intermediates alongside fluorescent conjugates acting as environmental indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans and Tweten, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramachandran et al., 2004</xref>), with some intermediates observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>) and electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Pee et al., 2017</xref>) high-resolution imaging. These and other studies have defined the key molecular events and rearrangements required for pore formation. Initially, membrane binding is mediated by domain 4 (D4) which specifically recognises cholesterol in the lipid bilayer. Interdomain contacts in the CDC fold drive oligomerisation forming arc prepores. CDCs undergo a drastic collapse by rotation of domain 2 (D2) which lowers domain 3 (D3) toward the membrane, enabling the α-helical bundles (αHB) to unfurl and insert into the bilayer forming transmembrane β-hairpins. Notably, these data showed the prevalence of full prepore and inserted rings and assumed them to be the functional mechanism of pore formation, although incomplete arc-shaped oligomers have been observed by other labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sonnen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PFO pore formation assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the TIRF assay to measure the PFO assembly and membrane pore formation.

The slight increase in the rate of poration in the 100% labelled sample (maroon curve) in comparison to lower labelled percentage samples suggests that the actual concentration of the labelled sample may be slightly higher than the unlabelled sample.

This assay measures the rate of release of a fluorescent dye from liposomes in bulk after incubation with PFO, which is correlated to the rate of pore formation. The main shortcoming of these experiments is that they give a single bulk readout of the reaction over time. The intrinsically stochastic nature of nucleation makes it impossible to synchronise pore formation on multiple liposomes even if they are exposed to PFO at the same time. As a result, any ensemble measurement of PFO binding is blurred by averaging the growth of pores at different stages of formation. Similarly, pore insertion is the culmination of multiple stochastic processes, occurring asynchronously between liposomes. As such, it is difficult to identify the specific molecular interaction in which variation underpins any observed changes in the bulk measurement.</p><p>To overcome the limitation of ensemble averaging, imaging methods have been developed to follow PFP assembly at the level of individual pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ros et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sathyanarayana et al., 2018</xref>).

These imaging studies support the insertion of incomplete arc-shaped membrane lesions, suggesting an alternative mechanism of pore formation that is distinct from the canonical prepore formation prior to insertion. This observation raises the question as to when and how release of the membrane spanning regions is triggered, which cannot be correlated with key assembly steps using ensemble methods. Related to this matter, it is also unclear whether release and insertion of the membrane spanning regions from each of the subunits occurs in a concerted or sequential fashion.</p><p>To observe PFP assembly and membrane permeabilisation simultaneously at the single molecule level, we have adapted the liposome dye release assay to measure kinetics on individual liposomes. By using single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we visualised the binding, nucleation, build up and insertion of individual PFO species. These data were subsequently used to develop a mathematical model for PFO pore formation in which parameters can predict the number of subunits in PFO oligomers at the time of insertion. We have also found in our assay that inserted PFO arcs, currently thought to be kinetically trapped, can continue to grow post insertion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorescence imaging of PFO pore assembly kinetics on single liposomes</title><p>Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to observe in real time the dynamic interactions between PFO and dye-loaded liposomes leading to dye release from individual liposomes using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The assay design is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Large unilamellar liposomes made of a synthetic lipid mixture containing cholesterol, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine and a small amount of a phosphatidylethanolamine derivative with biotinylated headgroup (55:44:1 molar ratio) were loaded with the small fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) during extrusion. The high-cholesterol content facilitates PFO activity on model membranes and is consistent with previous biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shepard et al., 2000</xref>). The liposomes had an average diameter of ~200 nm (183±37 nm measured by dynamic light scattering, 172±18 nm measured using super resolution microscopy; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and were captured on the surface of a streptavidin-coated glass coverslip at the bottom of a microfluidic channel device. Recombinant cysteine-less PFO (see Appendix) was labelled via lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 1991</xref>) with Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) using NHS ester chemistry, whereby most molecules contained a single dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and AF647-PFO retained full pore-formation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). AF647-PFO was constantly flowed at a defined concentration through the microfluidic channel while imaging AF647-PFO assembly and AF488 release from liposomes by dual-colour time-lapse TIRF microscopy. The immobilised liposomes appeared as diffraction-limited spots in the AF488 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top left), which disappeared over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom left).

A typical dual-colour pore formation trace recorded at a single liposome (highlighted with a white box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. A montage of corresponding images of the liposome and AF647-PFO channels are shown below the plot. Initially, the liposome intensity remains high while there is no signal above noise in the AF647-PFO channel. During this phase, PFO monomers interact transiently with the liposome membrane, which can be resolved by imaging at high temporal resolution (as described below) but are not detected in the pore formation traces. Eventually, the AF647-PFO signal rises above background, which we attribute to nucleation of a PFO oligomer that is stably bound to the liposome membrane and continues to grow in number of subunits (and hence intensity). A sudden drop in the content dye signal to background levels pinpoints the time of membrane poration, allowing rapid diffusion of AF488 out of the liposome. We attribute this event to the opening of a single transmembrane pore as a result of a PFO oligomer inserting into the membrane. We also determined the number of labelled subunits in the PFO oligomer forming the open pore structure from the AF647 intensity at the time of dye release divided by the intensity of a single AF647-PFO molecule. Interestingly, the AF647-PFO signal continues to increase beyond the time of pore formation on most liposomes. When experiments were continued long after poration, liposomes continued to bind PFO to levels much greater than the value expected for a single ring-shaped pore (~35 subunits), suggesting that eventually multiple pores form on a single liposome. Further example traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>Typically, a field of view contained ~2,300 liposomes (corresponding to a surface density of 0.074 liposomes/μm<sup>2</sup>). At AF647-PFO concentrations between 100 and 500 pM, most liposomes lost their dye signal in a single step (&gt;50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>), while ~30% of dye release traces showed partial or multi-step signal loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). The remainder (~10%) showed no or little signal loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), suggesting that these were not permeabilised despite AF647-PFO binding to many of these liposomes (further examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). At 50 pM AF647-PFO, single-step pore formation was less efficient (&lt;10%), and at even lower AF647-PFO concentrations, dye release was no longer observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We tentatively attribute the different release profiles to heterogeneity in the liposome preparations. For example, aggregated liposomes and multilamellar liposomes would be expected to give rise to traces with multiple steps or partial release of dye. Alternatively, multiple dye release steps could arise from transient pore opening events with a lifetime in the range of 0.1–1 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Single-step traces were identified for further analysis and initial inspection revealed that the time for nucleation of a growing PFO oligomer and the time for poration varied between liposomes, as did the number of subunits at the time of pore opening. These processes are analysed in more detail below. As expected, the kinetics of liposome poration decreased with decreasing AF647-PFO concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). At high concentrations (500 pM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, light blue) single-step dye release was complete within ~20 min, while at low concentrations (50 pM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, dark blue) this process takes ~2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characterisation of PFO monomer binding to liposomes</title><p>The first step of PFO pore formation involves the binding of PFO monomers to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). To measure the kinetics of this process, we imaged the interactions of AF647-PFO molecules with liposomes at high temporal resolution (~17.5 frames/s) for a period of 7 hr at room temperature at very low concentrations (2.5–20 pM), where the chance of two monomers binding to a liposome at the same time to dimerise becomes negligible. Under these conditions, we observed transient binding of single AF647-PFO molecules appearing as sporadic fluorescent spots. We then used a software developed for single-molecule localisation microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>) to detect and track AF647-PFO spots appearing and disappearing at the locations of individual liposomes, resulting in a trace at each location with typically over 1000 binding events. A representative single-liposome trace recorded in the presence of 10 pM AF647-PFO shows that the rate of binding events remained constant over the entire 7-hr experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), while zoomed-in views show sporadic binding intensity spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) corresponding to a AF647-PFO signal persisting for several frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The intensity distribution of all binding events on all liposomes overlaid completely with the intensity distribution of the same batch of AF647-PFO molecules sparsely immobilised directly on a glass coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) indicating that a single species associated with the liposomes. Single-molecule photobleaching of the molecules adhered to a glass coverslip showed that most molecules (84%) bleached in a single step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the AF647-PFO species transiently binding to liposomes are likely to be monomers.</p><p>The scatter plot of x/y-coordinates for all molecules detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> forms a ring-like distribution, as expected for the z-projection of AF647-PFO molecules binding to the membrane of a spherical liposome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The x/y-coordinate maps for all liposomes were further used to reconstruct a super-resolved image, which revealed the outlines of liposomes bound to the coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Interestingly, many liposomes displayed bright spots in the reconstruction images suggesting that liposome membranes may have a spatially inhomogeneous affinity for binding PFO, but the underlying mechanism for this observation remains unclear. Importantly, the super-resolved AF647-PFO structures colocalised with the diffraction-limited signals in the AF488 content dye channel, confirming that binding occurred on liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G/H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined the rates of AF647-PFO monomer binding and unbinding from each binding trace collected at a single liposome. First, we measured the time intervals between peaks in the trace (an example of one such Δ<italic>t</italic><sub>dark</sub> is highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to determine the distribution of waiting times before binding of the next molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). An exponential fit of this distribution provided the AF647-PFO monomer binding rate (0.043 s<sup>–1</sup> for the example liposome shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Similarly, we measured the duration of each peak (an example of one such Δ<italic>t</italic><sub>bright</sub> is highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) to determine the time distribution of the bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). An exponential fit of this distribution then provided the AF647-PFO monomer unbinding rate after correcting for photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We repeated this analysis for all liposomes in the field of view, revealing a wide distribution of binding and unbinding rates on different liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and M</xref>, respectively), possibly due to inhomogeneity in binding affinities of different structural states and/or local lipid composition. Analysis of binding experiments at a range of AF647-PFO concentrations showed that the binding rate distributions shifted to higher values with concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), whereby the median monomer binding rate increased linearly with concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). This analysis allowed us to obtain the monomer binding rate constant (<italic>B</italic>=0.9 ± 0.23 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) which corresponds to 7.2±1.8 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> μm<sup>–2</sup> when taking the surface area of liposomes into account (calculated as the surface area of a 200 nm sphere). As expected, the unbinding rate distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>) and the median unbinding rates obtained from these distributions were independent of concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>), yielding a value for the unbinding rate of <italic>U</italic>=2.27 ± 0.81 s<sup>–1</sup>.

We conclude that dimerisation on the membrane promotes strong PFO–PFO and PFO–membrane interactions. From our data we cannot distinguish whether the dimer disappears by unbinding from the membrane, or whether it dissociates to monomers that subsequently unbind from the membrane. We also note that the half-life of the dimer state is sufficiently long such that it is essentially irreversible on the time scale of PFO assembly at concentrations of ≥100 pM, where the entire pore formation process takes on average less than 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PFO dimerisation on the membrane nucleates a stably growing oligomer</title><p>At higher concentrations (≥25 pM), the transient interactions of PFO eventually lead to nucleation of a membrane-bound oligomer that continues to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

The mean traces obtained for a range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) show that oligomerisation occurs at a constant rate (all lines are linear) that increases with concentration. To further quantify the dependence of oligomerisation on concentration, we fitted the steady increase in fluorescence intensity after nucleation for each liposome with a linear function, whereby the slope provided the oligomerisation rate. As expected, the median oligomerisation rate for all liposomes increased linearly with AF647-PFO concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), providing an oligomerisation rate constant of p=0.23 ± 0.028 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>. This oligomerisation rate is essentially the product of the rate of PFO monomer binding to the membrane and the probability of finding and joining the growing oligomer. The ratio between the oligomerisation rate constant (0.23 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) to the single molecule binding rate constant (0.9 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) reveals that 25% of the time, a PFO monomer binding to the membrane will end up joining the oligomer (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for parameter summary). Finally, we validated the oligomerisation rate by directly observing the successive arrival of AF647-PFO monomers using single molecule imaging conditions, which yielded a value of 0.15±0.04 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since this approach does not rely on fluorescence intensity, the good agreement between the two independent measurements also validates the intensity-based method to determine the number of molecules in oligomers used in this work.</p><p>The oligomer disassembly rate (given by the Y-intercept of the fit line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) is effectively zero suggesting that PFO oligomers are stable on the membrane and do not dissociate. We conclude that PFO oligomerisation is essentially irreversible on the time scale of pore formation. The high stability of PFO oligomers on the membrane is also observed after removal of AF647-PFO from solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as discussed below, and is not surprising given the long mean lifetime of the dimer on the membrane (~20 min).</p><p>On the basis of the high dimer stability, we reasoned that the dimer represents the stable nucleus for oligomerisation, that is the rate-limiting step for nucleation is waiting for two monomers to be bound to the membrane at the same time and form a dimer. We used the kinetic model shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> to calculate theoretical nucleation rates, whereby firstly, membrane binding is governed by the binding and unbinding kinetics of monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and secondly, dimerisation on the membrane is governed by a dimerisation rate constant, <italic>D</italic><sub>f</sub>. We fitted the model to the experimental concentration dependence of nucleation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) with <italic>D</italic><sub>f</sub> as the only free parameter to obtain an estimate of <italic>D</italic><sub>f</sub> = 0.16 ± 0.19 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>, similar to the value for the oligomerisation rate constant obtained above (p=0.23 ± 0.028 nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>,<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, dimerisation is kinetically similar to oligomerisation, consistent with the dimer being the first stable species on the membrane. Accordingly, the predicted nucleation rates when using the value of <italic>P</italic> to parametrise dimerisation in the model were also in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. This agreement is remarkable, given that parameter values for the monomer binding/unbinding and oligomerisation kinetics were obtained using different experimental conditions and are sufficient to predict nucleation rates.</p><p>Next, we extended the kinetic model to account for the finite dimer stability measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Dimer dissociation may occur via one of two alternative pathways, that is unbind from the membrane or fall apart into monomers. Fits of these extended models to the experimental concentration dependence of nucleation rates were essentially indistinguishable from the simple model described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is because the dimer dissociation process is so slow, that it has virtually no impact on the outcome of nucleation in the concentration range investigated here, regardless of the pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PFO membrane insertion kinetics increase with the number of subunits in the oligomer</title><p>Dual-colour pore formation traces showed that membrane pore opening (dye release) occurred after onset of the AF647-PFO signal increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Analysis of the number of subunits at the time of dye release showed that low stoichiometry PFO oligomers insert into the membrane to form pores before they form full rings. While the fluorescence data do not provide structural information, we interpret these low stoichiometry PFO oligomers as arcs since wild type PFO assembly intermediates appear as arc-shaped structures in AFM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>). The pore opening kinetics of continuously growing arcs is complicated and analysed in detail below. To first measure (arc) pore opening kinetics in the absence of continuing oligomerisation, we devised a wash-out assay, in which liposomes are exposed to AF647-PFO for a limited time to allow formation of membrane-bound arcs. The AF647-PFO was then washed out of the microfluidics channel using a buffer at a time when the majority of liposomes still retained their content dye (i.e. the pore had not yet formed).</p><p>After wash-out, we observed that these dye-loaded liposomes showed a wide distribution of AF647-PFO oligomer sizes between 2 and 40 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as expected for a stochastic nucleation and growth process. We then continued to image the liposomes by TIRF microscopy to detect the dye release as a read-out for pore formation. A typical example trace recorded at a single liposome is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Initially, AF647-PFO nucleated a growing arc (signal appearance and increase) on the membrane, while the content dye signal remained high. After wash-out, the AF647-PFO signal stayed constant for the remainder of the experiment, confirming that membrane-bound arcs did not release PFO subunits (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). After a waiting time, the content dye signal disappeared, which we interpret as the insertion of the PFO arc into the membrane and concomitant opening of the membrane pore. Thus, we defined the time period between wash-out and dye release as the insertion time. Since our experimental read-out (dye release) reports the opening of the membrane pore, this definition assumes that the rearrangement of lipids required to open the semi-toroidal membrane pore is fast compared to time required to wait for PFO insertion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The energetics of PFO oligomer membrane insertion depends on the number of subunits in the prepore.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example trace of the AF647-PFO washout experiment.

In order for the β-barrel to form on a growing arc, the newly recruited monomer must undergo a vertical collapse, release of the α-helical bundles and unfurling of the β-hairpins. In the canonical prepore model (not shown), these processes are thought to be driven by interactions between the MACPF/CDC domains (consisting of D1 and D3) of adjacent subunits. In contrast, the interaction interfaces involved in the recruitment and conformational changes of a membrane-bound monomer for post-insertion arc growth are unknown, but may involve transient D4–D4 interactions, which have been postulated to form early in PFO assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Pee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wade et al., 2015b</xref>) and/or some of the interactions in D1 and D3 as seen in the linear oligomer structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lawrence et al., 2015</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) Monomeric PFO is flexible about the hinge region between D4 and the rest of the PFO molecule (as shown in molecular dynamics simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reboul et al., 2014</xref>). This flexibility enables monomer collapse after recruitment. (<bold>C</bold>) Alternatively, membrane bound monomers are capable of collapse prior to recruitment, thereby positioning the MACPF/CDC domain appropriately for direct interactions at the MACPF/CDC interface. The trigger for PFP collapse in the alternative pathways shown in B and C are unknown, but may involve the local environment of the toroidal pore. (<bold>D</bold>) Subsequent more substantive interactions may then be mediated by interdomain contacts of the MACPF/CDC interface. Therefore, a putative collapsed intermediate is postulated to exist whereby collapse precedes unfurling of the α-helical bundles (α-HB) required to form transmembrane hairpins (TMH). Simple rigid body fit of the PFO crystal structure (PDB 1PFO) into the cryoEM reconstruction of the pneumolysin pore (EMD-4118) reveals a sterically forbidden clash of α-HB1 (black arrow/red glow) occurs with strand β4 of the adjacent PFO (inset).

In this model, the assembly process starts from a stable dimer nucleus. Below the minimum number of subunits in the oligomer required for efficient insertion and pore opening (n&lt;4), the oligomer grows by monomer addition. Once the oligomer reaches n=4, it can either grow or insert, whereby the probability of growth versus insertion is determined by the respective rates for these processes.</p><p>Next, we validated the model by comparing predictions to experimentally determined distributions of intermediates detectable in the dual colour pore formation experiments. The size of oligomers inserting into the membrane, determined as the number of subunits from the AF647-PFO signal at the time of dye release, was broadly distributed at all AF647-PFO concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), whereby the upper end of the distributions represented the level expected for full rings (~35 subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2005</xref>). The mean number of subunits in the pore at insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) increased with concentration from fewer than 15 subunits at 50 pM to 20 subunits at 500 pM. Similarly, the fraction of oligomers inserting at a number of subunits consistent with a complete ring increased with concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) but remained below 30% even at the highest concentrations tested here. This outcome reflects that the oligomerisation rate was on average not fast enough to complete the full ring before arc insertion occurred.

This trend was also correctly predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, orange line). Overall, the excellent agreement between data and model predictions supports the dependence of insertion on the number of PFO subunits in the oligomer and concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>PFO oligomers continue to grow after insertion</title><p>Next, we analysed the AF647-PFO signal before and after the transition of the arc in the prepore state to the pore state had occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). It has previously been shown that arcs of the related CDC suilysin do not continue to grow after the transition from the prepore to the pore state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, the AF647-PFO oligomerisation rate was the same immediately after poration (dye release) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, yellow symbols) as it was just before poration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, orange symbols), that is the AF647-PFO signal increase did not stop (or pause) before or after insertion. Since the nucleation of a new structure is a slow process that would lead to a pause in the AF647-PFO signal increase, we interpret this observation as the continued addition of monomers (that bind from solution to the membrane) to the arc pore. An alternative explanation, that is the simultaneous growth of a second oligomer on the liposome, is unlikely for the following reasons: The nucleation of a second oligomer before insertion is unlikely since the first oligomer acts as a sink for monomers, further slowing an already slow nucleation step. Also, the appearance of additional oligomers would be apparent from an increase in the oligomerisation rate, which is not observed in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, orange symbols). This interpretation of nucleating a single oligomer per liposome is also consistent with negative staining EM images of PFO structures which appear as single complete rings, despite being assembled at relatively higher (nanomolar) concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, we calculated the upper limit for the probability of nucleating a second dimer on a liposome before insertion of the growing PFO oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). This analysis showed that the majority of liposomes are predicted to contain a single oligomer at the time of dye release at concentrations ≤100 nM, but nucleation of a new dimer become probable at higher concentrations (note that this dimer may not form an independently growing oligomer but could join the first oligomer).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Pore opening coincides with a drop in PFO oligomer movement on the membrane</title><p>Membrane insertion leads to a drastic reduction of the diffusion rate of CDC complexes on the surface of flat membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Senior et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>).

As expected we observed a reduction in rate over the pH range, whereby nucleation was almost abolished at pH 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This decrease in rate may result from either reduced membrane binding of PFO monomers or from reduced lateral interactions between PFO molecules forming the oligomer. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used the kinetic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> to predict the effect of weakening either of these interactions on nucleation (see Appendix for details). The better fit of the data by the membrane binding scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, purple line) leads us to conclude the observed decrease in nucleation kinetics with pH was due to a defect in PFO–membrane binding rather than a defect in PFO–PFO interactions, whereby we estimate that the affinity of PFO monomers for membranes is decreased by 10-fold between pH 5 and pH 8.</p><p>It has been proposed that the transition from the prepore to the membrane-inserted state could be affected by pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rossjohn et al., 2007</xref>). To test this possibility, we extracted the insertion kinetics as a function of the number of subunits in the oligomer as described above, which showed minor differences but no overall correlation between the insertion rate and pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This suggests that monomer binding was the only step affected by pH.</p><p>Next, we analysed the phase from nucleation to poration. Interestingly, the number of subunits in the arc at the time of poration was higher at pH 5 (~25 subunits) than at pH 8 (~10 subunits) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) and similarly the fraction of PFO oligomers that insert as complete rings decreased from ~30% to none detected across the pH range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Concomitantly, the time from nucleation to poration increased with pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). When we simply introduced the pH-dependent differences in the oligomerisation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) (which in turn result from the defect in membrane binding) into the oligomerisation/insertion kinetic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the model was able to reproduce the decrease in mean number of subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, orange line) and complete ring formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, orange line) and the increase in the time from nucleation to poration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) with increasing pH (See appendix ‘The effect of pH on growth and insertion’ for model details). Thus, the kinetics and energetics of membrane insertion are not affected by pH. Finally, we confirmed that across the entire pH range oligomerisation continued with unchanged kinetics after arc insertion, that is the basic features of the pore assembly pathway were preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of these analyses we conclude that the overall pronounced decrease of the pore formation efficiency and kinetics with increasing pH from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline is due to reduced affinity of the monomer binding to the membrane while PFO–PFO interactions are largely unaffected. This defect propagates through other phases of the assembly pathway, slowing nucleation and oligomerisation but not the kinetics of the prepore to pore transition. As a consequence, the mean number of subunits at the time of poration decreases with increasing pH. The implication of this observation is that other parameters that affect PFO–membrane affinity (such as lipid composition) would similarly tune whether insertion occurs early during PFO arc growth or when rings are (almost) complete.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By measuring the single-molecule kinetics of PFO accumulation on liposomes together with a functional read-out for pore opening at the level of single liposomes, we were able to identify distinct stages in the pore formation pathway that would be undetectable in ensemble measurements due to dephasing. Our analysis provides a complete kinetic description of CDC pore assembly from monomer binding to pore opening with the following characteristics: (i) PFO monomers repeatedly bind to and diffuse on the membrane surface and dissociate with a half-life of 0.3 s; (ii) dimerisation of two PFO monomers on the membrane represents the committed step that nucleates a stable growing oligomer; (iii) oligomerisation occurs by addition of monomers that bind to the membrane from solution and is essentially irreversible; (iv) oligomers (arcs) with as few as four (possibly fewer) subunits can insert into the membrane and open a membrane pore, whereby the rate of insertion increases approximately linearly with the number of subunits in the arc; this transition from the prepore to the pore state constitutes the main energy barrier in the pathway; (v) oligomers continue to grow after insertion by addition of PFO monomers, presumably forming complete rings.</p><p>Our experimental approach relying on immobilised liposomes is complementary to AFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulvihill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vögele et al., 2019</xref>) and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Senior et al., 2022</xref>) studies on flat bilayers to image the dynamic process of CDC pore assembly in real time. The assay has sufficiently high throughput to study the effect of varying experimental conditions on pore formation (in this work, PFO concentrations and pH), whereby each experiment provides traces from hundreds to over a thousand liposomes providing statistical power to detect small changes in kinetic parameters. The use of microfluidics enables temporal control of experimental conditions. In addition, the constant microfluidic solution flow facilitates experiments at exquisitely low concentrations by avoiding depletion of PFO from solution due to adsorption onto surfaces and assembly on membranes. TIRF microscopy provides sensitivity for single-molecule detection at high temporal resolution (57ms per frame) for prolonged periods of time (hours). This allowed us to measure the transient interactions of PFO monomers on liposomes at concentrations (≤20 pM) where dimerisation on the membrane surface is highly improbable, providing the first estimates of the monomer binding and unbinding rates for PFO.</p><p>Limitations of our approach include the following. Unlike measurements on flat membranes, we cannot resolve separate molecules or complexes on the same liposome due to the diffraction limit. While biochemical characterisation and AFM imaging of PFPs is typically carried out in the nM range, we limited the concentrations used in this study to the pM range to enhance the probability of observing the growth of a single complex per liposome. This is initially borne out in the data: The oligomerisation rate remains constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) instead of increasing (as would be expected for multiple oligomers) and the movement of the fluorescent complex on the membrane drops in a single step upon membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Nevertheless, the fluorescence signal ultimately exceeds the levels expected for a single ring-shaped pore, suggesting that additional oligomers eventually nucleate on the liposome, although it remains unclear when this second nucleation event occurs. Thus, we cannot rule out the simultaneous growth of more than one oligomer, especially during later stages of the experiment. Further experiments are required to pinpoint exactly when additional oligomers appear, for example using conditions that are optimised to detect new nucleation events or complementary approaches such as single-particle tracking on flat bilayers. Finally, it is possible that oligomer growth could also proceed by addition of dimers (or multimers) when PFO concentrations are sufficiently high for frequent dimerisation events, that is far above concentrations used in our experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation is that non-specific labelling of PFO (resulting in a heterogeneous sample of labelled species), as well as possible fluorescence artefacts, limit the precision with which we can determine the number of subunits in PFO oligomers. For validation, we determined the oligomerisation rate and number subunits in the oligomer at the time of pore opening by detecting and counting individual PFO monomers joining the growing oligomer. This intensity-independent analysis yielded essentially the same values as the quantification based on intensity.</p><p>Consistent with previous observations for PFO and other CDC/MACPF pore formers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Senior et al., 2022</xref>), we find that PFO oligomerisation is irreversible. Notably, our data also shows that the PFO dimer is the first long-lived species on the membrane, such that dimerisation is the committed step for pore formation. PFO does not form dimers (or oligomers) in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feil et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossjohn et al., 1997</xref>). On the membrane, collisions between PFO molecules may initially form weak, reversible interactions but stable PFO-PFO association is dependent on a conformational change that can only occur on the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hotze et al., 2012</xref>). This requires displacement of the β5 strand from the β-sheet in domain 3 to allow interactions between the β4 and β1’ strands of adjacent PFO molecules defining the nascent β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramachandran et al., 2004</xref>). It is worth noting that after oligomerisation, MACPF/CDC β-barrels are typically SDS-resistant and show remarkable stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heuck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shepard et al., 2000</xref>). Our data only revealed one long-lived dimer species, suggesting that the proposed reversible dimer is too short-lived to be detected here and either dissociates or immediately converts to the stable dimer. The type of conformational change required for this transition is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref> and resembles the pathway for dimerisation proposed on the basis of linear CDC oligomers in pneumolysin, vaginolysin, and intermedilysin crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lawrence et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, the level of stabilisation observed here (~3 orders of magnitude increase in half-life on the membrane) is remarkable even when accounting for avidity of a tight PFO-PFO dimer, suggesting that dimerisation goes along with further conformational changes to stabilise the membrane-bound state.</p><p>It has been shown that several MACPF/CDC PFPs can insert into the membrane as arcs before formation of the full ring is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulvihill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Podobnik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sonnen et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis showed that PFO oligomers with as few as four subunits can efficiently release the encapsulated dye from the liposome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since PFO assembly on liposomes is not sufficient for dye release, but requires unfurling and insertion of the β-hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heuck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heuck et al., 2000</xref>), our data suggests that small oligomers can insert into the membrane and induce formation of a (at least transient) semi-toroidal pore. PFO dimers and trimers do not efficiently release dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but we cannot distinguish whether these species fail to insert into the bilayer or fail to induce membrane pore opening upon insertion. Membrane-bound monomers are short-lived, rapidly dissociating back into solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and thus do not insert into the lipid bilayer.</p><p>Remarkably, the rate of arc insertion increased linearly with the number of subunits in the arc such that insertion of low order oligomers can only be observed in the absence of growth. One interpretation of the dependence on the number of subunits in the oligomer is that any subunit can independently trigger the process leading to insertion of the entire pore, that is the more subunits are available, the higher the probability of insertion. Overall, our interpretation fits with the sequential insertion model for β-barrel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Pee et al., 2017</xref>), whereby the conformational change in one subunit propagates to neighbouring subunits along the oligomer. In this model, the semi-toroidal pore opens early in the process and lipids are pushed aside into the bulk membrane as insertion proceeds along the oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vögele et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments also suggested that when oligomers are continuously growing, the insertion rate increases with the concentration of PFO in solution. This unexpected observation needs further investigation and validation. While we do not yet understand the underlying mechanism, one possible hypothesis is that the binding of a monomer to the growing oligomer induces a transient activated state that is more likely to insert. More frequent binding events (observed at higher PFO concentrations in solution) would then induce the activated state more frequently, leading to an overall increase in insertion kinetics.</p><p>We observed that AF647-PFO accumulation on the liposome continued unabated after opening of an arc pore, which we interpret as post-insertion oligomer growth. Using single-molecule tracking on droplet interface bilayers supported on an agarose layer, Wallace and colleagues also observed that PFO oligomers continue to grow by monomer addition after insertion into the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Senior et al., 2022</xref>), whereby insertion was detected by the sudden drop in lateral diffusion of the assembling structure on the membrane. In contrast, AFM studies of suilysin pore formation on lipid bilayers supported on mica have shown that suilysin arcs do not continue to grow after insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, further studies are needed to determine whether different CDCs and/or different experimental systems lead to different outcomes.</p><p>Real-time imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parsons et al., 2019</xref>) and structural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spicer et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that some members of the MACPF family can assemble via a growing pore mechanism whereby monomers or oligomers add to an inserted arc. Notably, MACPFs do not undergo a vertical collapse upon insertion such that oligomerisation interfaces remain aligned between molecules in the prepore and the pore state. In contrast, it is unclear how membrane-bound PFO monomers in the prepore state could join a collapsed inserted arc and how this interaction could lead to insertion of the newly arrived PFO molecule since insertion is thought to depend on the formation of extensive PFO-PFO contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burns et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wade et al., 2015a</xref>). While further experiments are required to establish whether post-insertion PFO oligomerisation adds monomers to the already inserted arc pore to complete the ring or whether the arc pore facilitates nucleation of a separate oligomer, it is nevertheless tempting to speculate how post-insertion growth may occur. One hypothesis is that the PFO monomer may interact with the inserted arc, for example through initial D4–D4 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 1991</xref>), followed by vertical collapse and unfurling of the β-hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This model is akin to the sequential unfurling of β-hairpins discussed above and requires considerable conformational flexibility (possibly of the subunits at the edge of the arc). An alternative hypothesis is that incoming PFO monomers may undergo an induced conformational change, for example as a result of interacting with the toroidal lipid edge, and subsequently add to the arc pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). All of our models for post-insertion oligomerisation require PFO to undergo conformational changes, driven through local environmental effects. While this is precisely what drives conventional PFO oligomerisation, characterising the specific details in the context of inserted arcs remains an unresolved question, whereby each hypothesis presented here has puzzling elements but provides the basis for future experimental studies.</p><p>As discussed above, insertion can be observed over a wide range of oligomer sizes, ranging from ~tetramers to full rings. We propose a model in which the transition from arc or ring-shaped prepore to pore is a stochastic process that is controlled by the kinetics of the different steps in the pore formation pathway. For example, under conditions where membrane binding is slow (e.g. at low PFO concentrations or pH &gt;7), oligomerisation is too slow to complete a full ring before insertion occurs. Since PFO monomers can continue to add after insertion, the final outcome is a ring-shaped pore, regardless of when insertion happened during arc growth. This is consistent with a predominance of ring pores in EM images, even when PFO assembly occurs at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). While this model is sufficient to explain the data, additional mechanisms may be operational such as the proposed allosteric trigger for the conformational change upon ring closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wade et al., 2015a</xref>). In addition to arcs and rings, pores can also be formed when two (or more) arcs coalesce into larger structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulvihill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Senior et al., 2022</xref>). We expect the relative abundance of these structures to be controlled by kinetics as well. For example, if PFO monomers are depleted from solution during the reaction, arc growth slows down such that coalescence becomes more likely.</p><p>Overall, our single-molecule approach enables analysis of all steps leading to PFO pore formation to be deconvoluted and investigated separately, unlike existing ensemble assays. The assay design is simple to modify and enables multiple experimental modalities for different lines of inquiry. Further, the moderate throughput enables statistical power to quantify individual processes within the full assembly pathway. In conjunction with kinetic modelling, this analysis represents a useful method to predict and measure the effects of modification to specific steps in the pathway, with applications in drug development or biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnstone et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>PFO production and purification</title><p>PFO C459A without signal peptide containing an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag (sequence shown in the Appendix; referred to as PFO herein) was used in this work.

In general, the probability that a single molecule will grow rather than fall off the membrane is given by the rate of growth divided by the sum of all rates out of that state.

At each oligomer size (in molecules), the pore formation process can be thought of as a choice, either the oligomer adds an additional monomer and grows, or it inserts to form a pore. The likelihood of each of these choices depends on how quickly the oligomer is growing in number of subunits, and how fast it is able to insert. The higher the solution concentration of PFO, the faster it will oligomerise, and the more likely it is to grow rather than insert. Conversely, the more subunits in the prepore, the faster it inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Mathematically, the probability of whether a prepore oligomer will grow, or insert, is given by the rate of oligomerisation (<italic>P c<sub>pfo</sub></italic>), or insertion (I<sub>0</sub> +n (I<sub>g0</sub> +<italic>c<sub>pfo</sub> I<sub>gc</sub></italic>)) respectively, divided by the sum of these two rates. This is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref> with growth probabilities coloured in Orange and insertion probabilities shown in Purple.</p><p>Overall, the probability that a pore will insert with a given number of subunits is then given by the product of the probabilities that the arc grew for all sizes less than the number of subunits at insertion before inserting at that number of subunits.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Janice L Robertson as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Nancy Carrasco as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ana J Garcia-Saez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found this to be an intriguing study, offering exquisite resolution into the complex reaction of perfringolysin O pore formation on membranes. However, all of the reviewers raised concerns about controls that are needed to interpret the data. It is anticipated that the following essential revisions can be reasonably addressed with further elaboration of the methods, revised analysis of the current data, or a limited number of control experiments. In general, the manuscript should also be revised to consider alternate interpretations of the data.</p><p>1) Mapping corrections between the co-localization fields. For co-localization of single-molecules, an experimental mapping correction is often performed in order to calculate the translational and magnification transformations that may be needed to map a pixel from one emission field to the other. This can be calculated using a sample that is known to contain co-localized molecules and imaged in both fields. Were experimental mapping corrections carried out in this study? In the following, it sounds that this mapping is carried out by the software: &quot;We then used a software developed for single-molecule localisation microscopy (Schnitzbauer et al., 2017) to detect and track AF647-PFO spots appearing and disappearing at the locations of individual liposomes.&quot; If this is the case, please elaborate on how this works and whether you have data confirming that this method provides an adequate correction.</p><p>2) Estimating the number of PFO molecules from intensities. Since the single-molecule intensities follow a broad distribution (Figure 2D), it is likely that any estimation of the number of PFOs from intensities will have a large uncertainty and will have to include consideration of different labeling probabilities. Along these lines, the PFO quantities should be reported as the raw AF647 intensities in the figures. A clear description of how the number estimations are calculated along with the uncertainty on these estimates can be included in the discussion, as these number values are rough estimations.</p><p>3) The effect of photobleaching. A main result of this work is that the dimer has a much higher association stability with the membrane than monomers. However, monomers and dimers were measured with widely different power intensities and at different frame rates. Hence, it should be absolutely clear to the reader that this observation does not simply reflect the different bleaching rates of the two different molecules. For example, the monomer was sampled with high wattage powers and at 17 frames per second (˜1000 per minute). The dimers are sampled at high wattage (how high?) and 3 frames per minute. Considering that the measured dwell time for monomers is 0.5 s, while the one for dimers is ˜20 min (or 1200 s), it follows that if the authors are measuring the bleaching of the molecule rather than the association of the molecules with the membranes, then there would actually be no difference between the association of monomers and dimers.</p><p>To address this, more evidence is required to show that what is being measured is association and not bleaching. Specifically, what is the bleaching rate of the dye under the experimental conditions? This could be easily measured for the dimer, as single-step intensity reductions of the fluorescence should provide information on bleaching. The authors might also consider using different dyes with different bleaching rates and compare the association rates. In addition, they say that the signal disappeared in one step, which is indicative of dissociation of the dimer from the membrane, rather than a photobleaching step (perhaps the authors should mention this). It is assumed that occasionally, the signal disappeared in two steps. Please indicate how many times a two-step process was observed. The kinetics of the two-step process can also be used to characterise the photobleaching time. Please indicate here how fast is photobleaching and how that compares with the dwell time of the monomer binding. Comparison of rates measured at different fluorescent power of frames per seconds might provide a quick way to establish what is measured here.</p><p>4) Possibility of multiple complexes on a single liposome. One weakness of the study is the inability to distinguish between one or more complexes simultaneously assembling in one liposome. It is unclear how one can distinguish whether the estimated PFO numbers reflect the stoichiometry of one oligomer and not multiple oligomers on one liposome? The continued growth would suggest that this cannot be distinguished. Are there any abrupt steps in the oligomerization process that could be attributed to additional pore structures growing from defined seeding points? The single-step dye loss was interpreted to mean that only one pore is likely to permeate the liposome (Pg. 6), with multi-step signals interpreted as being from multilamellar liposomes. While plausible, there is no clear evidence of this, and it remains possible that the multi-step increases are due to more than one pore forming in the liposome. To clarify this, it would be beneficial to measure the full width at half maximum of the AF647-PFO fluorescence intensity profiles on individual liposomes and plot them as a normal distribution. This would allow to exclude measurements with a full width at half maximum outside the population average (e.g. the 95th percentile of the distribution) which most likely correspond to liposomes containing more than on PFO complex. In addition, the paper requires revisions to consider the alternate possibility that the data reflect multiple pore forming reactions on the single liposomes.</p><p>5) Please address the recommendations raised by the reviewers below. These suggestions are directed at clarifying the manuscript and interpretation of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In Figure 1D, it will be useful to add examples of the &quot;single step&quot;, &quot;no step&quot;, and &quot;other&quot; traces directly in this main figure, as has been depicted in Figure 1 —figure supplement 3. Visualization of these representative traces is important to allow the reader to properly interpret the different behaviors.</p><p>2. In 2G, the super-resolution approach for PFO monomer binding appears to outline the liposome size quite well. Can you quantify the liposome size distribution based on this approach? Do you find that there is a significant amount of non-uniformity to indicate that your results may depend on liposome size?</p><p>3. Addition of uncertainty and statistical information. Much of the data presented lacks a description of the uncertainty or variability. For example, in the frequency/percentage bar plots, the binomial standard deviation could be used.

Revise the following paragraph on page 4 as this paper is no longer accompanying:</p><p>&quot;In an accompanying paper, Wallace and colleagues use single-molecule fluorescence tracking of PFO assembly on a droplet interface bilayer (Senior et al., 2021). These imaging studies support the insertion of incomplete arc-shaped membrane lesions, suggesting an alternative mechanism of pore formation that is distinct from the canonical prepore formation prior to insertion. This discrepancy raises the question as to when and how release of the membrane spanning regions is triggered, which cannot be correlated with key assembly steps using ensemble methods. Related to this matter, it is also unclear whether release and insertion of the membrane spanning regions from each of the subunits occurs in a concerted or sequential fashion.&quot;</p><p>5.

Furthermore, it is not clear how the authors can distinguish between the formation of conductive arc pores and full pores. Since it is only possible to observe a full liposome, all these species should have the same fluorescence properties. How can the authors know the number of subunits of a pore, considering that the fluorescent signal can only estimate the overall number of units in the membrane? How can the authors distinguish a full pore from two arcs?</p><p>4. Page 10. The authors argue that the arc pores with at least four subunits can form pores. How did they come to this conclusion? Only on the basis of fluorescence intensity? If that is the case, has photobleaching taken into account? The authors identified the oligomer-length specific insertion rates from the insertion times. However, it is not clear how this was done. The authors should either point to the methods where more details should be given, or explain more in detail how this was done (e.g. is the number of subunit estimated by the fluorescence intensity?).</p><p>5. The kinetic model (Figure 6B) also assumes that a monomer is added to a nucleated pore. However, since monomers are transient and dimers rather stable, would it make more sense that dimers are constantly formed from monomers and these structures move around the membrane until they meet each other and then form full pores? Would it also not be easier for a full pore to be formed from two arc pores?

The authors attribute the heterogeneous release profiles to heterogeneity in the liposome preparation. What about the stochastic nature of pore formation? That would also support the distributions observed between time of nucleation/poration.</p><p>2. The fluorescence signal of PFO on individual liposomes seems heterogeneous, which the authors attribute to differences in cholesterol distribution. However, the lipid composition is not expected to present phase separation. Could this be due to complex assembly on part of the liposome leading to heterogeneous distribution?

Please explain how the oligomerization rate by monomer addition before and after insertion can be the same.

While the authors nicely confirm that AF647-labelled PFO is functional and that the effect of self-quenching is small using different ratios of labelled to unlabeled PFO (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2), this analysis also revealed that a 100% ratio of labelled PFO is more active in perforating liposomes. While this effect can be caused by an underestimation of the amount of unlabeled protein (as the authors mention), they should also discuss the option that AF647-PFO is indeed more active due to possible structural alterations caused by the label.</p><p>7. The authors use photobleaching step counting of sparsely distributed AF647-PFO immobilized on glass coverslips to measure the reference monomer fluorescence intensity (as shown in Figure 1E and D). Considering that AF647-PFO has an estimated labeling efficiency of ~1.5 fluorophores/PFO, it would be beneficial to compare the population distribution of the determined monomer intensities (Figure 1E) to the intensity distribution measured for monomeric AF647 dye immobilized on glass.</p><p>8. In order to measure the oligomeric state of AF647-PFO at different time points in the liposomes, the authors determine the ratio of the fluorescence intensity associated with the liposome to the monomer fluorescence intensity derived from single photobleaching events. Given that not all PFO molecules are labelled with one single AF647 fluorophore (Figure 2E), the calculation of molecular units from fluorescence intensity is somewhat error prone. Labelling efficiency correction of the measured fluorescence intensities should be used to test if there is an influence of the labelling efficiency on the determined oligomeric state of AF647-PFO.</p><p>9. Considering the lipid composition of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (as a biological target for PFO pore formation), a concentration of 55% cholesterol seems very high. The authors should state in the manuscript why they chose the specific lipid mixture and how it might affect the mechanistic regulation of PFO (membrane binding, oligomerization, etc.) compared to the physiological scenario of the plasma membrane.</p><p>10. When discussing the possible explanations why PFO pores continue to grow over time with wit a membrane insertion rate increasing with concentration, the authors should also discuss the effect of continuous protein insertion on the physical properties of a toroidal pore. Increasing number of protein molecules inserted in a membrane increase the membrane tension and at the same time decrease the line tension at the pore rim both promoting the stabilization of an open pore.</p><p>11. In this line, the authors should also include a figure showing the oligomerization characteristics of PFO (as in Figure 4 B) beyond the expected number of molecules required to form a full pore ring until the oligomerization reaches saturation. The possible explanation for the continuous increase in the number of PFO molecules that &quot;eventually multiple pores form&quot; (page 6) is contradictory to the valid assumption made later that an existing PFO oligomer in the liposome &quot;acts as a sink for monomers&quot; (page 12) that newly bind to the membrane.</p><p>12.

For co-localization of single-molecules, an experimental mapping correction is often performed in order to calculate the translational and magnification transformations that may be needed to map a pixel from one emission field to the other. This can be calculated using a sample that is known to contain co-localized molecules and imaged in both fields. Were experimental mapping corrections carried out in this study? In the following, it sounds that this mapping is carried out by the software: &quot;We then used a software developed for single-molecule localisation microscopy (Schnitzbauer et al., 2017) to detect and track AF647-PFO spots appearing and disappearing at the locations of individual liposomes.&quot; If this is the case, please elaborate on how this works and whether you have data confirming that this method provides an adequate correction.</p></disp-quote><p>A.

Since the single-molecule intensities follow a broad distribution (Figure 2D), it is likely that any estimation of the number of PFOs from intensities will have a large uncertainty and will have to include consideration of different labeling probabilities. Along these lines, the PFO quantities should be reported as the raw AF647 intensities in the figures.

To do this, we imaged PFO binding to liposomes at a fast frame rate and with high laser intensity to observe individual molecules binding to the oligomer. The AF647-PFO intensity trace was then fitted with a step function to identify incoming PFO molecules. These experiments provided intensity-independent estimates of the oligomerization rate, the number of PFO monomers in the oligomer at the time of membrane insertion (detected via dye release) and the fraction of oligomers that reach the requisite number of subunits to insert as closed rings. The values for these parameters obtained by intensity calibration in Figure 4C and Figure 6C/D are within a factor of 1.5 or better to the values obtained by step fitting. We have described the new analysis based on step fitting to detect the arrival of single molecules in the Results section (page 9 and page 12), the Methods section and added the data as Supplementary Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Results (pg 9, pg 12)</p><p>PFO dimerisation on the membrane nucleates a stably growing oligomer “Finally, we validated the oligomerisation rate by directly observing the arrival of AF647-PFO monomers using single molecule imaging conditions, which yielded a value of 0.15±0.04 nM-1 s<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).

Frame rates were as follows (frames per second, FPS): 100 pM, 1/9 FPS; 200 pM, 1/4.5 FPS; 300 pM, 1/3 FPS; 400 pM, 1/2.5 FPS; 500 pM, 1/2 FPS. Step fitting of the AF647-PFO traces was performed using change point analysis in Matlab with a threshold of 3x105. The x/y-positions of AF647-PFO oligomers diffusing on liposomes were calculated using Picasso Localize (box size 9, minimum net gradient 800). Image stacks in both channels were corrected for stage drift using the cross-correlation calculated from the dye contents channel in JIM. The clusters of x/y-localisations of AF647-PFO oligomers detected using Picasso were aligned with the regions of interest of liposomes in the dye channel in JIM to generate dual-colour traces.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effect of photobleaching. A main result of this work is that the dimer has a much higher association stability with the membrane than monomers. However, monomers and dimers were measured with widely different power intensities and at different frame rates. Hence, it should be absolutely clear to the reader that this observation does not simply reflect the different bleaching rates of the two different molecules. For example, the monomer was sampled with high wattage powers and at 17 frames per second (˜1000 per minute). The dimers are sampled at high wattage (how high?) and 3 frames per minute. Considering that the measured dwell time for monomers is 0.5 s, while the one for dimers is ˜20 min (or 1200 s), it follows that if the authors are measuring the bleaching of the molecule rather than the association of the molecules with the membranes, then there would actually be no difference between the association of monomers and dimers.</p><p>To address this, more evidence is required to show that what is being measured is association and not bleaching. Specifically, what is the bleaching rate of the dye under the experimental conditions? This could be easily measured for the dimer, as single-step intensity reductions of the fluorescence should provide information on bleaching. The authors might also consider using different dyes with different bleaching rates and compare the association rates. In addition, they say that the signal disappeared in one step, which is indicative of dissociation of the dimer from the membrane, rather than a photobleaching step (perhaps the authors should mention this). It is assumed that occasionally, the signal disappeared in two steps. Please indicate how many times a two-step process was observed. The kinetics of the two-step process can also be used to characterise the photobleaching time. Please indicate here how fast is photobleaching and how that compares with the dwell time of the monomer binding. Comparison of rates measured at different fluorescent power of frames per seconds might provide a quick way to establish what is measured here.</p></disp-quote><p>What is the laser power used for imaging dimers on membranes?</p><p>The nominal laser power is 100 mW for monomers and 3 mW for dimers. These values are stated in the Methods section.</p><p>What is the bleaching rate in the experiments and how does it compare to the rate of monomer release?</p><p>We have performed the additional control experiments suggested by the reviewers to show that monomer unbinding is not the result of photobleaching and that we have correctly compensated for photobleaching. This analysis has been added as Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><p>1. Single-molecule photobleaching experiments at a range of laser powers (Figure 2—figure supplement3A-C) show that the bleaching rate (panel B) and the single-molecule intensity (panel C) is proportional to the laser power.</p><p>2. We performed single-molecule AF647-PFO binding experiments at a range of laser powers (Figure2—figure supplement 3D/E) and corrected the rate of signal disappearance at each laser by the corresponding photobleaching rate determined above.

One weakness of the study is the inability to distinguish between one or more complexes simultaneously assembling in one liposome. It is unclear how one can distinguish whether the estimated PFO numbers reflect the stoichiometry of one oligomer and not multiple oligomers on one liposome? The continued growth would suggest that this cannot be distinguished. Are there any abrupt steps in the oligomerization process that could be attributed to additional pore structures growing from defined seeding points? The single-step dye loss was interpreted to mean that only one pore is likely to permeate the liposome (Pg. 6), with multi-step signals interpreted as being from multilamellar liposomes. While plausible, there is no clear evidence of this, and it remains possible that the multi-step increases are due to more than one pore forming in the liposome. To clarify this, it would be beneficial to measure the full width at half maximum of the AF647-PFO fluorescence intensity profiles on individual liposomes and plot them as a normal distribution. This would allow to exclude measurements with a full width at half maximum outside the population average (e.g. the 95th percentile of the distribution) which most likely correspond to liposomes containing more than on PFO complex. In addition, the paper requires revisions to consider the alternate possibility that the data reflect multiple pore forming reactions on the single liposomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Are there features in the AF647-PFO traces that could be attributed to nucleation of additional pores?</p><p>The image acquisition settings for these experiments were optimised for measuring the kinetics between nucleation and pore opening and we prefer not to interpret trends in the data beyond this range with respect to the timing of new nucleation events. Instead, reliable detection of new nucleation events would require different settings and/or complementary approaches such as imaging on flat bilayers. Please see response to point #11 from reviewer #3 for more details.</p><p>Could multi-step traces arise from the opening of multiple pores on the same liposome?</p><p>No. We have simulated dye release via diffusion through pores using FEM modelling, showing that the dye is completely released on a time scale (0.1–1 ms) well below the temporal resolution of our measurements (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Thus, opening of the first membrane is expected to lead to release of the entire dye contents in a single frame. Please see response to point #1 from reviewer #3 for more details.</p><p>Consider the possibility that the data reflect multiple pore forming reactions on the single liposomes.</p><p>The experimental approach using liposomes is particularly suited to measure the early stages of the first pore nucleating on the liposome and we agree that it is difficult to distinguish the nucleation of additional independent oligomers that may occur at later stages of the process. We have added new experiments and theoretical considerations to address this question (see below). We have also modified the Discussion to better highlight the limitations of our study with respect to identifying additional nucleations.</p><p>Discussion (pg 16/17)</p><p>“Limitations of our approach include the following. Unlike measurements on flat membranes, we cannot resolve separate molecules or complexes on the same liposome due to the diffraction limit. While biochemical characterisation and AFM imaging of PFPs is typically carried out in the nM range, we limited the concentrations used in this study to the pM range to enhance the probability of observing the growth of a single complex per liposome. This is initially borne out in the data: The oligomerisation rate remains constant (Figure 4B) instead of increasing (as would be expected for multiple oligomers) and the movement of the fluorescent complex on the membrane drops in a single step upon membrane insertion (Figure 7C). Nevertheless, the fluorescence signal ultimately exceeds the levels expected for a single ring-shaped pore, suggesting that additional oligomer eventually nucleate in the liposome, whereby it remains unclear when this second nucleation event occurs. Thus, we cannot rule out the simultaneous growth of more than one oligomer, especially during later stages of the experiment. Further experiments are required to pinpoint exactly when additional oligomer appear, e.g. using conditions that are optimised to detect new nucleation events or complementary approaches such as single-particle tracking on flat bilayers.</p><p>Another limitation is that non-specific labelling of PFO (resulting in a heterogeneous sample of labelled species), as well as possible fluorescence artefacts, limit the precision with which we can determine the number of subunits in PFO oligomers. For validation, we determined the oligomerisation rate and number of subunits in the oligomer at the time of pore opening by detecting and counting individual PFO monomers joining the growing oligomer. This intensity-independent analysis yielded essentially the same values as the quantification based on intensity.”</p><p>New experiments to test for the simultaneous growth of two (or more) independent PFO oligomers.</p><p>To further test whether multiple PFO oligomers are present on the liposome at the time of insertion, we have performed additional PFO binding/dye release TIRF experiments in which we track the movement of the AF647-PFO signal between frames. These experiments show a sudden decrease of movement that coincides with dye release. This observation is consistent with the insertion (and concomitant decrease in diffusion) of a PFO oligomer that dominates the fluorescence signal. These experiments are shown in a new Figure 7 and are described in the Results section.</p><p>Results (pg 13)</p><p>Pore opening coincides with a drop in PFO oligomer movement on the membrane</p><p>“Membrane insertion leads to a drastic reduction of the diffusion rate of CDC complexes on the surface of flat membranes (Senior et al., 2021); (Leung et al., 2014). To determine whether the same effect could be observed on liposomes, we imaged PFO assembly and pore formation assay with high laser intensity to accurately localise the position (projected onto the x/y-plane) of growing PFO oligomers on liposomes over time with sub-pixel resolution. The example trace in Figure 7A shows that the frame-to-frame movements of the AF647-PFO signal initially fluctuated between 0–300 nm (Figure 7A). Pore opening (detected by dye release) led to a pronounced drop in movement (Figure 7A after 7.5 minutes). This reduction in movement is also evident in the map of all x/y-localisations. Localisations appeared as a diffuse point cloud with approximately the same size as the liposome (Figure 7B top left versus bottom right), and formed a tight focus upon dye release.</p><p>Experiments conducted at 100–500 pM AF647-PFO showed that oligomers on 85% of liposomes showed a reduction of ~41% in movement across the entire concentration range, which occurred in a stepwise fashion upon dye release (Figure 7C-E). We conclude that most liposomes contain a fluorescent species that dominates the point spread functions and becomes less mobile from one frame to the next, consistent with a single oligomer becoming less diffusive upon insertion into the membrane.”</p><p>Theoretical considerations to estimate the probability for nucleation of a second PFO oligomer.</p><p>A key question for interpreting the continuing increase of the AF647-PFO intensity after insertion is whether a second PFO oligomer is likely to nucleate on the liposome when an actively growing oligomer is already present on the membrane. To address this question, we have calculated the probability of a second dimer forming on the membrane before insertion of the first oligomer (new Figure 6—figure supplement 5C). This analysis shows that in the lower end of the concentration range, the majority of liposomes contain only a single actively growing oligomer before insertion happens. Notably, this calculation is based on the assumption that dimers do not join the growing oligomer, i.e. the probability would be considerably lower if joining of dimers and oligomers can occur (please see response to point #2 from reviewer #2 for further discussion).</p><p>Results (pg 13)</p><p>“Finally, we calculated the upper limit for the probability of nucleating a second dimer on a liposome before insertion of the growing PFO oligomer (Figure 6—figure supplement 5). This analysis showed that the majority of liposomes are predicted to contain a single oligomer at the time of dye release at concentrations ≤100 nM, but nucleation of a new dimer become probable at higher concentrations (note that this dimer may not form an independently growing oligomer but could join the first oligomer).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please address the recommendations raised by the reviewers below.

The experimentally measured rate for the signal increase after nucleation is 6–20 times faster than dimerisation within the concentration range of our experiments (shown in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 5A and B).

Furthermore, it is not clear how the authors can distinguish between the formation of conductive arc pores and full pores.

The authors argue that the arc pores with at least four subunits can form pores. How did they come to this conclusion? Only on the basis of fluorescence intensity?

The kinetic model (Figure 6B) also assumes that a monomer is added to a nucleated pore. However, since monomers are transient and dimers rather stable, would it make more sense that dimers are constantly formed from monomers and these structures move around the membrane until they meet each other and then form full pores? Would it also not be easier for a full pore to be formed from two arc pores?

The authors attribute the heterogeneous release profiles to heterogeneity in the liposome preparation. What about the stochastic nature of pore formation? That would also support the distributions observed between time of nucleation/poration.</p></disp-quote><p>Stochasticity/time distributions:</p><p>We absolutely agree that the pore formation process is inherently stochastic. Indeed, that is what necessitates studying the pore formation pathway at the single-molecule level, as each pore does not undergo the same process at the same time. As the reviewer points out, this dephasing leads to the distributions of times between different steps in the pathway.</p><p>Heterogeneous (multi-step) dye release profiles:</p><p>In addition to heterogeneity in the liposome preparation, multi-step dye release profiles could possibly arise if pore opening is transient, releasing only part of the dye before the membrane reseals. This would require the lifetime of the transient pore to be shorter than the time required for dye release. To get an understanding of the time scales involved in this process, we have simulated dye release via diffusion through pores of different diameters using FEM modelling. This analysis shows that dye release occurs on time scales of 100 μs to ~1 ms for pores with diameters between 35 nm and 2.5 nm. We have added the simulation of dye release as Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and added a sentence to the Results section (pg 6) referring to this new Figure.</p><p>Results (pg 6)</p><p>“For example, aggregated liposomes and multilamellar liposomes would be expected to give rise to traces with multiple steps or partial release of dye.

The fluorescence signal of PFO on individual liposomes seems heterogeneous, which the authors attribute to differences in cholesterol distribution. However, the lipid composition is not expected to present phase separation. Could this be due to complex assembly on part of the liposome leading to heterogeneous distribution? Otherwise, the authors might test their hypothesis of inhomogeneous cholesterol distribution by fluorescence microscopy on giant unilamellar vesicles or lipid bilayers containing a lipophilic dye.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

The relevant section (pg 7) has been rewritten to reflect this:</p><p>Results (pg 7)</p><p>“Interestingly, many liposomes displayed bright spots in the reconstruction images suggesting that liposome membranes may have a spatially inhomogeneous affinity for binding PFO, but the underlying mechanism for this observation remains unclear.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Please explain how the oligomerization rate by monomer addition before and after insertion can be the same. One would expect that the energetics of the interactions of the monomers with the non-inserted and inserted oligomers would differ. This part of the model is not very convincing yet and requires elaboration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that addition of monomers to PFO oligomers post insertion requires further investigation to validate this finding and to identify the interactions that drive this process. One possible model to explain the observation that oligomerisation rates are the same before and after insertion is that oligomerisation is effectively a diffusion-controlled reaction. That is to say, the rate-limiting step in oligomerisation is a monomer diffusing close enough to the end of an arc to interact. If this is the case, then the difference in binding affinity of a monomer with an oligomer before and after insertion would have little impact on the observed oligomerisation rate. This scenario is plausible given the tight binding of monomers adding to a growing oligomer and the very low concentrations used in this study. We have not included this model in the paper as it is highly speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Do the complete rings continue to grow indefinitely? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Complete rings are stable structures and do not continue to grow. Our data nevertheless suggest that PFO can accumulate on liposomes after the number of subunits required to form a complete ring has been reached. This continued increase in PFO signal is likely due to the growth of an additional PFO oligomer on the same liposome; please see also our response to point #11 from this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. While the authors nicely confirm that AF647-labelled PFO is functional and that the effect of self-quenching is small using different ratios of labelled to unlabeled PFO (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2), this analysis also revealed that a 100% ratio of labelled PFO is more active in perforating liposomes. While this effect can be caused by an underestimation of the amount of unlabeled protein (as the authors mention), they should also discuss the option that AF647-PFO is indeed more active due to possible structural alterations caused by the label.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevant section in the figure legend now reads:</p><p>“The slight increase in the rate of poration in the 100% labelled sample (maroon curve) in comparison to lower labelled percentage samples suggests that the actual concentration of the labelled sample may be slightly higher than the unlabelled sample.

Regardless, the activity of all samples is reasonably similar and we conclude that the labelled PFO is functional.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors use photobleaching step counting of sparsely distributed AF647-PFO immobilized on glass coverslips to measure the reference monomer fluorescence intensity (as shown in Figure 1E and D). Considering that AF647-PFO has an estimated labeling efficiency of ~1.5 fluorophores/PFO, it would be beneficial to compare the population distribution of the determined monomer intensities (Figure 1E) to the intensity distribution measured for monomeric AF647 dye immobilized on glass.</p></disp-quote><p>We analysed the first frame from photobleaching experiments with Picasso using the same parameters as in the liposome binding experiments, which should equally account for labelling efficiency. This is the distribution shown in Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In order to measure the oligomeric state of AF647-PFO at different time points in the liposomes, the authors determine the ratio of the fluorescence intensity associated with the liposome to the monomer fluorescence intensity derived from single photobleaching events. Given that not all PFO molecules are labelled with one single AF647 fluorophore (Figure 2E), the calculation of molecular units from fluorescence intensity is somewhat error prone. Labelling efficiency correction of the measured fluorescence intensities should be used to test if there is an influence of the labelling efficiency on the determined oligomeric state of AF647-PFO.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to point #2 of the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Considering the lipid composition of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (as a biological target for PFO pore formation), a concentration of 55% cholesterol seems very high.

When discussing the possible explanations why PFO pores continue to grow over time with wit a membrane insertion rate increasing with concentration, the authors should also discuss the effect of continuous protein insertion on the physical properties of a toroidal pore.

In this line, the authors should also include a figure showing the oligomerization characteristics of PFO (as in Figure 4 B) beyond the expected number of molecules required to form a full pore ring until the oligomerization reaches saturation.
