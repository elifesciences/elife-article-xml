be a previously unappreciated source of genome instability, but the extent to which this happens in any animal in vivo remains unknown. We consider an in vivo system where the adult stem cells of planarian flatworms are required to migrate to a distal wound site. We observe a relationship between adult stem cell migration and ongoing DNA damage and repair during tissue regeneration. Migrating planarian stem cells undergo changes in nuclear shape and exhibit increased levels of DNA damage. Increased DNA damage levels reduce once stem cells reach the wound site. Stem cells in which DNA damage is induced prior to wounding take longer to initiate migration and migrating stem cell populations are more sensitive to further DNA damage than stationary stem cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of DNA repair pathway components blocks normal stem cell migration, confirming that active DNA repair pathways are required to allow successful migration to a distal wound site. Together these findings provide evidence that levels of migration-coupled-DNA-damage are significant in adult stem cells and that ongoing migration requires DNA repair mechanisms. Our findings reveal that migration of normal stem cells in vivo represents an unappreciated source of damage, which could be a significant source of mutations in animals during development or during long-term tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

integrity by both exogenous and endogenous agents has led to the evolution of cellular mechanisms to counteract various forms of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoeijmakers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>). Accumulated genotoxic damage, particularly in stem cells, is thought to underpin both ageing and the development of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vitale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mandal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodell and Rando, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>). Therefore, maintaining the integrity of the genome is particularly important for longer-lived animals with adult stem cells. We know that efficient DNA repair mechanisms to counteract the effects of replicative stress and other sources of damage are central to avoiding both premature ageing and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeggo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sperka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2015</xref>). Recent in vitro studies using cancer cell lines, dendritic cells, as well as primary stem cells have shown that migration through micro capillaries or extreme constrictions imparts mechanical stress on nuclei, and this can be a source of DNA damage and genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irianto et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nader, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shah, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby and Lammerding, 2018</xref>). These studies reveal an assortment of mechanisms by which mechanical stress results in DNA damage. This damage can be either repaired in a regulated manner or cells may undergo differentiation after being reimplanted into animals after in vitro manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). However, evidence of damage caused by purely in vivo adult stem cell migration and whether it is a significant load to DNA repair mechanisms is currently conspicuously absent. If migrating cells, in particular stem cells, experience DNA damage in vivo, this has a number of broad implications for metazoan development and homeostasis. For example, migrating stem cells may experience aberrant effects on stem cell differentiation, become transformed to cause malignancies, or become senescent and contribute to ageing all as a result of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). As a corollary of this, we would expect that active DNA repair mechanisms might be required to allow continued cell migration in vivo.</p><p>However, it is not known whether migration and damage are associated in vivo in normal adult stem cells, as to this point cells have been manipulated to experience migration through artificial constrictions in vitro. To address this, we have improved on existing methods to study DNA damage and repair (DDR) processes in the highly regenerative animal <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>, focusing on the observation of migrating adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guedelhoefer and Sánchez Alvarado, 2012</xref>). We used an established assay in which migrating stem cells can be observed and with which we previously established that stem cells home precisely to wounds, form cell extensions when migrating, and require the transcription factors snail and zeb1, which regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition, for migration. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guedelhoefer and Sánchez Alvarado, 2012</xref>). Investigating the DNA damage response in this context, we found that the adult stem cell population displays increased levels of DNA damage as they migrate towards a distal wound site and repair this damage when they reach the wound site. We demonstrate that both the repair of DNA damage and active DNA repair mechanisms are required to allow directed stem cell migration to a wound site. Overall, our data find in vivo evidence for the link between cell migration and DNA damage and suggest that a reconsideration of the significance of migratory events across development and adult homeostasis in the context of potential DNA damage is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A robust DNA damage response allows stem cells to resist doses up to 15 Gy of ionising radiation</title><p>Planarian flatworms have a population of pluripotent adult stem cells, and potentially avoid both ageing and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sahu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rink, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>).

Planarian stem cells and their progeny must migrate to the site of a wound or during reproductive (asexual) fission to form a regenerative blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>). Recent work using cells in culture has shown that mechanical stress on the cell nucleus, through a variety of proposed mechanisms, can lead to DNA damage and genome instability during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shah, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lomakin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irianto et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>). However, how important this is generally in vivo in animals is unknown. To study this phenomenon in planarians, despite the lack of live-cell imaging approaches, we established a robust assay for stem cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>). This uses a lead shield to perform ‘shielded irradiation’ and obtain a stripe of stem cells whose subsequent migration can be followed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Head amputation triggers anterior migration from the shielded strip of stem cells towards the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and a lack of posterior cell migration over the experimental time course allows us to clearly define the posterior and therefore the pre-migration anterior boundary of the shield. This system has already allowed the detailed study of planarian stem cell migration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>), for example demonstrating that migrating stem cells develop cytoplasmic projections, precisely home to small ‘poke’ wound sites and require the activity of transcription factors with conserved roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transition.</p><p>Using this assay, we asked if normal stem cell migration in vivo leads to increased DNA damage.

In order to check nuclear shape plasticity in migrating cells compare to stationary cells, we measured the nuclear aspect ratio (NAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) of the cells in the migratory region compared to stationary cells at 7 day post-amputation and observed significant changes in NAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

Similarly, post-mitotic TUD1<sup>−</sup> cells (i.e. not stem cells) that are also present in the migratory region and wounded region environment have lower levels of detectable DNA damage than migrating stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that migrating adult stem cells, which have increased NARs capable of inducing DNA damage, experience ongoing DNA damage events while they migrate and until they reach the wound site and stop migrating.</p><p>While PAR staining measures an acute regulatory response to repair new damage, a COMET assay measures global levels of DNA breaks. To further validate that the increased DNA damage observed in stem cells in the migratory region, we performed COMET assays on cells in the shielded and migratory regions of the migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We used both intact animals (no migration of stem cells) and animals at 7 days post-amputation (wounded, where stem cell migration is induced). This allowed direct comparison of cell populations from the migratory regions with and without migrating stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

These experiments revealed that the levels of COMET were increased in migratory regions containing stem cells compared to migratory regions from intact animals that are devoid of stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). We conclude that migrating stem cells have increased levels of DNA strand breaks while they migrate. These experiments provide an independent measure of DNA damage and also show that migrating stem cells have increased levels of DNA damage.</p><p>Overall, these experiments to measure NAR, levels of nuclear PAR, and levels of COMET signal demonstrate planarian stem cells undergo migration-coupled-DNA-damage (MCDD) in vivo. Multiple factors have been shown to lead to increased DNA damage, for example nuclear deformation including changes in the localised concentration of DNA repair factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>) or due to increased replication fork stalling without any disruption of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shah, 2020</xref>). A reasonable assumption based on our data and in vitro studies suggests that the change in nuclear shape during migration is connected to increased DNA damage in planarian stem cells. While further work requiring the ability to manipulate planarian cells in vitro and perform live imaging will be needed to demonstrate this link more directly, we nonetheless found that stem cell migration in vivo leads to DNA damage in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Stem cells pre-loaded with DNA damage incur a delay in migration</title><p>We wished to understand whether stem cells in planarians continue to migrate irrespective of DNA damage or whether they repair damage during this process. We hypothesised that stem cells with accumulated DNA damage might pause to remove the source of damage while repairing damage, and then migrate once again. In order to understand, whether the presence of DNA damage acts to inhibit active stem cell migration in vivo, we pre-irradiated whole worms with 5 and 10 Gy IR before following stem cell migratory behaviour in the shielded irradiation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In these experiments, cells in the shielded region have incurred IR-induced DNA damage. We amputated animals to induce migration within 24 hr to trigger stem cell migration while we knew that DNA damage is still present in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We observed that pre-irradiated stem cells undergo a significant delay in migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Although there is a significant delay in migration, stem cells eventually reach the wound site, maintain normal stem cell numbers, and fuel normal regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest a relationship between active migration and levels of DNA damage, with increased levels of damage inhibiting active migration until sufficiently repaired. However, irradiation in this experiment also leads to reduction in cell density and cell proliferation in the shield post-IR exposure, and we cannot exclude that the observed delay in migration may be impart due to these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeifer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>DNA damage delays migration and migrating stem cells with MCDD are more sensitive to ionising radiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme showing worms pre-exposed to irradiation (5 and 10 Gy) followed by a shielded irradiation and amputation after 24 hr.

If this were the case, it would demonstrate that the increased damage observed during migration is a significant load on the repair machinery. In addition to performing shielded irradiation, the worms were given an additional dose of 5 Gy to the whole animal at 7 days post-amputation (dpa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), a time point when the highest number stem cells are actively migrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>) and when the cells have highest levels of MCDD as measured by levels of nuclear PAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We observed a significant decrease in stem cell survival in the migratory region after 5 Gy IR compared to stationary stem cells in the shield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–M</xref>), demonstrating that migrating stem cells with MCDD are more sensitive to irradiation than stationary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We also found that those cells that had migrated furthest, but had not yet reached the wound site, were the most sensitive to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), suggesting that the accumulation of MCDD may, on average, increase with migratory distance from the wound. We did not observe this striking difference earlier in the migratory process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–J</xref>) when cells have just started migrating in response to wounding, or when cells had already reached the wound site, and migration was complete and MCDD has been repaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K–P</xref>). This demonstrates that increased radiation sensitivity correlates with increased acute levels of DNA damage, dependent on the extent of active stem cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Wound-induced stem cell migration requires active DNA repair mechanisms to resolve ongoing MCDD</title><p>We next asked whether active DNA repair pathways are a functional requirement for continued stem cell migration as they are for recovery from non-lethal doses of IR exposure.

The significant reduction in the distance migrated by stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) supports a role for active ongoing DNA repair in maintaining genomic integrity during migration and allowing migration to proceed in the face of ongoing damage to the genome. Migrating stem cells incur DNA damage and then either die or differentiate in the context of DDR component knockdowns, similar to the effects of IR exposure. This is supported by the finding that a dose of 5 Gy, which usually removes 40–50% of stationary stem cells after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E–M</xref>), is sufficient to remove over 80% of migrating stem cells.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Wound-induced stem cell migration requires active DNA repair mechanisms to resolve ongoing MCDD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme to study the role of DDR genes in stem cell migration.

In the absence of fully functioning DDR machinery, planarian adult stem cells fail to migrate to the wound site in the shielded irradiation assay. Our findings confirm that migration leads to DNA damage in vivo in normal stem cells and, in the light of earlier in vitro findings in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irianto et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nader, 2020</xref>) and mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2019</xref>), may represent an evolutionarily conserved cost of this process. An ever growing number of studies using cells in culture or cells constricted in vitro and reimplanted into animals tissues suggest that cell migration mechanically impacts cell nuclei, with effects from complete nuclear rupture at one extreme to moderate nuclear deformation at the other, all leading to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoeijmakers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shah, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby and Lammerding, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vitale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lomakin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irianto et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mandal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Earle et al., 2020</xref>). We provide evidence of how adult stem cell migration can lead to DNA damage in vivo, thereby providing a physiological relevance to the relationship between cell migration and DNA damage of normal stem cells within a whole organism. Bringing our observations together, we propose a model where migrating cells go through a ‘migration–damage–repair–migration’ cycle as they move towards the wound site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><p>Both ageing and oncogenic phenotypes that are commonly thought to be caused by mutations due to replicative stress may also result from genome instability incurred during cell migration.

used in this study. The culture was maintained in 0.5% instant ocean solution (which we have referred to as planarian water in this paper) and fed with organic calf liver twice a week. Planarians were starved for 7 days prior to each experiment and also throughout the duration of each experiment and cultured in the dark at 20°C.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Gene cloning and RNAi</title><p>The sequences of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> RAD51 and BRCA2 were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peiris et al., 2016</xref>). Planarian DDR genes were identified by BLAST searches against the Planmine database, leading to the identification of full-length mRNA transcripts (details in key resources table). Fragments of these genes were cloned into the pPR-T4P plasmid vector containing opposable T7 promoters (kind gift from Jochen Rink, MPI Dresden). These clones were used for in vitro transcription to synthesise dsRNA and RNA probes as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>. dsRNA was delivered via microinjection using Nanoject II apparatus (Drummond Scientific) with 3.5’’ Drummond Scientific (Harvard Apparatus) glass capillaries pulled into fine needles on a Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (Patterson Scientific). Worms were injected with 3 × 32 nl of dsRNA six times over 2 weeks. A 1 day gap was kept between the last injection and irradiation experiments (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>). The primers used for amplification of DNA for dsRNA synthesis/RNA probes can be found in key resources table. Identification of orthologous genes across animal species was done using the Inparanoid database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Brien et al., 2005</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi">http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi</ext-link>) and EggNOG database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huerta-Cepas et al., 2019</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eggnogdb.embl.de">http://eggnogdb.embl.de</ext-link>). The phylogenetic tree is based on that presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grohme et al., 2018</xref>. We also used reciprocal blastp result against the nr database and tblastn result against each sequence. The Planmine database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rozanski et al., 2019</xref>) was used for the identification of sequences of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and other flatworm species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Gamma irradiation</title><p>Animals were starved for at least 7 days and exposed to 1.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 Gy of 137 Cs gamma rays (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) using a GSR D1 Gsm (Gamma-Service Medical GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) gamma irradiator at a dose rate of 1.9 Gy/min. This device was also used to apply doses to whole worms before or after shielded irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Shielded irradiation assay</title><p>Shielded irradiation was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>). Worms (3–5 mm) were anesthetised in ice-cold 0.2% chloretone and aligned on 60 mm Petri dish. The Petri dish was pre-marked with a line at the bottom according to the dimension of the shield (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The anterior tips of individual worms were aligned to keep the absolute migratory distance between the tip of head and the shielded region fixed. The Petri dish containing worms was then placed directly on top of the lead shield and irradiated from below with X-rays (225 kV, 0.5 mm AI filter, 23 Gy/min). The head and tail regions of the worms received 30 Gy, while the shielded region received less than 1.5 Gy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Immediately following irradiation, the worms were placed into fresh planarian water and cultured in the dark at 20°C. For experiments involving an initial dose of gamma irradiation, worms were incubated for 15 min in planarian water before being used for shielded irradiation assay (Experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Heads were amputated 4 days post-shielded irradiation to induce migration towards the wound (considered as 0 day post-amputation [dpa] or modified as necessary for a particular experiment [e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A]</xref>). Lack of posterior cell migration in the absence of a posterior wounds allowed us to define the boundary of the shield and measure the distance migrated by stem cells in whole mount samples as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abnave et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>COMET assay in planarians</title><p>Frosted microscope slides were coated with 700 μl of 1% normal-melting-point agarose (NMPA) in 1× PBS to make a uniform layer and dried overnight at 55°C. Worm fragments were gently diced to minimise any mechanical stress to the cells. The tissue pieces were digested using Papain (15 U/ml) for 1 hr at 25°C. Pieces were mechanically dissociated using a P1000 pipette to form a single-cell suspension and filtered through 100 μm and then 35 μm cell strainers (BD Falcon). Ten thousand dissociated single cells were re-suspended in 80 μl of CMFHE<sup>2+</sup>, and an equal amount of 1.5% low-melting-point agarose was added and mixed. Forty microlitres of the cell-agarose suspension was added onto an NMPA-coated slide and allowed to solidify at 4°C. Slides were incubated overnight (~15 hr) in a coplin jar at 4°C with lysing solution ([2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM trizma base, NaOH added to pH 10.0] and freshly added 1% triton x-100). This solution was then replaced with a neutralisation buffer (0.4 M Tris base in dH<sub>2</sub>O, pH to 7.5) for 15 min at 4°C. Following this, the neutralisation buffer was then removed, and the slides were placed into an electrophoresis chamber at 4°C filled with freshly prepared 1× electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA in dH<sub>2</sub>O) at 4°C. The slides were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min followed by an alkaline electrophoresis at 20 V for 20 min at 4°C. Next, slides were transferred back into the coplin jar and equilibrated for 5 min in neutralisation buffer. The slides were stained with SYBR Green I (1:10,000 dilution) in freshly prepared 1× TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). For long-term storage, the slides were fixed with cold 100% ethanol for 5 min and dried. After drying, 50 comets per slides were analysed using KOMET software (Andor), and the percentage of tail DNA was measured after different doses of gamma irradiation or from ‘shielded’ regions or ‘migrating’ regions both with and without migrating stem cells (i.e. with or without wounding). The shielded and unshielded areas were amputated away from each other based on visual estimation. In order to estimate the accuracy of the dissected areas, we performed Comet assay or <italic>smedwi-</italic>FISH on the same animals, such that if a piece (shielded) is used for Comet assay, then the corresponding part (unshielded migratory) is used for <italic>smedwi-1</italic> FISH to assure the accuracy of amputation.</p><p>Each FISH was performed in three replicates (InM1, InM2, InM3) with three worms per batch (‘In’ or ‘Wo’ corresponding to <underline>In</underline>tact or <underline>Wo</underline>unded. ‘M’ and ‘S’ corresponds to <underline>M</underline>igratory tissue or <underline>S</underline>hielded tissue). The corresponding tissues from these worms were pooled by experimental groups for use in the COMET assay. Individual replicates were analyzed for the presence of <italic>smedwi-1</italic> cells to confirm the accuracy of separating shielded vs unshielded areas.</p><p>For comet assay, cells were embedded into four to six slides/replicate, and 50 comets were randomly scored from each slide to a total of 200–300 comets analyzed per condition per replicate. Each of these replicates are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–G</xref>, with the detailed schematic on the experimental plan and subsequent analysis.</p><p>The extensive DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis does not show comet-like structures; hence, comet tails are representative of DNA breaks in remaining cells. Fragmented DNA in an apoptotic nuclei is very small (size of a nucleosome oligomer) and would generally disappears completely by diffusion in the gel during lysis and/or electrophoresis and are mostly seen as diffuse spheroid or like a halo around the nucleoid-head in comet images and does not show a structure that resembles comet-tail.

The worms were then washed in PBSTx (0.3% triton-X) and dehydrated with an increasing gradient of methanol washes and stored at −20°C. The following day worms were re-hydrated with a decreasing gradient of methanol and PBS, Xylene washes (two washes of 7 min each) and placed in molten paraffin for 1 hr. Individual worms were then aligned (sagittal or transverse) in paraffin moulds, trimmed, and sliced into 10 μm sections using a microtome. Individual ribbons of planarian sections were placed in a 37°C water bath and aligned to have the entire worm on each poly-lysine-coated slide.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Immunostaining on paraffinised sections</title><p>Planarian sections were deparaffinised using xylene substitute (two washes of 7 min each) and washed with PBS-Tx0.3 (0.3% triton-X). The sections were subjected to antigen retrieval with Trilogy (Cell Marque) at 90°C. The slides were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min followed by two washes of PBS-Tx0.5 (0.5% triton-X) for 30 min and transferred to a blocking solution (0.5% BSA and PBS-Tx0.5). One hundred and fifty microlitres of primary antibody (diluted in blocking solution) was added to individual slides, and a parafilm was placed on top for uniform spreading of the antibody solution. After an overnight antibody incubation at 4°C, the slides were washed with alternating changes of PBS-Tx0.5 and PBS + 0.1% tween-20. The secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight. The slides were washed again with alternating changes of PBS-Tx0.5 and PBS + 0.1% tween-20. After two 10 min washes, slides were developed with Tyramide/other fluorophores. For double immunostaining, sodium-azide based peroxide inactivation was performed after the development of each antibody. After two 10 min washes with PBS-TW, slides were stained with Hoechst for nuclear staining overnight.

The background is set to black for better visualisation, and all figures are prepared using Adobe Illustrator v6 with colour combinations in CMYK format to make scientific figures accessible to people with colour-blindness. Quantification of PAR fluorescence was performed in Fiji using the ‘mean fluorescence analysis’ tool and normalised to the nuclear area using the Hoechst signal. Total PAR fluorescence was measured from all the nuclei, with high intensity of perinuclear TUD1 staining used to determine Tudor-1-positive stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solana et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Quantitative RT-qPCR</title><p>Total RNA from samples of three to five worms were extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for each of two biological replicates for each RNAi condition.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Dario Riccardo Valenzano as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sahu et al. investigate a specific class of responses to wounding in planarians. Specifically, they find that upon decapitation, stem cell migration to the wound site is accompanied by DNA damage occurring in the migrating stem cells. These findings echo findings in vertebrates, where cell migration in vitro can be a source of DNA damage. Hence, migration-dependent DNA damage seems to be an ancient mechanism, shared between flatworms and vertebrates (although so far shown only in vitro). The authors show that migrating stem cells are susceptible to irradiation-induced DNA damage, which delays migration. Additionally, the authors show that successful migration to the wound site requires a substet of DNA-repair genes.</p><p>While we feel this work has a great potential, the major conclusion that links DNA damage in stem cells to migration is not justified yet and requires additional experiments to support this claim.</p><p>Could migrating cells be more sensitive to oxidative stress when entering the wounded region?</p><p>Could DNA damage be coupled with a specific phase of the cell cycle?</p><p>The paper needs thorough proofreading (e.g. &quot;However, it is not known to whether migration and damage are associated in vivo in normal adult stem cells, as to this point cells have studies have been manipulated to experience migration through constrictions in vivo&quot;).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before being considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the authors need address</p><p>the following outstanding issues:</p><p>1. Disentangle migration from cell proliferation. One caveat to the interpretation that stem cells are migrating is that healthy cells from the shielded area, having suffered no DNA damage, are capable of dividing, and produce new daughter cells that eventually repopulate the animal. To strengthen support for stem cell migration, the cell cycle should be inhibited with nocodazole after shielded radiation (as used in Grohme, Nature 2018, van Wolfswinkel, Cell Stem Cell 2014). If cells are indeed migrating and not proliferating, equivalent numbers of cells should be present outside of the shielded area after nocodazole treatment. If fewer, this will suggest that the apparent migration arises from proliferating cells moving beyond the shielded region via expansion of this population rather than directed migration. Alternatively, to clarify whether the wound's biochemical environment – without a regenerative response that requires cell migration – could trigger DNA damage in stem cells, the authors could check if wounding in the shielded region induces DNA damage in non-migrating stem cells. Can the authors assess whether migrating cells are more sensitive to oxidative stress when entering the wounded region, or whether DNA damage could be coupled to a specific phase of the cell cycle?</p><p>2. Can degradation due to apoptosis be compatible with the comet assay results?</p><p>In Figure 3, can longer comet tails be a result of increased apoptosis after radiation exposure?</p><p>3. RNAi results are incompletely reported. According to the paragraph in the middle of page 4, data for knockdown of atr, atm, brca2, parp1, and parp2 under homeostatic conditions should be included in Figure S3. However, the data in this figure is phosphohistone-H3 staining instead of smedwi-1 staining, used in most other figures.

An important control for these experiments would be a whole-animal stain of a shielded animal, which should show that the shielded area is devoid of PAR staining.

Given cells arriving at the wound site show reduced damage compared to migrating cells we do not believe this to be an issue. In addition, immunostaining with anti-PAR (to detect DNA damage) and Anti-Tud1 (to detect damage in stem cells (Tud1+) and differentiated progenies (Tud1- cells)) allowed us to perform a controlled experiment where we can simultaneously analyse both migratory and non-migratory cells in the same environment. The non-migratory Tud1- differentiated cells that are present in the migratory region and at the wound site region presumably would also be more sensitive/ acquire DNA damage due to “oxidative stress” as the reviewers suggested. However, we only see increased DNA damage in TUD1+ stem cells in the migratory region compared to the shield and do not detect increased damage in TUD1- cells (Figure 2 D-F). We have also confirmed this result by performing COMET assay using cells from the shielded region and migratory regions with and without migrating stem cells (Figure 2 G-K). We don’t think cells in the migratory region or at the wound site are acquiring DNA damage because of oxidative stress from the wounded region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could DNA damage be coupled with a specific phase of the cell cycle?</p></disp-quote><p>The activation of DNA damage checkpoints is accompanied by cell-cycle arrest, that provides a temporal delay to accommodate DNA repair factors to repair DNA lesions before resuming cell proliferation. NHEJ based DNA repair is effective throughout all the phases of cell cycle, whereas HDR requires a homologous template to repair the double stranded break, it occurs during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. It could be that damage is repaired through the cell cycle as migrating cells stop and divide and we have not investigated this in this study and do not have the resources available to do this in a reasonable time frame.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper needs thorough proofreading (e.g. &quot;However, it is not known to whether migration and damage are associated in vivo in normal adult stem cells, as to this point cells have studies have been manipulated to experience migration through constrictions in vivo&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have proofread the manuscript and fixed the mistakes in some sentences where we could see them. These changes are visible as tracked changes in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before being considered for publication in eLife, the authors need address</p><p>the following outstanding issues:</p><p>1. Disentangle migration from cell proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we do not think these processes can be disentangled in a proliferating cell population such as the planarian neoblasts, they are likely to be inextricably linked as neoblasts are always proliferating. So we are not sure if this is possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One caveat to the interpretation that stem cells are migrating is that healthy cells from the shielded area, having suffered no DNA damage, are capable of dividing, and produce new daughter cells that eventually repopulate the animal.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct as animals placed through the assay eventually regenerate normally to form healthy animals, this was reported in detail in our previous work where the migration assay was established (Abnave et al. 2017, Development). So, this is not a caveat. We have added a little more detail about this previous work to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To strengthen support for stem cell migration, the cell cycle should be inhibited with nocodazole after shielded radiation (as used in Grohme, Nature 2018, van Wolfswinkel, Cell Stem Cell 2014). If cells are indeed migrating and not proliferating, equivalent numbers of cells should be present outside of the shielded area after nocodazole treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown in Abnave et al., 2017 Development that stem cells migrate, form extended cell membrane processes as they migrate and fail to migrate towards the wound after knockdown of EMT transcription factors, a matrix metalloprotease, a beta-integrin etc without any effect on proliferation. We also reported the dynamics of proliferation of the migrating population and their ability to produce post-mitotic progeny of the epidermal lineage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If fewer, this will suggest that the apparent migration arises from proliferating cells moving beyond the shielded region via expansion of this population rather than directed migration.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study we clearly showed accurate homing of cells directly to the site of small wounds caused by fine needles, with considerable accuracy. Cells did not migrate Given the speed, spread and spacing (and functional work) we are convinced (as were reviewers at the time) that this is bona-fide migration of stem cells, not spreading through proliferation (see Abnave et al., 2017 Development).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestion for using Nocodazole to stop cell cycle progression and check for migration. We are concerned about the specificity of any result after Nocodazole treatment as while it blocks the cell cycle as shown in Grohme et al. 2018 and Van Wolfswinkel et al. 2014, it exerts its effect by interfering with microtubule polymerization. Cytoskeleton disassembly plays a major role in cell migration, and Nocodazole treatment has a significant impact on directed cell migration as observed in migration of cells in culture for example (Ganguly et al., JBC 2012; PMID-23135278; Baudoin et al., 2008 Dev Neurosci; PMID-18075261). Hence, we do not think that this experiment helps us beyond the extensive previous characterization of Abnave et al. 2017.</p><p>It is correct that cells are dividing and differentiating as they migrate. Cell proliferation and differentiation (without migration) also happens in the shield where we detect no rise in DNA damage. Similarly, we also don’t see a rise in DNA damage in non-migrating TUD1<sup>-</sup> post-mitotic differentiated cells (Figure 2 E-F). This data strongly supports our hypothesis that migration leads to DNA damage in Tud1<sup>+</sup> stem cells.</p><p>Moreover, the inability of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> stem cells to migrate after RNAi of DDR genes (Figure 4A) prove that cells are dying/differentiating en route to the wound, while cells in the shield are maintained. This further disentangles the role of migration and proliferation because we don’t see any significant change in the number of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> cells in the shielded region, suggesting healthy stem cells starts to migrate to the wound and acquire damage during migration and eventually die or differentiate due to the failure to resolve increased DNA damage. Together with multiple lines of evidence our data strongly confirms our interpretation that indeed migration is causing the DNA damage and not aberrant cell-proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, to clarify whether the wound's biochemical environment – without a regenerative response that requires cell migration – could trigger DNA damage in stem cells, the authors could check if wounding in the shielded region induces DNA damage in non-migrating stem cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to further clarify that the wound’s biochemical environment could trigger DNA damage. We note at the wound site damage is not as high in stem cells in transit through the migratory region distal to the wound site. The double immunostaining with anti-PAR [to detect DNA damage] and Anti-Tud1 [to detect damage in stem cells (Tud1+) and differentiated progenies (Tud1- cells)] allowed us to perform a controlled experiment where we can simultaneously analyse both migratory and non-migratory cells in the same environment. The non-migratory Tud1- differentiated cells that are present in the same environment and presumably would also get DNA damage as a potential bystander effect of the “wound’s biochemical environment” as the reviewers suggested. In this scenario, we only see increased DNA damage at 7dpa in TUD1+ stem cells in the migratory region compared to the shield and do not detect damage in TUD1- cells (Figure 2 D-F), once again implicating migration as the key variable. We have also confirmed this result by performing COMET assay using cells from the shielded region and migratory regions with and without migrating stem cells (Figure 2 G-K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors assess whether migrating cells are more sensitive to oxidative stress when entering the wounded region, or whether DNA damage could be coupled to a specific phase of the cell cycle?</p></disp-quote><p>See comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Can degradation due to apoptosis be compatible with the comet assay results?</p><p>In Figure 3, can longer comet tails be a result of increased apoptosis after radiation exposure?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up. The COMET results in control experiments after irradiation (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 A-B) show reduction in COMET after IR exposure suggest COMET is indeed measuring damage that is repaired in the cell population. The extensive DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis does not show comet-like structures hence comet tails are representative of DNA lesions and used for this purpose. Fragmented DNA in an apoptotic nuclei is very small (size of a nucleosome oligomer) and would generally disappear completely by diffusion in the gel during lysis and/or electrophoresis and are mostly seen as diffuse spheroids or like a halo around the nucleoid-head in single cell electrophoresis and do not show a structure that resembles comet-tail, rather they are referred to as hedgehogs (For interpretations of Comet assay results see, Lorenzo et al., Mutagenesis 2013, Collins 2004, Molecular Biotechnology). We have cited these papers in the manuscript to provide clear interpretation of our Comet assay data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. RNAi results are incompletely reported. According to the paragraph in the middle of page 4, data for knockdown of atr, atm, brca2, parp1, and parp2 under homeostatic conditions should be included in Figure S3. However, the data in this figure is phosphohistone-H3 staining instead of smedwi-1 staining, used in most other figures. In addition, the data in the figure are incomplete (not representing all genes tested). Rad51 is only mentioned, not shown.

The effect of RAD51 in stem cell maintenance is previously reported by Peiris et al., 2017, Development and we have added its effect in stem cell repopulation in the context of sub-lethal dose of IR in Figure 1H and its effect on animal survival in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 I-M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Controls showing the efficacy of RNAi need to be included (either by qRT-PCR or in situ hybridization).

If the inability to repair DNA is solely responsible for a failure of stem cells to migrate to the wound, then cells should be seen dying en route to the wound, with elevated levels of PAR staining and increased comet tails. Is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question, to check if there is increased DNA damage during migration after RNAi of DNA repair factor, we need markers of upstream DNA damage signaling proteins (like phosphorylated-H2Ax and 53BP1) and live-cell imaging tools in planarians, which is beyond the scope and time frame of this manuscript. For example, <italic>atr</italic> and <italic>atm</italic> are the major kinase responsible for H2Ax phosphorylation in response to single or double stranded break induction. Hence PAR formation which is an ADP-ribosylation event after DNA break repair is initiated, will not be increased after knockdown of DNA repair factors. Moreover, in the absence of stem cells in the migratory region after RNAi, it will be difficult to interpret any DNA damage signals or Comet assay as there is no/few stem cells to check for by COMET, which does not discriminate stem cells from differentiated cells. The inability of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> stem cells to successfully migrate after RNAi of DDR genes (Figure 4A) suggests a role for DDR in normal cell migration. Further work will be required to understand this process in greater detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to verify PAR staining specificity. An important control for these experiments would be a whole-animal stain of a shielded animal, which should show that the shielded area is devoid of PAR staining. The authors also need to indicate that quantification of PAR fluorescence was done in a standardized way, some indication of the number of animals analyzed, etc. Furthermore, the color selection makes it very difficult to see the staining in some images (e.g. Figure 2D). Higher magnification images and single-color images should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We do indeed present data for cells in the shielded area as a control at all time points as the reviewers suggest (Figure 2D, E) and provide higher magnification images just 5 minutes after irradiation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>We have kept individual PAR and Tud1 staining merged with Hoechst staining, providing clarity that Tud1 is peri-nuclear and PAR is nuclear, allowing independent measurement. The third panel represents a merged image of all three channels. We have remained consistent in representing all our PAR and Tud1 staining in this pattern (Please see Figure 1E, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 C).</p><p>The measurement of PAR is strictly nuclear, measuring only the signal overlapping with Hoechst. While a baseline signal of PAR is also detectable, the rise just 5 minutes after IR exposure is very clear, as its subsequent decrease over the next 24 hours. This control experiment (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 2C) allows us to then measure DNA damage in migrating cells vs stationary cells with confidence. The PAR antibody has been widely used as a DNA damage marker in mammalian cell lines and previously in planarians (Shibata et al., Dev Cell 2017), and we characterize its specificity with controls that were previously absent.</p><p>We performed double immunostaining with anti-PAR (DNA damage marker) and an antibody to planarian Tudor-1 (that marks the perinuclear RNP granules (chromatoid bodies) in <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> stem cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 C)) and measured DNA damage in stem cells. Tudor-1 gives a very specific perinuclear staining (Solana et al., 2009), and hence aids in demonstrating PAR staining to be nuclear. All analyses are made by measuring total PAR fluorescence by outlining the nucleus based on Hoechst staining, and then Tud-1 perinuclear staining is used to differentiate between stem cells (Tud1+) and post mitotic progenies (Tud1-). Experiments are performed with 5 worms per condition. The images are from 10 µm paraffinized sections and Z stack to cover single-nuclear volumes and are used for analysis in Figure 1 E-G, Figure 2 D-F and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 D-F. Just showing a single channel makes it very difficult to judge if the staining is nuclear and hence in our manuscript, we have kept individual PAR or Tudor1 staining merged with the Hoechst channel, followed by a third panel with a merge of all 3 stains. We have also presented a representative image in Figure 2—figure supplement 2-A with Z-stack optical section and individual channels showing the specificity of the staining. The color selection for all the figures in the manuscript is based on CMYK format with Magenta and Yellow and Blue to make scientific figures accessible to readers with color-blindness, and we wish to stick to these colors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was the presence/absence of DDR components assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>Identification of orthologous genes across animal species were done using Inparanoid database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi">http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi</ext-link>) and EggNOG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eggnogdb.embl.de/">http://eggnogdb.embl.de/</ext-link>) databases.
