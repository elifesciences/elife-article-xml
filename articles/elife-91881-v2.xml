molecule to initiate productive T-cell activation. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine the A6 TCR bound to HLA-A*02:01 presenting agonist or antagonist peptides under different extensions to simulate the effects of applied load on the complex, elucidating their divergent biological responses. We found that TCR α and β chains move asymmetrically, which impacts the interface with pMHC, in particular the peptide-sensing CDR3 loops. For the wild-type agonist, the complex stabilizes in a load-dependent manner while antagonists destabilize it. Simulations of the Cβ FG-loop deletion, which reduces the catch bond response, and simulations with in silico mutant peptides further support the observed behaviors. The present results highlight the combined role of interdomain motion, fluctuating forces, and interfacial contacts in determining the mechanical response and fine peptide discrimination by a TCR, thereby resolving the conundrum of nearly identical crystal structures of TCRαβ-pMHC agonist and antagonist complexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T-cell receptor</kwd><kwd>catch bond</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>major histocompatibility complex</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>US National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AI143565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mallis</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinherz</surname><given-names>Ellis L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Wonmuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>US National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI136301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinherz</surname><given-names>Ellis L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of an αβ T-cell receptor complexed with the major histocompatibility complex molecule presenting wild-type or mutant antigenic peptides reveal how it uses conserved framework motion to discriminate antigens by leveraging physiological force applied during immune surveillance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The αβ TCR (αβTCR) consists of the heterodimeric receptor TCRαβ formed by α and β chains each containing the pMHC-binding variable (V) and constant (C) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and the noncovalently associated cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) subunits that have cytoplasmic tails containing motifs for downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudolph et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Reinherz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brazin et al., 2018</xref>).

complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>). A cognate peptide antigen elicits a catch bond behavior where the TCRαβ-pMHC bond lifetime increases with force that peaks in the 10–20 pN range, and is observed with the clonotypic ligand-binding TCRαβ heterodimer in isolation or with the holoreceptor αβTCR including the non-covalently associated CD3 signaling subunit dimers (CD3ϵγ, CD3ϵδ, and CD3ζζ). The catch bond is coupled with a roughly 10 nm structural transition in both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banik et al., 2021</xref>), which supports the notion that the αβTCR acts as a mechanosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brazin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brazin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>). In our previous molecular dynamics (MD) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>), instead of enforcing dissociation of the complex with high force, as done in steered MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sibener et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), we applied pN-level forces and examined the behavior of the JM22 TCR complexed with an HLA-A*02:01 molecule presenting a peptide from an influenza virus matrix protein. We found that the TCRαβ-pMHC complex is in a loosely-bound state in the absence of load, which allows domain motion. Application of a 16-pN force suppresses the motion and overall enhances the fit among domains. We proposed a model where the TCRαβ-pMHC catch bond arises due to stabilization of the interface by altering the conformational motion of TCRαβ.</p><p>An important question regards the generality of this dynamic mechanism in other TCRs. To this end, we study the A6 TCR, which recognizes the Tax peptide (LLFGYPVYV) of the human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garboczi et al., 1996b</xref>) bound to HLA-A*02:01, the same MHC as for JM22. We perform all-atom MD simulations with the Tax peptide (wild type; WT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garboczi et al., 1996a</xref>) and four mutant peptides with a single-residue substitution: Y5F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2011</xref>), V7R, P6A, and Y8A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). Below, we call the TCRαβ-pMHC complex by the name of the corresponding peptide. For example, Y5F refers to the complex with the Y5F peptide (PDB 3QFJ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>While the crystallographic structures of these complexes are very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), they differ in immunogenicity. P6A and Y8A are weak antagonists because they inhibit T-cell function only at 1000-times higher molar concentration than that needed by the WT for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hausmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). We refer to them simply as ‘antagonists.’ Y5F is similar to WT in terms of equilibrium binding affinity and T-cell activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hausmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). V7R induces effector functions comparable to WT at 10- to 100-times higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). We call Y5F and V7R as ‘modified agonists.’ There have been several experimental and computational studies comparing the effects of peptide modifications or pMHC binding on A6 TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michielin and Karplus, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis-Harrison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuendet and Michielin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borbulevych et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuendet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fodor et al., 2018</xref>), but load was not explicitly considered. To simulate a complex under load, we held the distance between the terminal C<sub>α</sub> atoms of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) at a set extension for the duration of the simulation. This was done by applying harmonic positional restraints so that the terminal C<sub>α</sub> atoms were allowed to fluctuate in position, hence resulting in instantaneous fluctuation in the applied force akin to loading in experiments. We refer to a simulation as either low or high load based on the average load, which was around the physiological 10–20 pN range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To our knowledge, the present study is the first to elucidate the dynamic mechanism of the A6 complex harboring different peptides under load.</p><p>We found that differences between the WT and peptide mutants lie in dynamic responses to applied load. In the WT, physiological level load stabilized the TCRαβ-pMHC interface as well as the subdomain motion within TCRαβ. Modified agonists maintained stable contacts, yet high loads led to destabilization. Antagonists had less stable interfaces under load as the mutated residues disrupted surrounding interfacial contacts. Motion within the TCR, such as the Vα-Vβ scissoring as observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>, and an asymmetric bending of the V-module relative to the C-module, were coupled to the interactions between the variable domains and pMHC such that a single-residue mutation in the peptide affected the conformational behavior of the whole TCR. The present results suggest that the conserved TCRαβ framework motion is leveraged when determining the mechanically matched pMHC, a mechanism that is broadly applicable to different TCRαβ systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first study the WT-based systems to gain insight into the functional implications of TCRαβ-pMHC structural dynamics, followed by point mutations in the Tax peptide.

This was based on the realistic situation of immune surveillance. When a T-cell interacts with an APC, other molecules such as CD2 and CD58 maintain the separation near the ∼120 Å span of the TCRαβ-pMHC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>). The force applied to the complex fluctuates via thermal motion and through cellular activities such as coupling to the actomyosin machinery within the T-cell and APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>). Restraining terminal C<sub>α</sub> atoms in simulation mimics the membrane anchoring of these molecules with a relatively constant spacing and fluctuating force. The measured instantaneous force varies in magnitude and direction across coordinate frames. Averaged over time, it becomes mainly longitudinal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Despite the temporal variation in the applied force, the results below show that the response of the complex depends on the average force and the ligand.</p><p>In simulation, soft harmonic positional restraint can be used for conformational sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pitera and Chodera, 2012</xref>). Rather than positional sampling, our goal is applying force at a given extension, for which we used a stiff 1-kcal/[mol.Å<sup>2</sup>] potential (Laddered extension with added strands) that yields thermal fluctuations of amplitude ∼0.8 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang, 2007</xref>). While it is also possible to apply a constant force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stirnemann, 2022</xref>), it would not reflect the membrane-anchored state. In addition, the extension of the complex will fluctuate under a constant force, and the actual load that the TCRαβ-pMHC interface experiences will likewise fluctuate. How load propagates through the complex and distributes across the interface is a subject of a future study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Load stabilizes WT TCRαβ-pMHC interfacial contacts</title><p>We assessed the effect of load on WT first by counting high-occupancy contacts with pMHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; see Contact analysis in Computational methods).

For WT<sup>high</sup> and Vαβ-pMHC, high-occupancy contacts persist throughout the simulation (blue regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) while WT<sup>0</sup> or WT<sup>low</sup> exhibited breakage of contacts, especially when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi class="MJX-tex-caligraphic" mathvariant="script">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> increased (dashed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Differences in the interfacial contacts also manifest in their location. We displayed the backbone C<sub>α</sub> atoms of Vα and Vβ residues that form contacts with pMHC with greater than 80% average occupancy (averaging was done after the initial 500 ns; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In WT<sup>0</sup>, contacts are spread apart, and in WT<sup>low</sup> they lie mostly along the length of the peptide. These layouts potentially make interfacial contacts more prone to break via easier access by water molecules. In WT<sup>high</sup> and Vαβ-pMHC, high-occupancy contacts form more compact clusters. Exposure to water of the TCRαβ residues involved in those contacts was measured by their buried surface area (BSA), which follows the same trend as the number of high occupancy contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) Furthermore, this trend also applied to the root-mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of Tax peptide backbone C<sub>α</sub> atoms, even though RMSF values were small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>Experimentally, the WT complex has a relatively strong affinity as a TCRαβ (about 1 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 1999</xref>), which may be why the interface with pMHC involved more contacts in WT<sup>0</sup> compared to WT<sup>low</sup>. At low load, the short distance between restraints on the ends of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) allows wider transverse motion that in turn generates a shear stress or a bending moment at the interface. Transverse stress will be less for WT<sup>0</sup> where the end moves freely, and for WT<sup>high</sup> where lateral motion is suppressed. The extent of transverse motion can be seen by the RMSF of the center of mass of the C<sub>α</sub> atoms of the peptide in the transverse direction, which was 16.3 Å for WT<sup>low</sup> and 12.7 Å for WT<sup>high</sup>. The high stability of Vαβ-pMHC and WT<sup>high</sup> agree well with the results for JM22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Influence of pMHC and load on Vα-Vβ motion</title><p>We analyzed the motion between Vα and Vβ (Vα-Vβ motion) to find its effect on the TCRαβ-pMHC interface.

Compared to Tαβ, binding of pMHC increases the α-chain motion, which is the greatest in WT<sup>low</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, PC1 in top row). The greater degree of Vα-Cα motion is consistent with the smaller number of Vα-Cα contacts compared to Vβ-Cβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The asymmetry was further analyzed by measuring hinge angles ∠TCRα and ∠TCRβ independently of PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

For WT<sup>low</sup> and WT<sup>high</sup>, CDR3 distance decreases with increasing hinge angles, especially with ∠TCRα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which suggests that unbending of the V-module under load helps with bringing the CDR3 loops closer together.

Under high load, intermolecular contact occupancy decreased over time (Y5F and V7R in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, darkening of outlined circles) while intramolecular contact occupancy either increased (Y5F<sup>high</sup>) or decreased (V7R<sup>high</sup>) relative to the respective low load cases. For antagonists, both occupancy measures were lower than the WT, and further reduction could be seen over time in some cases (P6A and Y8A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, darkening of colors in outlined circles).</p><p>The stability of the TCRαβ-pMHC interface also manifested into their relative motion, which was quantified by the angle between the least-square fit line across the backbone C<sup><sub>α</sub></sup> atoms of the antigenic peptide and the unit vector formed between the centroids of Vα and Vβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). For WT, the peptide angle fluctuated more for WT<sup>low</sup> than WT<sup>high</sup> (WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) where 58.4°±3.6° (avg±std after 500 ns) for WT<sup>high</sup> reflects a diagonal binding. This is consistent with the greater transverse RMSF of WT<sup>low</sup> mentioned earlier which may assist with destabilizing the interface. For dFG<sup>low</sup>, the peptide changed orientation by more than 20°, and for dFG<sup>high</sup>, it stabilized, but at a higher value than WT<sup>high</sup>, which also was reached in dFG<sup>low</sup> later during simulation, suggesting a more orthogonal binding (dFG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

For antagonists, the angle overall fluctuated more under no load or settled to different values under high load. Since the antagonists are loosely coupled (low occupancy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), settling of the angle does not indicate stabilization of the interface, as evident from the positional shift of the α2 helix of V7R<sup>high</sup> or Y8A<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1G H</xref>) compared to WT<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study elucidates how the load-dependent TCRαβ framework motion influences the dynamics of the TCRαβ-pMHC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Instead of using defined conformational changes as seen in other catch bond systems, TCRαβ activates the catch bond via altering its conformational dynamics. A main feature of the TCRαβ framework is the smaller number of contacts for the Vα-Cα compared to the Vβ-Cβ interface. This causes an asymmetric V-C motion, primarily bending, where Vα moves more compared to Vβ relative to the C-module, which serves as a base. This in turn generates relative motion between Vα and Vβ, which can destabilize the contacts with pMHC, especially by affecting the distance between CDR3 loops that play the most direct role for sensing the bound peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). Applying a physiological level force stabilizes the interface by straining the whole complex into a more tightly coupled state, as can be seen by the increase of both inter- and intramolecular contacts in WT<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9C</xref>). This physically plausible mechanism is based on collective analyses of all simulations in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for peptide screening.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-matching pMHC or (<bold>B</bold>) matching pMHC but without adequate load do not stabilize the asymmetric V-C framework motion that affects the interfacial stability as measured by the CDR3 distance (CDR3 loops are shown above the V-module).

The applied load slightly increases the spacing between pMHC and TCRαβ, which provides room for the CDR3 loops to adjust as well as allow other contacts to ‘lock’ into more stable states with higher and more persistent occupancy. Absence of load or low load do not properly channel the framework motion and thereby increase exposure to water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>) and destabilize the interface.</p><p>The Cβ FG-loop stabilizes the Vβ-Cβ interface, thereby contributing to the asymmetric V-C motion. It also controls the relative orientation between Vβ and Cβ, hence it affects the orientation of the CDR loops of the V-module with respect to the loading direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>). The behaviors of the dFG mutant are consistent with the reduced catch bond response observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>). Consistency in these findings between the present study and our previous simulations using JM22 TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>) also underscores that the proposed mechanism based on the asymmetric framework motion is applicable to other TCRαβ systems. Furthermore, while the γδ TCR involved in transitional immunity operates as a slip-bond receptor, the Vγδ-Cαβ chimera forms a catch bond with its sulfatide ligand-loaded CD1d molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mallis et al., 2021</xref>), which provides additional experimental support for the proposed mechanism.</p><p>In the absence of bond dissociation events within the microsecond-long simulation, the catch bond manifests as stabilization of high-occupancy contacts and interfacial fit under load. Conversely, slip bond will exhibit destabilization of the interface under load, as seen for antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the case of a higher affinity slip bond, the interfacial behavior could be insensitive to the applied load within the finite simulation time. In addition to agreeing with previous experiments mentioned above, our atomistic simulations can be used to design mutant TCRs possessing altered load dependence. For example, the V7-βG100 contact is present mainly in the high-load case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The V7R peptide is a modified agonist as R7 forms contacts with residues other than βG100, albeit with lower occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Point mutations of βG100 may lead to different behaviors depending on the type and size of the mutated residue. Another possibility is placing a disulfide bond to limit the Vα-Cα motion or to alter the relative V-C orientation. Extensive simulations are needed to more accurately predict behaviors of such mutants.</p><p>After engagement with a cognate pMHC under load, reversible transition to an extended state is possible. This has been observed both during in vitro single-molecule experiments using TCRαβ and on cells displaying the full αβTCR holoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banik et al., 2021</xref>). Since Vαβ-pMHC lacking the C-module forms a more stable binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that was also observed in our previous simulations of the JM22 TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>), the C-module likely undergoes partial unfolding in the extended state. Thus, while the folded C-module serves as the base for the asymmetric V-C motion screening for the matching pMHC, once a match is found, the reversible transitioning propelled by the partial unfolding of the C-module may agitate the membrane and activate the cytoplasmic domains of the surrounding CD3 subunits to initiate downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>). A circumstantial evidence for the capacity of the C-module to unfold is that the Cα domain as well as parts of Cβ are occasionally unresolved in crystal structures, as in PDB 1AO7. Catch bond formation and subsequent reversible structural transitioning under applied load indicate that pMHC recognition requires energy input, for example from the actomyosin machinery. Further studies are needed to understand the energetics involved in pMHC recognition, signaling initiation, and ultimately T-cell activation.</p><p>In addition to TCRαβ, MHC may also respond to load. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2019</xref> suggested a partial separation of the MHCα1-α2 peptide-binding platform from β2m with the attendant lengthening of pMHC contributing to a longer bond lifetime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banik et al., 2021</xref> observed a catch bond for CAR-pMHC, where just MHC is being pulled with an antibody. While we did not find a clear load or peptide-dependence in contacts between subdomains of MHC, since the entire TCRαβ-pMHC complex is under load, conformational changes in pMHC may contribute to the extended state of the complex. Yet, for T-cell-based cancer immunotherapy, mechanistic knowledge of the mechanosensing through a TCR has a greater practical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>A recent study using a laminar flow chamber assay fit the measured bead survival distribution using Bell’s equation to estimate the zero-force off rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mtext>off</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and the force sensitivity distance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pettmann et al., 2023</xref>).

However, the force range tested was up to 100 pN, where even systems exhibiting catch bond in the 10–20-pN range will switch to a slip bond behavior. A catch bond exhibits a non-monotonic force versus bond lifetime profile, so that fitting with Bell’s equation, an exponential function, leads to results that do not have a clear physical meaning. For example, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pettmann et al., 2023</xref> was less than 1 Å in magnitude in all systems, which is shorter than the length of a single covalent bond. They also performed steered MD simulation that applies hundreds of pN forces, which is inadequate for studying behaviors of the system under loads in the 10–20-pN range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>). Use of a coarse grained model without appropriately incorporating atomistic properties of the TCR further makes it difficult to compare their simulation with wet laboratoryexperiments.</p><p>We earlier proposed that the residues of the antigenic peptide play a role more as ‘teeth of a key’ for screening the TCRαβ-pMHC interaction fitness rather than bearing applied loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, ‘bittings of a key’). The present study confirms this notion through simulations of mutant systems, where several contacts across the interface with pMHC were impaired due to a single-residue mutation on the peptide in ways that reflect the functional outcome of the mutation. In considering how a T-cell may respond to an unknown peptide, the pMHC motion and the asymmetric V-C motion are two points of guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Stabilization of the inter- and intramolecular interfaces throughout the whole complex under 10–20-pN load would indicate a cognate TCRαβ-pMHC interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Since these features are based on overall TCRαβ-pMHC complex dynamics, rather than changes to specific contacts or a particular conformational change, they can be used to predict fitness of other TCRαβ-pMHC combinations. Such tests involve performing many all-atom MD simulations and trajectory analyses. An in silico method would be needed that efficiently predicts dynamic properties of the complex based on sequence and structural data only. Atomistic insights gained from the present study will be helpful for developing such a method in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Structure preparation</title><p>Structure preparation was done using CHARMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>).

Residues differing at a few locations in some of the PDB files were converted so that all systems have identical sequences except for point mutations introduced in the Tax peptide (details are given below). Disulfide bonds between cysteine residues were introduced as noted in the PDB file. Histidine protonation sites were determined based on the 1QSE crystal structure to promote hydrogen bond formation with neighboring residues. Where neighboring residues were unlikely to hydrogen bond, we assigned the water-facing nitrogen of histidine as charged. This led to protonation of the N<sup>δ</sup> atom for all histidine residues except for MHC H263 and β2m H84, where the N<sup>ϵ</sup> atom was protonated.

After adding the strands, a series of energy minimization and a short MD simulation in the FACTS implicit solvent environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haberthür and Caflisch, 2008</xref>) were performed to relax them and bring together the C-terminal ends of the two TCR chains.

The coordinates listed are based on the renumbered indices. These were built using PDB 1QSE. For the Cα domain, we aligned the Vα domain of 1AO7 and 1QSE (K1–P115) based on their backbone C<sub>α</sub> atoms and added the missing Cα domain residue coordinates to 1AO7. After this, we performed a brief energy minimization on the added domain while fixing positions of all other atoms of 1AO7. For missing residues in the Cβ domain, we used backbone C<sub>α</sub> atoms of two residues each before and after the missing part to align 1QSE to 1AO7 and filled in coordinates, followed by a brief energy minimization of the added part in 1AO7.

Factors such as this, together with differences in conformational behaviors of the complex, affected the average force for a given extension. Thus we had to test and choose among different extensions for each system. We also ran 1–2 replicate simulations of comparable length (1 µs) at given extensions except for systems involving dFG and in silico mutants. However, even with nearly the same extensions used, measured forces in replicate simulations varied due to the reasons explained above. Additionally, the average force based on the initial 60–100 ns and after 500 ns differed. For detailed analysis, we thus chose sets of runs where higher extension led to higher average force. However, in all runs, we found that the average load rather than extension correlates better with the behavior of the TCRαβ-pMHC interface, which underscores the consistency of the load dependence found in our analysis. The final selection and average forces are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Other systems</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>TCRαβ-pMHC without load</title><p>These systems include WT<sup>0</sup> and the no load complexes with point mutations to the Tax peptide.

FG-loop deletion</title><p>The higher number of Vβ-Cβ contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and smaller range of ∠TCRβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>) in the WT TCR suggests that the β chain mainly bears the load while the α chain adjusts to accommodate different loading conditions. Our previous experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>) and computational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>) studies showed that the Cβ FG-loop plays a critical allosteric role for the catch bond formation. To examine its role in A6 TCR, we performed simulations of dFG in isolation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and under low and high loads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Similar to the WT, the number of contacts with pMHC increased with load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A and B</xref>). The BSA for high-occupancy residues contacting pMHC was also greater for high load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>). Thus, dFG may also possess a catch bond behavior, which agrees with experiment where a subdued catch bond was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>).

In particular, Vβ of the unliganded dFG is more tilted, as there is a lack of support from the FG-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>). When load is applied to the dFG-pMHC complex, dFG becomes less bent. Its tendency to return to the bent conformation would impose a strain on the interface with pMHC. This can be seen by the higher average load on dFG-pMHC complexes than WT-pMHC complexes under similar extensions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Comparing between the amplitudes of PCs of α and β chains, a notable difference from the WT systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) is that Hβ moves more than Hα for loaded dFG systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1D</xref>, bottom row). Also, distributions of ∠TCRα and ∠TCRβ shift to larger and smaller values, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1E</xref>). These indicate alterations in the conformation and motion of dFG. Furthermore, the CDR3 distance of dFG is elevated regardless of load or V-C angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1F</xref>), suggesting a reduced allosteric control by the V-C motion.</p><p>The altered conformation of dFG causes the interface with pMHC to tilt as observed in our previous study of JM22, which is detrimental to the stability of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>). The increased motion of Hβ may also deliver more agitation to the interface with pMHC. Thus, even though full dissociation with pMHC was not observed within the simulation time, the dFG-pMHC complex is likely to be less stable compared to the WT complex.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of the Cβ FG-loop deletion.</title><p>In all panels, the same criteria were used to measure values as for the WT systems in the corresponding figures.

For example, for <sup>Y8A</sup>WT<sup>high</sup> (Y8A under high load switched to WT), we took Y8A<sup>high</sup> at the beginning of its production run and mutated A8 to Y8 (see In silico mutants in Computational methods). A main question is whether the in silico mutants attain behaviors of the switched systems during the finite simulation time. We found this to be the case although behaviors were not recapitulated perfectly. Compared to WT<sup>high</sup>, the number of contacts with pMHC became lower for <sup>WT</sup>P6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1A</xref>). Note that <sup>WT</sup>P6A<sup>low</sup> had a higher force than <sup>WT</sup>P6A<sup>high</sup> (24.7 vs 19.5 pN; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). This was because the low extension in the former case allowed the loose C-terminal strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to form extensive nonpolar contacts with the C-module, especially with Cβ. This effectively shortened the length of the complex, which led to a higher average force as the extension was kept the same (Selecting extensions). Among the original systems, Y5F<sup>high</sup> had average force comparable to <sup>WT</sup>P6A<sup>low</sup> (23.7 pN; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), yet it had 1.8-fold more contacts, suggesting that the latter does behave like an antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1A</xref>). For in silico WT, the number of contacts with pMHC was comparable to that of WT<sup>high</sup> except for <sup>Y8A</sup>WT<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1A</xref>). In the original Y8A<sup>high</sup>, even though the number of contacts was at the level of WT<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the smaller size of A8 caused CDR3β to extend.

The CDR3 distance was higher for in silico antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1B</xref>, top), while for in silico WT their range became narrower, to 11–12 Å, which is similar to that of the modified agonist Y5F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1B</xref>, bottom row).

A few simulation observations either appear speculative or are not well illustrated, (e.g. on p5), &quot;short distance between restraints … allows wider transverse motion that in turn generates a shear stress or a bending moment at the interface&quot;.

While there are various analyses of the simulation data, it would strengthen the paper greatly if the authors could provide specific experimentally testable hypotheses, eg., in the form of predicted responses to a mutant peptide, or mutations to the variable chains that could alter the fluctuations (e.g. disulfide crosslinking).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In terms of presentation, I found the number and extent of data to be a bit overwhelming.

Multiple independent runs should be carried out for each simulation system, i.e., peptide and low/high load.</p><p>2) The definition of low and high load (Table 1) seems somewhat arbitrary as a low load of 13.2 pN and 14.9 pN is defined (from averaging over the 2nd half of the MD trajectory) for the WT peptide (full system and dFG, respectively) and these values are similar/higher than the high load of 13.5 pN of the P6A mutant.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Asymmetric framework motion of TCRαβ controls load-dependent peptide discrimination&quot; for further consideration by eLife.

It is also valuable to explicitly suggest a set of experimentally testable predictions from the simulation study.</p></disp-quote><p>For TCR<italic>αβ</italic>-pMHC, catch bond does not activate through any defined conformational transition as observed in other adhesion proteins (e.g., integrin). Instead, our results show that it is achieved by load-dependent changes in the conformational motion of the protein that affect the stability of the interface. We measured the interfacial stability in multiple ways, including: Maintenance of the initial high-occupancy contacts (Figure 3B-E), increase in the buried area of the contact-forming residues (Figure 3G), stabilization of the CDR3 distance (Figure 4D), and related time dependent features (Figure 8). The newly added Figure 1 gives an overview of different measurements. Given the seconds-order bond lifetime in reality, in microseconds-long simulations, slip bonds would manifest as deterioration of the interfacial stability under higher forces but without any dissociation actually occurring during the simulation. The lower stability of the interface observed in the modified agonist or antagonist systems indicate they will exhibit weaker catch bond or slip bond behaviors.

I suggest that the authors discuss why they chose to restrain the TCR/MHC separation, rather than devise an algorithm to apply a steady force. The issue with the restrained distance is that the forces reported for the different mutants are quite variable, and one might even say, not consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in our reply R0-1, we used positional restraints instead of applying constant forces to better reflect reality where the applied force fluctuates while TCR and pMHC are anchored to respective cell membranes separated by a relatively constant distance. Since fluctuation in the instantaneous force is rapid, the TCR<italic>αβ</italic>pMHC complex does not have time to respond at each moment. Yet, the fluctuating force drives the complex to respond differently depending on the average force, as demonstrated by our simulations. If a constant force were applied, the extension of the complex would fluctuate more widely, and the load actually experienced at the interface between TCR and pMHC may not be the same as the constant force applied to the ends, which would be similar to the case of fluctuating force under constant extension. A more detailed comparison between constant extension vs. constant force methods would be an interesting subject of a future study. For the present manuscript, we believe our main conclusions regarding the TCR catch bond mechanism are well-supported by constant-extension simulations.</p><p>Changes made:</p><p>Changes are the same as those listed in our response R0-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

(Table1) it might be interesting to check whether the integral of the force over the three extensions reported in the table correlates with the TCR/pMHC binding strength, if these data are available.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is an interesting idea, the work done by force in our simulation and the binding strength have nontrivial relation. For example, the dFG-pMHC system had a greater increase in force (14.9 pN to 29.0 pN) compared to the WT (13.2 pN to 18.2 pN) over similar change in extension (page 4, Table 1). This does not indicate that dFG-pMHC has a higher binding strength. On the contrary, the higher force in dFG-pMHC in the high-load case is due to the conformational change that shortened its longitudinal span, which would have a greater destabilizing effect in a longer simulation, as explained in Appendix 1 (page 27). To quantitatively address energetics, a much more extensive sampling simulation at incremental distances would be needed, with the added complexity of dealing with a catch bond.</p><p>Regardless of the practical difficulty, the energetics involved in antigen discrimination and TCR triggering is a fundamental issue, which we briefly mention in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Change made:</p><p>On pages 14–15, Concluding Discussion, lines 414–417, we mentioned about the energetics issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In particular, the newly added Figure 1 gives an overview of our different simulations and analyses, which helps with following individual Results sections. Regarding the example that the reviewer pointed out, it was based on the expectation that a loosely held molecule will transversely fluctuate more compared to a tightly held one. To check, we measured the root-mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the center of mass of the C<italic><sub>α</sub></italic> atoms of the WT Tax peptide in the transverse direction.

While there are various analyses of the simulation data, it would strengthen the paper greatly if the authors could provide specific experimentally testable hypotheses, eg., in the form of predicted responses to a mutant peptide, or mutations to the variable chains that could alter the fluctuations (e.g. disulfide crosslinking).</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed in R0-3 and R1-0.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In terms of presentation, I found the number and extent of data to be a bit overwhelming.

Figure 8 that the reviewer suggested to move to the supporting information, is particularly important as it shows how forces and contact occupancy fluctuate over time, yet they reflect different loading conditions or ligand. Figure 8 also is relevant to the proposed model in Figure 9. Instead of further reducing figures, we added Figure 1 as the summary panel suggested by the reviewer. We hope it will help with grasping the flow of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have carried out a simulation study of the behavior of the TCR-pMHC complex for different peptides with and without load in the physiological range (10-20 pN). The load is calculated by applying harmonic restraints to the ends of the complex and extending their distances iteratively. The analysis of the complex under load seems to be novel.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1) While the general conclusions regarding the load (e.g., higher number of contacts) seem to be supported by the simulations with different peptides, the conclusions regarding the different behavior of individual peptides (e.g., modified agonist vs. weak antagonist) are not fully supported as only one MD run was carried out for each peptide sequence and value of load. Multiple independent runs should be carried out for each simulation system, i.e., peptide and low/high load.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the data presented, we did carry out additional 2 replicate runs for the WT and 1 replicate run for each of the mutant systems. However, as was briefly explained in the Methods section of our original manuscript (page 18, lines 563–568) and in Appendix 2 for <italic>in silico</italic> mutants (page 27, lines 881–886), it was difficult to achieve monotonic increase of force with extension. This was because in some of the runs the Cterminal added strands made contact with the C-module of TCR, effectively shortening the span of the complex during the simulation. This led to the average force comparable to or higher than that for a larger extension. The runs included in Table 1 were those where low and high extensions resulted in low and high average forces (measured after 500 ns), respectively. Importantly, for other replicate simulations, we found that certain measures such as the CDR3 distance and average contact counts, are consistent with the average load rather than average extension, which agrees with the picture that the response at the interface is determined by the applied load.</p><p>Aside from replicate runs, simulations of <italic>in silico</italic> mutants (switching between the WT and mutants; Appendix 2 on pages 27–28) serve as additional tests, which yielded overall consistent results. Most of all, the asymmetric motion observed in all of the simulations and its impact on stability of the interface with pMHC provide a physically plausible explanation for the catch bond mechanism that does not rely critically on details of any single simulation.</p><p>Changes made:</p><p>– Page 13, lines 372–373 in Concluding Discussion: We added a remark about the generality of our findings obtained by analyzing multiple simulations collectively.</p><p>– Page 18, lines 560–574 in Methods: We explained about the issues we found about replicate simulations and the dependence of the responses on load rather than extension <italic>per se.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The definition of low and high load (Table 1) seems somewhat arbitrary as a low load of 13.2 pN and 14.9 pN is defined (from averaging over the 2nd half of the MD trajectory) for the WT peptide (full system and dFG, respectively) and these values are similar/higher than the high load of 13.5 pN of the P6A mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>This partly relates to the difficulty of precisely controlling forces at a given extension, as explained in R0-1 and R3-1. But even when the difference in forces is accounted for, the WT and mutant systems behave distinctly. In the case of the antagonist P6A that the reviewer pointed out, the average force of P6A<sup>high</sup> (13.5 pN) is the lowest among the high-load simulations shown in Table 1. Both its extension and average force are comparable to those of WT<sup>low</sup>. If P6A<sup>high</sup> were considered in isolation, it could be argued that the instability of the interface observed in simulation would be due to insufficient force, similar to WT<sup>low</sup>. However, when P6A<sup>0</sup> (no load) and P6A<sup>low</sup> are considered together, difference from the WT system emerges. This can be seen by the overall lower stability of the interface and weaker dependence on load (e.g., Figure 3A,G for WT vs. Figure 6A,B for P6A), differences in conformation; in Figure 7D, the average BOC for WT<sup>low</sup> lies between those for WT<sup>0</sup> and WT<sup>high</sup>, all of which differ substantially from the average BOCs for all P6A systems tested. Also, compared to WT<sup>low</sup> that gradually loses contacts with pMHC, P6A<sup>high</sup> has low contact occupancy early on in the simulation (Figure 8A). The lower stability of the interface is also evident for the <italic>in silico</italic> P6A mutant (<sup>WT</sup>P6A; see Appendix 2–figure 1A on page 28). As seen in Appendix 2-table 1 (page 27), loads on the <italic>in silico</italic> P6A are comparable to or higher than those used for WT in Table 1. Also note the average force on <sup>WT</sup>P6A<sup>low</sup> (24.7 pN) is higher than that on <sup>WT</sup>P6A<sup>high</sup> because the added strands made contacts with the TCR’s C-module in <sup>WT</sup>P6A<sup>low</sup> (page 27, lines 879–883 in Appendix 2; also explained in R3-1). Since we did not perform any replicate simulations for <italic>in silico</italic> mutants, we used these data directly.</p><p>Changes made:</p><p>– Page 4, lines 113–115, newly added Results section ‘<italic>Applying loads to TCRαβ-pMHC complexes</italic>:’ Added a remark that distinction can be seen between different systems despite variations in the applied load.</p><p>– Page 18, lines 569–574: Expanded discussion about practical issues with applying positional restraints.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved and the reviewers appreciated the revision, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>A new comment concerns the standard deviations of the forces that have been added. The std are quite variable between the various structures (varying from ~2.5A to ~12A). I wonder whether this variability is interpretable in terms of the proposed catch-bond mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting observation. We examined the data more carefully, and found that there are both thermodynamic and system specific aspects to the large variation in the std of force. Regarding the thermodynamic aspect, the std tends to be larger for larger average forces. This can be seen more clearly by plotting all the values in Table 1 (Appendix 3-figure 1).</p><p>Except for Y8A<sup>low</sup> and dFG<sup>low</sup>, all other data points lie on nearly a straight line. Thermodynamically, the force and position of the restraint (blue spheres in Figure 2A) form a pair of generalized force and the corresponding spatial variable in equilibrium at temperature 300 K, which is akin to the pressure <italic>P</italic> and volume <italic>V</italic> of an ideal gas.</p><p>If <italic>V</italic> is fixed, <italic>P</italic> fluctuates. Denoting the average and std of pressure as ⟨<italic>P</italic>⟩ and as ∆<italic>P</italic> respectively, Burgess showed that ∆<italic>P/</italic>⟨<italic>P</italic>⟩ is a constant (Eq. 5 of Burgess, Phys. Lett. A, 44:37; 1973). In the case of the TCR<italic>αβ</italic>-pMHC system, although individual atoms are not ideal gases, since their motion lead to the force fluctuation of the restraints, the situation is analogous to the case of an ideal gas where pressure arises from individual molecules hitting the confining wall as the restraint. Thus, the near-linear behavior in the figure above is a consequence of the system being many-bodied and at constant temperature. The linearity is also an indirect indicator that sampling of force was reasonable.</p><p>In addition to the thermodynamic aspect, system-specific aspects influence the std of force. In the above figure, Y8A<sup>low</sup> is an antagonist that had the smallest number of contacts with pMHC except for Y8A<sup>0</sup> without load (Figure 6A of our manuscript). dFG<sup>low</sup> also had similarly small number of contacts with pMHC (Appendix 1figure 1A). The weakly held interface likely caused a wider conformational motion, leading to greater fluctuation in force relative to the average (dFG<sup>low</sup> and Y8A<sup>low</sup> in Figure 8A, symbols without outline).</p><p>The above suggest that the variation in the std of force <italic>per se</italic> does not provide a clear distinction between catch vs. slip bonds, although a comparatively larger std is indicative of potential instability. Feedback from the reviewers motivates us to carry out a future study focused on fundamental aspects of forces, constraints, and fluctuations in a smaller model system for more thorough analysis.</p><p>Changes made:</p></body></sub-article></article>
