membrane proteins and small RNAs to target cells for the control of cell migration, development and metastasis. To study the mechanisms of RNA packaging into exosomes, we devised a purification scheme based on the membrane marker CD63 to isolate a single exosome species secreted from HEK293T cells. Using immunoisolated CD63-containing exosomes we identified a set of miRNAs that are highly enriched with respect to their cellular levels. To explore the biochemical requirements for exosome biogenesis and RNA packaging, we devised a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the species-selective enclosure of miR-223 in isolated membranes supplemented with cytosol. We found that the RNA-binding protein Y-box protein I (YBX1) binds to and is required for the sorting of miR-223 in the cell-free reaction. Furthermore, YBX1 serves an important role in the secretion of miRNAs in exosomes by HEK293T cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19276.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19276.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19276.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human cells release molecules into their surroundings via membrane-bound packets called exosomes. These molecules can then circulate throughout the body and are protected from degradation. Among the cargos carried by exosomes are small molecules of RNA known as microRNAs, which are involved in regulating gene activity.</p><p>Only a select subset of the hundreds of microRNAs in a human cell end up packaged into exosomes. This suggests that there might be a specific mechanism that sorts those microRNAs that are destined for export. However, few proteins or other factors that might be involved in this sorting process had been identified to date.</p><p>Shurtleff et al. set out to identify these factors and started by purifying exosomes from human cells grown in the laboratory and looking for microRNAs that were more abundant in the exosomes than the cells. One exosome-specific microRNA, called miR-223, was further studied via a test-tube based system that uses extracts from cells rather than cells themselves. These experiments confirmed that miR-223 is selectively packed into exosomes that formed in the test tube. Using this system, Shurtleff et al. then isolated a protein called Y-box Protein I (or YBX1 for short) that binds to RNA molecules and found that it was required for this selective packaging.</p><p>YBX1 is known to be a constituent of exosomes released from intact cells and may therefore be required to sort other RNA molecules into exosomes. Future studies will explore how YBX1 recognizes those RNA molecules to be exported from cells via exosomes. Also, because exosomes have been implicated in some diseases such as cancer, it will be important to explore what role exosome-specific microRNAs play in both health and disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19276.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19276.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>YBX1</kwd><kwd>Y-box</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cell-free reaction that reconstitutes the selective sorting of a miRNA into exosomes reveals an RNA-binding protein, YBX1, as a critical sorting factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In contrast to the normal pathways of protein secretion, the processes by which unconventional cargoes are secreted have proved diverse and enigmatic. Indeed, our understanding of unconventional secretory mechanisms is limited to a few examples of leader-less soluble and transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malhotra, 2013</xref>). Unconventionally secreted molecules may be externalized in a soluble form by translocation across various membranes. This may include direct translocation across the plasma membrane, or across an organelle membrane followed by fusion of the organelle with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang and Schekman, 2013</xref>). Alternatively, proteins and RNAs can be secreted within vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane, as in the budding of enveloped viruses such as HIV, or within vesicles internalized into a multivesicular body (MVB) that fuses with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>RNA is actively secreted into the medium of cultured cells and can be found in all bodily fluids enclosed within vesicles or bound up in ribonucleoprotin complexes, both forms of which are resistant to exogenous ribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arroyo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchell et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, extracellular vesicle-bound RNAs appear to be enriched in specific classes of RNAs, including small RNAs and microRNA (miRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kosaka et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Exosomes are a subclass of extracellular vesicle which can be defined as 30–100 nm vesicles with a buoyant density of ~1.10–1.19 g/ml that are enriched in specific biochemical markers, including tetraspanin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>). It is often assumed that vesicles fitting this description are derived from the multivesicular body, but some evidence suggests that physically and biochemically indistinguishable vesicles bud directly from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booth et al., 2006</xref>). Numerous studies have reported the presence of RNAs, especially miRNAs, from fractions containing exosomes, though many of these studies have relied on isolation techniques (e.g. high speed sedimentation) that do not resolve vesicles from other cellular debris or RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobrie et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to know in which form RNAs are secreted and even more challenging to determine which miRNAs may be specifically secreted as exosome cargo. The use of many different cell lines, bodily fluids and isolation methods to identify which miRNAs are specifically packaged into exosomes further complicates the establishment of widely accepted exosomal miRNA cargo.</p><p>Even with the crude preparations that have been characterized, it is clear that RNA profiles from exosomes are distinct from those of the producer cells. Thus RNA capture or stabilization in exosomes is likely to occur through a selective sorting mechanism. RNA packaging may occur by specific interactions with RNA binding proteins that engage the machinery necessary for membrane invagination into the interior of an MVB or by interaction of RNAs with lipid raft microdomains from which exosomes may be derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to probe the mechanism of exosome biogenesis, we developed procedures to refine the analysis of RNA sorting into exosomes. Using traditional means of membrane fractionation and immunoisolation, we identified unique miRNAs highly enriched in exosomes marked by their content of CD63. This miRNA sorting process was then reproduced with a cell-free reaction reconstituted to measure the packaging of exosome-specific miRNAs into vesicles formed in incubations containing crude membrane and cytosol fractions. Among the requirements for miRNA sorting in vitro, we found one RNA-binding protein, YBX1, which is a known constituent of exosomes secreted from intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buschow et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purified exosomes contain RNA</title><p>We first sought to purify exosomes from other extracellular vesicles and contaminating particles containing RNA (e.g. aggregates, ribonucleoprotein complexes) that sediment at high speed. We define exosomes as ~30–100 nm vesicles with a density of 1.08–1.18 g/ml and containing the tetraspanin protein CD63. Based on these criteria, purified exosomes were recovered using a three-stage purification procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). First, large contaminating cellular debris was removed during low and medium speed centrifugation and exosomes were concentrated by high-speed sedimentation from conditioned medium. Next, to eliminate non-vesicle contaminants, the high-speed pellet fraction was suspended in 60% sucrose buffer and overlaid with layers of lower concentrations of sucrose buffer followed by centrifugation to float vesicles to an interface between 20 and 40% sucrose. Analysis of this partially purified material by electron microscopy showed vesicles of the expected size and morphology with fewer profiles of larger (&gt;200 nm) membranes and reduced appearance of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). Finally, sucrose gradient fractions were mixed with CD63 antibody-immobilized beads to recover vesicles enriched in this exosome marker protein.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19276.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purified CD63-positive exosomes contain RNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Exosome purification schematic. (<bold>b</bold>–<bold>e</bold>) Representative electron micrographs of negative stained samples from the 100,000 ×g pellet fraction (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>d</bold>) and post-flotation fractions (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>e</bold>) at either 9300X (a,b) or 1900X (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>e</bold>) magnification.

Tetraspanin proteins share a common topology in which the amino- and carboxyl-termini face the cytoplasm resulting in a predicted orientation inside the lumen of an exosomal vesicle. Although an intact C-terminal sequence is reported to be required for the proper localization of CD63 to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rous et al., 2002</xref>), we found that our overexpressed CD63-luciferase fusion was localized to a variety of cell surface and intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using isolated exosome fractions, we confirmed that the CD63-luciferase fusion maintained the expected topology. Luciferase activity was stimulated by the addition of detergent to disrupt the membrane and allow access to the membrane impermeable substrates luciferin and ATP, and to trypsin, which inactivated luciferase activity in the presence but not in the absence of detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The CD63-luciferase cell line was then used to monitor exosome purification. CD63-luciferase specific activity increased at each step of the purification, yielding a 5-fold purification of exosomes from the starting 100,000 ×g pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Additionally, following immunoisolation, most of the RNA was found in the CD63 positive bound (B) fraction, showing that RNA is associated with purified exosomes from HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). These results established that the RNA is associated with CD63-containing exosomes, but not necessarily enclosed within exosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Exosomes contain selectively packaged miRNAs</title><p>Previous reports indicated the presence of miRNAs in fractions containing exosomes but which also contain contaminating particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobrie et al., 2012</xref>). To identify the specific miRNAs that are enriched in CD63-positive exosomes from 293T cells, we performed Illumina-based small RNA sequencing on libraries prepared from purified exosomes and from cells. We obtained a total of 123,679 miRNA reads (4.4% of total mapped reads – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) in the exosome library representing 502 distinct miRNAs and 880,093 reads (7.3% of total mapped reads – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) representing 637 miRNAs in the cell library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To determine if a particular miRNA species was over-represented in exosomes, we analyzed the datasets for reads mapping to miRNA precursors and the targeting or passenger strand of mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Exosomes were slightly enriched in reads mapping to precursor and passenger strand transcripts, however, the vast majority of miRNAs (91% from cells and 88% from exosomes) mapped to the mature targeting strand. The relative abundance of each miRNA was estimated by normalizing to the total number of miRNA-mapped reads (i.e. the number of reads mapped to a miRNA locus divided by the total number of miRNA mapped reads for each dataset – RPM). Of these, 134 and 269 miRNAs were uniquely found in the exosome and cell datasets respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Most of the miRNAs uniquely found in exosomes were of very low abundance, with only a few counts for each miRNA. A notable exception was miR-223-3p, which was in the 72nd percentile for normalized reads in exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref> – red). The relatively high abundance of miR-223 in exosomes and its low level in the cellular library indicated that miR-223 was very efficiently packaged and secreted via exosomes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19276.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of select miRNAs in exosomes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Venn diagram showing the number of total (above diagram), unique (inside red or green circles) and shared miRNAs (inside yellow) from each library.

To determine if these exosome associated RNAs are contained within exosomes and not simply bound to the surface, we performed an RNase protection experiment. Both miRNAs were protected from RNase I digestion, unless detergent was added to disrupt the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). These results confirm that miRNAs are selectively packaged into exosomes purified from HEK293T conditioned media and establish miR-223 and miR-144 as specific exosomal miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cell-free assays for exosome biogenesis and miRNA packaging</title><sec id="s2-4-1"><title>Rationale</title><p>The mechanism of exosome biogenesis has been probed in mammalian cell culture using the tools of gene knockdown, knockout and overexpression where it is often difficult to distinguish a primary or indirect role for a gene product.

Previous studies have reported the use of cell-free assays to monitor multivesicular body biogenesis and sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into intraluminal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falguières et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</xref>). To specifically monitor exosome biogenesis, we measured the protection over time of luciferase fused to CD63. The fusion protein displayed luciferase on the cytoplasmic face of a membrane such that its incorporation into a vesicle by budding into the interior of an endosome (or into a vesicle that buds from the cell surface) would render the enzyme sequestered and inaccessible to exogenous luciferin and ATP, the substrates of catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). During the incubation, substrate would have access to luciferase exposed on the cytoplasmic face of a membrane or to enzyme about to be internalized into a bud, but not to luciferase that had already become sequestered within vesicles in cells prior to rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In order to focus only on luciferase that became sequestered during the cell-free reaction, aliquots taken after a 20 min incubation of membranes, cytosol and substrate at 30°C were sedimented, resuspended in buffer and sedimented again to remove excess substrate, and CD63-luciferase remaining exposed on the surface of membranes was inactivated by treatment with trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) for 1h at 4°C. Remaining luciferase activity was then monitored in a luminometer. Since the substrates D-luciferin salt and ATP are membrane impermeable, the residual luminescence measured in trypsin-treated samples should derive from luciferase that became segregated along with substrate during the cell-free incubation. Relative protection was quantified as the ratio of relative light units (RLU) for reactions incubated without cytosol, at 4°C and in the presence of detergent (Triton X-100) divided by the RLU for a complete reaction incubated at 30°C. We observed that the formation of sequestered luciferase required cytosol and incubation at 30°C and was disrupted in incubations containing detergent (Triton X-100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

We used the cell-free packaging assay to compare the efficiency of incorporation of synthetic miR-223 and a relatively abundant cellular miRNA that is not found in exosomes (miR-190a-5p – miR-190). Exosomal miR-223 was more efficiently packaged into vesicles (9%) than cellular miR-190 (1.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Furthermore, the rate of miR-223 packaging mirrored the rate at which luciferase became sequestered in the biogenesis reaction whereas the rate of miR-190 protection in a 30°C incubation reflected the low rate of formation of sequestered luciferase in an incubation held on ice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).

The inability to detect Ago2 in our mass spectrometry results from in vitro packaged miR-223 could be due to technical limitations of our reaction. We considered two potential technical explanations. First, we used the single stranded guide RNA in our reaction rather than a duplex RNA molecule. Although Ago2 associates with guide RNA in a reaction containing purified components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacRae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gagnon et al., 2014</xref>), single-stranded miRNA may be rapidly degraded in a crude extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gagnon et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it was possible that the duplex molecule might represent a more relevant packaging substrate. Second, 3' biotinylated RNA was used as the substrate for the packaging reaction. A recent report suggested that, in some cases, 3' biotinylated RNA could prevent the proper loading of the miRNA into complex with Ago2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Steitz, 2014</xref>). To address these concerns we synthesized miR-223 passenger strand and guide strands biotinylated at the 3' end or internally at position 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The internal position was chosen because in crystal structures of miRNA-protein complexes, middle positions of guide RNAs do not appear to be in direct contact with Ago2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Steitz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elkayam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schirle and MacRae, 2012</xref>). We then annealed the guide and passenger strands to form the miR-223 duplexes. To determine if the guide or passenger strands can be efficiently loaded into Ago2 in our in vitro reaction conditions, we first mixed the biotinylated substrates with cytosol alone and evaluated complexes that associated with streptavidin beads. In our reaction conditions, both the single stranded guide and duplex oligonucleotides bound apparently equally to Ago2 in cytosol alone and there was no discernible difference in the association comparing 3' or internally biotinylated oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). We then tested the various substrates in our complete packaging reaction including membranes, cytosol and an ATP regenerating system. Duplex substrates were packaged ~2-fold more efficiently than the single stranded guide RNA, irrespective of the position of the biotin group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Interestingly, in reactions programmed with duplex RNA substrate, only the guide RNA and not the passenger RNA was sorted into a protected compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). In similar incubations, the YBX1 protein was ~2X more efficiently packaged in reactions programmed with duplex RNA but Ago2 was not detected associated with miR-223 in any of the complete reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f</xref>). This suggests that whereas the RNA substrates are capable of being bound by Ago2 in the cytosol, in the complete reaction containing membranes and ATP, YBX1 is the predominant binding factor. These results explain why Ago2 was not detected in the mass spectrometry data and are consistent with our failure to detect Ago2 in buoyant density-fractionated extracellular vesicles. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Deun et al.

Thus, YBX1 is required for exosomal miRNA packaging in vitro but is not required for the sorting of an exosome membrane cargo protein into vesicles in our cell-free reaction.</p><p>In an effort to connect the results of our cell-free reaction to the mechanism of sorting of miRNAs into exosomes secreted by HEK293T cells, we examined the secretion of miR-223 and of another miRNA, miR-144, which was also highly enriched in our purified exosome fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We measured the amount of miR-144 and miR-223 secreted into the medium and retained in cells by qRT-PCR. ΔYBX1 cells showed a significant decrease in secretion of both miRNAs, though more notably of miR-144, during a 24 hr incubation in fresh medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). When the YBX1 paralog YBX2 was knocked down in ΔYBX1 cells, miR-223 secretion was diminished to the baseline level, suggesting partial functional redundancy for YBX paralogs in the secretion of miR-223 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The defect in miR-223 secretion was less substantial in cells compared to the cell-free reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), possibly reflecting a rate effect that distinguishes the magnitude of the defect in a 20 min cell-free incubation at 30°C vs. a 24 hr incubation of cells at 37°C. Nonetheless, the secretion defect was accompanied by an ~three–four fold accumulation of each miRNA in cells. No accumulation was observed for another miRNA (miR-190), which is not released in exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). To determine if Ago2 binds miR-223 that accumulates in ΔYBX1 cells, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation with Ago2 or isotype matched control IgG in lysates of WT and ΔYBX1 cells and quantified the amount of associated miR-223 by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). No miR-223 above background co-immunoprecipitated with Ago2 in WT cells. In contrast, miR-223 accumulated in ΔYBX1 cells was found to be associated with Ago2. These results suggest that miR-223 is properly processed in HEK293T cells, likely loaded into Ago2 and then efficiently dissociated and bound by YBX1. Taken together, our results show that YBX1 controls the secretion of select exosomal miRNAs in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results establish miR-223 and miR-144 as specific exosome cargo in HEK293T cells. In order to probe the mechanism of RNA sorting into exosomes, we developed biochemical assays that measure the capture of an exosome membrane protein and miRNA into vesicles formed in a cell-free reaction. Using this approach, we identify YBX1 as an RNA-binding protein that is critical for the efficient packaging of miR-223 in vitro and its secretion in cultured human cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How are miRNAs recognized for sorting into exosomes?</title><p>We find that synthetic miR-223 is sequestered into vesicles more efficiently than miR-190, consistent with the possibility of a primary RNA sequence or secondary structure, perhaps stabilized by an RNA binding protein such as YBX1, that directs RNA sorting. One possible sorting motif – GGAG – is enriched in miRNAs secreted in exosomes from T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>). This motif is recognized by hRNPA2B1, a T-cell exosome RNA-binding protein, which requires sumoylation for efficient secretion via exosomes. It was therefore suggested that binding of GGAG containing miRNAs by sumoylated hRNPA2B1 was a sorting mechanism for miRNAs into T-cell-derived exosomes.</p><p>We were unable to identify any statistically significant primary sequence motifs for miRNAs by either multiple alignment (ClustalW) or multiple Em for motif elicitation (MEME) in HEK293T-derived exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the mature targeting strand of miR-223 packaged into exosomes contains no guanine nucleotides and hRNPA2B1 was not detected in our mass spectrometry results for proteins bound to miR-223-biotin isolated from vesicles formed in our cell-free reaction. The human genome encodes more than 1000 experimentally determined and predicted RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore propose that different cell types may use RNA binding proteins with distinct binding preferences to secrete miRNAs, and perhaps other RNA classes, in exosomes. In addition, some cell types may deploy multiple RNA-binding proteins to sort RNAs into exosomes, in which case motif discovery would be challenging, even in highly purified vesicles, due to diverse motif preferences from distinct proteins.</p><p>We identified YBX1 as the dominant RNA-binding protein physically interacting with miR-223 in vitro and confirmed its role in miR-223 packaging into exosomes both in vitro and in cultured cells. YBX1 is found within mammalian P-bodies (GW bodies) containing untranslated RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kedersha and Anderson, 2007</xref>) and in the nucleus where it plays a role in RNA splice site selection by binding short sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). YBX1 binds RNA via an internal cold shock domain and an inherently disordered, highly charged C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lyabin et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, another cold shock domain containing protein, Lin28, binds pre-miRNAs of the Let7 family via hairpin-loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nam et al., 2011</xref>). YBX1 also binds hairpin-loops in a murine retrovirus, leading to stabilization of the viral RNA genome and increased particle production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bann et al., 2014</xref>). YBX1 binding of viral RNA also increases production of other retroviruses, including HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>). This raises the possibility that the recognition motif for sorting into exosomes may be based on secondary rather than primary RNA structure and that YBX1 may act as an RNA co-factor to escort exosomal RNAs into exosomes.</p><p>Our studies focused on miRNAs, however it is possible that YBX1 is responsible for the secretion of other RNA classes in exosomes. Several recent reports indicate a role for YBX1 in binding various small RNAs, including miRNAs, tRNA fragments and snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blenkiron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goodarzi et al., 2015</xref>). It is interesting to note that most miRNAs present in exosomes in our study are not highly enriched compared to their relative abundance in cells. This raises the possibility that highly enriched exosomal miRNAs mimic other classes of RNAs that are more efficiently packaged in a YBX1-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chaperone-mediated sorting of miRNAs into exosomes</title><p>A surprising finding from our study is the lack of evidence for the argonaute proteins in isolated exosomes or sequestered with miR-223 in our cell-free RNA sorting reaction. This in spite of our observation that cell-free reaction reconstitutes sorting of the mature strand from a duplex RNA. Some recent evidence suggests that Ago2 may be sorted along with miRNAs into exosomes as a result of aberrant KRAS signaling. Analysis of extracellular RNA in isogenic cell lines differing only in KRAS status revealed that secretion of a sub-population of miRNAs is decreased in colorectal cancer cells harboring an activating KRAS mutation whereas other miRNAs are secreted at equivalent levels irrespective of KRAS status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequent experiments showed that KRAS mutation results in phosphorylation of Ago2 causing its re-localization from multivesicular bodies to P-bodies leading to decreased secretion of select miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, the miRNA (miR-223-3p) shown here to be dependent on YBX1 is among the cohort of miRNAs that were not affected by KRAS status. These results combined with ours suggest two possible routes for miRNA egress via exosomes, an Ago2-associated pathway and a RNA-binding protein-dependent pathway that we term chaperone-mediated sorting. The chaperone-mediated pathway would include the previously identified hnRNPA2B1 in T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>) and YBX1 in HEK293T cells. Interestingly, one other highly enriched miRNA (miR-328-5p) has been previously shown to conditionally associate with either Ago2 or with the RNA-binding protein hnRNPE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eiring et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that these two pathways may not be mutually exclusive. A notable feature of the chaperone-mediated pathway is that the RNA content of exosomes may be manipulated by altering the expression of individual RNA binding proteins involved in RNA export with distinct nucleic acid binding specificities. Further characterization of the chaperone-mediated pathway may then allow for targeted sorting of engineered RNA species into exosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The physiological role of exosomal miRNA</title><p>The functional role of secreted miRNAs has been a matter of discussion since the first reports of extracellular RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Théry, 2011</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs can be transferred to neighboring cells in experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kosaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pegtel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mittelbrunn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rana et al., 2013</xref>). However, the transfer of miRNAs in biologically significant quantities for function in a physiological context is far from proven. Indeed, a recent study reported a stoichiometry of less than one specific miRNA per exosome, with the caveat that this study characterized crude, high-speed pellet fractions from conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chevillet et al., 2014</xref>). Functional miR-223 transferred between macrophages and miR-223-containing exosomes can induce macrophage differentiation, however, it has yet to be shown that miR-223 transfer plays a direct role in the differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ismail et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, direct and convincing evidence for a physiological role of miRNAs secreted via exosomes has so far proven elusive. Alternatively, exosomes may be a convenient carrier to purge unnecessary or inhibitory RNAs from cells. A recent report provided evidence for both alternative views with the demonstration that target transcript levels for miRNAs in the cell modulate the abundance of miRNAs in macrophage exosomes, and this in turn dictates which miRNAs are transferred to repress transcripts in recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Squadrito et al., 2014</xref>). Because YBX1 and the RISC machinery have both been shown to localize to P-bodies and P-bodies are closely juxtaposed to multivesicular bodies, all of the necessary machinery is poised to efficiently secrete miRNAs in exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibbings et al., 2009</xref>). YBX1 may complex with miRNAs whose mRNA targets are not expressed, and sort them into the intralumenal vesicles of a multivesicular body for export by unconventional secretion. Physiological studies of the function miRNAs that are secreted via the Ago2-associated vs. chaperone-mediated pathways may explain contradictory results for different miRNAs and provide general rules for extracellular miRNA function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, media and general chemicals</title><p>HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Those miRNAs with described passenger strands (star strand) were then analyzed to determine how many mature reads mapped to either targeting or passenger strands.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing</title><p>A pX330-based plasmid expressing venus fluorescent protein was kindly provided by Robert Tjian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cong et al., 2013</xref>). A CRISPR guide RNA targeting the first exon of the YBX1 open reading frame was selected using the CRISPR design tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>). The YBX1 guide RNA was introduced into pX330-Venus by oligonucleotide cloning as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cong et al., 2013</xref>). HEK293T cells were transfected for 48 hr at low passage number, trypsinized and sorted for single, venus positive cells in a 96 well plate using a BD Influx cell sorter. Wells containing single clones (16 clones) were allowed to expand and were screened by semi-nested PCR using primers targeting the genomic region flanking the guide RNA site. Primers for the first round of PCR (10 cycles) were: YBX1-F1 (GGTTGTAGGTCGACTGAATTA) and YBX1-R1 (ACCGATGACCTTCTTGTCC). The PCR primers from the first round were removed using DNA clean and concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer's instructions and the second round of PCR (25 cycles) was performed with primers: YBX1-F2 (CGGCCTAGTTACCATCACA) and YBX1-R1 (ACCGATGACCTTCTTGTCC). PCR products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel to identify products smaller than the wild type PCR product, indicating a deletion. Clones (8) showing homozygous or heterozygous mutations were then screened by immunoblot to identify those that did not express YBX1. A clone containing a single homozygous mutation at the target site and not expressing YBX1 by immunoblot was recovered and designated ΔYBX1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>siRNA Knockdown and measurement of miR-223 secretion</title><p>Predesigned siRNA oligos targeting YBX2 were obtained from Qiagen (Hs_YBX2_3:AAGCCGGTGCTGGCAATCCA). Cells were seeded at 60% confluency and siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies). After 48 hr the media was replaced with exosome depleted media and allowed to incubate another 24 hr. An aliquot (1 ml) of medium was removed and centrifuged at 1500 and 15,000 ×g and then extracted using the Zymo RNA Prep Kit. 1 ng of RNA was reversed transcribed and qPCR was performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA immunoprecipitation</title><p>RNA immunoprecipitation was performed using the Magna RIP kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse monoclonal anti-Ago antibody (5 µg, clone 2A8) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was used to immunoprecipitate from a lysate generated from 2.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> HEK293T cells (WT or ΔYBX1) in 100 µl Magna RIP lysis buffer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Amita Gorur for help and advice on electron microscopy.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Y-box protein 1 is required to sort microRNAs into exosomes in cells and in a cell-free reaction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tim Nilsen (Reviewing Editor), Jim Manley (Senior Editor), and Detlef Weigel (Deputy Editor).</p><p>The reviewers including the Reviewing Editor have extensively discussed the reviews with one another, with Senior Editor Jim Manley, and with Deputy Editor Detlef Weigel. The consensus was to decline the work in its current form, because it appears that addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers would likely require substantially more work than can be accomplished in the two months that <italic>eLife</italic> normally strives for. However, we are interested in the area of the work in principle, and would likely reconsider a thoroughly revised manuscript, which would be treated as a new submission. The most substantial concern related to Ago protein. That Agos were not identified from the affinity purification was one concern; the other that only single stranded miRNA, rather than a miRNA-loaded Ago complex was used in the in vitro packaging reaction.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here, Schekman and colleagues examine the mechanism whereby specific miRNAs are sorted into exosomes using HEK293T cells as a model system. They use a rigorous method to purify CD63 positive exosomes and find that miRs 223 and 144 are highly enriched in them relative to miRNAs in the cell. They then use a cell free system that appears to mimic the sorting and using affinity purification identify proteins bound to miR 223. YBOX1 emerges as a candidate sorting protein. Then using CRISPR knockouts of YBOX1 gene they implicate it as being involved in sorting miRNAs to exosomes.</p><p>While the reviewers agreed that the work has the potential of broad relevance expected for <italic>eLife</italic>, they all expressed concerns about some of the data. In particular, all of the referees questioned the use of single stranded miRNAs in the in vitro packaging reactions. It is well known that mature miRNAs are obligatorily associated with an Ago protein. The fact that Agos were not identified in the affinity purification was a major concern and brought into question the relevance of the in vitro experiments. One reviewer also noted an inconsistency in the results pertaining to the inability of YBOX1 KO cell extracts to package miR 223 when the in vivo experiments demonstrate that an additional knockdown of YBox2 is required to inhibit packaging. Questions were also raised about the sequencing results regarding both the number of reads and their mapping.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Here, Schekman and colleagues examine the mechanism whereby specific miRNAs are sorted into exosomes using HEK293T cells as a model system.</p><p>They use a rigorous method to purify CD63 positive exosomes and find that miRs 223 and 144 are highly enriched in them relative to miRNAs in the cell. They then use a cell free system that appears to mimic the sorting and using affinity purification identify proteins bound to miR 223. YBOX1 emerges as a candidate sorting protein. Then using CRISPR knockouts of YBOX1 gene they implicate it as being involved in sorting the miRs to exosomes.</p><p>While the paper is clearly written and the experiments seem to be carefully performed and well controlled I do have some fairly significant concerns regarding the work and its interpretation.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) All mature miRNAs in the cell are complexed with an Ago protein as a necessary prerequisite for their maturation. It is clear that miR 223 goes through normal maturation since approximately 90% of miR 223 molecules in exosomes are the mature targeting strand. Accordingly it is unclear if the cell free assays are relevant since naked miR 223 is the substrate in these reactions. Much more appropriate would be reactions in which miR 223 was built up in cells (wherein exosome synthesis was blocked by inhibitor). Mixing of extracts from such cells with exosome competent extracts would be a good experiment. If such an experiment were not possible, building up of 223 in YBOX1 YBOX2 deficient cells could also be tried.</p><p>2) Building on the previous comment there seems to be an inconsistency in the latter part of the results. On one page it is stated that extracts from YBOX1 KO cells do not support packaging of miR 223.

They also established a cell-free reaction to recapitulate the exosome formation process with a focus on the sorting mechanism for miRNA cargoes. They further identified YBX1 as a key molecule required for sorting miR-223/144 into the exosome. Overall, this is a very interesting and well executed study that establishes a much needed biochemical tool for studying the exosome and understanding the mechanism of cargo sorting. I have a few points that should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1) The authors used small RNA sequencing to examine the miRNA profiles in the 293T cells and the purified exosome. However, the reads number was very low (58,848 total miRNA reads for the exosome and 511,555 total miRNAs for the cells). With the HiSeq platform, a single lane should yield at least 200M reads. Because the authors didn't provide the mapping information including how many total reads were generated, how many reads were mapped to miRNAs vs other RNAs, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of small RNA sequencing experiments. The very low reads number could be simply due to low coverage of the sequencing but could also be due to technical issues. Because the preferential loading of miR-223/144, which are lowly expressed by the cells but highly represented in the exosome, onto the exosome is a key finding of this study, it is important for the authors to provide more information for both exosome miRNA profiles and cellular miRNA profiles. Ideally, these experiments should be repeated or at least re-sequenced to generate deeper coverage.</p><p>2) To validate the biochemical purification scheme, the authors provided EM pictures to document the morphology and purity of the isolated exosome. The authors should analyze their exosome generated in their cell-free system with the same approach. Ideally, they should image the cytosol and membranes before reconstitution and the exosome after reconstitution to confirm the formation of exosome.</p><p>3) The authors used synthetic miR-223 to validate the sorting of this miRNA during cell-free exosome formation and to purify miR-223 associated proteins including YBX1. However, they used a single-stranded miR-223 for both experiments (based on the description in the method section). But I am not sure if this is the right approach. During miRNA biogenesis, one strand of the double-stranded miRNA duplex (post Dicer cleavage) is incorporated into an Ago protein. The incorporation of a single-stranded miRNA into Ago protein, which triggers a conformational change of the Ago protein according to multiple structural studies, is clearly important for the stability of both miRNA and Ago. In Dicer cKO when all miRNAs are abolished, Ago protein levels are strongly depleted and in Ago1/2 double KO most miRNAs are depleted. Therefore, it is unclear how much single-stranded, free miRNAs are available in the cytosol for sorting into the exosome. In addition, in the miR-223 associated proteome, the authors didn't identify Ago proteins. This result suggests that single-stranded miRNA can't be incorporated into Ago. The authors may consider to use miR-223 duplex for both experiments and determine how much miR-223 is sorted into the exosome and analyze whether YBX1 is still the main protein associated with the exosome miRNA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the article by Shurtleff et al. the RNA binding protein YBX1 is implicated in driving miRNAs (specifically miR-223 and miR-144) into exosomal compartments. This is demonstrated through a combination of cell culture experiments and reconstitution assays. A highlight of the article is that several experimental approaches are pioneered. The authors developed a method to purify exosomes from cell culture media using density gradients coupled to immunoisolation via CD63 antigen. Small RNA content in the isolates is then assessed through high-throughput sequencing, revealing a set of enriched miRNAs. The two most abundantly recovered miRNA species (miR-223 and miR-144) are validated for exosome loading through qPCR and biochemical assays. The sorting of miR-223 into exosomes is then reproduced in a cell-free assay, which is subsequently used as a system for identifying factors involved in the process-with the most highly recovered factor being YBX1. Finally, the authors demonstrate the dependency of miR-223 and miR-144 sorting on YBX1 using mutant cells.</p><p>The article provides strong evidence that YBX1 is responsible for sorting of miR-223 and miR-144 into exosomes in HEK cells. As mentioned above, this is accomplished through novel purification schemes that are satisfactorily validated. Furthermore, this is an exciting area of research into a phenomena that may lead to new clinical diagnostics. Thus the article is of sufficient quality and broad interest to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I feel there are a two additional experiments that if performed would significantly enhance the insights provided by the article into the functional consequences of sorting miRNAs into exosomes.</p><p>1) The authors discuss the types of miRNA species sorted into exosomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, which they subdivide into targeting, passenger, and precursor only. It is not clear what the authors mean by precursor only. Does this mean loop (products of dicer cleavage) or reads that map haphazardly to precursor hairpins? This is an important distinction. miRNA loops can become loaded and act as regulators in RISC. If loop species are what is meant by &quot;precursor only&quot; then shuttling of miRNAs may happen after loading into Argonautes. On the other hand if the recovered precursor species are derived from fragmented precursor then sorting of miRNAs may happen at the level of dicer/dicer loading complex before RISC formation. This has a significant implication: If miRNAs are diverted before Ago loading, exosome sorting may have an antagonistic role on miRNA function.</p><p>2) To further address the functional consequence of miRNA sorting into exosomes the authors should perform reporter assays for miR-223 and miR-144 mediated regulation in YBX1 mutant cells. If not sorted into exosomes do miRNAs show a gain in regulatory function? Is exosome sorting a mechanism for eliminating miRNAs from regulatory complexes? This will also provide insight into outstanding questions regarding the role of multivesicular bodies in miRNA regulation touched on in the discussion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Y-box protein 1 is required to sort microRNAs into exosomes in cells and in a cell-free reaction&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jim Manley (Senior Editor), Timothy Nilsen (Reviewing Editor and reviewer), and two other reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved from the original submission but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. All thought that the paper was significantly improved. One lingering question raised by two reviewers is whether miR-223 ever is correctly loaded by Ago proteins. Two complimentary approaches are suggested to answer this question. Please perform these analyses. Whatever the outcome the paper is now viewed to be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, assuming the minor revisions are incorporated. You can see the reviewers' specific comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, Shurtleff et al., has nicely addressed several issues raised during the initial review. In particular, they used single- or double-stranded miR-223 mimics to examine their incorporation to Ago2 in the cytosol and to test selective incorporation into exosome. They showed that whereas miR-223 can be correctly programmed with Ago2, Ago2 is not detectable in the exosome. Interestingly, duplex miR-223 has higher efficiency of incorporating into the exosome than the single-stranded counterpart. In addition, the &quot;correct&quot; guide-strand is incorporated into the exosome, implying the same strand sorting mechanism also works for the exosome. Together with the results that Ybx1 is required for incorporating miR-223 into the exosome, these data provide strong evidence that Ybx1 but not Ago2 is associated with miRNAs in the exosome. Overall, this revised manuscript is greatly improved and should be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I only have a few minor comments to enhance clarity of the paper.</p><p>1) The author should use either &quot;microRNA&quot; or &quot;miRNA&quot; but not both in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The paragraph between (Results section “Exosome biogenesis in vitro) is out of order as it discusses results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>. This was before the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a-c</xref> was discussed in the following paragraph.</p><p>3) For clarity, Temp information should be provided within the panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, instead of using the information from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the resubmission of the article: &quot;Y-box protein 1 is required to sort microRNAs into exosomes in cells and in a cell-free reaction&quot;, Shurtleff et al. added multiple experiments to explore the involvement of Ago2 in YBX1-mediated sorting of miRNAs into exosomes. These efforts showed that Ago2 is not interacting with RNAs localized to exosomes or with YBX1. Furthermore, they show duplex RNA to be more effectively sorted by YBX1 into exosomes. Together this provides some insight into the interaction of the miRNA biogenesis pathway and exosome sorting. The experiments do not distinguish, however, whether miRNAs associate with YBX1 before RISC loading or after displacement from Ago.</p><p>In my previous review I suggested authors inspect closely the alignment of small RNA reads in the exosome library to pre-miRNA hairpins. This has become a substantially more useful experiment in light of the Ago2 results. Properly processed hairpins will show precise cleavage patterns at documented Dicer cleavage sites. Clear guide, passenger, and loop reads can be recovered-all of which are competent for Ago loading. Do the exosome derived RNAs show the expected pattern? Indeed, the identity of the increased &quot;precursor&quot; reads in exosome libraries may provide insight into where diversion of miRNAs into exosomes occurs during their biogenesis. If precursor reads are not composed primarily of loop sequences, but rather reads that span Dicer cleavage sites this strongly suggests exosome sorting occurs before Ago loading, possibly in response to abortive Dicing. This may also help to explain why double stranded RNAs are more effectively bound by YBX1. At a minimum read alignments should be done for miR-233 and miR-144 to demonstrate the exosome sorted RNAs are appropriately processed.</p><p>Beyond this, I feel the manuscript is much improved. With this additional, easy test I support publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed the major concern regarding their initial submission; i.e. the apparent absence of an Ago protein in their pull down experiments. It seems that Ago must be displaced by YBOX1 during in vitro and in vivo packaging. Alternatively, biogenesis of miR-223 may bypass Ago involvement altogether which would be a remarkable result. To distinguish between these possibilities one additional experiment would be informative. In YBOX1 knockout cells miRs 223 and 144 accumulate inside of cells. Are these miRNAs associated with Ago? A simple IP and qPCR would answer this question. Subsequent work beyond the scope of this manuscript could then sort out the biochemistry of how YBOX1 could dissociate a tightly bound miRNA from Ago.

The secretion of miR-223 is significantly decreased in YBX1-KO cells but is further diminished after YBX2 knockdown.

We added this explanation to the revised manuscript. In addition, it is worth emphasizing that the two assays, ss RNA incorporation a cell-free reaction and RNA sorting into exosomes secreted by intact cells, are measured over quite different time scales: 20 min vs. one day.

It is often assumed that the machinery involved in exosome biogenesis is the same as the MVB machinery, a primary degradative pathway within the cell. It is not clear that over-expressing a single miRNA precursor could saturate the exosome producing apparatus. However, we believe the basis of this concern is addressed in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.

We believe that the strongest evidence for miR-223 and miR-144 as true exosomal miRNAs is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 e,f,g</xref> which shows that the miRNAs are enriched at each stage of the biochemical purification and are inside of detergent sensitive vesicles.

The input membrane fraction for the in vitro reaction is a crude sample containing all cellular membranes that sediment at 15,000Xg. This will include many different structures, including vesicles, membrane sheets as well as non-membranous structures. The formation of vesicles by EM pre and post incubation is unlikely to show any difference given the large excess of material in the reconstitution reaction. Furthermore, any vesicles that are seen might have been budded from other organelles present in the sample (e.g. ER or Golgi). Finally, it is not expected that the reconstitution forms free vesicles, but rather intralumenal vesicles within multivesicular bodies. These newly formed vesicles would not be visible using the simple negative staining EM presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p> <italic>3) The authors used synthetic miR-223 to validate the sorting of this miRNA during cell-free exosome formation and to purify miR-223 associated proteins including YBX1.
