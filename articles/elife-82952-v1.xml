While the anatomical substrates involved in head direction (HD) coding are well known, the mechanisms by which visual information updates HD representations remain poorly understood. Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in forming coherent representations of space in mammals and it encodes a variety of navigational variables, including HD. Here, we use simultaneous two-area tetrode recording to show that RSC HD representation is nearly synchronous with that of the anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (ADn), the obligatory thalamic relay of HD to cortex, during rotation of a prominent visual cue. Moreover, coordination of HD representations in the two regions is maintained during darkness. We further show that anatomical and functional connectivity are consistent with a strong feedforward drive of HD information from ADn to RSC, with anatomically restricted corticothalamic feedback. Together, our results indicate a concerted global HD reference update across cortex and thalamus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>head direction</kwd><kwd>retrosplenial cortex</kwd><kwd>anterodorsal thalamus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS106031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harnett</surname><given-names>Mark T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006919</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>James W. and Patricia T.

Changes in environmental information are known to trigger remapping of place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Muller and Kubie, 1987</xref>), grid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fyhn et al., 2007</xref>) and realignment of HD receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taube, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodridge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knierim et al., 1998</xref>). Visual cues influence the HD signal by providing an external anchoring reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taube, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taube and Burton, 1995</xref>), counteracting the drift from stochastic error in angular velocity integration observed in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mizumori and Williams, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stackman and Taube, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Valerio and Taube, 2012</xref>). In the insect and mammalian HD systems, realignment has been observed in the form of rotations of preferred firing directions (PFD) of HD cells in response to rotations of a prominent visual cue - often a color-contrast card (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taube, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodridge et al., 1998</xref>), a narrow band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>) or scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) on an LED screen. Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanisms, acting in specific circuit arrangements, have been proposed to explain these phenomena in the fly ellipsoid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Network models with similar architecture have been applied to the rodent HD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hahnloser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knight et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Page et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>). However, unlike the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franconville et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>), the circuitry that drives HD realignment in the rodent brain is not yet resolved. Several studies have indicated that cortical regions play a role in the stability and the visual anchoring of HD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golob and Taube, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodridge and Taube, 1997</xref>), but whether the HD representation is first aligned to the sensory cues in cortex and then updated in downstream regions is still unknown. Understanding the dynamics and the connectivity of visual-HD integration is the first necessary first step to uncover the mechanisms that lead to realignment in the mammalian HD system.</p><p>Previous studies in the rat indicate that the HD code in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADn), the necessary thalamic relay of HD to the hippocampal formation and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frost et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodridge and Taube, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jenkins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Winter et al., 2015</xref>), becomes unstable and is less likely to remap to reflect cue rotations after lesions to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2010</xref>) or the post-subiculum (POS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodridge and Taube, 1997</xref>). Both of these regions are strongly interconnected with visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Groen and Wyss, 2003</xref>), with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kononenko and Witter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</xref>), and with ADn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jankowski et al., 2013</xref>). While HD dominates the spatial code in POS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taube, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peyrache et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laurens et al., 2019</xref>), RSC exhibits diverse visuo-spatial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Sharp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Voigts and Harnett, 2020</xref>), with complex receptive fields shaped by multiple spatial correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander and Nitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike POS, which presents mostly homogeneous, cue-guided rotations of HD fields in response to rotations of a prominent visual cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taube, 1990</xref>), diverse responses of RSC HD cells to cue manipulations or specific environmental configurations have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sit and Goard, 2023</xref>), suggesting differential influence of idiothetic and allothetic cues and complex encoding schemes.</p><p>As a cortical association area, RSC plays a critical role in spatial cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knight and Hayman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vann et al., 2009</xref>) and spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2014</xref>): rats and humans with RSC lesions show impairments in route planning as well as identification and flexible use of navigational landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hindley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pothuizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vann and Aggleton, 2004</xref>). Specifically, in the intact RSC, associations between egocentric and allocentric reference frames become evident with spatial tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shine and Wolbers, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van Wijngaarden et al., 2020</xref>). These kinds of computations might underlie the emergence of navigational landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Page and Jeffery, 2018</xref>), as sensory stimuli that appear in the egocentric view and, having been deemed reliable, are ultimately mapped to an abstract representation of space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry and Burgess, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bicanski and Burgess, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, this evidence strongly implicates RSC in the integration of visual orienting cues and HD. Moreover, RSC is also necessary for path integration-based navigation in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elduayen and Save, 2014</xref>), likely by integrating motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yamawaki et al., 2016</xref>) and angular velocity signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hennestad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keshavarzi et al., 2022</xref>) together with the incoming HD from thalamic nuclei and POS, to form a representation of orientation. However, while the coordination between POS and ADn HD representations has been already elucidated across wake and sleep states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>), it is unknown how visually-guided changes in HD representation are coordinated between RSC and ADn. We sought to answer this question by performing simultaneous single unit recording in RSC and ADn in freely moving mice while a visual cue was either rotated around the arena or turned off.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential HD encoding in RSC and ADn</title><p>To monitor single unit activity in RSC and ADn, we implanted independently movable tetrodes assembled in a lightweight microdrive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Voigts et al., 2020</xref>) targeting the two regions simultaneously in nine mice. We additionally recorded from RSC alone in two mice, and used carbon fiber electrodes to record from ADn in one more mouse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref> for electrolytic lesions in ADn and RSC for each mouse). During the recordings, mice could freely roam in a dark circular arena of 50 cm diameter, inside a large sealed box. The only visual cue was provided by an illuminated subset of LEDs spanning an angle of 20Â° which formed a wider circle outside and above the arena. Fifty-four percent of the units we recorded under these conditions in ADn met our criterion for HD cells, whereas 12% in RSC did so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B&amp;C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-C</xref> for more examples of HD units). Our HD cell selection method relied on the amount of directional information, the magnitude of the resultant and the concentration parameter from the tuning curve or the von Mises fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LaChance et al., 2022</xref>) to the largest peak for multi-peak units against those obtained from shuffling the spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and finally on the replication of these in two different segments of a session while the cue is stable (ADn: 11 HD units with 2 peaks, 139 with 1; RSC: 2 HD units with 2 peaks, 71 with 1). RSC displayed a modest HD code, in agreement with previous findings in rats and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Sharp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shine and Wolbers, 2021</xref>): directional information in RSC was lower than in ADn (bits/spike, median: ADn HD = 0.084, n=150; RSC HD = 0.015, n=73; ADn non-HD=0.011, n=122; RSC non-HD=0.006, n=584; Kruskal-Wallis test p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.0001 for multiple comparisons, except for ADn nonHD versus RSC HD p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), as well as the median resultant length (median: ADn HD = 0.21, n=150; RSC HD = 0.084, n=73; ADn non-HD=0.047, n=122; RSC non-HD=0.041, n=584; Kruskal-Wallis test p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.0001 for multiple comparisons, except for ADn versus RSC HD, p=0.0031, and nonHD, p=0.028, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>).

Previous work with cue card rotations indicates that HD cells in ADn rotated their preferred directions coherently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yoganarasimha et al., 2006</xref>), but it remains unclear if the same applies to RSC. To further investigate whether RSC HD ensembles stay coherent in our behavioral setting, we calculated the angle offsets between the tuning curves of all unique simultaneous HD pairs before and after cue rotation. As expected, the preferred direction difference between pairs of ADn HD neurons remained rigid after cue rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, circular correlation = 0.91, n=603 pairs, 10 mice). In RSC HD cells, we observed a smaller yet significant correlation (0.28, n=269 pairs, 9 mice) in the preferred direction difference of RSC HD pairs between before and after cue rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

We quantified the stability in HD tuning as the correlation between the preferred firing directions (PFD) of HD cells calculated from two consecutive segments with the same stable cue orientation. We found that RSCâs PFDs were significantly stable although less than ADn HD units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F</xref>, ADn left n=150, correlation = 0.93, RSC right n=73, correlation = 0.79, p&lt;0.0001 for both). Furthermore, the strength of HD tuning, quantified as the resultant, did not change between two sample trials from selected significant cue rotation sessions across RSC HD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3G</xref> right, n=71, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test p=0.79, median before = 0.086, after = 0.088) as well as ADn HD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3G</xref> left, n=128, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test p=0.23, median before = 0.22, after = 0.23).</p><p>To compare how both regions responded to cue rotations, we calculated the mean preferred direction shifts for RSC and ADn HD ensembles. Despite a bias toward the inertial (self-motion-driven) HD estimate, evident through the higher density of rotations around 0, the rotations from simultaneously recorded ADn and RSC HD ensembles were more correlated (coefficient = 0.54 from unique ensembles for different sizes and directions of rotations, 7 mice) than those produced by random shifting of RSC and ADn neural activity around the cue rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The result held when trials from the same ensembles with similar (large or small, negative or positive) ADn rotations were not averaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3L</xref>, correlation = 0.48, p&lt;0.01, above the 99th shuffle percentile). This suggested that the HD map is well-locked between the two regions in our behavioral paradigm, despite the differences in HD encoding between ADn and RSC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synchronous shifting of HD representations in ADn and RSC in response to cue rotations</title><p>Based on the tuning curves of our HD cells, we concluded that RSC and ADn encode the same HD reference, regardless of whether they shift with cue rotation or disregard the cue as an orienting landmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). However, it was not clear if ADn and RSC also coordinate at a finer temporal scale in response to the cue rotation. To answer this question, we applied a decoding approach to infer the HD representation from the entire recorded population at a high temporal resolution (20ms bins) in ADn and RSC. We implemented a linear-Gaussian generalized model (GLM) that related ADn or RSC ensemble neural activity to HD obtained from behavioral tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). For each trial we estimated the weight coefficients based on the stable cue period before rotation, excluding the last 120 s, and tested the model on the remaining stable period, by calculating the difference between the decoded HD and the HD from headstage tracking, which we will refer to as âdecoded errorâ. For each session, we compared the accuracy, calculated as the median of the absolute decoded error, with that obtained by decoding HD from shuffled firing rates. For further analyses, we selected sessions where the error was lower than the 10th percentile of 100 shuffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). From the remaining sessions, the median decoded error from the test period was 36.32Â° in ADn (n=36 unique ensembles) and 47.53Â° in RSC (n=29 ensembles) (p=0.0039, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). However, given that HD is modulated by angular velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3K</xref>&amp;L, left panels for cue on modulation of the peak firing rate of the HD tuning curves, ADn n=91, median AV &gt;30Â°/s 53.7 Hz, AV &lt;30/s=50.4 Hz, p&lt;0.0001 Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test; RSC n=27, median AV &gt;30Â°/s 32.2 Hz, AV &lt;30/s=26.6 Hz, p&lt;0.0001 Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test), we considered whether the decoding accuracy was affected by these state changes. Indeed, decoding performance dropped for high compared to low angular velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E, F</xref>), (low angular velocity medians: ADn = 33.4Â°, RSC = 43.4Â°, high angular velocity medians: ADn = 39.4Â°, RSC = 60.9Â°). Two-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between the two regions (p&lt;0.0001) and also between the two velocity states (p=0.0012), but no effect for the interaction between the two variables (p&gt;0.05), suggesting that the angular velocity effect was largely similar between the two regions.</p><p>The errors from our GLM decoder reflected the mean rotations of the ensemble HD neurons tuning curves both from ADn and RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G, H</xref>, 0.73 and 0.75 circular correlation coefficients for ADn, n=113, and RSC, n=59 unique ensembles for different sizes and directions of rotations, respectively, p&lt;0.0001 for both) suggesting that our method largely captured the changes in neural activity with cue rotation.

Similarly, we also observed a high density of decoded rotation values around zero. This effect likely resulted from devaluation or bias toward internal HD estimates caused by the familiarity with the arena and by the consecutive cue change creating a mismatch between the internal HD and the visually HD reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knierim et al., 1998</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Synchronous shifting of ADn and RSC HD representation in response to cue rotation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, Example of decoded HD in ADn (top, blue line) and RSC (bottom, red line) from a simultaneous recording in the two regions before and after cue rotation (green line at t=0 s).

To isolate the effect of change of the HD reference, we included only trials where the absolute mean HD shift was at least 17.2Â° or above. While some trial-to-trial variability in the correlation level was observed, the majority of trials had peaks at 0ms time lags (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between data and null distribution, p&lt;0.0001 for both stable and shifted), both before and after cue rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>; Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test p=0.88, n=28 unique ensembles from 108 trials). Similar results were obtained for shorter decoded error traces immediately after cue rotation (25 s window), albeit with higher variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov p&lt;0.0001 for both stable and shifted; Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test between shifted and stable p=0.40). This confirmed that the two regions were coordinated even in the initial stages of the shifting of the HD representation.</p><p>To check that the 0 lag peaks were not originating from spurious cross-correlation values of long and jittering decoded error traces, we assessed the difference in decoded HD and decoded HD error between the two regions, in short (5 s) segments to cover a total of 35 s and plotted the absolute median for different time lags. In principle, this approach should mirror that of the temporal cross-correlation, whereby the time lags corresponding to the smallest difference values would reveal whether there was a temporal offset between the two HD representations. The difference in the decoded HD showed a trend toward 0ms coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>, ensemble averages from 108 individual trials), but this effect was weak. In theory, if there was a detectable temporal offset, it would be masked by opposing HD difference values caused by varying AV directions and directions of rotations. To obviate these problems, we evaluated the difference in decoded HD errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C</xref>), after ensuring the final rotations had all the same sign. We found that a great majority of the trials had troughs at 0ms lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3D</xref>, n=108 trials, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test p=0.83). We evaluated this relationship for independent ensembles (n=28) by taking the median across trials from the same ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E, F</xref>) and found the same result (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test p=0.92). We ensured that the variance in the â5â5 s lags was correlated with the variance of the tracked HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3G</xref>, n=108 trials, correlation <italic>r</italic>=0.389 for the stable, <italic>r</italic>=0.302 after rotation, p&lt;0.0001 for both).</p><p>Contrary to our predictions (i.e. that RSC would lead the HD reference update via visual integration of the cueâs new angular position), we found that the two regions were synchronized (within 20ms) in this regard. Variability was observed in the histograms from the cross-correlations after cue rotation, but they lacked any specific bias for anticipatory or delayed time lags. Changes in the neural activity, and therefore in HD decoding, could emerge following the cue rotation as a response to visual stimuli, potentially explaining the slightly decreased synchrony compared to stable cue periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Correlated HD drift in darkness in ADn and RSC</title><p>Visual cues are essential for stabilizing the HD reference map and guide orientation, however it is unknown if they are necessary for maintaining the coordination of HD representations in ADn and RSC. To resolve this issue, we challenged the sense of orientation in a subset of mice by turning the LED off after a period of cue-on baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). HD cells maintained the same initial preferred directions while the cue was on in a stable position, but were more variable while the cue was off, and sometimes continuously drifted during prolonged darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Moreover, it modulates ADn and RSC peak firing of HD neurons in both cue-on and cue-off conditions (p&lt;0.0001 between AV &gt;30Â°/s and AV &lt;30Â°/s for both cue-on medians = 53.7 and 50.4, respectively, and cue-off medians = 51.2 and 47.2 for ADn, n=91; p&lt;0.0001 also between AV &gt;30Â°/s and AV &lt;30Â°/s for both cue-on medians = 32.2 and 26.6, respectively, and cue-off medians = 30.8 and 26.3 for RSC, n=27, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests between AV states). We next asked how this variable affects the relationship between the internal HD of ADn and RSC when the cue is turned off. We isolated time points of high and low angular velocity (cut-off of 30Â°/s) and calculated the circular correlation between ADn and RSC HD drifts in the two light conditions.

To this end, we performed spike cross correlation between all possible ADn-RSC pairs, considering the spikes occurring during cue-on periods. Putative monosynaptic connections were identified in the cross correlograms as sharp peaks above the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) between 1 and 5ms from the time of ADn unit firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Using this metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stark and Abeles, 2009</xref>), we identified 6.88% of all possible pairs with a monosynaptic connection in the ADn-to-RSC direction (348 out of 5056) and only 0.08% in the RSC-to-ADn direction (4 out of 5056). In terms of unit counts, 91 out of 326 ADn units had at least one connection to RSC, while only 4 out of 749 RSC units had a connection with ADn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The mean number of RSC synaptic partners was 4.23 for ADn HD cells and 0.04 for non-HD cells. When we focused on the connectivity during darkness, we found similar results: 35 out of 161 units in ADn (3 mice) had at a connection, while no RSC units were connected. The generally lower connectivity rate was likely due to the reduced sample size of cue-off trials, but suggested that even in the absence of visual cues corticothalamic projections were not a substrate for HD coordination. ADnâs dense connectivity largely originated from identified HD cells (275 connected pairs from ADn HD cells versus 72 from non-HD ADn cells) and included both HD as well as non-HD partner cells in RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). HD-coding was a feature of both RS and FS units in RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), and both groups received ADn connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, left plot).</p><p>Finally, the distribution of the preferred direction differences between ADn HD-coding units and their HD-coding synaptic partners in RSC showed a small but significant bias toward similar tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> left polar plot, n=73 units, 28 RS and 47 FS, 6 mice, circular mean â5.4Â° with a circular standard deviation of 61Â°, Rayleigh test for non-uniformity p=0.005 for the RS synaptic partners only, p=0.002 when both cell types were combined). This similarity bias was not observed for the preferred direction differences between the same ADn units and all other non-synaptically connected HD-coding units, whose distribution was uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> right polar plot, n=73, 65 RS and 8 FS units, Rayleigh test p=0.052 for the RS units, p=0.086 for RS and FS combined). Together, these results suggest that ADn sustains the RSC HD code with a widespread feedforward connectivity to both RS and FS units, a connectivity that targets not only HD-tuned units, directly shaping their preferred directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), but also units with more complex, presumably multimodal, receptive fields. On the other hand, the very sparse RSC-to-ADn connections that we identified are, alone, unlikely to drive the change or the stability, in the presence of visual cues, in preferred directions in ADn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data show that the HD representation in ADn and RSC is closely coordinated, both in conditions when visual cues are stable and during adaptation to a new reference in response to cue rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). This is also true for HD drift in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E and G</xref>), showing that visual input is not necessary for maintaining these coordinated representations, and that other sensory modalities, such as angular velocity, optic flow, and/or motor efference copy, influence ADn and RSC HD. Finally, our functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) supports the ADn-RSC HD coordination through a strong feedforward input to RSC, which shapes the local HD code there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FâH</xref>). Specifically, the bias toward similar tuning between connected ADn and RSC HD units suggests that ADn HD code might not be simply inherited in RSC, as has been shown in POS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peyrache et al., 2017</xref>), but likely integrated with other spatial codes via different circuit organization principles, that include recruitment of FS and RS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simonnet et al., 2017</xref>). We conclude that the visually driven updating of the internal HD is a more complex process that privileges coordination across brain regions over sustained error signals with mismatched representations. However, the temporal resolution of the decoding occludes potential faster dynamics, at the scale of monosynaptic connections (ms range). Furthermore, given the reports of cells that track internal and external spaces and are able to bind HD and prominent visual information especially in dysgranular RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sit and Goard, 2023</xref>) and in posterior cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LaChance et al., 2022</xref>), further investigation is needed on the presence of these specific firing patterns in set ups similar to that described here and on their activity in relation to ADn firing to better understand the mechanisms of realignment.</p><p>Using a simple generalized linear encoding model of HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), we decoded HD at a fine (20ms) temporal scale with ensembles of 3â30 units ADn and 8â110 in RSC.

Whether these conditions affect the speed of these shifts in our paradigm is unknown. Slow, continuous drifts of the HD representation after cue rotation as reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3H</xref>) have also been observed in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim, 2017</xref>) and in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knierim et al., 1998</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajabi et al., 2023</xref>) ADn, with the exception of one study in the rat ADn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zugaro et al., 2003</xref>) where immediate HD shifting was observed in specific cue-heading configurations. While behavioral and arena-configuration differences may underlie this discrepancy, it remains to be resolved if the cause of such slow drifts lies in: (1) the configuration of the polarizing visual stimulus, including the distance between the cue and the mouse, with farther away cues being less impacted by egocentric view and having more control over HD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zugaro et al., 2001</xref>; (2) the memory of previous experiences of cue rotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajabi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knierim et al., 1995</xref>); and/or (3) the intrinsic time course of synaptic plasticity associated with the learning of the new landmark orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodridge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Page et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Whether distinct circuit mechanisms are recruited to coordinate the learning of the new orienting cue according to the behavioral demands and the complexity of the navigation task is not known.

This asymmetry was more extreme than that observed in previously reported ADn-POS connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peyrache et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Groen and Wyss, 1990b</xref>), and possibly exacerbated by the widespread sampling of RSC locations in our recordings, across granular and dysgranular portions, with a higher concentration of tetrodes in the upper L2/3 and L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and 9 out of 48 cortical tetrodes in mice with simultaneous ADn and RSC recordings in L6. Further denser sampling of layer 6 in RSC, and more specifically in the granular portion, where ADnâs presynaptic partners in RSC are mostly found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shibata, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), are needed to clarify the role of the anatomically-identified corticothalamic projections in the visual updating of ADn-RSC HD reference. RSC also extends over 1.5 mm in the anterior posterior axis, and it is possible our recordings have missed hotspots in the more posterior granular RSC bordering POS. Given that RSC displays a gradient along the anterior-posterior axis in encoding egocentric versus allocentric navigational variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hennestad et al., 2021</xref>), future studies should address whether this anterior-posterior specialization is reflected not only in visual and HD computations, but also on downstream synaptic connectivity.</p><p>How would the visual cue integration that anchors HD be reflected in the ensemble representation? We hypothesized that an âerrorâ signal would appear as a temporal offset in the HD of the two regions: specifically, the RSC HD update by integration of visual inputs, would precede that of other regions, in our case ADn. Contrary to this hypothesis, our decoding showed no temporal offset in HD representation during shifting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3AâF</xref>). Importantly, this was true regardless of the exact control of the cue over the realignment. At the same time, even in the absence of visual cues, RSC and ADn were closely coordinated during small and large HD drifts, a phenomenon that has recently been proposed to be mediated by intact cerebellar inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fallahnezhad et al., 2023</xref>). This coordination, which we directly show under two visual challenges, is likely sustained by a strong and widespread feedforward ADn-to-RSC connectivity, where the updated HD reference may already be computed upstream of ADn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yoder et al., 2015</xref>). This framework is consistent with an existing hypothesis that visual anchoring may compete with and, depending on the manipulation, dynamically bias the memory of the internal estimation from angular velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajabi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knierim et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides new insight on the relative dynamics of HD realignment and drift and on the direct connectivity between ADn and RSC ensembles. The HD coordination and striking sparseness of RSC-to-ADn connectivity do not preclude, however, that RSC could support the change in HD reference through activation of dedicated ensembles encoding the orienting âlandmarkâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bicanski and Burgess, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Page and Jeffery, 2018</xref>) or with conjunctive HD-visual fields. In fact, RSC is necessary for ADn HD alignment to visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2010</xref>) and the dense interconnection between RSC and several regions of the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</xref>) may support coordinated HD representation across the brain as a mechanism to ensure consistent flexible spatial computations relevant to behavior output. Future experiments using multi-site high-density recordings with laminar probes in RSC could directly assess the activity patterns, at the single unit and population level, associated with the learning of the new cue orientation and the reliability (or unreliability) of a landmark.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Behavior and subjects</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with NIH and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on Animal care guidelines.

Four females and eight males were used for tetrode recordings, and two 12-week-old mice were used for modified rabies tracing experiments in RSC, one mouse for rabies and one for red retrobeads tracing experiments in ADn. Mice were kept on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with unrestricted access to water. Eight of the implanted mice underwent mild (up to a 10% reduction in body weight) food restriction. Of the implanted mice, eight were housed isolated in conventional cages, four with siblings in rat cages with running wheels.

The arena was enclosed in a 78x86 Ã 84 cm wooden dark box to shield from lighting and noise. In food deprived mice, pellets (Bioserve) were sprinkled on the floor to allow continuous exploration during long recordings. To provide novelty in the environment and induce exploration, two types of arena walls (black pvc with a white paper at the upper edge and opaque clear plastic) were used and changed when the cue rotation did not produce shifts in the HD tuning.</p><p>The visual cue was a set of computer-controlled (Teensy 3.2) LEDs spanning an angle of 20Â° with brightness following a gaussian with peak at the center and sd of 1. 2 weeks after surgery mice were habituated to a single cue or no cue at all while units were monitored. Different starting cue angular positions for the recording sessions were sampled and different sequences of rotations of Â±90Â° and Â±45Â° were played. For recordings with the Open-Ephys ONIX system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Newman et al., 2023</xref>) with the commutator, rotations and cue on-off switches occurred every 20â40 min, versus the 5â20 min for recordings with the first generation Open-Ephys system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Siegle et al., 2017</xref>) without commutator.

To increase the yield of units especially for ADn, some guide tube positions were occupied by two tetrodes. Tetrodes were constructed from 12.7 Î¼m nichrome wired (Sandvik â Kanthal, QH PAC polyimide coated) with an automated tetrode twisting machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Newman et al., 2020</xref>) and were gold plated to lower the impedance to a final value between 150 and 300 kOhm.

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2% induction, 0.75â1.25% maintenance in 1 l/min oxygen) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. Body temperature was maintained with a feedback-controlled heating pad (DC Temperature Control System, FHC). Slow-release buprenorphine (1 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (4 mg/kg) were pre-operatively injected subcutaneously. After shaving of the scalp, application of hair-removal cream and disinfection with iodine and ethanol, an incision was made to expose the skull. For implants, after cleaning with ethanol, the skull was scored and a base of dental cement (C&amp;B Metabond and Ivoclar Vivadent Tetric EvoFlow) was applied. A burr hole was drilled over prefrontal cortex close to the olfactory bulb for placement of the ground screw (stainless steel) connected to a silver wire. Sometimes an additional burr hole and ground screw, connected to the other with silver epoxy, provided extra stability. For drive implants with tetrode arrays, a large craniotomy from ~0.3 to~3 mm from Bregma, and from the midline to ~0.95 mm ML at the level of M2 and ~0.7 mm ML at the level of RSC was drilled. After durotomy, the drive was lowered onto the surface of the brain with one RSC (AP ~2.400, ML ~0.150 mm, DV ~0.200 mm) and one ADn (AP ~0.350 mm, ML ~0.975 mm, DV ~1.800 mm) -targeting tetrodes extended for guiding the placement of the array. For the carbon fibers implant, a smaller (~1 mm diameter) craniotomy, followed by durotomy, allowed lowering of the bundle of fibers into ADn (AP: 0.68 mm, ML 0.75 mm, DV 2.65 mm). The drive, or the fiber frame, was then secured to the skull with dental cement, the skin incision was partially closed with sutures and the mouse was placed in a clean cage with wet food and a heating pad and monitored until fully recovered.

After implant surgery, ADn-targeting tetrodes were lowered until HD-coding cells were identified based on their tuning obtained from brief recordings, and RSC targeting tetrodes were slowly lowered until well-isolated units appeared. When at least two HD cells in ADn were first detected, recordings of cue rotation or cue-on-off sessions were collected over a minimum of 2 weeks and up to 8 months. Tetrodes in ADn and RSC were regularly moved by ~20â150 Âµm increments, followed by recordings of short stable cue-on sessions to verify if the yield was improved. To avoid sampling of the same units for HD neurons quantifications and spike correlations for monosynaptic connections, units from selected sessions based on the movement of tetrodes and the number of units recorded and from only one session for the carbon fiber-implanted mouse and one for the large were included in these analyses. At the end of the experiments, electrolytic lesions were obtained by passing positive and negative current (20â25 ÂµA) on each electrode contact for 5 s with a stimulus isolator (A365RC, WPI) while the animal was under isofluorane-induced anesthesia.

All spiking and behavioral data, with exception of the spike times for the detection of monosynaptic connections, was binned in 20ms bins. Behavioral tracking from the light receivers was linearly interpolated. Circular Statistic Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berens, 2009</xref>) functions were employed such as circular means for quantifications of HD unitsâ preferred firing directions (PFD), mean ensemble rotations and peak offsets, as well as neural population and decoded errors mean rotations and drifts, confidence intervals, tests of uniformity of angles, and circular correlations between decoded errors, PFD offsets of HD cell pairs between trials, PFDs within trials and mean ensemble rotations. Where the data was not circular, such as absolute values of angles, standard metrics and Pearson correlations coefficient were calculated.</p><p>Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâG</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3G</xref> included only 1 trial per selected sessions with unique ensemble cells, where significant tuning curves rotations were observed and finally where each direction bin had a 1 s minimum occupancy. This was to avoid smoothing PFDs offsets by averaging across before-after rotation segments. For comparisons of HD unitsâ properties between cue-on and cue-off in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3HâL</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F</xref>, metrics for individual units were obtained by averaging across trials within the same session, which were again selected to sample unique ensembles following tetrode movements and changes in recorded unit numbers. A similar session selection criterion was used for the functional connectivity, where unique combinations of ADn-RSC ensembles were used. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D&amp;E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3DâG</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1CâF</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3AâG</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>&amp;B the metrics of trials from largely overlapping ensembles were averaged and the statistics were performed on unique ensembles. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G, H</xref> data was presented as mean and standard errors of the rotation values from overlapping ensembles and between ranges of large positive, small positive, null, large negative and small negative and large negative rotations.</p><p>The difference in decoded HD or decoded HD errors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref> was calculated as the median of the absolute medians of the wrapped difference in decoded HD (or HD error) of 7, non-overlapping 5 s segments, to cover a total of 35 s of stable test and realignment following cue rotation periods. Absolute medians from trials from the same ensembles were combined.</p><p>Two-tailed Kolmogorov Smirnov tests were used to compare the time lags of peak correlation between ADn and RSC decoded errors vs the null distribution obtained from 100 shuffles, and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests to compare the peak correlation values before and after cue rotation. Shuffle distributions for the decoded rotations in ADn and RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>&amp;H) were obtained by decoding the HD from circularly shifted spikes by random amounts 100 times. For analyses on decoded HD, trials were included if the decoding accuracy from that session was above 90% of that from shuffle spikes. Shuffle distributions for the decoded errors (both for dark and cue-rotation drifts) were obtained by circularly shifting the tracked HD by random amounts 100 times and subtracting it from the RSC decoded HD. Significant ensemble preferred directions rotations were determined if at least half of the HD cells experienced preferred direction shifts larger than the 98th percentile of a distribution obtained by randomly reassigning 500 times the indices around that rotation trial. p-Value thresholds of 0.05 were used for statistical non-parametric tests. Multiple comparison tests were performed with Bonferroni-correction.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>The author is a board member of Open Ephys Inc, a public benefit workers cooperative in Atlanta GA</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>The author is president of Open Ephys Inc, a public benefit workers cooperative in Atlanta GA</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Software, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Software, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with NIH and MassachusettsInstitute of Technology Committee on Animal care guidelines (protocol number 0521-036-24).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82952-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Recording Sessions Summary.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-82952-supp1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data and associated code have been uploaded on Dryad at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z3555">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z3555</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van der Goes</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Voigts</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Toloza</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Murugan</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Harnett</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Coordinated Head Direction Representations in Mouse Anterodorsal Thalamic Nucleus and Retrosplenial Cortex</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.dfn2z3555</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hongkui Zeng, Shenqin Yao, Ali Cetin, and the Allen Institute as well as Ian Wickersham and Heather Sullivan for sharing monosynaptic rabies tracing viral constructs.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While each reviewer has raised a number of specific concerns about the present study, there was an agreement that the following essential revisions needed to be addressed to warrant the publication of the manuscript.</p><p>1) The study claims that the 0-lag correlation in decoding error demonstrates a near-synchronous encoding of HD in the AD-RSC network. However, this observation may arise from erroneous decoding and video tracking. Specifically, the decoding seems quite unreliable at times, and concomitant errors in HD tracking and/or decoding would lead to a high 0-lag correlation. This problem can be addressed by measuring correlation at times of reliable decoding only and possibly using decoding techniques depending less on the neuron's tuning curves (i.e. unsupervised techniques).</p><p>2) Cue rotation did not necessarily lead to a shift in the internal HD signal. It seems like the animals after some time ignored the position changes of the visual cue. In this context, it doesn't make much sense to qualify the update of the HD reference as &quot;successful&quot;. It would perhaps be better to include the first rotations or include only the trials that led to a substantial rotation of the internal HD.</p><p>3) There are some concerns about the quality of the spike sorting and criteria used for the identification of HD cells, as example tuning curves seem broader than what has been previously reported. Additional examples and quantification of sorting quality could address this problem.</p><p>4) Considering how critical the number of simultaneously recorded neurons is to evaluate the reliability of decoding, the study should include a detailed table of the number of neurons per session, etc.</p><p>5) Along the same lines, whether recordings at the same tetrode depth were included as independent samples is unclear. A detailed table of sessions, tetrode position, number of cells, etc. would be very informative.</p><p>6) The limitations regarding RSC-to-AD connectivity should be carefully discussed as RSC projecting neurons are likely in layer 6 only and may not have been sampled as well as other layers. Furthermore, only one tracing technique was used, not ruling out the possibility that these viruses have a poor tropism for this specific pathway.</p><p>The authors are invited to address as much as possible specific comments from the reviewers, appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While I believe there are very strong points to this manuscript as noted above, some concerns about the experimental design have dampened my enthusiasm a bit. I have a series of specific questions.</p><p>1. The design of the behavioral protocols is not ideal to draw conclusions on visual landmark updating, as the visual cue was not presented as a reliable landmark for the animal. (It had shifted repeatedly while the animal was in the arena, and therefore probably underwent 'devaluation' (line 428) over time, and 90{degree sign} cue rotations often gave rotations of the neural representation of HD around 0 (cf line 1069)). If I understand correctly, this means that the animals after some time ignored the position changes of the visual cue. In this context, it doesn't make much sense to qualify the update of the HD reference as &quot;successful&quot; (line 261), after cue rotation, when an HD shift of &gt; x{degree sign} is observed. It is a mismatch situation, and the mouse might rely more on self-information, proprioceptive and vestibular, than on the moving visual cue. I suggest changing the wording (&quot;successful&quot;). Beyond that, could it be helpful to include only the first few cue rotation experiments for a given animal? Before it considers the visual cue as unreliable.</p><p>There might be an opportunity to investigate more deeply the effects of learning cue reliability (or unreliability) over time.</p><p>2. Can you rule out potentially confounding effects of recordings obtained during early or late phases of the repeated exposures to the visual stimuli, that would affect the coherence between the AD and RSC HD representations? Are there more or less HD cells over time, when the animals have more prior experience with the environment?</p><p>3. To help the reader to better understand how the experiments were structured, I suggest including an overview table, indicating, per mouse, for each of the 12 mice of this study:</p><p>Mouse id;</p><p>Tetrode positions in Suppl Figure 1;</p><p>Which experimental protocols were run;</p><p>How many sessions/trials;</p><p>How many units in AD and/or in RSC were recorded;</p><p>How many of them were HD or nonHD cells;</p><p>Number of possible AD â AD pairs;</p><p>Number of possible RSC â RSC pairs;</p><p>Number of possible AD â RSC pairs.</p><p>4. Often times persistence of directional firing in the dark is used as a criterion for Head direction firing, and it may be useful to distinguish HD cells from visually responsive cells for example. I saw that 3 mice were tested in the dark (Figure 3), does it mean 9 mice were not? (How sure would you be to qualify directionally tuned cells as HD cells, and not visually responsive cells, if a dark condition was missing?)</p><p>Furthermore, the criteria for HD cells typically include cue control. Because of the lack of a disorientation period during the cue rotation, this may be difficult to affirm for the protocols used here. Do you think it is still justified to qualify all the directionally tuned neurons as HD cells?</p><p>Did you examine if units identified as HD might change and become nonHD (or vice versa) across different recording conditions?</p><p>In the dark recordings, do you find that some directionally tuned cells become silent, and might those be cells responding to the visual cue?</p><p>5. Please show more examples of tuning curves of HD and nonHD cells in addition to those in Figure 1B. I would find it more convincing and also a helpful resource, for reference, to see the range of different shapes of the tuning curves in AD and in RSC, their width, and peak firing rates.</p><p>How many HD cells have more than 1 peak (suppl Figure 2A), in AD and in RSC?</p><p>6. All head direction cells were pooled together to produce suppl Figure 2D. In an ideal setting, one would expect the diagonal of preferred peak firing directions to be straight and to show uniform coverage of the 360{degree sign}, at least for ADn. This is not entirely the case. Could some of the HD cells be cells that are tuned to the visual cue? Can you indicate the cue position(s) on the graph, and might they be overrepresented?</p><p>7. Decoding: how many neurons were included? A range is given in the Discussion section, line 423, this information should rather be moved to the methods, and the actual number of simultaneously recorded units for each ensemble (Figures2, 3, S6) indicated in the results (or figure legends). How may this number influence the accuracy of the decoding?</p><p>8. What is the firing frequency in light and in dark (Figure 3, suppl Figure 6), and is decoding still reliably carried out at low firing frequencies?</p><p>9. Figure 2C. It may be misleading to label the Y axis as a 'decoded error' with respect to a visual cue when the visual cue might not function as a visual landmark (see point 1, the mouse might rely more on self-information, proprioceptive and vestibular, than the visual cue). Figure 2C would benefit from showing more time before 0 (baseline).</p><p>10. Line 359 states that AD-to-RSC connectivity was divergent, but in Figure 4H it appears that four differently tuned AD neurons, in blue, contact two (same?) RSC neurons (same-shaped tuning curves 1-2, and 3-4). Is this a mistake? Also, can you confirm that the RSC (red) traces all qualified as HD units (it looks quite untuned by the eye)?</p><p>11. In addition to the connectivity rates indicated in Figure 4, I would suggest also including the numbers for ADn-ADn and RSC-RSC pairwise connectivity rates, for comparison, and for the sake of completeness.</p><p>12. line 274, &quot;highly synchronized&quot; â please indicate the time scale.</p><p>13. It is not easy to read the color codes in some instances, including Figure 4G FS vs RS; especially when histograms overlap, also in Figure S2BC and Figure S6A.</p><p>14. Figure 4 rabies tracing: There is only one example for each, please indicate n = 1, unless there are more experiments that are not shown (in which case, please show them in the supplementary data). In B, why are the presynaptically labelled cells in RSC red? Shouldn't they be green?</p><p>Figure 4G: Is there really similar tuning between connected Ad and RSC HD units (line 451)? Even if the circular mean of the RS peak differences is at -7.44{degree sign} (Figure 4G), very few pairs seem to have such a small difference in preferred head direction.</p><p>15.

Mouse numbers:</p><p>Line 74, 9 mice were simultaneously recorded;</p><p>Line 97, 8 miceâ¦ which is correct?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors state that 'our results provide direct evidence against the hypothesis that visually guided updates in the HD reference would first appear in the RSC' (page 17 lines 416ff). This is indeed a strong statement, but I am not sure it is entirely supported by the authors' data. I wonder if a temporal offset in cue-rotation responses between AD and RSC HD cells might have gone undetected in the authors' study (see also point 2 below). For example, the visual update drive â in the form of e.g. an excitatory input from RCS that realigns HD cells in the AD- could be difficult to detect, considering the temporal resolution of the authors' experimental design. Hence, it is difficult to prove a 'negative result' here. The authors refer to two possible limitations (page 20 lines 491-492): 'cue devaluation with repeated trials' and 'temporal control of the cue rotation'. Is it conceivable that these limitations might have prevented the observation of a temporal delay between the shifts in HD representations between retrosplenial and AD?</p><p>2. It is surprising that the authors recorded in the retrosplenial cortex, but do not comment upon nor describe bidirectional HD cells (Jakob et al., 2017). Since these neurons are regarded as prime candidates for the sensory-HD integration the authors aim to study, I think they should focus their analysis on these firing patterns specifically.</p><p>3. The tuning curves of HD cells in the AD nucleus are very broad (e.g. Figure S2E, Figure 1B, E), which seems to be at odds with prior literature, and this is potentially concerning. I wonder if this might be accounted for by the authors' definition of HD cells, and/or by spike sorting quality. The authors should try to quantify and exclude systematic spike sorting issues. As a 'control' they should maybe apply more stringent inclusion criteria, restrict the analysis to 'good' sharply tuned and nicely sorted HD units, and see if their conclusions hold for this refined dataset as well. They should also comment on whether and how (possibly suboptimal?) sorting might have impacted the 'negative result' of the present study, i.e. the fact that against predictions from prior literature, the authors did not find evidence for a visual update drive in the RSC cortex.</p><p>4. The authors state that &quot;the RSC is not wired to drive visual reference update&quot; (page 17 line 413). However, connectivity RSCâ AD has been demonstrated in several prior studies, and this is somewhat not recapitulated by the authors' tracing experiments with rabies viruses (I wonder if this finding needs to be confirmed with more conventional tracers, to exclude suboptimal tropism or synapse-specific effects of the viral transynaptic tracing, e.g. Rogers and Beier J Neurosc Methods 2021). The authors' statement is also supported by functional connectivity data (cross-correlations). The 'apparent sparsity' of connectivity could however be biased by cellular sampling since most thalamic projecting neurons are expected to be found in the deep layers (mostly L6) which seem not to have been systematically sampled with tetrode recordings.</p><p>5. The authors state that they have performed 'widespread sampling of RCS locations' (page 18 line 449). This is to some extent true; however, the retrosplenial cortex goes well beyond the recording locations sampled by the authors. I think the authors should reword these statements and acknowledge the possibility that other subfields of the retrosplenial cortex (which were not extensively sampled by the authors) could in principle be responsible for the visual update drive to the thalamus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Decoding errors: Average decoding error in RSC seems very high â 90.83 degrees for fast head turns seems like a chance level and I am not sure if it is still appropriate to talk about successful decoding of HD in that case. Since the quality of decoding is critically dependent on the number and tuning of HD cells recorded in each session, could the authors provide evidence that in each session included in the dataset both ADN and RSC decoders perform significantly better than chance as estimated from spike shuffles?</p><p>Examples in Figure 2A show many gaps in the tracked HD of the mouse, which to me indicates the sub-optimal quality of the behavioural tracking. This is especially important for analyses of decoding errors like the one in Figure 2D that shows that internal HD representations in ADN and RSC are coordinated at zero lag (+/- 20ms). The observed zero-lag peak could be instead explained by errors in behavioural tracking dominating the analysis, which would affect both representations simultaneously and show spurious zero-lag positive correlations. However, coordination could also be shown by computing the difference between internal HD decoded from ADN and RSC at different time lags, without reference to the HD tracked behaviourally. Could the authors include this sanity check in the manuscript?</p><p>The percentage of HD cells in RSC reported in the literature is generally low (~10%), but those RSC HD cells often show very narrow HD tuning. Yet, judging by the examples, the HD tuning of RSC cells recorded in the study seems worse than expected. Could the authors provide some statistical measure of HD tuning stability for each cell (i.e. correlating the first and second half of the baseline recording) as a sanity check? Canonical HD cells should show very good tuning stability under constant conditions.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 2F seems to show an overrepresentation of HD cells with similar preferred directions, especially so in RSC. If this is indeed the case, I am wondering if this apparent HD tuning could be explained by any other behavioural variable that in this session happens to be correlated with HD, as in my experience sometimes happens when a tuning curve shows weak HD tuning. I find that such spurious HD tuning often disappears if only epochs when the animal is moving are included in computing the HD curve, could the authors demonstrate that HD tuning does not change if stationary epochs are excluded?</p><p>Could the authors provide the breakdown of overall cell numbers recorded per animal (including nonHD/HD cells), for example as a table?</p><p>Are there any differences in HD modulation across layers and sub-regions of RSC?</p><p>Figure 1J shows that HD cell receptive fields exhibit both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations, do these correspond to the clockwise or anticlockwise rotations of the cue, or is the realignment not dependent on the direction of cue rotation?</p><p>The manuscript often uses a number of trials as their sample size for statistical analyses and the methods state that tetrodes were regularly advanced, but there is no indication of whether multiple trials at the same tetrode position were included in the same statistical comparison (except for recordings '4 days apart' for the HD tuning and synaptic connectivity analyses). Multiple trials with a high likelihood of recording the same cell population should not be counted as separate samples when calculating statistical significance. The authors should clarify whether tetrodes were moved between recording sessions and, if that was not the case, correct their statistical analyses to, e.g. perform statistical tests on average values per recorded population over multiple sessions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Coordinated Head Direction Representations in Mouse Anterodorsal Thalamic Nucleus and Retrosplenial Cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but reviewer #2 has some remaining issues that need to be addressed (mostly clarification of result interpretation and discussion), as outlined below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In response to my concern #1, the authors state: &quot;We agree that the 20ms temporal resolution prevents the observation of a temporal offset occurring at shorter timescales, for example, that of direct excitatory drive between the two regions&quot;. This potential limitation should be specifically acknowledged in the discussion, e.g. by stating that the temporal resolution of the decoding approach (20 ms) might have prevented the resolution of faster (monosynaptic) dynamics, which are approx one order of magnitude faster. Again, I believe that saying &quot;our results provide direct evidence against the hypothesis that visually guided updates in the HD reference would first appear in the RSC&quot; (lines 343ff) is a very strong statement. The authors provide evidence consistent with this hypothesis but do not formally rule out alternative updating mechanisms that might occur on faster timescales, i.e. beyond the authors' temporal resolution. Faster dynamics (&lt;20ms) might have gone undetected in the authors' work. This limitation should at least be acknowledged in the discussion.</p><p>The sentence in the abstract &quot;with surprisingly little reciprocal drive in the corticothalamic direction&quot; is not supported by the authors' data, nor by previous anatomical work showing strong RS deep layer-to-ADn connectivity. This is also clear from the authors' tracing data (from retrograde tracings, RS L6 shows up prominently). At some points, the authors make granular vs agranular RS distinctions (e.g. lines 377ff), but this is not done consistently throughout the manuscript, and the above sentence in the abstract generally refers to RS. The authors also refer to &quot;asymmetry&quot; in RS â ADn connectivity; I do not see what the authors mean by 'asymmetry', since the connectivity follows the classical thalamocortical rules (e.g. L6 back to thalamus). As for the functional data, more extensive sampling of RS L6 is needed to support claims about asymmetric connectivity. Hence, such strong claims (as the one in the abstract) should at least be moderated throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82952.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While each reviewer has raised a number of specific concerns about the present study, there was an agreement that the following essential revisions needed to be addressed to warrant the publication of the manuscript.</p><p>1) The study claims that the 0-lag correlation in decoding error demonstrates a near-synchronous encoding of HD in the AD-RSC network.

This new metric, which better reflects the readerâs expectation, is much lower than what we previously showed, and more comparable to other studies.</p><p>2) For our cross-correlation analysis, we have corroborated the coordination results with a revised rotation threshold and number of independent ensembles in Figure 2D and E. We also performed the same analysis by excluding points of low (below 30Â°/second, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> and B) or high (above 30Â°/second, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref> and D) angular velocity (AV). Higher AV is associated with a small but significant reduction in decoding accuracy (shown in Figure 2 â Supplement 1E and F), thus suggesting a more reliable quantification of the lag between the two regions when considering only time points with low AV. However, the exclusion of several data points, on average halved at 0-time lags and further exacerbated at lags away from zero, resulted in higher variability in the cross-correlation traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). This variability was more pronounced when we considered points of high AV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). In both cases, the average correlation traces pointed to a peak at 0-time lags, more pronounced in the high AV case and much smoother in the low AV case, as expected, and the histograms of the peaks showed a majority at 0-time lag.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Correlation of decoded HD errors at different angular velocity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>): Individual trials (grey traces, n=108) and averages of the unique ensembles (n=28) of the cross correlations between decoded errors composed only of the time points with high AV (more than 30Â°/s).

We did this and present the results in Figure 2 â Supplement 3B. Each trial (n=108, grey traces) is the median of the median absolute difference between ADn and RSC decoded HD calculated for sliding 5s windows of 35s decoded traces at up to +/- 5s time lags. This approach was taken to circumvent the possible problems of leading or lagging of the decoded HD depending on the head rotations (clockwise or counterclockwise) and the overall smearing of possible temporal offsets for long traces. However, in contrast to the cross correlation of the decoded error, the difference on the decoded HD does not consider opposing scenarios of lead/lag of the HD representations following positive and negative cue rotations. Therefore, we still resorted to the difference of the decoded HD errors (with some flipped to be on the same sign of the rotations), in Figure 2 â Supplement 3C-F. As in Figure 2 â Supplement 3B and as a mirror image of the cross-correlation results, we observed a trough, in other words a point of minimum error between the two regions, at 0-time lags, both on the individual (Figure 2 â Supplement 3C and D) as well as on the unique ensembles (Figure 2 â Supplement 3E and F) traces averages, resulting in a majority of 0-time lags of the trough histograms both during stable cues and after cue rotation.</p><p>4) We have replicated the cross-correlation results by using a different decoding strategy, namely a long-short-term memory network (LSTM) with a single hidden layer of 50 units trained on the neural activity of each trial, which, as suggested in the main points of the reviewers, relies less on the tuning curves of the individual units. We included this approach in the method section of the manuscript but decided to present the GLM decoding results in the main manuscript because of the overall higher decoding accuracy in the test period observed with the GLM. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> similar panels as those shown throughout the manuscript for this decoding method, with a detailed legend. We note that at times the number of ensembles or trials is different from that of the GLM-results because the spike shuffling control was not applied in this instance and because averages based on the value of the decoded rotations might differ from those obtained with the GLM-decoder.</p><p>In the course of the revisions we have also implemented several other changes that have improved the quality of the decoding and the robustness of the results: (a) We have extended the test period used for quantifying this accuracy from 80s to 120 s; (b) For our GLM decoding, we have excluded sessions that did not pass our threshold for decoding accuracy in comparison to spike shuffling for individual sessions, as suggested by reviewer 3; (c) We have revisited the dataset with stricter criteria for units selection and inclusion of sessions and trials that had good heading occupancy; (d) We have averaged across trials from the same sessions and from sessions with overlapping recorded ensembles to yield statistical comparisons between independent samples.</p><p>Altogether, our new analyses and substantial refinements to both the data inclusion criteria and our existing analyses addresses the concerns about spurious correlations, and demonstrates the robustness of our results.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>LSTM-based decoding of HD recapitulates GLM-based decoding results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>): Mean and 95% CI of the absolute decoding error distribution for ADn (blue) and RSC (red) for each region from the test period from rotation trials (n=37 unique ensembles ADn, N=30 for RSC).

As a result, the percentage of RSC HD units is lower than in the previous version of the manuscript, while that of ADn slightly increased, with medians for RSC HD group improved for directional information and resultant length (Figure 1 â Supplement 3B and C). In response to reviewersâ suggestions, we show several new analyses that confirm different properties of HD units in ADn and RSC.

For each unit we also show the waveforms on the 4 channels of the tetrodes as means and standard errors and the spike auto correlograms in the -15 to 15 ms. In Figure 1 â Supplement 2C, we show different ADn units from the same session. To answer the concerns about spike sorting quality, we show in Figure 1 â Supplement 2D the distributions of noise overlap, isolation metrics and mean firing rates as extracted for each unit cluster from the mountainsort spike sorting. We labeled HD and Non-HD units from RSC and ADn and show that for these classes the distributions of the different metrics are largely overlapping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Considering how critical the number of simultaneously recorded neurons is to evaluate the reliability of decoding, the study should include a detailed table of the number of neurons per session, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion and have added a table (Supplementary File 1) in which, for each mouse, we list the recording sessions and the session types, the tetrode locations and movements, the total number of units and the number of classified HD units in each region, the total number of possible ADn-RSC pairs and the number of connections. We also show in response to reviewer 1 the relationship between the number of recorded units and the quality of the decoding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Along the same lines, whether recordings at the same tetrode depth were included as independent samples is unclear. A detailed table of sessions, tetrode position, number of cells, etc. would be very informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have noted in Supplementary file 1 for each tetrode the fraction of turns done after the recording session. We have adjusted the criterion for identifying independent sessions to more closely follow these tetrode movements and the number of recorded units, which may change also as a result of drift and movement due to attaching/detaching of the headstage between recording sessions. This was done independently for RSC and ADn tetrodes. For Figure 1C,F,G,H, and Figure 1 â Supplement 3 and Figure 2 â Supplement 1, where HD unit quantifications, HD coding properties, decoding, and rotation accuracies are shown, the presented data comes from sessions sampling different units in each region according to the tetrode movement and the number of units recorded. For analyses addressing the regional coordination (in Figure 2 and Figure 2 â Supplement 3, Figure 3D,E,G, and Figure 3 â Supplement 1A and B) and the functional connectivity (Figure 4 and Figure 4 â Supplement 2), sessions where either RSC or ADn tetrodes where moved or the number of units substantially differed were counted as independent samples. In the cases of Figure 1H, 2B, Figure 2 â Supplement 1 F&amp;G and in the above figure of the LSTM results panel E, averages of trials across the same ensembles were calculated by separating the individual the ADn rotation values according to whether they were large negative small negative, null, small positive and large positive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The limitations regarding RSC-to-AD connectivity should be carefully discussed as RSC projecting neurons are likely in layer 6 only and may not have been sampled as well as other layers. Furthermore, only one tracing technique was used, not ruling out the possibility that these viruses have a poor tropism for this specific pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the discussion on the RSC-to-ADn anatomical tracing data to consider potential tropism of the rabies virus and compare our results to past retrograde tracings using other techniques. Along those lines, we show in Figure 4 â Supplement 1B that injected retrobeads in ADn do label deep layers, particularly layer 6, of mostly granular RSC. The difference in density of the presynaptic labeling may result not only from viral tropism but also from the density of ADn labeling: in fact, the virus cocktail used for ADn rabies tracing consists of AAV1-Syn-Cre and two helper viruses, thus diluting the chances of co-infection necessary for retrograde labeling.</p><p>We acknowledge that a denser sampling of the deeper layers of granular RSC may provide a more definitive answer to the degree of functional connectivity between the two regions. We want to point out however that 9 out of 48 RSC tetrodes in mice with simultaneous ADn-RSC recordings were located in the deepest layers, and nonetheless only 4 connections were found. It is possible that we have missed more posterior hotspots in the granular RSC bordering postsubiculum, another region with known direct connections to ADn and with a functional role in controlling visual anchoring of ADn HD (Goodridge and Taube 1997). Regardless of the exact connectivity rate, a striking asymmetry exists between corticothalamic and thalamocortical connections, as previously assessed in postsubiculum (Peyrache et al. 2015). Moreover, our conclusions highlight that the most economical explanation to the coordination of the HD representations decoded from the ensemble activity we recorded relies on a feedforward drive of HD in the thalamocortical direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors are invited to address as much as possible specific comments from the reviewers, appended below.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While I believe there are very strong points to this manuscript as noted above, some concerns about the experimental design have dampened my enthusiasm a bit. I have a series of specific questions.</p><p>1. The design of the behavioral protocols is not ideal to draw conclusions on visual landmark updating, as the visual cue was not presented as a reliable landmark for the animal. (It had shifted repeatedly while the animal was in the arena, and therefore probably underwent 'devaluation' (line 428) over time, and 90{degree sign} cue rotations often gave rotations of the neural representation of HD around 0 (cf line 1069)). If I understand correctly, this means that the animals after some time ignored the position changes of the visual cue. In this context, it doesn't make much sense to qualify the update of the HD reference as &quot;successful&quot; (line 261), after cue rotation, when an HD shift of &gt; x{degree sign} is observed. It is a mismatch situation, and the mouse might rely more on self-information, proprioceptive and vestibular, than on the moving visual cue. I suggest changing the wording (&quot;successful&quot;). Beyond that, could it be helpful to include only the first few cue rotation experiments for a given animal? Before it considers the visual cue as unreliable.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewerâs concern about the behavioral design, however we also point out that other studies have approached the visual updating without disorientation before cue rotation and observed rotations (Knight et al. 2014 and, though the rotation was done on the animal through a rotating platform, also Knierim et al. 1998). Our behavioral design choice was also motivated by the possibility to closely compare the influence of the cue position on the changes of the neural activity, without adding other behavioral conditions. However, in light of the reduced cue control, especially for the 90Â° rotations, we have deleted the word âsuccessfulâ update of the reference frame to âchangeâ. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> we show for each mouse and for the two regions (ADn in panel A and RSC in panel B) the neural rotations calculated from the difference between the decoded and the tracked HD over the session numbers, While for some mice the size of the decoded rotation was reduced over time (see Mouse 4 both ADn, panel A, and RSC, panel B), as expected from a progressive devaluation of the cue, for others this trend was not obvious, suggesting that taking only the first rotations might not necessarily imply perfect HD rotations. We believe that this screening focused on the rotations, together with stricter quality parameters, can support the following analyses of the coordination between ADn and RSC.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Rotations over time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>): Decoded rotations from ADn ensembles plotted over trials for each mouse.

Many previous studies have tested (Yoganarasimha and Knierim, 2006, Zugaro et al., 2003, Jeffery 1998, Knierim et al. 1998) or modeled (Yan, Burgess and Bicanski, 2021, Page and Jeffery, 2018) the conditions and the under which cues can be used to anchor the HD depending on their reliability. Sit and Goard, 2023 and previously Jacob et al. 2017 reported in RSC firing patterns and proposed possible circuit mechanisms that could process landmarks, however further experimental evidence of the conditions of reliability and processing of visual inputs are needed. We show that ensemble ADn and RSC cells rotate with the cue rotations, especially to the smaller cue rotations, where the mismatch with the internal HD is smaller (Figure 2 â Supplement 2B), but with large cue rotations, where the mismatch is larger, the HD reference does not always follow the cue rotations even though a realignment from the previous reference is observed, somewhat similarly to what Knight et al. 2014 observed. Besides being a topic that would require a separate research article, we believe that we donât have the right dataset to fully explore the question of cue reliability for several reasons: (1) because we have presented only one visual cue in our behavioral arena, to which the mice were already habituated for a lengthy period (but not exactly the same for each mouse) before we recorded sufficient HD cells, it is not clear how much more in depth than previous studies we could investigate the learning reliability; (2) more detailed camera tracking of the mouse visual field would also be better suited to explore the relationship between reliable and unreliable cues; (3) denser RSC ensembles, similar to what the Sit and Goard 2023 study have reported, should be recorded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Can you rule out potentially confounding effects of recordings obtained during early or late phases of the repeated exposures to the visual stimuli, that would affect the coherence between the AD and RSC HD representations?

Mice were also habituated to the environment for several days, even weeks before the recording sessions, while tetrodes were lowered until a substantial number of HD cells was detected. We note that some changes of the number of HD cells can also occur as a result of moving the tetrodes between sessions, and we refer the reviewers to Supplementary File 1 that tracks tetrode movements and several other parameters. Therefore, between the change in tetrode location and the already lengthy exposure to the arena, pinning the relationship between the number of HD cells to environmental exposure would be difficult in this dataset.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Number of HD cells over time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>): Number of HD cells recorded in ADn over trials plotted by mouse.

Often times persistence of directional firing in the dark is used as a criterion for Head direction firing, and it may be useful to distinguish HD cells from visually responsive cells for example. I saw that 3 mice were tested in the dark (Figure 3), does it mean 9 mice were not? (How sure would you be to qualify directionally tuned cells as HD cells, and not visually responsive cells, if a dark condition was missing?)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point â and agree this may be a shortcoming of the study. Indeed, because not all mice were tested in dark condition, we cannot use this criterion for identifying HD cells and we rely only on directional tuning properties described. We have however restricted the criterion for directional tuning by making sure that directional information calculated as bits/spike, resultant and concentration parameters are above 98% of the shuffled control, thus raising the threshold from the previous assessment. Moreover, only cells for which these conditions were met in two distinct trials within the session were selected as HD cells. In Figure 1 â Supplement 3B and C we show the distribution of these parameters. As an additional quality assurance, we also assessed the stability of the preferred firing direction (Figure 1 â Supplement 3F) between the first and second half of a trials, as suggested elsewhere. We also showed that the position of the cue was not a determinant of the preferred firing directions of HD cells (Figure 1 â Supplement 3D). Additionally, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref> the HD information calculated as bits/spike plotted against the egocentric angle with respect to the cue for our selected HD cells in ADn and RSC, to address the potential confound of selectivity to the visual cue. Given that the egocentric information falls below the unity line for the vast majority of ADn HD cells, we are confident in our HD classification. RSC HD units are more variable, as already indicated throughout the manuscript and as suggested in the previous literature, likely owing to the conjunctive nature of associative cortical neurons, and therefore a clear-cut distinction is not as apparent as in ADn.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Egocentric information of HD cells.</title><p>Left, ADn (n=150) HD directional information (bits/spike) of classified HD cells vs egocentric directional information with respect to the angular position of the cue, with both axes on the logarithmic scale.

Because of the lack of a disorientation period during the cue rotation, this may be difficult to affirm for the protocols used here. Do you think it is still justified to qualify all the directionally tuned neurons as HD cells?</p></disp-quote><p>In the experiment design, we did not include a disorientation protocol for technical reasons but also to allow a training and testing of the HD decoding on stable cue conditions and assess directly the effect of the rotation on the HD representation by looking at the decoded error. We agree that not including this criterion might be a shortcoming for HD classification, especially of RSC units, which have been shown in previous studies to have different responses to cue and environmental manipulations (Chen, et al., 1994; Jacob, et al., 2017). However, we show correlated mean HD rotations calculated from the tuning curves in dual area recordings in Figure 1H (where trials from the same ensembles but different size of rotations were averaged), even though very few sessions were included, given that RSC HD cells are sparse. This suggests that on average HD cells from the two regions respond similarly with cue rotations and that our classification based on information, resultant and concentration parameters, and the peak stability quantifications largely captures HD cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did you examine if units identified as HD might change and become nonHD (or vice versa) across different recording conditions?</p><p>In the dark recordings, do you find that some directionally tuned cells become silent, and might those be cells responding to the visual cue?</p></disp-quote><p>We have compared the resultant of HD cells tuning curves during light condition with those from the first 2 minutes of dark conditions (before significant drifting could be observed) to address this point in Figure 1 â Supplement 3J, and show that this parameter does not significantly change as assessed by Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test.

While the mean firing rate of the whole ensembles marginally change only for RSC ensembles, the peak firing rates of HD units are slightly decreased in darkness as opposed to cue on conditions in both regions (p=0.0027 for ADn, p=0.0004 for RSC, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test).

The authors state that 'our results provide direct evidence against the hypothesis that visually guided updates in the HD reference would first appear in the RSC' (page 17 lines 416ff). This is indeed a strong statement, but I am not sure it is entirely supported by the authors' data. I wonder if a temporal offset in cue-rotation responses between AD and RSC HD cells might have gone undetected in the authors' study (see also point 2 below). For example, the visual update drive â in the form of e.g. an excitatory input from RCS that realigns HD cells in the AD- could be difficult to detect, considering the temporal resolution of the authors' experimental design. Hence, it is difficult to prove a 'negative result' here. The authors refer to two possible limitations (page 20 lines 491-492): 'cue devaluation with repeated trials' and 'temporal control of the cue rotation'. Is it conceivable that these limitations might have prevented the observation of a temporal delay between the shifts in HD representations between retrosplenial and AD?</p></disp-quote><p>We want to first clarify that the two limitations mentioned in the final section of the conclusion apply to the characterization of landmark encoding cells, whose contribution to internal HD representations is not addressed in this study, but would indeed be of interest in future recordings. Specifically, a tight control of the entering of the cue in the visual field of the mouse (for example in a head fixed setting on a rotating platform, such as that described in Sit, and Goard, 2023) would most likely be necessary in characterizing the firing fields of landmark-encoding cells. We have however eliminated this sentence to avoid confusions.</p><p>We do not believe those limitations would prevent the observation of a temporal delay between HD representations because: a) if there was no rotation of the HD reference then the trial was excluded; b) because of the slow time course of the rotations a temporal offset would most likely be observed regardless of the exact (+/- 500 ms) control of the visual field. As stated in the discussion, it is unclear what behavioral conditions lead to a slow realignment of the HD reference in contrast to the Zugaro et al. 2003 study, where rapid realignment (80 ms) was observed, but slower timescales have been reported by Knierim et al. 1998 and by Ajabi et al. 2021. How the time scale of the realignment is related to the activity of RSC (or postsubiculum, as an alternative brain region for visual/HD integration) is unknown, but the Ajabi et al. 2021 study related the time course needed to differences in ADn network gains, with an initial spike possibly reflecting visual inputs.</p><p>We agree that the 20ms temporal resolution prevents the observation of a temporal offset occurring at shorter timescales, for example that of direct excitatory drive between the two regions. To observe this case, enough deep layers ADn-projecting neurons have to be recorded and these neurons have to encode HD to allow accurate decoding specifically from this ensemble at 1 ms resolution. Alternatively, one would have to search for specific combinations of ADn-RSC HD cells pairs with the same tuning and cue rotations events in which the mouse keeps the head still in the preferred orientation (as described in Zugaro et al. 2003). It is unclear whether the neurons described in Jacob et al. 2017 (as indicated in point 2) would be directly involved in conveying updated HD information to ADn, given that most RSC presynaptic neurons to ADn are found in granular and not in dysgranular cortex. However, they could be involved in locally updating HD (Page et al. 2018), as suggested by the study of Sit and Goard 2023, where the realignment to repeated rotations was supported by a subpopulation of cells with distinct firing fields, likely through inputs from both external visual and HD inputs and local RSC inputs carrying specific spatial and visual information. A more detailed study of the circuit connectivity and the operations carried by individual RSC circuit components would answer these questions and resolve whether these visual/HD transformations can occur at a smaller temporal resolution than the one we used in this study.</p><p>We also want to point out that in addition to local and long-range inputs to RSC carrying information necessary for these transformation, previous literature has shown that HD reference update in behavioral settings similar to that described here depend on postsubicular activity (Goodridge et al. 1998) and on cortico-mamillary inputs (Yoder et al. 2015), whereby HD update can occur upstream of thalamus. This evidence points to a coordinated action of multiple brain regions to keep the HD in register across the brain, suggesting that substantial HD reference offsets are unlikely to be observed when decoding from the large ensemble levels.</p><p>Following the main suggestions and the comments of the other reviewers, we have (1) systematically checked our dataset and set stricter criteria for including trials and units; (2) we have averaged across trials with overlapping ensembles to perform statistical assessments on independent samples; and (3) we have offered an alternative method for checking the 0-ms time lag of HD coordination between the two regions in Figure 2 â Supplement 3. Our results are similar to those previously presented, suggesting the robustness of our data and methods. Moreover, we have decoded the internal HD representation of both regions with an alternative method, namely a LSTM network with only one hidden layer. Even in this case, the coordination between the decoded HD of the two regions by calculating the cross-correlation occurs at a 0-ms time lag. Because of the higher sensitivity of the difference between decoded errors to moment to moment variability in the 5s segments and the slightly lower decoder accuracy from the LSTM prediction, more variable distributions of time lags of minimum median error were observed; however, most of the traces had troughs at 0 ms time lags.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is surprising that the authors recorded in the retrosplenial cortex, but do not comment upon nor describe bidirectional HD cells (Jakob et al., 2017). Since these neurons are regarded as prime candidates for the sensory-HD integration the authors aim to study, I think they should focus their analysis on these firing patterns specifically.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the discussion to consider the potential sensory-HD integration neurons proposed in the Jacob et al. 2017 study as candidates for landmark-based update of HD representation in RSC. However, we believe that these bi-or multidirectional firing patterns, as discussed in Jacob et al. 2017, are coupled to specific environmental configurations, i.e. the two distinct symmetrical rooms that can be closed and through which the animals can continuously navigate. Similarly, in the studies of Sit and Goard, 2023 and LaChance et al. 2022 bidirectionally tuned cells were identified in retrosplenial and postrhinal cortex, respectively, in environments with symmetric cues, and suggested this class of cells could discriminate between visual cues and process landmarks that anchor the HD. However, because these set-ups are not proposed in our study, a search for these patterns in our dataset does not seem feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The tuning curves of HD cells in the AD nucleus are very broad (e.g. Figure S2E, Figure 1B, E), which seems to be at odds with prior literature, and this is potentially concerning. I wonder if this might be accounted for by the authors' definition of HD cells, and/or by spike sorting quality. The authors should try to quantify and exclude systematic spike sorting issues. As a 'control' they should maybe apply more stringent inclusion criteria, restrict the analysis to 'good' sharply tuned and nicely sorted HD units, and see if their conclusions hold for this refined dataset as well. They should also comment on whether and how (possibly suboptimal?) sorting might have impacted the 'negative result' of the present study, i.e. the fact that against predictions from prior literature, the authors did not find evidence for a visual update drive in the RSC cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide in Figure 1 â Supplement 2A-C additional tuning curves of selected HD cells from different mice in ADn and RSC for two distinct angular positions of the visual cue, together with the corresponding spike autocorrelation histograms and the waveforms on all 4 channels of the tetrode where the units were detected. In Figure 1 â Supplement 2D we also show the distributions of the noise overlap and isolation metric, as directly extracted from spike sorting, of all our HD and non HD cells and we highlight: (1) the isolation metric is strongly skewed toward the maximum (on a scale from 0 to 1); (2) the noise overlap, in contrast, is skewed toward 0, with a small subset of units having a 0.0-0.4 overlap; and (3) these metrics are largely overlapping across all 4 categories.</p><p>We have refined the HD unit selection with stricter criteria: in addition to raising the threshold of resultant length and spike information to 98% of those obtained from spike shuffling, we included the concentration of the tuning curves as an additional parameter and, together with the sampling of unique ensembles following the tetrode movement more closely for both RSC and ADn, indeed the percentage of RSC HD units decreased and that of ADn HD units slightly increased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors state that &quot;the RSC is not wired to drive visual reference update&quot; (page 17 line 413). However, connectivity RSCâ AD has been demonstrated in several prior studies, and this is somewhat not recapitulated by the authors' tracing experiments with rabies viruses (I wonder if this finding needs to be confirmed with more conventional tracers, to exclude suboptimal tropism or synapse-specific effects of the viral transynaptic tracing, e.g. Rogers and Beier J Neurosc Methods 2021). The authors' statement is also supported by functional connectivity data (cross-correlations). The 'apparent sparsity' of connectivity could however be biased by cellular sampling since most thalamic projecting neurons are expected to be found in the deep layers (mostly L6) which seem not to have been systematically sampled with tetrode recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our discussion to clarify this point, and rephrased the quoted sentence to express that RSC, while playing a major role in encoding landmarks and translating between internal and external spaces, in our experimental paradigm and through our data analysis does not seem to anticipate, at the ensemble level and at the time resolution of 20 ms, the HD reference with respect to ADn during cue rotations.</p><p>We have provided an alternative anatomical tracing strategy to overcome potential poor tropism of the virus, or, as discussed in point 6 of the essential revisions, potentially low number of infected starter ADn neurons. With retrobeads injected into ADn, we show results in line with those from previous literature (Shibata, 1998), with deep layers, especially in granular RSC, labeled. As for the sparsity from the functional connectivity in the RSC-to-ADn direction, we agree with the reviewers that a more focused sampling of layer 6 of RSC and possibly also in more posterior RSC closer to the postsubiculum would have revealed more connections. However, based on the ensembles we have recorded, with 9 tetrodes out of 48 in the mice with simultaneous ADn-RSC recordings, the internal HD we have decoded from the two regions and the temporal coordination are supported by the functional connections we have observed. Furthermore, these connections were determined with a high threshold (99.9% probability from a convolved distribution, used as baseline).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors state that they have performed 'widespread sampling of RCS locations' (page 18 line 449). This is to some extent true; however, the retrosplenial cortex goes well beyond the recording locations sampled by the authors. I think the authors should reword these statements and acknowledge the possibility that other subfields of the retrosplenial cortex (which were not extensively sampled by the authors) could in principle be responsible for the visual update drive to the thalamus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that particularly more posterior locations in RSC, where the granular portion borders with postsubiculum, have not been substantially sampled. We have reworded our discussion to highlight the need of extensive recording of RSC in the anterior-posterior axis in future studies to test their roles in these visual realignment tasks, especially given that RSC is already known to display a gradient in encoding egocentric versus allocentric navigational variables (Hennestad et al. 2021). As mentioned in the discussion, there are however several different pathways through which HD in ADn can be updated: 1) direct postsubiculum to ADn connections, and 2) cortical (postsubiculum) to LMN connections. It is unclear whether different behavioral conditions would prioritize one pathway as supposed to another or whether, regardless of the behavioral demands, a coordinated HD representation is ensured at different levels in the HD circuitry through multiple connections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Decoding errors: Average decoding error in RSC seems very high â 90.83 degrees for fast head turns seems like a chance level and I am not sure if it is still appropriate to talk about successful decoding of HD in that case. Since the quality of decoding is critically dependent on the number and tuning of HD cells recorded in each session, could the authors provide evidence that in each session included in the dataset both ADN and RSC decoders perform significantly better than chance as estimated from spike shuffles?</p></disp-quote><p>We want to clarify that in the original version of the paper (Supplementary Figure 3C) we presented the degree value corresponding to the 75 percentile of the error distribution. We realized that the median of the absolute decoded error is a better metric for this analysis and have thus adjusted the graphs to reflect this (now Figure 2 â Supplement 1D), which has brought the accuracy metric to lower values. We also followed the reviewerâs suggestion to eliminate sessions for which the median decoded error was higher than the 10th of 100 values calculated from shuffled spikes (shown in Figure 2 â Supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Examples in Figure 2A show many gaps in the tracked HD of the mouse, which to me indicates the sub-optimal quality of the behavioural tracking. This is especially important for analyses of decoding errors like the one in Figure 2D that shows that internal HD representations in ADN and RSC are coordinated at zero lag (+/- 20ms). The observed zero-lag peak could be instead explained by errors in behavioural tracking dominating the analysis, which would affect both representations simultaneously and show spurious zero-lag positive correlations. However, coordination could also be shown by computing the difference between internal HD decoded from ADN and RSC at different time lags, without reference to the HD tracked behaviourally. Could the authors include this sanity check in the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>There might be at times gaps in the HD tracking if the sensors on the headstage are obscured, for example during grooming bouts, or by the connecting cable. HD is tracked through the HTC Vive Base Station system detection from 3 receivers in 9 mice â 2 in 3 mice â placed on top of the headstage, at a 30 Hz frequency. To reach the 50Hz sampling resolution we use throughout the manuscript, we interpolate between data points. We have provided a new example in Figure 2A and have not median-smoothed the HD tracking as we did in the previous version of the figure.</p><p>As for the zero-lag between HD representations, we followed the reviewerâs suggestion, and plotted the difference between the decoded HD of each region in Figure 2 â Supplement 3B. Specifically we have taken the absolute median of the difference between 5 s segments and temporally offset them up to +/- 5 s, and repeated this to cover the length of 75s of decoded trace. We note that there are however some factors that contribute to the high variability and would potentially obscure effects in the scenarios of either region leading the HD reference change: 1) the direction of the cue rotation; b) the direction of the head rotations (clockwise vs counterclockwise). For these reasons, initially we took the cross correlation of the decoded errors. The sign and the magnitude of the angular velocity are the major factor leading to large error differences in the -180 to 180 range at around 5s temporal lags, therefore we decided to take the absolute median error. Finally, to combine our results in the face of the different directions of the rotations, we made all the decoded errors have the same sign. We can see from the histogram of the troughs from unique ensembles that the majority lies at 0, recapitulating the temporal cross correlation results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The percentage of HD cells in RSC reported in the literature is generally low (~10%), but those RSC HD cells often show very narrow HD tuning. Yet, judging by the examples, the HD tuning of RSC cells recorded in the study seems worse than expected. Could the authors provide some statistical measure of HD tuning stability for each cell (i.e. correlating the first and second half of the baseline recording) as a sanity check? Canonical HD cells should show very good tuning stability under constant conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the suggested analysis of peak stability in Figure 1 â Supplement 3F and indeed found that the peak is quite stable (circular correlation = 0.93 for ADn, n=150, for RSC 0.79, n=73, p&lt;0.0001 for both). We have also revised the HD selection criterion to be more stringent. As suggested by other reviewers and by the essential revision, we have also added more examples in Figure 1 â Supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 2F seems to show an overrepresentation of HD cells with similar preferred directions, especially so in RSC. If this is indeed the case, I am wondering if this apparent HD tuning could be explained by any other behavioural variable that in this session happens to be correlated with HD, as in my experience sometimes happens when a tuning curve shows weak HD tuning. I find that such spurious HD tuning often disappears if only epochs when the animal is moving are included in computing the HD curve, could the authors demonstrate that HD tuning does not change if stationary epochs are excluded?</p></disp-quote><p>We have rerun the HD cells selection by refining the criteria (namely selecting bits/spike, resultant and concentration parameters above 98% of those from shuffled spikes for both ADn and RSC units in 2 distinct segments of the recording sessions) and by selecting only time points within a period of stable cue where the animal is moving, as here suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors provide the breakdown of overall cell numbers recorded per animal (including nonHD/HD cells), for example as a table?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided in the essential revision point 4 the Supplementary File 1 summarizing total number of cells and number of HD cells in each region per recording session, per mouse, as well as the number of ADn-RSC pairs tested for functional connectivity and the tetrode movements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there any differences in HD modulation across layers and sub-regions of RSC?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this would be an interesting avenue of research to better understand the organization of RSC. However, we think that this characterization of HD within cortical layers would be better addressed with high density laminar probes where layer identification is more accurate and sampling much higher.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1J shows that HD cell receptive fields exhibit both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations, do these correspond to the clockwise or anticlockwise rotations of the cue, or is the realignment not dependent on the direction of cue rotation?</p></disp-quote><p>No, indeed sometimes the ensemble/decoded rotation is in the opposite direction or overshoots (as can be seen in Figure 2 â Supplement 2B) and, as a consequence of the circularity, it seems the HD representation goes in the opposite direction as the imposed cue rotation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript often uses a number of trials as their sample size for statistical analyses and the methods state that tetrodes were regularly advanced, but there is no indication of whether multiple trials at the same tetrode position were included in the same statistical comparison (except for recordings '4 days apart' for the HD tuning and synaptic connectivity analyses). Multiple trials with a high likelihood of recording the same cell population should not be counted as separate samples when calculating statistical significance. The authors should clarify whether tetrodes were moved between recording sessions and, if that was not the case, correct their statistical analyses to, e.g. perform statistical tests on average values per recorded population over multiple sessions.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, unlike in the HD quantification and spike correlation analyses where we originally took recordings 4 days apart, all trials were included in the previous versions of Figure 2 and 3, whether they were within the same recording session (as shown in the examples) or in next day session. In our revised manuscript we have followed the reviewerâs suggestion and have adjusted Figures 2 DandE, 3D-G and Figure 2 â Supplements 1 and 3 and Figure 3 â Supplement 1 to average across sessions containing largely overlapping ensembles and perform statistical tests on unique ensembles following more closely the tetrode movements and changes in recorded unit numbers. Similarly, we have sampled sessions with different ensembles (or combinations of RSC-ADn ensembles for the functional connectivity) to present and perform statistical analysis for the data in Figures 1 and 4 and Figure 1 â Supplement 3 and Figure 4 â Supplement 2.

This potential limitation should be specifically acknowledged in the discussion, e.g. by stating that the temporal resolution of the decoding approach (20 ms) might have prevented the resolution of faster (monosynaptic) dynamics, which are approx one order of magnitude faster. Again, I believe that saying &quot;our results provide direct evidence against the hypothesis that visually guided updates in the HD reference would first appear in the RSC&quot; (lines 343ff) is a very strong statement. The authors provide evidence consistent with this hypothesis but do not formally rule out alternative updating mechanisms that might occur on faster timescales, i.e. beyond the authors' temporal resolution. Faster dynamics (&lt;20ms) might have gone undetected in the authors' work. This limitation should at least be acknowledged in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point to more precisely and carefully communicate our results in light of potential limitations. We have eliminated the sentence âTogether, our results provide direct evidence against the hypothesis that the updated HD reference from visual cue rotations would first appear in RSC, at the ensemble level, and then be directly conveyed to ADnâ in the discussion and, as the reviewer requested, added the sentence âHowever, the temporal resolution of the decoding occludes potential faster dynamics, at the scale of monosynaptic connections (ms range)â to acknowledge the limitation of our 20ms window.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sentence in the abstract &quot;with surprisingly little reciprocal drive in the corticothalamic direction&quot; is not supported by the authors' data, nor by previous anatomical work showing strong RS deep layer-to-ADn connectivity. This is also clear from the authors' tracing data (from retrograde tracings, RS L6 shows up prominently). At some points, the authors make granular vs agranular RS distinctions (e.g. lines 377ff), but this is not done consistently throughout the manuscript, and the above sentence in the abstract generally refers to RS. The authors also refer to &quot;asymmetry&quot; in RS â ADn connectivity; I do not see what the authors mean by 'asymmetry', since the connectivity follows the classical thalamocortical rules (e.g. L6 back to thalamus). As for the functional data, more extensive sampling of RS L6 is needed to support claims about asymmetric connectivity. Hence, such strong claims (as the one in the abstract) should at least be moderated throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the abstract to tone down the concept of asymmetry in light of the L6 labeling in the retrobeads tracing, and have also changed the heading of the Results section accordingly. And in the discussion, we have specifically added the sentence âFurther denser sampling of layer 6 in RSC, and more specifically in the granular portion, where ADnâs presynaptic partners in RSC are mostly found ((Shibata, 1998), Figure 4B, Figure 4 â Supplement 1B), are needed to clarify the role of the anatomically-identified corticothalamic projections in the visual updating of ADn-RSC HD referenceâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
