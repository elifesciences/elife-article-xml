In melanoma, the melanocytic (MEL) and the mesenchymal-like (MES) states present themselves with different responses to therapy, making the identification of specific enhancers highly relevant. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in a panel of patient-derived melanoma lines (MM lines), we set to identify and decipher melanoma enhancers by first focusing on regions with state-specific H3K27 acetylation close to differentially expressed genes. An in-depth evaluation of those regions was then pursued by investigating the activity of overlapping ATAC-seq peaks along with a full tiling of the acetylated regions with 190 bp sequences. Activity was observed in more than 60% of the selected regions, and we were able to precisely locate the active enhancers within ATAC-seq peaks. Comparison of sequence content with activity, using the deep learning model DeepMEL2, revealed that AP-1 alone is responsible for the MES enhancer activity. In contrast, SOX10 and MITF both influence MEL enhancer function with SOX10 being required to achieve high levels of activity. Overall, our MPRAs shed light on the relationship between long and short sequences in terms of their sequence content, enhancer activity, and specificity across melanoma cell states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>MPRA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>724226_cis-CONTROL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name><name><surname>Mauduit</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Christiaens</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C14/18/092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S03317N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minnoye</surname><given-names>Liesbeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12J6916N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demeulemeester</surname><given-names>Jonas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011851</institution-id><institution>Kom op tegen Kanker</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wouters</surname><given-names>Jasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stichting tegen Kanker</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wouters</surname><given-names>Jasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-level massively parallel reporter assays (H3K27ac, ATAC and short tiles) in a panel of melanoma cell lines, together with a deep learning model, reveal location, multiplicity and grammar of subtype specific enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enhancers are crucial regulatory regions in the genome that control cell type-specific gene expression. Identifying enhancers helps to better understand cell identity and is key to develop therapies targeting a singular relevant cell type in a disease. To date, accurate prediction of enhancer location and cell-type activity remains a challenge. Both the presence and clustering of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are good predictors of enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasperini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">King et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, such an approach requires prior knowledge of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammar in the studied cell types as only a small proportion of the TFBSs found in the genome are bound by the corresponding transcription factor (TF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">YÃ¡Ã±ez-Cuna et al., 2012</xref>). Another strategy to identify candidate enhancers is to use active enhancer marks such as H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Minnoye et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). The most successful studies, combining this approach with transcriptome data, generated libraries with up to 60% of active enhancers in the target cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gorkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graybuck et al., 2021</xref>). Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have been developed to screen the activity of thousands of sequences simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inoue and Ahituv, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 2013</xref>). However, limitations of sequence synthesis constrain one to choose either a large number of short sequences (e.g., thousands of sequences of 150â250 bp) or a small number of longer sequences (e.g., dozens of sequences of 500â1000 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inoue and Ahituv, 2015</xref>). This issue, combined with the difficulty of identifying putative enhancers, leads to a low rate of active enhancers in MPRAs.</p><p>Here, we study enhancer location, specificity, and regulatory grammar in melanoma using a variety of MPRA strategies. Melanoma exhibits pronounced heterogeneity within and between patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grzywa et al., 2017</xref>). Two main subtypes or cell states are discernible, the melanocytic (MEL) and the mesenchymal-like (MES) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verfaillie et al., 2015</xref>), as well as more recently identified variants of the MEL state, such as the neural crest-like and intermediate states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rambow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsoi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>). The MEL and MES subtypes display distinct epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles, resulting in divergent phenotypes such as migration and therapy response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verfaillie et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the identification of subtype-specific enhancers may be relevant for therapy, where it could improve safety and efficiency by narrowing down the effect of the treatment to a specific population. Comparisons between MEL and MES yield thousands of regions with differential acetylation (H3K27ac) and accessibility. However, it is unclear which of these subtype-specific regions function as active enhancers and which TFs are responsible for their activity.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed regions with MEL- and MES-specific H3K27ac chromatin marks proximal to differentially expressed genes. We designed MPRA experiments to test those regions at three different levels in a panel of patient-derived malignant melanoma (MM) lines. Our results precisely locate the origins of enhancer activity within the larger H3K27ac domains. In addition, we can accurately predict their subtype specificity and ultimately identify a set of rules governing MEL and MES enhancer activity. Furthermore, we show that a melanoma deep learning model (DeepMEL2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atak et al., 2021</xref>) trained on ATAC-seq data pinpoints which TFBSs drive enhancer activity and specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of MPRA libraries based on H3K27ac, ATAC-seq, and synthetic sequences</title><p>H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks are often used for the selection of candidate enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). However, such peaks can encompass large genomic regions, often 2â3 kb long, while enhancers are usually only a few hundred base pairs in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasperini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li and Wunderlich, 2017</xref>). To investigate the relationship between H3K27ac signal, chromatin accessibility peaks, and enhancer activity, we designed MPRA libraries at three different levels: 1.2â2.9-kb-sized H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks, 501-bp-sized ATAC-seq peaks that fall within the H3K27ac regions, and 190-bp subsequences tiling the entire H3K27ac regions.</p><p>We designed the H3K27ac ChIP-seq-based library (H3K27ac library) by selecting regions that are specifically acetylated in either the MEL or the MES melanoma cell state and located around differentially expressed genes in a panel of 12 melanoma lines: 3 MES lines (MM029, MM047, and MM099) and 9 MEL lines that cover a spectrum from pure melanocytic to intermediate melanoma (MM001, MM011, MM031, MM034, MM057, MM074, MM087, MM118, SKMEL5) (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Minnoye et al., 2020</xref>). A special consideration was given to regions overlapping ChIP-seq peaks for SOX10 and MITF (for MEL regions) or AP-1 (JUN and JUNB; for MES regions), known regulators of each state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>). A total of 35 MES- and 18 MEL-specific regions, with an average size of 1987 bp, were amplified from genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Regions were named âGENE_(-)000X,â where GENE is the associated target gene, (-)000 is the distance to the TSS, and X denotes whether the enhancer is distal, intronic, or at a promoter position (see Materials and methods). The H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal across these selected regions displays a good correlation between cell lines of the same subtype and a negative correlation between cell lines of a different subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). This correlation is also observed in the ATAC-seq signal and the target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c, d, and h</xref>). We created two vector libraries based on the CHEQ-seq vector backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verfaillie et al., 2016</xref>) by cloning the sequences upstream (5â² position) or downstream (intron position) of a minimal promoter (SCP1, see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Selection and cloning of melanoma state specific regions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cell state-specific regions were selected based on H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal from a panel of melanoma cell lines containing both mesenchymal-like (MES) (red bar) and melanocytic (MEL) lines (pure MEL: blue bar; intermediate MEL: purple bar).

We used only the H3K27ac peaks that are identified as active in the H3K27ac library or that are assigned as MEL- or MES-specific regulatory regions (respectively represented by regions belonging to topic 4 and topic 7) in our previously published cisTopic analysis of ATAC-seq data from 16 human melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo GonzÃ¡lez-Blas et al., 2019</xref>). Each sequence was defined by taking the summit of the ATAC-seq peak and extending 250 bp on each side, resulting in a 501 bp candidate sequence. In total, 28 MES- and 18 MEL-specific ATAC-seq peaks were selected from 37 of the 53 H3K27ac regions (for nine regions, two ATAC-seq peaks were selected). Over the 501 bp of those regions, the correlation of the H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq signals between the different cell lines remains the same as for the H3K27ac library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1e-g</xref>). We cloned the regions in the CHEQ-seq vector, upstream of the SCP1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition, we cloned the same set of sequences in the STARR-seq vector (an alternative MPRA vector) to assess assay-related variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muerdter et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to locate the precise origin of enhancer activity, we generated two tiling libraries (A and B, see Materials and methods), encompassing the entire H3K27ac regions. The tiles are 190 bp long with a 20 bp shift between consecutive tiles. The tiling for library A starts at nucleotide position 1 of the H3K27ac ChIP-seq regions while library B starts at position 11, resulting in a final tiling resolution of 10 bp when both sublibraries are taken into account.</p><p>We also sought to probe the effect of mutations within putative TFBSs in the selected H3K27ac regions. We used Cluster-Buster (CBust; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frith et al., 2003</xref>) with position weight matrices (PWMs) for binding sites of key regulators of MEL (SOX10, MITF, TFAP2A) and MES (AP-1 and TEAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>) to identify candidate TFBSs and generated tiles carrying mutated versions of these motifs (see Materials and methods). For each sublibrary, 800 shuffled tiles were generated as negative controls, resulting in a total of 7412 and 7356 tiles for sublibraries A and B, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

We confirmed that the majority of active tiles (92.2%) are located within an ATAC-seq peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and identified active tiles in 7 out of the 10 most active MEL ATAC-seq-based enhancers. Short 190 bp regions can thus often recapitulate the enhancer activity of the larger encompassing region. When two or more consecutive tiles are active, the enhancer may be contained in an even smaller sequence or the activity is coming from independently active elements close to one another.</p><p>We recently trained a deep learning model on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory topics (sets of co-accessible genomic regions clustered by cisTopic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo GonzÃ¡lez-Blas et al., 2019</xref>) from 30 melanoma lines, called DeepMEL2, that accurately predicts the accessibility and activity of a sequence in the different melanoma subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atak et al., 2021</xref>). Each topic used to train the model regrouped accessible regions found in one cell line, in a specific subtype, or in all cell lines. Two topics are associated with the MEL subtype, topics 16 and 17, mostly focused on SOX and MITF motifs, respectively. We scored our 190 bp tiles with DeepMEL2 and found high MEL prediction scores (&gt;0.10, see Materials and methods) specifically within ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Of the top DeepMEL2 predictions for MEL specific topics, 11% (topic 16) and 17.3% (topic 17) are active tiles in the MPRA (with 0.25/0.375 recall and 0.11/0.173 precision for topics 16 and 17, respectively). These low precision values may be explained by the fact that the DeepMEL2 model was trained on ATAC-seq data, thus yielding high prediction scores within ATAC-seq peaks, yet not all of these show positive MPRA activity.</p><p>In some cases, we identified multiple acetylated regions near one gene. For the tyrosinase (<italic>TYR</italic>) gene, expressed specifically in MEL lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1h</xref>), three regions were selected as MEL-specific and tested at the acetylation, accessibility, and tiling levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). TYR_â9-D and TYR_â1-D regions display high reporter activity, which is subsequently found in the selected ATAC-seq peak. Activity is further narrowed down to tiles corresponding to the DeepMEL2 predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The TYR_P region, at the geneâs promoter site, has a low activity that is also not found when tiling the region, despite the DeepMEL2 predictions. Those findings suggest that TYR expression in MEL lines is largely dependent on the activity of distal enhancers.</p><p>Some other enhancers that are active in the H3K27ac and ATAC-seq libraries are not recapitulated in the tile library (e.g., SOX10_â34-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2c</xref>). This can be due to technical reasons, such as the small size of the tiles. Nevertheless, from the combination of the ATAC-seq and enhancer tiling MPRAs, we can conclude that not all subtype-specific ATAC-seq peaks function as a stand-alone enhancer.</p><p>We finally compared signals of H3K27ac ChIP-seq mean score, ATAC-seq mean score, and their corresponding MPRA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>). With the H3K27ac library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), the acetylation signal measured over the selected regions correlates well with the accessibility signal (Pearsonâs correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.77), indicating that ATAC-seq peaks are found within the selected acetylated regions and maintain the same differential signal. Active enhancers are found in the majority (14/18) of the MEL-specific acetylation regions with ATAC-seq signal. This trend is also visible in the ATAC-seq-based library, with most of the active enhancers detected in ATAC-seq peaks (13/19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). However, the moderate correlation between ATAC-seq signal and CHEQ-seq activity in the corresponding library (Spearmanâs rho = 0.48) also indicates that the peak mean signal is not a good predictor of the activity level of an enhancer. In part, this may be due to confounding of ATAC and H3K27ac read depth by genomic copy number aberrations. Also, the activity displayed by some MES-specific regions lacking ATAC-seq signal in MM001 suggests that closed regions in the genome can still harbor activity in an episomal MPRA.</p><p>In conclusion, our enhancer selection resulted in a high rate of active enhancers in MM001 and the design of our MPRA libraries allowed us to precisely pinpoint the origins of, at least part of, the enhancer activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MES-specific H3K27ac/ATAC regions are active in MES lines</title><p>Next, we transfected all libraries in the MES line MM029.

This activity is further confirmed in the ATAC-seq and tiling libraries: the ATAC-seq peaks within the four active H3K27ac regions are all active, while the ATAC-seq peaks within the three negative H3K27ac regions are all negative. In the COL5A1_â17-D region, tiling suggests the presence of three distinct enhancers, including two that are located within small ATAC-seq peaks that were not selected for the ATAC-based library.</p><p>DeepMEL2 is trained on both MEL- and MES-accessible regions, and topic 19 has been shown to be the best-performing MES topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atak et al., 2021</xref>).

Such enhancers are found in the SERPINE1_â110-I region, where the SERPINE1_â110-IA ATAC-seq peak is inactive in the CHEQ-seq and STARR-seq assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c</xref>), but the tiling assay shows robust enhancer activity. Of the two ATAC-seq peaks in the FOSL2_â117-I region, neither one recapitulates the activity of the acetylated region.

ATAC-based and tiling CHEQ-seq assays show that most active enhancers in the H3K27Ac regions reside within ATAC-seq peaks (151/164 active tiles are found in ATAC-seq peaks; 92.1%). Irrespective, ATAC-seq peak mean signal remains a poor predictor of the level of enhancer activity, at least as read out by CHEQ-seq. Moreover, the presence of a differentially accessible ATAC-seq peak does not guarantee enhancer function. Indeed, of 26 differentially accessible peaks, only 14 show demonstrable activity (54%).</p><p>In conclusion, MPRAs performed in MM001 and MM029 have shown a high success rate of selected regions to display activity specifically in their corresponding cell state. However, MM001 and MM029 lie at the extremes of the MEL-MES spectrum. To further investigate how the activity of these regions scales along the MEL-MES axis, we studied them in five additional melanoma cell lines, representing more intermediate or transitory melanoma states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsoi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MES enhancers show lower but consistent activity in intermediate lines</title><p>We expanded our panel of cell lines to include two additional MES lines (MM047 and MM099) and three MEL-intermediate lines (MM057, MM074, and MM087). These three lines have high SOX10 and MITF expression (hallmarks of the MEL subtype), yet also show both marker expression and phenotypic characteristics typical for the MES subtype (e.g., AXL expression, TGFb1 signaling activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsoi et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to MM001, when SOX10 expression is lost, these lines shift toward a MES subtype, with expression of AP-1 and increased chromatin accessibility in MES-specific regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>). MM057, MM074, and MM087 were part of the cell lines used for the selection of MEL-specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq regions. As such, they display an acetylation and accessibility profile as well as a transcriptional activity of the associated genes similar to MM001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1bâd</xref>).

Based on the tiling profile of that region across all tested lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), we can identify two active enhancers. One enhancer, located within the largest ATAC-seq peak, is MEL-specific and overlaps with the DeepMEL2 predictions for MEL accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a</xref>, green highlight). The other one is located just downstream in a GC-rich region and displays activity in all cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a b</xref>, red highlight). This profile explains why the SOX10_â56DB ATAC-seq region, which does not fully cover this GC-rich region, is less active in MES lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>With the ATAC-seq region library, the correlation between lines remains the same with a clear separation of the MEL and MES lines and the same pattern in the proportion of active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>). The overall lower percentage of active MEL enhancers can be explained by the high proportion of regions with two peaks selected, where most of the time only one is active. As in the H3K27Ac library, the MES enhancer activity is higher in intermediate lines than in MM001 but lower than in MES lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).</p><p>At the tiling level, intermediate lines show an increased MES enhancer activity comparable to that in the MES lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4gâi</xref>). This results in a reduced correlation with MM001 despite a similarly strong activity of MEL enhancers. As observed in the specific part of the SOX10_â56-D region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), most active MEL regions have a good specificity, with no activity in MES lines. On the contrary, MES enhancers display a similar activity in MES lines and intermediate lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>In summary, MEL enhancers display a consistent and specific activity in MEL lines while MES enhancers are not only active in MES lines but also in intermediate lines and to a lesser extent in MM001. This behavior suggests that enhancer activity is driven by the expression of TFs responsible for the MEL and MES subtypes. SOX10, MITF, and TFAP have been identified as drivers of the MEL state and AP-1 and TEAD of the MES state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verfaillie et al., 2015</xref>). MM029 expresses MITF at a low level, but this does not result in MEL enhancer activity, suggesting that MITF (or its isoforms in MM029) alone is not sufficient.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Key transcription factor binding sites explain melanoma enhancer activity</title><p>To better understand which TFs are important for MEL enhancer activity, we included tiles with MITF, SOX, and TFAP binding site mutations in our tiling libraries. SOX10 and MITF both represent established lineage TFs in melanocytes and in melanoma, and TFAP2 has been found to co-occur with MITF in active regulatory elements in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goding, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seberg et al., 2017</xref>). SOX10 was previously shown to be necessary for melanoma formation and maintenance by controlling cell survival and cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cronin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shakhova et al., 2012</xref>). MITF is considered to be a melanoma oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garraway and Sellers, 2006</xref>) and has been implicated in various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goding and Arnheiter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levy et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The comparison of wild-type versus mutant tiles shows that TFAP does not affect the activity of the profiled enhancers in any of the MEL lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, loss of SOX or MITF significantly affects enhancer activity. KIT_114-D provides a good example of both MITF and SOX motif contributions in MM001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The tiling library confirms the location of enhancer activity to be in the KIT_114DA region, where both motifs are found to influence the activity. Mutation of the SOX binding site abolishes tile activity. The same is observed when the MITF binding site is mutated, with the notable exception of one tile also containing the SOX motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). It is worth noting that despite KIT_114-D(A) being by far the most active region in both the H3K27ac (together with SGCD_15-I) and the ATAC-seq library, tiles with a higher activity have been found in five other MEL regions. This suggests that individual tiles do not necessarily recapitulate the full enhancer activity and specificity coming from the whole accessible regions. The DeepMEL2 topic 16 and 17 prediction scores closely follow tile activity, and both highlight the SOX and MITF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, activity and predictions are not centered on the ATAC-seq peak summit. This suggests that, through training with ATAC-seq data, DeepMEL2 has identified TFBSs responsible for both accessibility <italic>and</italic> activity. Motif enrichment analysis on both the active and most accessible tiles in MEL lines identifies the E-box motif (MITF) as highly enriched in both active and accessible sequences while the SOX motif is only enriched in accessible tiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). On the other hand, AP-1 motifs are enriched only in active tiles. The discrepancy between the effect of some SOX mutations on activity and the absence of enrichment for the SOX motif in active tiles could be due to the limited number of MEL enhancers tested (18). Note that MITF and SOX10 motif enrichment agrees with previously published ChIP-seq data, with the most active regions in our MPRA having high ChIP-seq signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). Extending our observations to all MEL vs. MES differentially acetylated regions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verfaillie et al., 2015</xref>, we found a significant enrichment of both MITF and SOX10 ChIP-seq signals in MEL-specific regions (t-test p-value &lt; 10<sup>â16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). Finally, to confirm that the observed effect of mutations on activity is not limited to 190 bp tiles but also applies in the context of 501 bp accessible regions, we mutated MITF or SOX in three active ATAC regions (MLANA_5-I, IRF4_4-I, TYR_â9-D) and tested them in a luciferase assay in MM001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3a</xref>; see Materials and methods). For all three regions, mutation of either TFBS from the sequence results in a significant drop in enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3b</xref>). Additionally, mutating ZEB motifs increased activity compared to wild type for both MLANA_5-I and IRF4_4-I.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Analysis of transcription factors driving MEL specific enhancer activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) KIT_114-D region activity summary in MM001.

After cisTopic analysis, we selected 1461 ATAC-seq peaks where accessibility is lost upon KD and tiled them with 190-bp-long sequences and 120 bp shifts, resulting in 6696 individual sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4aâd</xref>). We cloned this library in the CHEQ-seq vector and transfected it in MM087.

Only the MITF ChIP-seq signal was enriched in active tiles, indicating that SOX10-dependent regions containing MITF sites are preferentially active.

Twenty-four different combinations were generated in two background sequences, cloned in the CHEQ-seq vector and transfected in MM001, MM074, and MM087.

We see a progressive increase of the activity based on the number of MITF binding sites only when there is also a SOX dimer motif present in the sequence. In the absence of a SOX motif, enhancer activity remains low in comparison with sequences containing at least one SOX motif, even when as many as six MITF motifs are present.

By studying candidate enhancers with different sequence lengths and interpreting the results in conjunction with deep learning predictions, we obtained a better understanding of the regulatory grammar, function, and specificity of melanoma enhancers.</p><p>The first studies that used MPRAs were based on very short sequences (84â145 nt) and identified a modular and motif-centric definition of enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kheradpour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 2013</xref>). The use of captured genomic regions allowed for longer (hundreds of bp) and more (several millions) sequences to be tested in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verfaillie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). While providing a genome-wide view on enhancer activity, the cloned fragments are highly variable in size and do not readily allow the study of corresponding mutant sequences. Furthermore, most studies using MPRAs have been limited to one cell line or two very different cell lines (e.g., K562 and HepG2; or S2 and OSC in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ernst et al., 2016</xref>), leaving the evaluation of enhancer specificity unassessed or reduced to individual examples. Here, we perform MPRAs in a panel of seven cell lines from the same disease, allowing us to validate the cell state specificity of the selected regions.</p><p>Our approach of selecting putative enhancers based on specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks, located close to differentially expressed genes, resulted in a high success rate (60â75%), comparable to other studies leveraging a similar approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gorkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graybuck et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, our large-scale library based solely on ATAC-seq peaks that decrease after SOX10 KD contained only 15.1% active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). This indicates that success rates of enhancer activity vary widely. Whereas most of the differential H3K27ac peaks near marker genes are indeed enhancers, many ATAC-seq peaks scattered across the genome do not act as enhancers when tested in reporter assays, even if they were affected by TF KD. We also find active enhancers in closed chromatin regions, a phenomenon previously described in whole-genome STARR-seq studies in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017a</xref>). Those closed regions can often be found accessible in other cell lines of our panel, and their ectopic activity suggests that the chromatin state in the genome differs from the episomal plasmid, keeping the enhancer inactive in the genome despite what seems to be a sufficient TF expression to trigger their activity in our episomal assay. Conversely, some enhancers may rely on 3D chromatin structure and the formation of enhancer-promoter looping to activate transcription via long-range interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>). This mechanism would require the native chromatin context that cannot be readily recapitulated by our reporter assay.</p><p>The influence of the size of the candidate enhancer has previously been assessed, although to a limited extent, and only by choosing sizes that are not representative of chromatin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klein et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we tested long sequences corresponding to entire H3K27ac regions up to 2.9 kb, 501 bp ATAC-seq peak regions located within the larger H3K27ac domains, and finally, short 190 bp sequences tiling acetylated regions. This revealed that the actual enhancer within a H3K27ac region is usually located within an accessible subregion. Furthermore, the activity of that ATAC-seq peak can often be recapitulated by a sequence of 190 bp in length. Previous studies have used enhancer tiling to assess the activity of accessible chromatin regions and highlighted the importance of cell type-specific binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ernst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, such a short sequence does not always capture all the regulatory information found within the accessible region. Our detailed description of KIT_114DA and COL5A1_â17-D ATAC-seq peaks highlights the presence of both activator and repressor elements spread over distances larger than 190 bp that cannot be jointly evaluated with our tiled MPRA. This finding highlights the necessity of using sequences ~ 500 bp long to more confidently evaluate enhancers.</p><p>Many genes are regulated by an âarrayâ of enhancers thought to cooperate to regulate target gene expression by forming a chromatin hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Giammartino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). For several loci in this study, we selected multiple regions near the same target gene. This experiment indicated that not all regions with a similar acetylation and ATAC-seq profile harbor enhancer activity in the reporter assay. As previously described by genomic editing of enhancers displaying similar chromatin features, enhancer cooperativity can be required to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hnisz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). This makes the identification of relevant TFBSs the most informative method to find active enhancers. In that regard, the use of deep learning models like DeepMEL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atak et al., 2021</xref>), even when they are trained only on ATAC-seq data, provides a powerful tool to identify key TFs and evaluate enhancer activity.</p><p>Intriguingly, we find a gradient of MES enhancer activity across our panel of cell lines, with MM001, intermediate, and MES lines having low, medium, and high activity, respectively. These enhancer profiles do not agree with their acetylation, ATAC-seq, and transcriptome profiles, which all show a strong intra-subtype homogeneity. This discrepancy was more pronounced with short 190 bp sequences.</p><p>Our results suggest that AP-1 is responsible for the activity of MES enhancers, agreeing with its predominance in allele-specific chromatin accessibility variants in melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atak et al., 2021</xref>). Note that AP-1 is also typically activated during the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hess et al., 2004</xref>). This may contribute to the limited activity of MES regions in MM001 following electroporation. Nevertheless, AP-1 enhancers show much higher activity in intermediate lines, which cannot be explained by a stress response alone. The observed activity of AP-1 enhancers in intermediate lines, even though they are neither accessible nor acetylated in these lines, could be due to the episomal nature of our reporter assay, whereby a (limited) AP-1 activity, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>), may be sufficient to activate enhancers on a plasmid, but not in the endogenous locus. The use of a genome integrated reporter assay could help determine if the accessibility of the sequence is required for MES enhancer activity in MEL lines.</p><p>The analysis of MEL regions revealed that both SOX and MITF binding sites independently contribute to enhancer activity. TFAP binding sites did not show any influence on enhancer activity in the tested H3K27ac regions and showed only a small enrichment in SOX10-dependent ATAC-seq peaks displaying activity (NES: 1.19; pAdj: 0.046). These results contradict previous observations of TFAP2 and MITF co-occurrence in active regulatory elements in melanocytes and of TFAP2 pioneer function during cell fate commitment in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rothstein and Simoes-Costa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seberg et al., 2017</xref>). These differences may be explained at least in part by the limited number of regions selected in our H3K27ac library or by a possible reduced influence of TFAP2 in the melanoma lines used in this study. Interestingly, we identify an interaction between SOX and MITF where the presence of at least one SOX dimer motif greatly increases the activity of enhancers containing MITF motifs. It is not clear if this interaction is due to the direct cooperation of SOX10 and MITF or the pioneer factor function of SOX family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Julian et al., 2017</xref>). Cooperativity between these two TFs could be governed by strict rules requiring the presence of a SOX motif for activity or could be a more âlooseâ requirement for heterotypic clusters of TFBSs (i.e. containing binding sites for multiple TFs) to maintain a high level of activity. Indeed, studies have shown that, in some cases, homotypic clusters of TFBSs yield lower expression than heterotypic clusters of TFBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fiore and Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levo and Segal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">White et al., 2016</xref>). While our exploration of synthetic SOX/MITF-based enhancers did not include sequences with fewer than six MITF and no SOX motifs, our enhancer tiling MPRA and luciferase assay did reveal such sequences to be active (e.g., KIT_114-D and SOX10_â35-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2b and c</xref>; MLANA_5-I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3b</xref>). This suggests that a SOX motif is not required in enhancers with few MITF motifs. Alternatively, the pioneer function of SOX would suggest that the sequences cloned in the reporter vector are at least partially chromatinized. Riu et al. previously presented evidence supporting plasmid chromatinization, more precisely in regions of bacterial origin, resulting in silencing of a human expression cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riu et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is still unclear if non-coding human regions could also be subject to chromatinization in a plasmid context and what role sequence length might play. We find a less pronounced influence of the SOX motif in short 190 bp compared to 259 bp sequences, and shorter MES enhancers also show more ectopic activation in intermediate lines, which may suggest that short enhancer sequences are being less efficiently chromatinized. Consequently, short enhancers might be characterized by increased accessibility in an extrachromosomal reporter, uncoupling measured activities from those demonstrated at the endogenous locus. Kheradpour et al. proposed a similar hypothesis by suggesting that DNA sequence features contained within the tested elements are partly responsible for establishing the endogenous chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kheradpour et al., 2013</xref>). These considerations are also relevant in the context of extrachromosomal DNA driving oncogene overexpression in various human malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verhaak et al., 2019</xref>). The use of integrated MPRA or the measurement of chromatin accessibility in the plasmid would help to determine if enhancer sequences are subject to chromatin modification.</p><p>With this study, we show that melanoma subtype-specific enhancers can be identified, even down to sizes of 190 bp. This opens up promising avenues to use information gathered from MPRAs to identify small, specific enhancers for enhancer and gene therapies. Our assay combining SOX and MITF motifs showed that new MEL enhancers can be designed by addition of the corresponding TFBSs to a random background sequence and that the level of activity can be precisely controlled by varying the number of TFBSs. Using genomic regions confirmed as MEL enhancers and adjusting the motif sequences and numbers could further improve enhancer design.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KAPA-HiFi <break/>HotStart ReadyMix</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Material #

Differentially enriched H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks between MEL (6669) and MES (13,453) state, identified in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verfaillie et al., 2015</xref>), were used as input in i-cisTarget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">ImrichovÃ¡ et al., 2015</xref>) to identify enriched TFBSs in specifically acetylated regions. For each melanoma subtype, the target genes of the top three enriched TFBSs were extracted and used to filter the list of differentially expressed genes identified in each subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verfaillie et al., 2015</xref>). Those genes were ordered by differential expression in MES vs. MEL lines, and the TSS of the top and bottom genes was used as the starting point to manually search for H3K27ac regions specific for MES and MEL, respectively. ChIP-seq tracks are visually investigated using the UCSC Genome Browser for regions displaying acetylation peaks only in one state close to those genes. Identified regions, within ~150 kb of the TSS, are associated with the differentially expressed gene, even if some of them are closer to or within another gene. Candidate regions were preferentially selected if they also overlapped with ChIP-seq peaks for SOX10 or MITF for MEL regions and JUN and JUNB (AP-1) for MES regions. 65 regions with a size &lt;3 kb were manually selected, and primers to amplify them were designed using Primer3Plus within the flanking first 100 bp on each side of the sequence. 15 bp extensions were added to the primers to allow recombination with the region upstream of the SCP1 promoter in the CHEQ-seq vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verfaillie et al., 2016</xref>) via In-Fusion reaction (primer list is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Regions were named as follows: GENE_(-)000X with âGENEâ the name of the gene associated to the region, (-)000 the distance (in kb) between the gene TSS and the highest peak summit (H3K27ac) of the region, and âXâ the gene annotation of the region with âPâ for promoter, âIâ for intron, âEâ for exon, âDâ for distal, and â3Uâ for 3â² UTR.</p><p>All PCR amplifications performed in this study make use of the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

Reactions were recovered from the membrane, and 2.5 Âµl of the reaction was transformed into 25 Âµl of Lucigen Endura ElectroCompetent Cells (Biosearch Technologies, Hoddesdon, UK). Transformed bacteria were cultured overnight in a shaker before maxiprep.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>ATAC-based library</title><p>The sequences constituting the ATAC-based library were selected from ATAC-seq peaks from MM001, MM029, MM047, MM057, MM074, MM087, and MM099 overlapping with H3K27ac library regions. Among this subset, only peaks that overlap with regions identified as active in the H3K27ac library or that are assigned as MEL- or MES-specific regulatory regions (respectively represented by regions belonging to topics 4 and 7) in our previously published cisTopic analysis of ATAC-seq data from 16 human melanoma cell lines were retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo GonzÃ¡lez-Blas et al., 2019</xref>). The final selection included 46 ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When two ATAC peaks were selected within the same H3K27ac region, an âAâ and a âBâ were added to the region name to distinguish them (e.g., KIT_114DA and KIT_114DB). The summit of each peak was extended by 250 bp on both sides to generate a 501 bp sequence. At the 3â² end of the sequence, a 16 bp spacer sequence was added, followed by an 8 bp BC specific for each selected region. 38 sequences were synthesized by Twist Bioscience (South San Francisco, CA). This includes four sequences where an A or a T was substituted to break a polyA or polyT, respectively, in order to make the sequences compatible with the synthesis process. Primers were designed for the remaining eight sequences to amplify them from genomic DNA (âATAC-seq-based libraryâ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Only one PCR, that is, for the amplification of the SERPINE1_â27-D sequence, was not successful.

The individual sequences were pooled together in equimolar ratio, and NEBuilder (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), with a vector to insert ratio of 1:2, was used to introduce them in the vectors. Dialysis and transformation were performed similarly to the H3K27ac library. Before culture for maxiprep, 1:100,000 of the transformed bacteria was plated on an LB-agar dish with carbenicillin to estimate the complexity of the cloned library.

Tile generation is stopped when the position of the final nucleotide of the tile is superior to the final nucleotide of the H3K27ac region. To generate mutated tiles, we first scanned all selected H3K27ac regions with CBust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frith et al., 2003</xref>) and the following PWM separately: transfac_pro__M08838 (SOX10 dimer); homer__RTCATGTGAC_MITF; transfac_pro__M01859 (TFAP monomer); tfdimers__MD00038 (TFAP dimer); tfdimers__MD00591 (SOX10-TFAP dimer); hocomoco__JUN_f1; homer__NATGASTCABNN_Fosl2; cisbp__M5907 (TEAD). Using a custom script, motifs were mutated on their two or four most important nucleotides for monomers and dimers, respectively. In order to keep the number of tiles manageable, only highly conserved motifs were mutated. This resulted in some potentially functional sites (presence of TF ChIP-seq peak) not being recognized by PWM scores. Mutated tiles for each motif were generated separately so that all occurrences of a single motif are present. Shuffled negative control tiles were generated by shuffling all WT and mutated sequences with uShuffle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>). Sequences containing a stretch of the same nucleotide for six or more nucleotides were filtered out.

Enhancers were first filtered based on the number of BCs identified in the sequencing reads. Thresholds of 5 (for the H3K37ac libraries and enhancer tiling libraries), 10 (for ATAC libraries), or 20 (for the SOX-MITF combinations library) BCs per enhancer were selected based on the complexity of the library and the sequencing saturation of the enhancerâBC assignment samples. For the remaining enhancers, BC counts were aggregated per enhancer and then a count per million (CPM) normalization was applied. Plasmid (input) and cDNA (output) samples were merged by keeping only enhancers remaining in both samples after filtering. Input normalization was done by dividing CPM normalized cDNA counts by CPM normalized plasmid counts, resulting in an FC value. For libraries with shuffled sequences, a basal expression normalization was further applied by dividing the FC value of the enhancer by the median FC value of the shuffled sequences. The MPRAnalyze method was tried as an alternative to our method and gave nearly identical results in the case of the H3K27ac CHEQ-seq intron library (mean Pearsonâs correlation on log2 FC <italic>r</italic> = 0.96; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashuach et al., 2019</xref>). The high computational demand when the number of BCs is high made it inappropriate for the analysis of most libraries. For consistency, all assays were analyzed with our aggregated BC method, which showed more consistency with low complexity libraries and more scalability with very complex libraries. In order to distinguish active and inactive enhancers, a Gaussian fit of the shuffled negative control values was performed with the ârobustbase 0.93-6â package, and a p-value and BenjaminiâHochberg adjusted p-value was calculated based on that Gaussian fit for all enhancers with the âstats 3.6.0â package. An enhancer is considered active if its adjusted p-value is &lt;0.05. For the H3K27ac and ATAC-seq libraries, which did not contain shuffled sequences, regions containing no active tiles in the enhancer tiling MPRAs and displaying low activity in both H3K27ac and ATAC-seq libraries MPRAs were selected as negative controls and used to fit the Gaussian curve.

By comparing enhancer activity through massively parallel reporter assays, chromatin features, and underlying TF binding profiles in melanocytic and mesenchymal-like melanoma cell states, the authors identify candidate regulators and mechanisms that explain enhancer activity and specificity in melanoma biology. These findings will be of broad interest to those seeking to understand cell type- or cell identify-specific gene regulation at the level of transcriptional and epigenetic control of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71735.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.27.453936">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.27.453936v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jian Xu as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide more details on the filtering and selection criteria for the identification of MES- and MEL-specific regions. A simple flowchart to illustrate the major selection criteria might be helpful.</p><p>2) Consider improving the nomenclature for various enhancer regions, as commented by Reviewer #1.</p><p>3) For the identification of candidate TFs and their combinations responsible for differential enhancer activity in MEL vs MES cells, DeepMEL2-based analysis does not seem to provide robust predictions. This is also exemplified by the analysis of binding sites for MITF and AP-1, as commented by Reviewer #2. Therefore, the authors may use available ChIP-seq data for candidate TFs and quantitatively compare signals at the respective enhancers in different cell states.

Unfortunately, this resulted in some functional sites not being recognised by PWM scores. In the case of the IRF4__4-I region, as mentioned by the reviewer, there is one MITF motif identified by its PWM that does not overlap with a ChIP-seq peak, and one ChIP-seq peak without a high-scoring PWM match. Interestingly, the DeepExplainer profile of the tile containing the high-scoring PWM match (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>) shows the presence of neighboring ZEB repressor motifs, potentially explaining the absence of MITF ChIP-seq signal at this location. The DeepExplainer profile of the IRF4__4-I ATAC-seq region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2c</xref>) shows a MITF motif with a predicted contribution to the ATAC-seq signal and which overlaps with the MITF ChIP-seq peak. A mutation in nucleotide 10 of the motif (A instead of C or T) is most likely the reason for this motif not being picked up as PWM match even though the ChIP-seq data suggest that it is functional. It is interesting to see that DeepMEL2 allows more flexibility in the identification of functional TFBSs by taking motif context into consideration, as illustrated in figure 6 for the COL5A1_-17-D region.
