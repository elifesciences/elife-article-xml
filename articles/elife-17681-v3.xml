Deficiency in either the RIβ or the RIIβ subunit results in distinct neuronal phenotypes. Although RIβ contributes to synaptic plasticity, it is the least studied isoform. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we generated high-resolution large-scale immunohistochemical mosaic images of mouse brain that provided global views of several brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebellum. The isoforms concentrate in discrete brain regions, and we were able to zoom-in to show distinct patterns of subcellular localization. RIβ is enriched in dendrites and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RIIβ is concentrated in axons. Using correlated light and electron microscopy, we confirmed the mitochondrial and nuclear localization of RIβ in cultured neurons. To show the functional significance of nuclear localization, we demonstrated that downregulation of RIβ, but not of RIIβ, decreased CREB phosphorylation. Our study reveals how PKA isoform specificity is defined by precise localization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17681.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17681.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein kinases</kwd><kwd>cellular and subcellular localization</kwd><kwd>Immunohistochemical mouse brain images</kwd><kwd>correlated light and electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>High resolution large scale images</kwd><kwd>PKA regulatory subunits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK054441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Susan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM082949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution, large-scale immunohistochemical mouse brain images showing global views of different brain regions, as well as cellular and subcellular details, identified distinct localization of PKA RIβ and RIIβ regulatory subunits that reveal functional differences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise spatiotemporal regulation of signaling molecules is central to the intricacies of signal transduction. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is ubiquitously expressed in every mammalian cell, regulates numerous signaling pathways and is critical for many neuronal functions. These include learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kandel, 2012</xref>) and multiple forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yasuda et al., 2003</xref>). Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PKA severely affects the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation and inhibits synaptic plasticity and long-lasting memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 1997</xref>). A reduction in PKA signaling contributes to the etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dagda and Das Banerjee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howells et al., 2000</xref>). Phosphorylation mediated by cAMP signaling is critically involved in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, synaptic release of neurotransmitters and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Skalhegg and Tasken, 2000</xref>), and a large part of the functional diversity of this kinase results from isoform diversity. Eukaryotic cells express multiple forms of PKA regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits. PKA holoenzyme consists of an R-subunit dimer bound to two C- subunits (R<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>). The biochemical and functional features of PKA holoenzymes are largely determined by the structure and the biochemical properties of the regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilouz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There are two classes of R-subunits, RI and RII, which are classified into α and β subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Døskeland et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKnight et al., 1988</xref>). Each isoform is encoded by a unique gene and preferentially expressed in different cells and tissues. RIα and RIIα are ubiquitously expressed in every cell, whereas RIβ and RIIβ expression is more tissue restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</xref>). RIβ is expressed in brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</xref>). RIIβ is predominantly expressed in brain, endocrine, fat, liver and reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahnsen et al., 1986</xref>). The four R-subunits are functionally non-redundant. Depletion of either the RIβ or the RIIβ gene in mice resulted in specific neuronal defects. RIIβ knockout mice display defects in motor behavior and loss of PKA-mediated neuronal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandon et al., 1998</xref>). Hippocampal slices from RIβ null mice show a severe deficit in long-term depression and depotentiation at the Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapse. Despite a compensatory increase in the RIα protein levels, hippocampal function was not rescued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandon et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The composition and specific structural and biochemical properties of PKA holoenzymes (R<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) account, in part, for differential cellular responses to discrete extracellular signals that activate adenylate cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). Space-restricted kinase activation provides an extra layer of specificity in PKA signaling. PKA is typically targeted at specific intracellular microdomains through interactions with A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). Many AKAPs have been identified together with their specific requirements for selective binding to regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sarma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>). This spatio-temporal regulation determines the access of proteins to interacting binding partners. AKAPs provide a control mechanism that directs, integrates and locally attenuates the cAMP-initiated cascade. The hallmark signature motif of the AKAPs is an amphipathic helix that binds tightly to the dimerization and docking (D/D) domain of the R-subunits. Recently, a point mutation in the D/D domain of the RIβ gene has been associated with a new neurodegenerative disease that presents with dementia and Parkinsonism, characterized by specific and abundant accumulation of RIβ in neuronal inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Rigorous cellular characterization of protein localization is a necessary step if we aim to understand PKA function in a physiological context. To date, relatively few efforts have attempted to define the subcellular localization of endogenous proteins systematically using imaging-based techniques. Currently, RIβ, the isoform that has a unique role in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandon et al., 1995</xref>) and has been associated with a neurodegenerative disease, is the least-studied PKA isoform. RIβ spatial localization has not been systematically studied due to antibody cross-reactivity with RIα. Furthermore, most of the available RIIβ localization data are focused on specific regions of interest; thus the global context of the protein localization is lost.</p><p>Subcellular cAMP signaling domains are defined by the distinct environments within cellular organelles. The dogma of cAMP-PKA signaling in the nucleus states that, upon cAMP-induced activation of the cytosolic PKA holoenzyme, the C-subunit dissociates from the R-subunit in an isoform-specific manner and translocates into the nucleus by diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harootunian et al., 1993</xref>). Contradictory, reports have increasingly proposed the existence of resident pools of nuclear PKA holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jarnaess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sample et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zippin et al., 2004</xref>). While the necessity of a proper nuclear PKA activity for neuronal function is well-documented, neither the existence of PKA R-subunits nor their physiological role within the nucleus has been well-studied.</p><p>In this study, we generated high-resolution large-scale mosaic images of several mouse brain slices using RIβ- and RIIβ-specific antibodies. As RIβ is the least-studied isoform at the protein level, we focused our analyses on brain regions where we expected RIβ to be predominant on the basis of its mRNA expression profiles and its predicted functional importance from RIβ(–/–) mice. The use of large-scale immunohistochemical brain maps allows us to gain an overview of the RIβ and RIIβ protein distributions over large areas and then to zoom in to obtain higher-resolution views in order to investigate subcellular features. We found that each regulatory isoform is predominant in distinct brain regions and were able to identify unique and consistent patterns of distribution within the hippocampus and the cerebellum. RIβ is concentrated in dendrites, and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RIIβ is concentrated in axons. We confirmed the RIβ subcellular distribution that emerged from the mosaic images using the mini-Singlet Oxygen Generator (miniSOG), a probe that allowed us to do correlated light and electron microscopy. We found RIβ in the mitochondria, as we predicted earlier, as well as in the nucleus, establishing a new paradigm for PKA signaling in the nucleus. To demonstrate a functional distinction between the two isoforms in the nucleus, we selectively downregulated the two isoforms and used CREB phosphorylation as a reporter for a nuclear PKA substrate. Downregulation of RIβ, but not of RIIβ, decreased pCREB in hippocampal cultures. These comprehensive brain images are accessible to browse or download via the Cell Centered Database (CCDB).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of the regional distribution of RIβ and RIIβ across brain regions</title><p>The overall patterns of RIβ and RIIβ protein distribution across brain regions within a full coronal slice are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Images were acquired using confocal microscopy. Image stacks were then knit together to create high-resolution 2D large-scale brain images. The resulting image mosaics provide detailed views of the cellular and subcellular distribution of RIβ and RIIβ without losing the context of the tissue. To map the protein distribution of RIβ and RIIβ, we stained mouse brain sections with specific RIβ and RIIβ antibodies. Although RIIβ antibody is commonly used and its specificity has been previously validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</xref>), RIβ immunohistochemical imaging has not been possible previously due to the high cross reactivity of existing antibodies with RIα. Thus, it was essential to confirm the absolute specificity of the RIβ antibodies. To achieve high specificity, we removed any RIα cross-reacting antibodies with immobilized RIα protein as described in the Material and methods, and then extensively validated the specificity and selectivity of the RIβ and RIIβ antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) Western blots confirmed the specificity of the antibodies for RIα vs. RIβ purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, upper left panel), while dot blots of the four purified R-subunit isoforms demonstrated the specificity and selectivity of our RIβ and RIIβ antibodies to the proteins in their native conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, upper right panel). To confirm specificity in cells, we overexpressed RIβ-MKO2 or RIα-MKO2 in mouse 10 T1/2 cells; RIβ antibody detects overexpressed RIβ-MKO2 but not the overexpressed RIα-MKO2. Similar experiments were also carried out for the RIIβ antibody in order to validate its specificity and selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The antibody did not crossreact with RIIα, its closest homolog. Staining the overexpressed cells with secondary antibodies alone resulted in no signal at similar levels or higher laser power, demonstrating no background from secondary antibodies in our method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1 A4 and C4</xref>). For an additional negative control, RIβ antibody was incubated with purified full-length human RIβ protein. The pre-absorbed antibody blocked the antibody’s specific binding and no signal was detected when tested on the RIβ-MKO2 overexpressed cells or on a brain slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1 A5 and C5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17681.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the regional distribution of RIβ and RIIβ across brain regions.</title><p>Wide-field views of a high-resolution large-scale mosaic image for a full coronal tissue slice are shown for RIβ (red in colored image) and RIIβ (green in colored image).

Strong signals are observed in the allocortex, including the piriform cortex and the retrosplenial granular cortex, and much less in the neocortex. RIβ is observed also in the dorsal endopiriform nucleus. In the hypothalamus, strong cell body labeling is seen in the subincertal nucleus. Comparing RIβ protein levels to previously reported RIβ mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</xref>), we observe that RIβ mRNA levels are higher in the pyramidal cell layer than in the dentate gyrus but the protein is expressed at similar levels in both regions.</p><p>In our images, RIIβ is predominantly expressed in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RIIβ was previously shown to be the major PKA isoform in the striatum — including the caudoputamen, nucleus accumbens, and islands of calleja — by in situ hybridization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</xref>), as well as by comparing the RIIβ protein expression from various dissected brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandon et al., 1998</xref>). RIIβ is also seen strongly at the choroid plexus and in blood vessels. RIIβ strongly labels the mossy fibers of the hippocampus but not the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. Increased labeling within specific nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus was observed. On the basis of comparison with the Franklin and Paxinos mouse brain atlas, we posit that substantial levels of RIIβ are also evident at the reticular thalamic nucleus, rhomboid and reuniens thalamic nucleus. In the hypothalamus, ventromedial nuclear cells are strongly labeled as was the arculate nucleus in the mediobasal hypothalamus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differential expression of RIβ and RIIβ at the hippocampus</title><p>To investigate the differential expression pattern of RIβ and RIIβ in detail within any specific region of interest, we used the brain images to zoom in from the gross sectional levels to the sub-neuronal levels of a specific region of interest. The images provide detailed views of cellular and subcellular structures without losing the context of the brain region. The problem of relating more magnified views with the lower-scale surveys is eliminated in this method. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a detailed view of the hippocampus.

RIβ is localized to the cell bodies of these cells as well as to their dendrites, including both basal dendrites and the apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel). Interestingly, RIβ, but not RIIβ, is localized to the hippocampal interneurons, which are the inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel).

The advantage of the high-resolution large-scale mosaic images is that these comprehensive maps make it possible to analyze protein localization at gross structural level while at the same time providing subcellular details, thereby allowing the tracing of an axonal pathway and at the same time visualizing details such as axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We can trace an axonal pathway, in which RIIβ is enriched, that emerges from the hilus of the dentate gyrus to the mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). RIIβ is abundant in the axons that emerge from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pass through the hilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). RIIβ is also concentrated in the mossy fiber axon terminals in the CA3-stratum lucidum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This is consistent with in situ hybridization data that show that the granule cells of the dentate gyrus express RIIβ mRNA abundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadd and McKnight, 1989</xref>). RIβ localization is distinct in these regions as it is concentrated in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer including the dendrites. RIIβ is abundant in the axons of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare layer, which contains perforant path fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The advantage of the detailed hippocampus map is that we can zoom in into different axons within the subfields, such as the stratum lacunosum-layer or stratum radiatum, in order to identify synaptic boutons, which helps us to assign the staining specifically to axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). RIIβ is also enriched in the alveus, which is the deepest layer that contains the axons from pyramidal neurons, which pass on towards the fimbria/fornix, one of the major outputs of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The parallel path of axonal fibers, immunostained by RIIβ, in the alveus is evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The necessity for PKA activation and a subsequent phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 is well documented for many neuronal signaling pathways, including synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kandel, 2012</xref>), but the specific physiological functions of PKA regulatory subunits in these signaling complexes are only beginning to be understood. As we found RIβ in the nucleus, we sought to investigate whether downregulation of RIβ would result in impairment of CREB phosphorylation, a nuclear PKA substrate, in cultured cells. To accomplish this, we designed lentiviral shRNA vectors containing GFP to knockdown RIβ or RIIβ subunits. Thus, cells expressing shRNA plasmids can be identified by the presence of GFP. We first confirmed the knockdown efficiency by co-transfecting 293T cells with cDNA encoding either RIβ or RIIβ genes, together with a scrambled shRNA (shRNA IRR) as a negative control or shRNAs targeting either RIβ or RIIβ. Western blot analysis confirmed the knockdown efficiency for RIβ at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Western blot analysis indicated that an efficient RIIβ knockdown had been achieved using shRNA RIIβ clone #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This clone was used in the subsequent experiments to knockdown RIIβ. To further validate the knockdown efficiency of these shRNA lentiviruses in primary cultured neurons,we infected the cells with shRNAs targeting either RIβ or RIIβ and used scrambled shRNA (shRNA SCR) as a negative control. Cells were immunostained with either RIβ- or RIIβ-specific antibodies. Infected cells expressing the indicated shRNAs were identified by the presence of GFP. Cells expressing shRNA against RIβ or RIIβ display a significant reduction in the cell fluorescence intensity produced by their specific antibodies as compared to cells infected with a negative control. The results indicate a significant inhibition of RIβ or RIIβ expression in cells infected with shRNA against a corresponding gene. Representative cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>. The shRNAs against RIβ or RIIβ demonstrate 70% or 80% knockdown efficiency, respectively, in neuronal cells (p-value &lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Following knockdown validation, we sought to investigate whether downregulation of RIβ would result in the impairment of CREB phosphorylation. We infected dissociated rat hippocampal cultures with GFP-shRNA lentiviruses against RIβ, RIIβ or an irrelevant control. After recovery from infection, cells were stimulated with forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, to increase intracellular levels of cAMP and to activate PKA. The physiological consequence of RIβ and RIIβ downregulation for nuclear cAMP signaling was evaluated by analysis of CREB phosphorylation at Ser 133. Owing to the robust survival capacity of non-neuronal cells, trace gila present in initial preparations were an unavoidable component of these cultures. Non-infected cells remain as well. To specifically assay CREB phosphorylation in infected cells, the signal was quantified only in cells that were positively stained for βIII-tubulin (neuronal marker, red) and that expressed GFP (the marker for lentivirus infection). CREB phosphorylation was quantified in the specified cells as a measure of pCREB signal intensity per the area of the nucleus as delineated by DAPI. We find that in forskolin-stimulated neuronal cells, a significant reduction in the intensity of phospho-Ser133 CREB was detected in neurons infected with shRNA against RIβ compared to the control (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">B</xref>).

While the necessity of proper PKA catalytic activity and the phosphorylation of its downstream substrates are well established in a variety of neuronal functions, the rational and significance for having multiple PKA regulatory isoforms has not been appreciated. In this study, we used highly specific antibodies against RIβ and RIIβ to create high-resolution large-scale mosaic images of the brain, and these images revealed distinct patterns of localization. Although RIβ is expressed at low levels in most cells, it is enriched in the brain, and our images show that RIβ, but not RIIβ, is highly expressed in the hippocampus, consistent with tissue fractionations and with many of its predicted roles in neuronal function. In spite of its importance for neuronal function, RIβ has never been comprehensively imaged before due to the lack of specific antibodies. Furthermore, there has never been a systematic comparison of these two isoforms that are abundantly expressed in the brain. The mouse brain mosaic images presented here thus provide detailed global comparative views of whole brain sections and also help to explain the functional non-redundancy of RIβ and RIIβ. In addition, the maps allow the interrogatation of subcellular features without losing the context of the brain regions. By zooming in to different brain regions, such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, we consistently find that RIβ is enriched in dendrites and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RIIβ is more concentrated in axons. In our mosaic maps, RIβ is also localized to the nucleus within different brain regions. To verify the subcellular localization at higher resolution, we used miniSOG labeling, a technique that allows us to correlate light microscopy with electron microscopy. Consistent with our earlier report, we found RIβ at the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilouz et al., 2012</xref>), and with the miniSOG labeling, we could further localize RIβ to the inner membrane and cristae of the mitochondria. In addition, RIβ was prominently seen in the nucleus and around the nuclear envelope. To demonstrate a functional distinction between the two isoforms at the nucleus, we used primary neuronal cells and specific lenti-viruses to downregulate RIβ or RIIβ selectively and then tracked CREB phosphorylation as a reporter for a PKA nuclear substrate. Downregulation of the RIβ, but not of RIIβ, decreased CREB phosphorylation, which is consistent with the observed nuclear localization of RIβ.</p><p>Our mosaic maps provide an overview of the distribution of endogenous PKA regulatory subunits in a whole brain slice, and at the same time allow us to identify subcellular features. The distinct subcellular localization of PKA RIβ and RIIβ subunits within discrete brain regions emphasizes the importance of mapping the spatial localization of proteins in the context of the tissue, whereas cultured cells sometimes do not provide an accurate representation of spatial localization. We find that each regulatory subunit is predominant within different brain regions and has a distinct and consistent patterns of cellular and subcellular localization across multiple regions. This isoform-specific localization provides an additional layer of control for achieving specificity in PKA signaling, and identifies localized pools of PKA signaling complexes in the brain. The specific pattern of distribution of RIβ in the hippocampus is consistent with its known unique roles in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandon et al., 1995</xref>). RIβ but not RIIβ is predominant at the pyramidal neurons in the CA1–CA3 regions of the hippocampus, as well as in the dentate gyrus and hilus neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This localization is consistent with hippocampal slices from RIβ null mice, which showed a severe deficit in LTD and depotentiation at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. This defect was also evident at the lateral perforant path-dentate granule cell synapse in RIβ knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandon et al., 1995</xref>). By contrast, and also consistent with previous reports, our maps show that RIIβ is not expressed at the pyramidal neurons but is concentrated in the striatum. In correlation with the RIIβ expression pattern, targeted disruption of the RIIβ gene in mice led to a dramatic downregulation of total PKA activity in the striatum and a partial compensatory increase in RI subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandon et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear signaling events mediated by PKA are critical for numerous neuronal functions, including the activation of gene expression that is required for long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kandel, 2012</xref>). A surprising and intriguing finding in this study is that RIβ is the PKA regulatory subunit that is localized to the nucleus of many cells in different brain regions, and miniSOG labeling of RIβ confirmed the nuclear localization at a nanoscale resolution by electron microscopy. Induction of cAMP and activation of PKA leads to phosphorylation of specific transcription factors and induction of gene expression and long-term changes in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greengard, 2001</xref>). Nuclear localization of RI and RII has been reported in hepatocytes by immunogold labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuettel et al., 1985</xref>). There is evidence to suggest that nuclear RIIβ binds CREB in T cells, implicating nuclear RIIβ as a potential negative regulator of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elliott et al., 2003</xref>). Whether PKA is resident in the nucleus or translocated into the nucleus in response to cytoplasmic signals is still an open question. Clearly one now also needs to explore all of the PKA isoforms as well as specific cell types carefully.</p><p>PKA holoenzymes are recruited into well-defined macromolecular signaling complexes through a specific interaction between the dimerization and docking (D/D) domain, a conserved hydrophobic domain within PKA R-subunits, and A Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). These scaffold proteins determine the spatio-temporal activity of PKA. Over 50 members and splice variants of the AKAP family have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2013</xref>). While most AKAPs were initially identified by their ability to bind RII subunits, several AKAPs, such as D-AKAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1997b</xref>) and D-AKAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 1997a</xref>), have been shown to bind RI as well, thereby making them dual-specific. Recently, other AKAPs such as smAKAP or GPR161 were shown to be highly specific and selective for RI subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgers et al., 2012</xref>). The first RIβ-specific AKAP, which is the only neuronal binding partner for RIβ identified to date, is the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein merlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grönholm et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, we provide a comprehensive comparison between the protein localization of RIβ and RIIβ in several brain regions, and show that RIβ co-localizes with MAP2 at the cerebellum. MAP2 was the first AKAP identified to bind RII subunits and tethers PKA with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Theurkauf and Vallee, 1982</xref>). It is only in recent years that we appreciate that some AKAPs can be dual-specific. On the basis of sequence alignment as well as structural alignment, it can be deduced that MAP2 is an AKAP that satisfies the requirement of binding both RI and RII subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sarma et al., 2010</xref>). We thus suggest that preferential binding and interactions of either RI or RII with a potential dual-specific AKAP is likely to be cell specific and may be determined by the predominant R subunit that is expressed in a certain location.</p><p>Little is known about AKAPs that assemble and integrate RIβ holoenzyme signaling at cellular and subcellular regions; however, recent discoveries suggest that RIβ compartmentalization can indeed be linked to neurodegenerative disease. A point mutation in the dimerization and docking (D/D) domain of human RIβ, for example, has been associated with a new type of a familial neurodegenerative disease presenting with dementia and Parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). These patients also show an increase of RIβ in neuronal inclusions. This mutation can thus be classified as a targeting defect that can be validated in mouse models and in patient samples where we anticipate that RIβ localization will be altered. Although the pathophysiological mechanism by which this mutation leads to neurodegenerative disease remains to be investigated, this point mutation further emphasizes the importance of precisely controlled PKA isoform localization. Our mosaic maps, which can be downloaded and queried in great detail, represent the endogenous expression and localization of PKA isoforms. These images lay the foundation for studying biological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, at subcellular and molecular levels, in which PKA regulation may be dysfunctional both in mouse models and patient samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>mKO2 plasmids</title><p>The mKO2-tagged PKA regulatory (R) subunits were generated by fusing respective R subunits with mKO2 to the C terminus with PCR and were inserted between EcoRI and NotI sites in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

It would be better for the authors not to try to conflate CREB phosphorylation with L-LTP because the two are not identical. There are many additional steps and processes involved in L-LTP, depending on how it is induced. CREB phosphorylation plays a role in any process in which induction of the CRE promoter is involved. It would be better to simply list some of those processes. The general importance of CREB phosphorylation for brain regulation is not disputed.</p><p>a3) &quot;[…]These results support previous studies indicating the role of RIβ in L-LTP, and provide an insight into the cause of long-term memory deficit in R (AB) transgenic animal (Abel et al., 1997).&quot; This statement needs to be expanded into a short paragraph with an explanation of the relationship between results with R(AB) animals and the experiment of the authors. <italic>eLife</italic> is a journal read by a diverse readership. Most readers will be unfamiliar with R(AB) transgenic animals. Similarly, the discussion of these mutants in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section is inadequate.</p><p>a4) In the subsection “RIβ mutation prevents RIβ -homodimer formation and perturbs AKAP binding” and in the Methods section. The description of the experiments with the Rluc assay is full of jargon and very hard to parse. The term PPI for &quot;protein-protein interaction&quot; should be discarded. Instead, a plain English description of each interaction measured should be given, for each phase of the experiment.</p><p>a5) In the subsection “RIβ mutation prevents RIβ -homodimer formation and perturbs AKAP binding”: &quot;This complex formation could be dissociated upon forskolin treatment&quot;. This is sloppy English and can be confusing. The authors don't mean that &quot;complex formation&quot; could be dissociated. They mean that the complexes could be dissociated by forskolin treatment. This section needs thorough editing by a native English speaker.</p><p>a6) In the subsection “RIβ mutation prevents RIβ -homodimer formation and perturbs AKAP binding”, the authors need to clearly state that the same region of RIbeta that is altered by the L50R mutation is involved in interaction with every AKAP. Otherwise, the statement; &quot;[…]support the notion that AKAP binding to RIβ-L50R is affected in general&quot; is not clear.</p><p>b) The Discussion needs thorough editing.</p><p>b1) &quot;Using primary neuronal cells, we show that down-regulation of the nuclear RIβ, but not RIIβ, decreased L-LTP related signaling as reported by CREB phosphorylation.&quot; CREB phosphorylation is not considered a reporter for L-LTP.

This part of the Discussion needs reorganization, starting with a description of the association of RIbeta with &quot;dual-specificity&quot; AKAPs and with those that are specific to RIbeta (if there are any).

In this manuscript, Ilouz and colleagues seek to characterize and differentiate the expression patterns of PKA regulatory subunits RIβ and RIIβ through high resolution confocal mosaic brain mapping and electron microscopy. The idea is simple and straightforward, to identify differences in broad expression and subcellular expression through multiple imaging modalities, and then begin to probe to see if these differences in expression can result in unique downstream changes in biochemistry and/or behavior. Identifying broad and subcellular expression is something that's been overlooked for various components of the cAMP pathway for far too long, and this is a welcome and necessary study. The main findings are that RIβ is more highly expressed in the dendrites and soma (around the nucleus), and that RIIβ is mainly in the axons. They then go to show that only down regulation of RIβ changes pCREB signaling while RIIβ does not, further confirming the differences in compartmentalization between these two subunits. Interestingly, they link this difference in expression to a recently discovered familial disease that results from a mutation in the RIβ subunit which provides further evidence demonstrating how important this compartmentalization is.</p><p>1) The authors make the broad claim that RIβ is expressed in dendrites and the nucleus, while RIIβ is expressed in axons; however, they make this claim off looking at a small number of brain regions and cell types. In particular, it appears that most of these regions they looked at (the cerebellum and hippocampus) are regions where RIβ were very highly expressed and RIIβ was much lower. My question is what happens when you look at an area where RIIβ is more highly expressed, such as the caudate and putamen. Does higher expression of RIIβ change its subcellular compartmentalization?</p><p>2) If RIIβ is more highly expressed in axons, why is there such strong expression in the soma in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>?

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using isoform-specific antibodies against the two major regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, RIβ and RIIβ, the authors generated high-resolution large-scale immunohistochemical mosaic brain images that provide global views of the distribution of the two isoforms in several brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebellum. The isoforms concentrate in discrete brain regions and the results reveal distinct patterns of subcellular localization. RIβ is enriched in dendrites and colocalizes with MAP2, whereas RIIβ is concentrated in axons. Using correlated light and electron microscopy the authors confirm mitochondrial and nuclear localization of RIβ in cultured neurons. To show the functional significance of nuclear localization of RIβ, the authors demonstrate that down-regulation of RIβ, but not RIIβ, decreased CREB phosphorylation. The study reveals how PKA isoform specificity is defined by precise localization.</p><p>The authors have been responsive to the concerns of reviewers of previous versions of this manuscript about the immunohistochemical study by adding controls to address antibody specificity and improving the focus and clarity of the manuscript with changes in the text and the addition of several supplemental figures. This part of the manuscript is substantially improved. There are still some concerns about the functional study that can be addressed by appropriate revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The description of the knockdown experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is not yet adequate. The efficiency of the shRNAs was tested by co-transfection with &quot;PRKAR2beta&quot; or &quot;PRKAR1beta&quot; and infection with the shRNA lentiviruses. However, very little detail is given for how this experiment was carried out either in the Results section or in the methods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> appears to show that only one of 3 shRNAs were effective against R2beta when tested by cotransfection in a cultured cell line. One has to assume that only shRNA#2 was used in the experiments in neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; however, this is not explicitly stated.</p><p>2) More troubling is that the authors have not reported any test to check whether the appropriate R subunits are, in fact, knocked down in the neurons after infection with the shRNAs. The authors should be able to carry out infections and then stain the infected cultures for RIβ or RIIβ and compare the intensity of staining between non-infected and infected neurons. Without information about the actual extent of knockdown of each subunit in the infected neurons, it is not possible to know how significant the difference is between p-CREB after infection with RIβ vs. RIIβ shRNAs. It is important to know how effective the knockdown of each subunit was in the neurons, in order to interpret the changes in p-CREB appropriately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17681.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers felt that the manuscript contains data that is potentially significant and important, but the joining of two separate studies, one a survey of localizations of RIbeta and RIIbeta throughout the brain, and the second a set of biochemical studies indicating the importance of subcellular location of the two subunits, ultimately does not work well, as indicated below.

After re-reading the manuscript along with all your helpful comments, as well as discussing this part with one of the identified reviewers, Ted Abel, we agree that it would be best to remove the last experiment (Figure 9) that relates to the RIβ L50R mutation, found in patients with a neurodegenerative disease. This additional data seems to deflect from the message of the manuscript and provides an impression that two separate studies are presented in this manuscript. As the paper is now structured we present the regional, cellular and subcellular spatial localization of RIβ and RIIβ that is provided by the high-resolution large-scale mosaic images using isoform-specific antibodies. We then present a few specific and significant examples of localization and functional consequences that emerged from the large data set. One of the examples that we focused on was the nuclear localization of RIβ, the least studied PKA isoform, in different brain regions. We further investigated the subcellular localization of RIβ using miniSOG labeling that allowed for correlating light and electron microscopy. We find RIβ at the mitochondria, as we reported earlier, as well as at the nucleus, modifying the existing dogma regarding PKA isoforms in the nucleus. The images suggested a potential functional distinction between the two isoforms in the nucleus. To support this we showed that down-regulation of RIβ, but not RIIβ, in hippocampal cultures decreased pCREB, which we use as an example of a nuclear PKA substrate. Taken together, we present a multi-scale approach, going from the global views of whole brain sections, which allow identification of subcellular features, without losing the context of the brain regions, to the validation of the subcellular localization using electron microscopy and correlation of this localization with functional differences of PKA isoforms. Obviously, there are many other ways in which this data, that defines comprehensively the unique enrichment of RIβ vs. RIIβ across multiple brain regions, can be utilized to drive new hypotheses. We feel that by ending the manuscript here as well as addressing the reviewers’ comments on the functional data (as provided by point-by-point response below) the focus and clarity of the manuscript has significantly improved.</p><p><italic>The manuscript by Ilouz et al. first introduces detailed maps of the regional, cellular, and subcellular locations of the RIbeta and RIIbeta regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

We performed a comprehensive analysis with all of these controls to determine specificity and selectivity of the primary and secondary antibodies used in this study. Only after we were convinced that the antibodies are specific and selective did we carry out the large-scale high-resolution immunohistochemical imaging. We agree that the original manuscript lacks the negative controls for antibody validation but they were all done routinely for every experiment. We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns, and the requested controls are now included or specifically mentioned in our revised manuscript. These controls for antibody specificity and selectivity are now discussed comprehensively and up front at the beginning of the manuscript (Results section:” Overview of the regional distribution of RIβ and RIIβ across brain regions”) and the control images are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Negative controls for the tissue staining were also added in a new figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns regarding antibody specificity:</p><p>1) Controls for secondary antibodies alone were done for each secondary antibody used in this study. The secondary antibodies were specific and detected nothing as proven by the black images. This negative control was done on tissue sections as well as on cultured cells.</p><p>The primary antibodies used in this study are commercially available and western blot analyses are shown in the datasheet of the companies. We observed a single band at the known molecular weight of the PKA regulatory subunit when the proteins are denatured. Our goal was to use these antibodies for IHC, where the antigens are at their native conformation, and therefore we performed additional experiments using dot blots of purified proteins to validate specificity and selectivity of the primary antibodies for proteins in their native conformation. We overexpressed RIβ-MKO2 or RIα-MKO2 and showed that the RIβ antibody detects only the RIβ overexpressed protein. The RIβ antibody staining was also overlapping with the MKO2 signal. To further validate that the RIβ antibody does not cross-react with its highly homologous regulatory subunit, RIα, we overexpressed RIα-MKO2 and showed that it is detected by the RIα antibody but not by the RIβ antibody even when the laser power was significantly increased (This experiment is shown is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Control of secondary antibody only was done along with the experiment using similar laser power and higher. The secondary antibody did not detect anything and the images were black. The same experiment was done to validate the RIIβ antibody specificity.</p><p>An additional negative control that was not mentioned in the original manuscript, was an experiment where we incubated the RIβ antibody with purified full length human RIβ protein, that we purify routinely in our lab, to block the antibody. The pre-adsorption antibody resulted in loss of the staining on the tissue. The images were black. This experiment demonstrates that the antibody is specific for the immunogen. The same control was done for RIIβ antibody. This control is also now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We did not previously include checks for cross reactivity between RI and RII antibody because only α and β forms of either RI or RII are highly homologous. This control is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, where the dot blot shows that there is not cross reactivity between RI and RII subunits.</p><p>We find that the primary and secondary antibodies used in our study are reproducible as we tested different lot numbers. Reproducibility is an important criterion for validation and standardization. This note is important as we expect that this paper will be a good reference for these specific antibodies and is included now in the manuscript.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> is added now to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. As the reviewer commented adding this supplement figure to the main figure makes the differential localization more obvious.</p><p> <italic>d) A complete survey of the distribution of RIβ and RI β in mouse brain should present staining patterns for both proteins in coronal and sagittal tissue sections to reveal brain areas not contained in the coronal sections of forebrain.</italic> </p><p>It was not our intention to provide an atlas for the protein distribution of these PKA isoforms. To clarify this we also changed the title and replaced mapping with imaging. For these initial studies we focused primarily on brain regions where we anticipated that these PKA isoforms would be highly concentrated and that also correlate with the isoform specific functions that were defined by the RIβ or RIIβ knockout studies. Our major focus, therefore, was to provide cellular and subcellular analyses of protein distribution in the hippocampus and the cerebellum without losing the tissue context. We have clarified the reason we selected these brain regions in the Results section. These imaging maps are rich in information and we focused on only a few and specific examples to correlate the data with electron microscopy and functional studies. These comprehensive maps, uploaded online, can drive new hypotheses on many of the cellular and subcellular regions that are included in these maps but were not discussed in the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>e) One reviewer felt that it is difficult to follow the text describing the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The authors' conclusions would be strengthened if they used neuronal markers for dendrites and axons. Simple counterstaining with these markers would be an important addition to the study.</italic> </p><p>We agree that immunohistochemical high magnification images usually require co-staining with specific markers to validate dendrite or axon co-localization. The advantage of the high–resolution large-scale mosaic images is that these comprehensive maps allow us to analyze protein localization at a gross structural level and at the same time provide subcellular details, thereby allowing studying protein localization at different scales simultaneously. The images as simply shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were taken from the full maps and, therefore, lack the complete picture. We deduced that RIIβ is in axons by combining insights from the low and high-resolution scales. When we trace a whole axonal pathway, we can also clearly see boutons, which are part of the axonal structure. In addition, this staining does not co-localize with the dendritic staining (for example: CA3 region). We have emphasized this now in the revised manuscript (Results section: RIIβ is concentrated in axons whereas RIβ is concentrated in dendrites and somata in various subfields of the hippocampus”.</p><p><italic>f) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> argue that R β is expressed at higher levels than RIIβ in regions of the cerebellum. However, the immunofluorescence data presented in the study are not adequate by themselves to justify this conclusion. The impression of higher levels could be an artifact if the affinity of the RIβ antibodies is much higher than those for RIIβ. Independent verification of protein levels in these tissues should be added to the study.</italic> </p><p>The conclusion that RIβ is the predominant regulatory subunit at the cerebellum was not made based on the immunofluorescence data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> but on a western blot analysis showing the expression levels of all PKA regulatory subunits in the cerebellum (Weisenhaus, 2010). In addition, we also mentioned that in situ hybridization data showed much less hybridization of RIIβ compared to RIβ at the cerebellum (Cadd and McKnight, 1989). Our results are quite consistent with McKnight’s earlier analysis of protein expression in these regions. We revised the text discussing the cerebellum staining to prevent an impression that we concluded that RIβ is the predominant isoform at the cerebellum based on the immunostaining.</p><p><italic>g) Because of the light staining in higher resolution images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it would be especially important to include control images of staining with secondary alone.</italic> </p><p>We have now included these controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. The nuclear localization of RIβ was also validated by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>h) The authors make the broad claim that RIβ is expressed in dendrites and the nucleus, while RIIβ is expressed in axons; however, they make this claim based upon a small number of brain regions and cell types. In particular, it appears that most of the regions they looked at (the cerebellum and hippocampus) are regions where RIβ was very highly expressed and RIIβ was much lower. This raises the question of what happens when you look at an area where RIIβ is more highly expressed, such as the caudate and putamen. Does higher expression of RIIβ change its subcellular compartmentalization?</italic> </p><p>This is a very important point. Because we did not do whole brain mapping we cannot answer this question comprehensively but these are clearly major questions that need to be explored in future studies. However, if we zoom in on the striatum where RIIβ is enriched we still see that it is excluded from nuclei whereas RIβ is still present in most nuclei. Nuclear localization thus does not appear to be influenced by the level of expression. We do not claim that RIβ, as opposed to RIIβ, is always enriched in dendrites of every neuron, but this pattern was consistently seen in all of the neurons that we examined here.</p><p><italic>i) If RIIβ is more highly expressed in axons, why is there such strong expression in the soma in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>? This seems to contradict the results.</italic> </p><p>A significant body of evidence now exists to suggest RNA translation occurs within axons. This is in contrast to the classical thought that the cell body is the exclusive source of axonal proteins. In any case, we believe that the localization of RIIβ in axons as well as the cell body is not contradictory; as it can be in both. We performed an additional experiment with different organelle markers and found that the strong labeling of RIIβ in the cell body comes from the Golgi apparatus.</p><p><italic>j) The miniSOG experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are preliminary. Additional data showing the signals with secondary antibodies alone should be included. The results need to be quantified. How many nuclei/mitochondria were examined, and how many of those were positive for RIbeta?</italic> </p><p>There seems to be a misunderstanding about the miniSOG methodology, which we hope to clarify through our responses below and by revising the text in the manuscript. Contrary to what the reviewer suggested, no primary or secondary antibodies are involved in this method. The miniSOG (for mini Singlet oxygen generator) is a genetically encoded tag, designed and validated by Tsien and Ellisman, that allows us doing correlated light and electron microscopy. This is an essential feature of this innovative probe and provides a way for achieving higher resolution (Shu, X, pLOS biology, 2011). RIβ cDNA was fused to a construct containing the miniSOG tag. Many transfected neuronal cells and adjacent non- transfected neuronal cells were identified by fluorescent microscopy. The advantage of this probe is that the same region that was viewed by light microscopy can be analyzed with electron microscopy following photo-oxidation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> we provide EM images of 2 different transfected cells and controls for their adjacent non-transfected cells, however, 126 transfected darkened mitochondria and 71 non-transfected light mitochondria were counted. This method has been proven reliable and widely used, as the reference paper has been cited now over 100 times in PubMed.</p><p><italic>The reviewers found several problems with the second part of the manuscript:</italic> </p><p><italic>a) Beginning with the section of the Results “RIβ, but not RIIβ, controls PKA-dependent CREB phosphorylation that is required for Late-Long Term Potentiation (L-LTP)”, the writing becomes unclear and often laced with jargon.</italic> </p><p>We address some of the concerns below but most of the unclear text has now been removed as indicated above. We include the nuclear localization and the axon/dendrite localization as two observations that we believed were important to functionally confirm. We specifically address the concerns about CREB phosphorylation as a reporter for LTP. Here we agree with the reviewer and now simply use CREB phosphorylation as an example of a nuclear substrate for PKA.</p><p> <italic>a1) &quot;[…]down-regulation of RIβ is associated with memory deficit.&quot; This statement is not accompanied by citation and needs more explanation.</italic> </p><p>This statement has now been removed as we emphasize better the rational of doing the CREB phosphorylation experiment. We removed the CREB phosphorylation as a reporter for L-LTP and the association of RIβ with memory deficit as a rational for the CREB phosphorylation experiment.</p><p> <italic>a2) &quot;[…]stimulated with forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, which has been previously used as a culture model for L-LTP..&quot; Despite the two citations, this treatment is not widely accepted as a &quot;culture model&quot; for L-LTP. It would be better for the authors not to try to conflate CREB phosphorylation with L-LTP because the two are not identical. There are many additional steps and processes involved in L-LTP, depending on how it is induced. CREB phosphorylation plays a role in any process in which induction of the CRE promoter is involved. It would be better to simply list some of those processes. The general importance of CREB phosphorylation for brain regulation is not disputed.</italic> </p><p>We did not intend to conflate CREB phosphorylation with L-LTP. We agree with the reviewer that there are many additional steps and processes involved in L-LTP. We therefore re-wrote this section in the Results and specifically removed all reference to LTP. Instead we simply state that we wanted to investigate whether down-regulation of RIβ would result in impairment of CREB phosphorylation, a downstream PKA substrate at the nucleus.</p><p> <italic>a3) &quot;[…]These results support previous studies indicating the role of RIβ in L-LTP, and provide an insight into the cause of long-term memory deficit in R (AB) transgenic animal (Abel et al., 1997).&quot; This statement needs to be expanded into a short paragraph with an explanation of the relationship between results with R(AB) animals and the experiment of the authors. eLife is a journal read by a diverse readership. Most readers will be unfamiliar with R(AB) transgenic animals.

It is involved in many other processes. Thus, this statement is seriously misleading.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that CREB phosphorylation is involved in many other processes.

This part of the Discussion needs reorganization, starting with a description of the association of RIbeta with &quot;dual-specificity&quot; AKAPs and with those that are specific to RIbeta (if there are any). Are Type I AKAPs specific for association with RI?</italic></p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have clarified the discussion about the role of AKAPs and re-wrote the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.

It would be informative to know what happens to phosphorylation of Ser 142 on CREB. This is a Cam K II site and should serve as a good negative control</italic> </p><p>This experiment has been carefully controlled and quantified. We have now emphasized it in the manuscript. We could do a western blot, however, it would not be as accurate as quantifying the intensity of CREB phosphorylation in infected neurons. Due to the robust survival capacity of non-neuronal cells, trace gila present in initial preparations were an unavoidable component of these cultures. Non-infected cells remain as well. To specifically assay CREB phosphorylation in infected cells, the signal was quantified only in cells positively stained for βIII-tubulin (neuronal marker, red) that expressed GFP (marker for lentivirus infection). CREB phosphorylation was quantified in the specified cells as a measure of pCREB signal intensity per the area of the nucleus as delineated by DAPI. We have internal controls in each experiment comparing CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 of infected neurons to non-infected neurons. We show statistically significant data of infected neurons with shRNA against RIβ compared to the scrabbled shRNA (p&lt;0.0001). We show statistically significant data of neurons infected with shRNA against RIβ compared to RIIβ (p&lt;0.001). 50 neurons were counted in each experiment. Since we have internal controls as well as two negative controls (scrabbled and RIIβ) and the data is statistically significant we are confident that the data is properly controlled.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The description of the knockdown experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is not yet adequate. The efficiency of the shRNAs was tested by co-transfection with &quot;PRKAR2beta&quot; or &quot;PRKAR1beta&quot; and infection with the shRNA lentiviruses. However, very little detail is given for how this experiment was carried out either in the Results section or in the methods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> appears to show that only one of 3 shRNAs were effective against R2beta when tested by cotransfection in a cultured cell line. One has to assume that only shRNA#2 was used in the experiments in neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; however, this is not explicitly stated.</italic> </p><p>We revised the sections describing this experiment to provide detailed information about the experiment and a more adequate description of results.</p><p>1) We edited the Materials and methods paragraph. This now includes:</p><p>“293T cells were co-transfected with either PRKARIβ or PRKARIIβ rat cDNA (Origene) and with scrambled shRNA (Σ) or shRNAs targeting PRKARIβ (5’- CGGCAGAAGTCAAACTCACAGTGTGATTC-3’, purchased from Origene) or PRKARIIβ (#1-5’-CGTCATCGACAGAGGAACATT-3’; #2-5’-CGATGCAGAGTCCAGGATAAT-3’ and # 3-5’-CCTTCAGGAGAATAATAGTAA-3’). […] Lentiviral particles were then prepared as previously described (Ikawa et al., 2003).”</p><p>2) We edited the Results section that describes this experiment:</p><p>“We first confirmed the knockdown efficiency by co-transfecting 293T cells with cDNA encoding either RIβ or RIIβ genes, together with a scrambled shRNA (shRNA IRR) as a negative control or shRNAs targeting either RIβ or RIIβ. Western blot analysis confirmed knockdown efficiency of RIβ at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Western blot analysis indicated that an efficient RIIβ knockdown had been achieved using shRNA RIIβ clone #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This clone was used in the subsequent experiments to knockdown RIIβ.”</p><p>3) We also edited the figure legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> describing this experiment.</p><p>We have also moved this experiment to a new figure. It is now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1, a</xref> figure that provides a comprehensive knockdown efficiency validation as described in our response to comment #2 by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>2) More troubling is that the authors have not reported any test to check whether the appropriate R subunits are, in fact, knocked down in the neurons after infection with the shRNAs. The authors should be able to carry out infections and then stain the infected cultures for RIβ or RIIβ and compare the intensity of staining between non-infected and infected neurons. Without information about the actual extent of knockdown of each subunit in the infected neurons, it is not possible to know how significant the difference is between p-CREB after infection with RIβ vs. RIIβ shRNAs. It is important to know how effective the knockdown of each subunit was in the neurons, in order to interpret the changes in p-CREB appropriately.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers and with the suggested experiment and have included a new supplementary figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. The figure provides a comprehensive validation for shRNA knockdown efficiency and includes:</p><p>A. and B. We first confirmed knockdown efficiency by co-transfecting 293T cells with cDNA encoding either RIβ (A) or RIIβ (B) genes, together with a scrambled shRNA as a negative control or shRNAs targeting either RIβ or RIIβ. Western blot analysis confirmed knockdown efficiency of shRNAs against RIβ and RIIβ at the protein level. The two western blots were part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the original manuscript. We decided to include this information as part of a comprehensive figure showing shRNA knockdown efficiency.</p><p>C. The reviewer’s suggested experiment is now included. To validate the knockdown efficiency of shRNA against RIβ or RIIβ in primary cultured neurons we infected cells with shRNAs targeting either RIβ or RIIβ and used scrambled shRNA as a negative control. Cells were immunostained with either RIβ or RIIβ specific antibodies. Infected cells expressing shRNAs were identified by the presence of GFP. Cells expressing shRNA against RIβ or RIIβ display a significant reduction in the cell fluorescence intensity produced by their specific antibodies as compared to cells infected with a negative control. The results indicate a significant inhibition of RIβ or RIIβ expression in cells infected with shRNA against a corresponding gene. Representative cells are shown.</p><p>D. Quantification analyses to validate knockdown efficiency are also now provided. Knockdown efficiency was determined by measuring cell fluorescence intensity of the signal from RIβ or RIIβ specific antibodies. The immunofluorescence signal was reduced by shRNA against RIβ or RIIβ as compared to cells infected with a negative control. GFP fluorescence intensity was used to normalize the quantification analyses. Corrected total cell fluorescence was measured for each condition using imageJ. The shRNAs against RIβ or RIIβ demonstrate 70% or 80% knockdown efficiency, respectively in neuronal cells. P-value &lt;0.0001, Student’s t-test.</p><p>We have revised the section in the Results (subsection “RIβ, but not RIIβ, contributes PKA-dependent CREB phosphorylation”) and in the Materials and methods (subsection “Image deposition into the cell centered database”) and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> legend to provide a detailed description about this figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
