equally efficient manner. It is unclear how, on a molecular level, such simplification can arise. With ancestral reconstruction and biochemical analysis, we have traced the evolution of bacterial small heat shock proteins (sHsp), which help to refold proteins from aggregates using either two proteins with different functions (IbpA and IbpB) or a secondarily single sHsp that performs both functions in an equally efficient way. Secondarily single sHsp evolved from IbpA, an ancestor specialized in strong substrate binding. Evolution of an intermolecular binding site drove the alteration of substrate binding properties, as well as the formation of higher-order oligomers. Upon two mutations in the α-crystallin domain, secondarily single sHsp interacts with aggregated substrates less tightly. Paradoxically, less efficient binding positively influences the ability of sHsp to stimulate substrate refolding, since the dissociation of sHps from aggregates is required to initiate Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding. After the loss of a partner, IbpA took over its role in facilitating the sHsp dissociation from an aggregate by weakening the interaction with the substrate, which became beneficial for the refolding process. We show that the same two amino acids introduced in modern-day systems define whether the IbpA acts as a single sHsp or obligatorily cooperates with an IbpB partner. Our discoveries illuminate how one sequence has evolved to encode functions previously performed by two distinct proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chaperones</kwd><kwd>erwiniaceae</kwd><kwd>ancestral reconstruction</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPUS 17 2019/33/B/NZ1/00352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karaś</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name><name><surname>Kochanowicz</surname><given-names>Klaudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitek</surname><given-names>Marcin</given-names></name><name><surname>Obuchowski</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name><name><surname>Liberek</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPUS 21 2021/41/B/NZ8/02835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Domanski</surname><given-names>Przemyslaw</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomiczek</surname><given-names>Barlomiej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011089</institution-id><institution>Infrastruktura PL-Grid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLG/2023/016546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomiczek</surname><given-names>Barlomiej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phylogenetic and biochemical analysis reveals crucial role of two substitutions in the α–crystallin domain for development of new functionality of IbpA chaperone after the loss of paralogous IbpB in <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene birth and loss is a hallmark of protein family evolution, however, molecular determinants and genetic mechanisms enabling that process are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández and Gabaldón, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Worth et al., 2009</xref>).

Examples of gene loss often involve adaptive changes in response to changing environmental niches, like loss of genes encoding olfactory receptors in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demuth and Hahn, 2009</xref>) or differential retention of paralogous genes encoding venom toxins in different rattlesnake lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowell et al., 2016</xref>). In prokaryote genomes, gene loss is one of the main evolutionary processes accelerating sequence divergence leading to functional innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puigbò et al., 2014</xref>). In complex protein systems, execution of a cellular function can be shared between several proteins. In bacteria, the cost of maintaining additional gene copy is very high and maintaining a low gene count is important for keeping the replication energy costs low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kempes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lever et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lynch and Marinov, 2015</xref>). Still, it remains unclear how a multi-protein system can undergo simplification. Here, we asked what are the molecular events that enabled the gene loss, and how one of the biochemical functions has been taken over by the other protein. We investigated these questions using sHsp system, which underwent simplification within <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (which include common bacteria species like <italic>Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>) as a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>small heat shock protein (sHsp) systems in <italic>Enterobacteriacrae</italic> and <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic>.</title><p>Left - schematic phylogeny of sHsps in <italic>Enterobacterales</italic>.

They bind misfolded proteins and sequester them into refolding – prone assemblies, preventing uncontrolled aggregation and helping to maintain proteostasis at stress conditions. sHsp is composed of a highly conserved α–crystallin domain (ACD), in a form of so-called β–sandwich, flanked by less conserved, unstructured N- and C-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haslbeck and Vierling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haslbeck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reinle et al., 2022</xref>). Their smallest functional unit is usually a dimer, formed by the interaction between ACDs of two neighboring sHsps. Stable sHsp dimers in turn tend to form variable and dynamic higher-order oligomers, stabilized by N- and C-terminal region interactions. Particularly the interaction between the IXI motif, highly conserved in sHsps C-termini, and the cleft formed by β4 and β8 strands of ACD is critical for oligomer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haslbeck and Vierling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennaway et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simmons and Ochoterena, 2000</xref>). Oligomers of bacterial sHsps reversibly dissociate into smaller forms when the temperature increases. It is considered their activation mechanism, probably uncovering substrate interaction sites. The mechanism of sHsps’ interaction with misfolded substrates is not yet fully understood, but both N-termini and β4–β8 cleft region have been found to play a role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reinle et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In most <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> a two-protein sHsps system exists, consisting of IbpA and IbpB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mogk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obuchowski et al., 2019</xref>). IbpA and IbpB have originated via duplication, form a heterodimer partnership, and are functionally divergent from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obuchowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piróg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). IbpA is specialized in tight substrate binding (sequestrase activity), while IbpB is required for the dissociation of both sHps from the aggregates, a step necessary to initiate Hsp70-Hsp100 dependent substrate disaggregation and refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Obuchowski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ratajczak et al., 2009</xref>).

How did IbpA evolve to become independent of its partner? In this study, using ancestral reconstruction, we identify mutations, which allowed the secondarily single IbpA to be fully functional without its partner in substrate sequestration and handover to Hsp70-Hsp100-mediated disaggregation and refolding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>New activity of <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic> IbpA has evolved in parallel to IbpB gene loss</title><p>To better understand the evolution of sHsps after gene loss, we reconstructed the IbpA ancestors from before and after the loss of its IbpB partner.

It is initiated by binding of the Hsp70 system (DnaK and cochaperones DnaJ and GrpE) to aggregates that require sHsps to be outcompeted from aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Żwirowski et al., 2017</xref>). To gain insight into the competition between sHsps and Hsp70 we modified the biolayer interferometry experiments and introduced the sensor with sHsps bound to luciferase aggregates into a buffer containing Hsp70 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Although biolayer interferometry cannot distinguish between proteins bound to the sensor, we took advantage of the differences in the thickness of the protein layers specific for sHsp or Hsp70 binding and also in the binding kinetics. The analysis of the Hsp70 binding to the aggregates covered with sHsps clearly shows that the presence of IbpA<italic><sub>E.amyl</sub></italic> or IbpA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> Q66H G109D on aggregates only weakly inhibits Hsp70 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and H</xref>).

Glutamine 66 and glycine 109 are characteristic of IbpA proteins which bind tightly to substrates and thus are not easily outcompeted from the aggregates by Hsp70s. Such IbpAs require IbpB partner cooperation to function properly. Substitutions at these positions to histidine (position 66) and aspartic acid (position 109) allowed for the emergence of a single sHsp which binds to aggregating substrate less tightly and can be outcompeted from the aggregates by Hsp70s in the absence of IbpB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we traced, at the molecular level, how the two-protein sHsp system, a part of the cellular protein refolding machinery, underwent simplification in a way that its biochemical functions are performed by a single protein. In most <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> two sHsps (IbpA and IbpB) drive the sequestration of misfolded proteins into the reactivation-prone assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obuchowski et al., 2019</xref>). Together, IbpA and IbpB form a functional heterodimer, in which IbpA specializes in substrate binding, preventing the substrates from creating large aggregates (sequestrase activity), while IbpB promotes sHsps dissociation from the aggregates required for subsequent Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obuchowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piróg et al., 2021</xref>). We showed that, in parallel to the <italic>ibpB</italic> gene loss in <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic>, new functions of IbpA have emerged, i.e., a lower substrate sequestrase activity, which correlates with the efficient substrate refolding. We have identified two amino acid substitutions (Q66H and G109D) responsible for this new IbpA functionality. Selection analysis shows that these two substitutions were likely driven by positive selective pressure. This indicates that this change possibly had an adaptive character in the ancestral background. It is important to note, however, that models used for the analysis do not account for the variation of synonymous substitution rate and multinucleotide substitution events, which in some cases might lead to false positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lucaci et al., 2023</xref>). Because of that, the alternative hypothesis that substitutions Q66H and G109D occurred in the common ancestor of <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic> due to genetic drift, enabling the subsequent loss of IbpB gene, cannot be fully discounted. Functional differences observed between modern-day sHsps from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. amylovora</italic> are at least partially defined by the presence of specific amino acids in these two positions and can be diminished by their swapping between extant proteins. Their occurrence in the last common ancestor of <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic> IbpA resulted in a decreased affinity of ACD’s β4-β8 cleft to aggregated substrates as well as to the C-termini of the other sHsps. These interactions might be of particular importance for the stabilization of sHsps on a surface of sequestered aggregated substrates leading to the formation of so-called protective shell preventing further uncontrolled aggregation. Apparent role of C-termini and ACD interaction is in agreement with earlier studies, showing that the addition of free C-terminal peptide causes <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA and IbpB dissociation from the outer shell of sHsp - substrate complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Żwirowski et al., 2017</xref>). It was also shown that, in case of Hsp 16.6 from cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, substitutions that slightly weakened the interaction between ACD and C-termini lead to increased stimulation of luciferase refolding. However, abolishing this interaction resulted in a non-functional protein, most likely due to the loss of the sequestrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giese and Vierling, 2002</xref>). Destabilization of the protective shell of secondarily single IbpA by weakening these interactions had an effect functionally analogous to a role of IbpB in the two-protein system, facilitating IbpA dissociation from the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obuchowski et al., 2019</xref>). Two identified substitutions also weaken the ACD interaction with aggregated substrates which is an additional factor shifting the sHsps balance towards dissociation, a step necessary to initiate Hsp70-Hsp100 dependent disaggregation and refolding.</p><p>Our results show how ACD substitutions can fine-tune sHsp system by exerting pleiotropic effects on ACD-C-terminal peptide and ACD-substrate interactions. These relatively small changes strongly influence the effectiveness of sHsp functioning in complex process of aggregated protein rescue by molecular chaperones. It might be particularly important in the case of a conserved interaction, like the one between C-terminal peptide and ACD, when excessive changes of affinity may be detrimental to the overall protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giese and Vierling, 2002</xref>). Our approach enabled us to find functional residues in sHsp system, which would not have been possible by using conventional mutagenesis and highlights the importance of using the vertical approach in biochemical studies. This study closely follows the evolutionary process, in which mutations in one of the two cooperating proteins tinker it to a point where it becomes independent of its partner, enabling the simplification of a more complex system by partner loss while maintaining its overall function.</p><p>Following, with molecular precision, the genetic events associated with the gene loss allowed us to answer several questions about protein family evolution. The first question concerns how the lost function is incorporated into a remaining partner protein. The results of our experiments indicate that even though the primary function of a partner protein is maintained, it is altered so that it does not interfere with the newly incorporated one. In our case substrate binding properties, as well as the formation of higher-order oligomers were altered in a way to keep the sequestrase function maintained but allow for more efficient stimulation of Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding. The second question concerns the context-dependence of mutations in protein evolution. We successfully transplanted the mutations that appeared in <italic>E. amylovora</italic> into <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA ortholog, artificially creating an efficient single protein system from a protein that normally needs a partner for efficient substrate refolding. In contrast to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mogk et al., 2003</xref>) the context of <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA protein did not influence the ability of IbpA<sub>E.coli</sub> Q66H G109D to work without IbpB partner. This brings the question about the accessibility of adaptive solutions. In case of <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA, there was no need for adaptive changes because the gene loss did not occur in this clade, suggesting that the loss of a protein can push another one towards an adaptation, which leads to finding efficient molecular innovations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clustal Omega</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clustal Omega</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001591">SCR_001591</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">European Bioinformatics Institute</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iq-tree</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IQ-TREE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FastML</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FastML</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_016092">SCR_016092</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tel Aviv University</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">codeml</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">codeml</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014932">SCR_014932</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Part of PAML software package</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gromacs 2019.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GROMACS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014565">SCR_014565</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AlphaFold-Multimer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AlphaFold-Multimer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">ColabFold implementation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PyMol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PyMol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pET3a – <italic>AncA<sub>0</sub></italic> (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">pET3a plasmid carrying <italic>AncA<sub>0</sub></italic> gene was ordered from Genscript on the basis of reconstructed amino acid sequence.

I think it would be more clear for the reader to consistently refer to it as Erwiniaceae IbpA vs Escherichia IbpA, or something similar.</p></disp-quote><p>In the introduction we clarified (page 4 lines 11-13) that the term “secondarily single” IbpA refers to IbpA that lacks partner protein as a result of ibpB gene loss. This is in opposition to “single-protein” IbpA from a clade in which gene duplication leading to creation of two – protein sHsp system did not occur (like Vibrionaceae or Aeromonadaceae) - see Obuchowski et al., 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 1B. The labels are not defined. What is L? A and B refer to IbpA and IbpB but this should be made more clear to the reader. Why is this panel only referred to in the Introduction and not the Results? Why is there a second panel for E.amy, rather than including it in the same panel, as for other experiments? What are the error bars? (That goes for every error bar in the paper, none are defined).</p></disp-quote><p>Labels in Fig.1B were corrected; “L” was used in reference to “luciferase alone” and it has been corrected for consistency to “no sHsp”. The sHsps activity measurements (obtained in the same experiment) were split into two separate panels as a correspondence to the two branches of the simplified tree in Fig. 1. The figure was modified to make it clearer and avoid confusion. Definitions of error bars were added to this and other figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-&quot;AncA0 exhibited sequestrase activity on the level comparable to IbpA from Escherichia coli(IbpA <italic>E. coli</italic>). AncA1 was moderately efficient in this process and IbpA from Erwinia amylovora(IbpAE.amyl) was the least efficient sequestrase (Fig. 1D).&quot; - First, this should be referring to Fig. 1C. Second, the text doesn't quite match the panel. A0 appears to have the strongest sequestrase activity over most concentrations. Can the authors comment on in what concentration range these differences are most meaningful?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure legend was corrected. Descriptions of panels C and D were fixed. Now these data are presented in panels A and B of a new Fig. 3. In our opinion differences in sequestration are most meaningful at lower sHsp concentrations (in this case lower than 5 µM), as with high enough sHsp concentration even less effective sequestrases seem to be able to effectively sequester aggregated proteins. Comment about it was added to the main text (page 5, line 6)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-&quot;Ancestral proteins' interaction with the aggregated substrates was stronger than in the case of extant E. amylovora IbpA, but weaker than in the case of extant <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA (Fig. 1C).&quot; - Is this referring to Fig.1C, or to the unlabelled panel on the bottom right panel of Fig 1 (that is not referred to in the legend)? Can the authors comment on why they think the 2 ancestral proteins are much more similar to each other than they are to either of the native IbpAs?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to our mistake descriptions of panels C and D were switched.</p><p>Figure 1 was rearranged and split into Figures 1 and 3. Former figure S1 (full phylogeny) was inserted into the main text, as Fig. 2, per request of reviewer #1. Former panel 1D (now 3B) was rearranged, as graph was not apparent to be a part of that panel and looked as if it was unlabeled.</p><p>The fact that the two ancestral proteins are more similar to each other than to the extant <italic>E. coli</italic> and E. amylovora proteins in their interaction with model substrate might be caused by higher sequence identity between the two ancestral proteins than between ancestral and extant proteins (10 amino acid differences between AncA0 and AncA1 compared to 20 differences between AncA1 and IbpA from E. amylovora or 11 differences between AncA0 and IbpA from E. coli). One also has to remember that this property is only one aspect of sHsp activity – proteins AncA0 and AncA1 are much less similar to each other if other activities such as sequestrase activity are considered. Substrate affinity and sequestrase activity are connected to each other, but there isn’t a strict correlation, as can be seen in the case of free ACD domains, which strongly bind aggregated substrate while effectively lacking sequestrase activity (fig. 5 A, fig. 5 – figure supplement 4 A,B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 1E should have E. coli IbpA and IbpB, by themselves, included for comparison. Strangely, it seems, by comparison to Fig 1B, that the &quot;inhibitory&quot; activity of A0 is not present in the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein, and the authors should comment on this. Similarly, A1 disaggregation looks like it might not be significantly different than the E. coli protein. Can the authors comment on why disaggregation might be so low in A1 compared to E.amy?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA alone was added to Fig. 1E (Fig. 3C in the new version) as suggested.</p><p>AncA1 indeed exhibits similar activity to extant IbpA from <italic>E. coli</italic>, which, at the conditions of the experiment, does not possess inhibitory effect observed for AncA0. This suggests that:</p><p>-There was an additional increase in ability to stimulate luciferase disaggregation between AncA1 and extant IbpA from E. amylovora</p><p>-There was also an increase of ability to stimulate luciferase refolding between AncA0 and extant <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA, albeit to a significantly lesser degree than in the Erwiniaceae branch.</p><p>It is quite likely that after separation of Erwiniaceae and Enterobacteriaceae sHsp systems, they underwent further optimization through evolution. This might have led to observed higher effectiveness of modern IbpAs from both clades in refolding stimulation in comparison to the reconstructed ancestral proteins.</p><p>Despite the above, effects of substitutions on positions 66 and 109 on activities of the extant <italic>E. coli</italic> and E. amylovora proteins suggests that the two identified positions still play key role in differentiating extant IbpAs from Erwiniaceae and Enterobacteriaceae.</p><p>Nevertheless, additional mutations that lead to increased ability to stimulate luciferase reactivation must have occurred in both Erwiniaceae and Enterobacteriaceae branches of the phylogeny during evolution. These substitutions would be a worthwhile subject of further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Fig 1D - lizate should be lysate.</p></disp-quote><p>The typo was corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-What is the bottom right panel in Fig 1?

Full sequences of ML and alternative ancestors with posterior probabilities for each reconstructed position are presented in supplementary file 3</p><p>The testing of the robustness to statistical uncertainty was intended to test to what extent properties of reconstructed ancestral proteins could be influenced by uncertainty present in a given reconstruction due to probabilistic nature of the process. Relatively high similarity between ML and AltAll sequences would indicate low uncertainty of the reconstruction (most likely due to high conservation during evolution). In such a case similar properties of AltAll and ML proteins would simply indicate that they are robust to the level of uncertainty present in a given reconstruction (which may be low). It would not tell us much about “general” robustness to mutations, but it was not relevant to research questions considered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-If the functional gain by IbpA comes down to only two amino acid substitutions, I'm not convinced this would be meaningfully reflected in any tests of positive selection.</p></disp-quote><p>After considering Reviewer #1’s comments about limitations of models used for selection analysis we added acknowledgment in the discussion (page 9, line 9 - 13) that results indicating positive selection in our dataset should not be considered conclusive (see answer to Reviewer #1’s public review below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The full MSA should be provided as supplemental material.</p></disp-quote><p>The full MSA in fasta format is presented in the supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-For the aggregate binding panels in Figs 3 and 4, it would be helpful to show the native and ancestral proteins for comparison. I know this is a bit redundant, as they're present in Fig 1, but I find it hard to judge the scale of change. This is especially important because A0 and A1 are very similar in Fig 1, so I want to see what kind of difference the 2 mutations make.</p></disp-quote><p>Data presented in Fig. 3C (Fig. 5C in the new version) refer to the binding of α-crystallin domains (A0ACD and A0ACD Q66H G109D) and not full length sHsps to <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins aggregated on a BLI sensor. Our intention was to show the influence of the two crucial substitutions (Q66H G109D) on the properties of A0 ancestral α-crystallin domain.</p><p>Figure 4 (Fig. 6 in the new version) represent the effects of the substitutions on the identified positions 66 and 109 on the properties of extant IbpA orthologs from <italic>E. coli</italic> and E. amylovora, showing that these two positions play a key role in differentiating properties of those extant proteins. Changes in binding to aggregated substrate caused by those substitutions, as shown in Figure 6 B,C (new version), are indeed larger than observed between AncA0 and AncA1, as shown in Fig. 3B (new version).</p><p>One has to remember, however, that the experiment shown in Fig.3 (new version) shows the effects of all 10 amino acid changes between the nodes A0 and A1 and not only the two analyzed substitutions, as was the case in experiment shown in Fig. 6 B,C (new version). Moreover, due to relatively large number of differences between ancestral and extant sequences (11 differences between AncA0 and <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA, 20 differences between AncA1 and E. amylovora IbpA), substitutions in the two experiments are introduced into different sequence context.</p><p>Because of the above, we believe that direct comparison of the results obtained for ancestral proteins with the results obtained for substitutions introduced into extant proteins would not meaningfully contribute to answering the question of the role of analyzed substitution in the context of extant proteins, while decreasing clarity of presented information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Some of the luciferase plots show a time course, but others just show a single %.

In the Introduction, it would be beneficial to explore additional instances where this evolutionary simplification process has been observed in nature. Investigating the prevalence of this phenomenon and identifying other multi-protein systems that have undergone simplification could enhance the understanding of its significance and implications.</p></disp-quote><p>The section of the introduction concerning gene loss and differential paralog retention was expanded with additional examples of gene loss that is considered adaptive (page 3 lines 1 - 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I am intrigued by the reasons why certain organisms continue to maintain a two-protein system despite the viability of a single-protein system. This aspect is particularly relevant for bacteria, considering the fitness cost associated with maintaining extra gene copies. Do you have any hypotheses or theories that may shed light on this intriguing observation?</p></disp-quote><p>Refolding of proteins from aggregates requires the functional cooperation of sHsps and chaperones from Hsp70 system and Hsp100 disaggregase. In two protein sHsps system one sHsp (IbpA) is specialized in substrate binding, while the second one (IbpB) possesses low substrate binding potential and enhances sHps dissociation from substrates (Obuchowski et al, 2019). Thus, the presence of IbpB reduces the amount of chaperones from Hsp70 system required to outcompete sHsps from aggregated substrates to initiate refolding process. The cost associated with maintaining extra sHsp gene copy (ibpB) in bacteria might be compensated by lower requirement for Hsp70 chaperones for efficient and fast protein refolding following stress conditions.</p><p>In this study we have demonstrated how such a system could have been simplified to a single – protein system capable of efficient substrate sequestration as well as stimulation of reactivation. This indeed leads to the question why such single – protein system isn’t more prevalent in Enterobacterales.</p><p>One possibility may be that there are very specific requirements for efficient reactivation by a single – protein sHsp system. We have shown that new, more efficient IbpA functionality observed in Erwiniaceae required at least two separate mutations. It is possible, that such combinations of two substitutions simply did not occur in Enterobacteriaceae clade, in which IbpA still required partner protein for efficient reactivation stimulation.</p><p>One must also remember that experiments performed in this study were performed in vitro in a specific set of conditions, which most likely does not represent whole spectrum of challenges faced by different bacteria. It is possible that two – protein system has some other additional adaptive effects, counterbalancing the additional cost of gene maintenance. It was for example recently shown (Miwa &amp; Taguchi, PNAS, 120 (32) e2304841120) that bacterial sHsps play an important role in regulation of stress response. Two – protein system could potentially allow for more complex regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Incorporating X-ray crystallization as an additional technique in the methodology would offer detailed molecular insights into the effects of Q66H and G109D substitutions on ACD-C-terminal peptide and ACD-substrate interactions. The inclusion of such data would further strengthen the results section and provide robust support for your findings. Since the x-ray data might be difficult to collect, the authors might think to get alphafold model or some rosetta score for the model to discuss the finding further.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to reviewer comment we added the comparison of the structural models of AncA0 and AncA0 Q66H G109D ACD dimers complexed with the C-terminal peptides, representing middle structures of largest clusters obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation trajectories based on the AlphaFold2 prediction and in silico mutagenesis (Fig. 5 – figure supplement 2). Model comparison as well as C-terminal peptide – ACD contact analysis did not reveal any major changes in mode of peptide binding or α-crystallin domain conformation, although we do acknowledge that simulation timescale limits the conformational sampling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The work in this paper is in general done carefully. Reconstructions are done appropriately and the effects of statistical uncertainty are quantified properly. My only slight complaint is that I couldn't find statistics about posterior probabilities anywhere and that the sequences and trees do not seem to be deposited.</p></disp-quote><p>Posterior probabilities for all positions of reconstructed proteins were added as a supplementary file 3. MSA of all sequences used for ancestral reconstruction as well as phylogenetic tree in Newick format were added as supplementary files 1 and 2, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also have preferred to have the actual phylogeny in the main text. This is a crucial piece of data that the reader needs to see to understand what exactly is being reconstructed.</p></disp-quote><p>Full phylogeny was added to the main text as Fig. 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper identifies which mutations are crucial for the functional differences between the ancestors tested. This is done quite carefully - the authors even show that the same substitutions also work in extant proteins. My only slight concern was the authors' explanation of what these substitutions do. They show that these substitutions lower the affinity of the C-terminal peptide to the alpha-crystallin domain - a key oligomeric interaction. But the difference is very small - from 4.5 to 7 uM. That seems so small that I find it a bit implausible that this effect alone explains the differences in hydrodynamic radius shown in Figure S8. From my visual inspection, it seems that there is also a noticeable change in the cooperativity of the binding interaction. The binding model the authors use is a fairly simple logarithmic curve that doesn't appear to consider the number of binding sites or potential cooperativity. I think this would have been nice to see here.</p></disp-quote><p>The binding model we used is equivalent to the Hill equation as it accounts for the variable slope of sigmoid function by inclusion of input scaling factor k, which is equivalent to the hill coefficient. Simple one site binding model and two site binding model were also considered but provided worse fits to the data than model including binding cooperativity. Not providing values of fitted parameter k was our mistake, and it was corrected (Fig. 5. with a legend). Additionally, output scaling parameter L is not necessary as fraction bound takes values from 0 to 1, therefore we have fitted the curves again without this parameter. The new values of fitted parameters are very similar to the previous ones. To make text more accessible to the reader, we have used a conventional form of Hill equation. Indeed, AncA0 Q66H G109D ACD displays higher binding cooperativity than more ancestral AncA0 ACD (hill coefficient 2.3 for AncA0 vs 3.7 for AncA0 Q66H G109D). Fitted values of Hill coefficients are higher than one can expect for 2-site ACD dimer, which is probably caused by an experimental setup of BLI, where C-terminal peptide is immobilized on the sensor and ACD is present in solution as bivalent analyte leading to emergence of avidity effects. Both cooperativity and avidity are reflected in the value of Hill coefficient, however as ligand density on the sensor is the same in all experiments only change in ACD binding cooperativity can account for observed difference in the value of Hill coefficients. Difference in the C-terminal peptide binding cooperativity may influence the process of sHsp oligomerization and assembly formation despite similar binding affinity, especially if avidity of multiple binding sites within oligomer is considered.</p><p>In addition, we changed the legend to Figure S8 (now called Fig. 5 – figure supplement 4A ) to clarify the fact that the differences in average hydrodynamic radius are in fact ferly small. To highlight the observation that there are two populations of particles in AncA0 and AncA0 Q66H G109D measured at 25, 35 and 45 °C with different hydrodynamic diameters, we used % of intensity in DLS measurement. It allows us to show the change in the hydrodynamic diameter distribution that is relatively small. We recognize it was not properly explained in the article and added a clarification in figure description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the authors use likelihood methods to test for signatures of selection. This reviewer is not a fan of these methods, as they are easily misled by common biological processes (see PMID 37395787 for a recent critique). Perhaps these pitfalls could simply be acknowledged, as I don't think the selection analysis is very important to the impact of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing to the recent research about limitations of methods used in our work in selection analysis. As per recommendation we added acknowledgment of limitations of methods used to discussion (page 9, line 9 - 13), modifying wording of our conclusions to deemphasize significance of selection analysis results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
