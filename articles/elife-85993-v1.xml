to their long-term retention, that is, to viral domestication. For instance, in some endoparasitoid wasps (whose immature stages develop inside their hosts), the membrane-fusion property of double-stranded DNA viruses have been repeatedly domesticated following ancestral endogenizations. The endogenized genes provide female wasps with a delivery tool to inject virulence factors that are essential to the developmental success of their offspring. Because all known cases of viral domestication involve endoparasitic wasps, we hypothesized that this lifestyle, relying on a close interaction between individuals, may have promoted the endogenization and domestication of viruses. By analyzing the composition of 124 Hymenoptera genomes, spread over the diversity of this clade and including free-living, ecto, and endoparasitoid species, we tested this hypothesis. Our analysis first revealed that double-stranded DNA viruses, in comparison with other viral genomic structures (ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA), are more often endogenized and domesticated (that is, retained by selection) than expected from their estimated abundance in insect viral communities. Second, our analysis indicates that the rate at which dsDNA viruses are endogenized is higher in endoparasitoids than in ectoparasitoids or free-living hymenopterans, which also translates into more frequent events of domestication. Hence, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the endoparasitoid lifestyle has facilitated the endogenization of dsDNA viruses, in turn, increasing the opportunities of domestications that now play a central role in the biology of many endoparasitoid lineages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EVE</kwd><kwd>domestication</kwd><kwd>dsDNA virus</kwd><kwd>parasitoid</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>Hymenoptera</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11-JSV7-0011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varaldi</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-CE02-0021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charlat</surname><given-names>Sylvain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The propensity to endogenize and domesticate dsDNA viruses depends on lifestyle in Hymenoptera.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recent boom of genome sequencing programs has revealed the abundance of DNA fragments of viral origin within eukaryotic genomes. These so-called Endogenous Viral Elements (EVEs) stem from endogenization events that not only involve retroviruses as donors (as could be expected from their natural lifecycle) but also viruses that do not typically integrate into their host chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aswad et al., 2021</xref>). In insects, where retroviruses have yet to be found, endogenization events have involved various non-retroviral viruses: three families of large double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses, at least 22 families of RNA viruses, and three families of single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbert and Belliardo, 2022</xref>). Degeneracy and loss are likely the fate of most EVEs, since they do not a priori benefit their hosts. Still, several studies have reported that EVEs can be retained by selection, thus becoming <italic>domesticated</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koonin and Krupovic, 2018</xref>). The functions involved include defensive properties against related viruses in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2020</xref>), against macroparasites in some Lepidoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gasmi et al., 2021</xref>), or modifications in the expression of genes involved in dispersal in aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gasmi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parker and Brisson, 2019</xref>). Beyond insects, the membrane fusion capacity of viruses, allows their entry into host cells, have been repeatedly co-opted in three metazoan clades: mammals, viviparous lizards, and parasitoid wasps. In placental mammals and viviparous Scincidae lizards, domestication of the <italic>syncytin</italic> protein from retroviruses has allowed the emergence of the placenta, through the development of the syncytium (composed of fused cells) involved in metabolic exchanges between the mother and the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lavialle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cornelis et al., 2017</xref>). A similar fusogenic property was repeatedly co-opted by parasitoids belonging to the Hymenoptera order through the endogenization and domestication of complex viral machineries deriving from large dsDNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drezen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbert and Belliardo, 2022</xref>). The numerous retained viral genes allow parasitoid wasps to produce virus-like structures (VLS) within their reproductive apparatus. These are injected into the wasp’s host, together with their eggs, and protect the wasp progeny against the host immune response. This protection is achieved thanks to the ability of VLS to deliver virulence factors in the form of genes (in which case VLS are called polydnavirus - PDV) or proteins (in which case VLS are called Virus-like particles - VLPs) to host immune cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gauthier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drezen et al., 2022</xref>). So far, five independent cases of such viral domestication have been detected in parasitoid wasps, four of them falling within the Ichneumonoidea superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bézier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Volkoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pichon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke, 2019</xref>) and one in the Cynipoidea superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Giovanni et al., 2020</xref>). The four cases where the donor virus family has been unequivocally identified point towards dsDNA viruses. More specifically, the domesticated EVEs (hereafter, dEVEs) derive from the <italic>Nudiviridae</italic> family in three cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bézier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pichon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke, 2019</xref>) while the fourth involves a putatively new viral family denoted ‘LbFV-like’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Giovanni et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, all these domestication events took place in endoparasitoids, that is, in species that deposit their eggs inside the hosts, as opposed to ectoparasitoids that lay on their surface.</p><p>Beyond these well-characterized events of viral domestication in Hymenoptera, additional cases of endogenization have been uncovered, in studies that enlarged the taxonomic focus of either the hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ter Horst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kondo et al., 2019</xref>) or the viruses that were considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flynn and Moreau, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ter Horst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Irwin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we complement this earlier work by expanding the range of both the hosts and viruses under study, and by further analyzing which endogenization cases have been followed by a domestication event.</p><p>To this end, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline to detect endogenization events involving any kind of viruses (DNA/RNA, single-stranded, double-stranded), at the scale of the whole Hymenoptera order. This analysis first allowed us to test whether the propensity of viruses to enter Hymenoptera genomes, and to be domesticated, depend on their genomic structure (in line with the pattern observed so far, where only dsDNA viruses have been involved in domestication events as described above). We then tested whether the lifestyle of the species (free-living, endoparasitoid, ectoparasitoid) correlates with their propensity to integrate and domesticate viruses. Our working hypothesis was that the endoparasitoid lifestyle may be associated with a higher rate of viral endogenization and/or a higher rate of domestication events, for two non-exclusive reasons related either to the exposure to new viruses and the adaptive value of the endogenized elements.</p><p>First, a higher endogenization rate may simply stem from a higher exposure to viruses. Such an effect could be at play in endoparasitoids due to the intimate interaction between the parasitoid egg or larva and the host. In other words, the endoparasitic way of life may facilitate the acquisition of new viruses deriving from the hosts. Notably, this lifestyle may also facilitate the maintenance and spread of newly acquired viruses within wasp populations. Indeed, endoparasitoid wasps often inject not only eggs but also venomic compounds (typically produced in the venom gland or in calyx cells) where viruses can be present and may thus be vertically transmitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the confinement of the several developing wasps within a single host may facilitate viral horizontal transmission and its subsequent spread in wasps populations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Varaldi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Second, a higher rate of domestication in endoparasitoids may be the consequence of a particular selective regime. This is expected since, these insects are facing the very special challenge of resisting the host immune system, contrary to other lifestyles. This selective pressure may promote the co-option of viral functions such as the above-mentioned membrane fusion activity, that provide a very effective mean to deliver virulence factors.</p><p>Our analysis reveals numerous new instances of endogenization events, some of which are also characterized by signatures of molecular domestication. We found a clear enrichment in endogenization events deriving from dsDNA viruses as compared to those with other genomic structures. While the data did not reveal a significant effect of Hymenoptera lifestyles on the acquisition of dsRNA, ssRNA, or ssDNA viruses, it supports the hypothesis that genes from dsDNA viruses are more often endogenized and domesticated in endoparasitoids than in free-living and ectoparasitoid species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We screened for EVEs 124 Hymenoptera genome assemblies, including 24 ectoparasitoids, 37 endoparasitoids, and 63 free-living species (the list can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). EVEs were identified using a sequence-homology approach based on a comprehensive viral protein database. Different confidence levels (ranging from A to D) were associated with the various EVEs inferred, where the A score indicates a maximal confidence level for endogenization. This confidence index is based upon sequencing depth combined with the presence of eukaryotic genes and/or transposable elements in the genomic environment of the candidate loci (as detailed in the Material and methods section). By default, the four categories are included in the analysis, but unless otherwise stated statistical tests based on the A category only led to the same conclusions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref> for more details). Since several EVEs may enter into the genome during a single endogenization event, we grouped into the same event EVEs that were localized in the same scaffold (only for viruses having similar genomic structure), and/or that derived from the same putative viral family. Our analysis further included an inference of the phylogenetic relationships among homologous EVEs, that was used to map endogenization events on the Hymenoptera species tree. Finally, inferences of domestication events relied upon signatures of purifying selection in the integrated genes (based on <italic>dN/dS</italic> estimates) and/or on expression data. An important objective of our analysis is to detect and enumerate not only EVEs but also endogenization <italic>events</italic> that can explain the presence of these EVEs. Indeed, an EVE denotes a single gene of viral origin in a single species. Several neighboring EVEs in a genome most likely result from the endogenization of a single viral genome, and homologous EVEs shared by several closely related species may further stem from a single ancestral endogenization event. This distinction is critical when it comes to examining the effect of various factors on the probability of integrating EVEs, which implies counting events rather than EVEs. As an example, let’s consider the single endogenization event involving 13 EVEs that occurred in the common ancestor of <italic>Leptopilina</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Giovanni et al., 2020</xref>). In this wasp genus, based on previous findings, we expect the 39 EVEs to be grouped into a single endogenization event. Our pipeline appropriately detected 36 EVEs (out of 39) and correctly aggregated them into a single endogenization event mapped on the branch leading to the <italic>Leptopilina</italic> genus. Thus, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we can observe a pie chart at the node corresponding to the common ancestor of the three <italic>Leptopilina</italic> species (<italic>L.boulardi</italic>, <italic>L.clavipes,</italic> and <italic>L.heterotoma</italic>). Most of this pie chart is blue, which corresponds to the putative donor viral family, i.e., LbFV-like, and is surrounded by a black border, indicating that the genes involved are inferred as domesticated. The number of EVEs and dEVEs (n=12/13) for each of the 3 species is then plotted along the horizontal bar plots with the same color code (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> for more canonical examples).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous Viral Elements (EVEs ) and their domestication status in Hymenoptera.</title><p>Lifestyles are displayed next to species names (blue: free-living, green: endoparasitoid, yellow: ectoparasitoid, gray: unknown). The number of EVEs and domesticated EVEs (dEVEs) found in each species are represented respectively by the first and second facets of the horizontal histograms. Colors along these histograms indicate the potential donor viral families (where blue tones correspond to viral double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, red tones to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses, orange/brown tones to dsRNA viruses, and green tones to ssRNA genomes). EVEs shared by multiple species and classified within the same event are represented by circles whose size is proportional to their number; those that are considered as dEVEs are surrounded by a black border. Numbers in the white boxes correspond to the number of endogenization events inferred. As an example, <italic>Megastigmus dorsalis</italic> and <italic>Megastigmus stigmatizans</italic> are ectoparasitoids (yellow) sharing a common endogenization event (within the Cluster21304, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that likely originated from an unclassified dsRNA virus (gray color in circle), and shows no sign of domestication (no black border around the gray part of the circle).

Since these two species do not share a close common ancestor in the phylogeny and come from two different families, the algorithm, therefore, assigned them to two independent viral endogenization events. The viral locus found in the assembly of the endoparasitoid species <italic>Platygaster orseoliae</italic> was annotated F, meaning that the depth of coverage deviated significantly from the BUSCO distribution of the genome and that no TEs and less than five eukaryotic genes were found in the scaffold containing the candidate insertion. Finally, the two loci belonging to the ectoparasitoid species <italic>Megastigmus stigmantizans</italic> and <italic>Megastigmus dorsalis</italic> both show a score supporting viral endogenization. Furthermore, these species exhibit a doubly monophyletic clade (high bootstrap score) within the gene phylogeny and within the species phylogeny, suggesting that they acquired this viral gene from their closest common ancestor about 20 million years ago.

We may thus wonder whether adding complexity to this view would change our main conclusion. In particular, a significant proportion of our free-living species are in fact eusocial (ants, some bees). We thus tested the robustness of our conclusion by including an ‘eusociality’ category in our analysis (see new categories in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>First, the new models did not reveal any significant effect of the lifestyle in the number of Events or domestication Events involving ssRNA and ssDNA viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3G,H and K,L</xref>).

In addition, more than 99% of the MCMC iterations led to a higher coefficient value for endoparasitoids compared to ectoparasitoid or eusocial species in that combination.

We found a massive entry of genes from dsDNA viruses in an undescribed species belonging to the Campopleginae subfamily (‘Campopleginae sp’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In Ophioniformes (a clade that includes Campopleginae), two lineages that have previously been shown to host domesticated viruses (the Campopleginae species <italic>Hyposoter didymator</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Volkoff et al., 2010</xref>), and the Banchinae species <italic>Glypta fumiferanae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Béliveau et al., 2015</xref>). It has been advocated that these so-called ichnoviruses found in <italic>Hyposoter didymator</italic> and <italic>Glypta fumiferanae</italic> may derive from the same endogenization event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Béliveau et al., 2015</xref>). In our unknown Campopleginae species, we identified homologs of 35 out of the 40 ichnovirus genes present in the genome of <italic>H. didymator</italic> (so-called IVSPER genes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Volkoff et al., 2010</xref>). Those genes show conserved synteny in the two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), strongly suggesting that they derive from the same endogenization event. However, our analysis did not identify viral homologs in the two Ophioninae and Cremastinae subfamilies, that are internal to the clade including Campopleginae and Banchinae wasps. Together with previous studies that does not reveal the presence of IVSPER in other internal clades, this result argues against the view of a single event at the root of Ophioniformes, and supports the alternative view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burke et al., 2021</xref>) that the so-called IVSPER genes in the Campopleginae and Banchinae subfamilies stem from independent events, despite their striking structural similarities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> for illustration). We found no trace of the previously suggested remnants of ichnoviruses in the related species <italic>Venturia canescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pichon et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the presence of nudiviral genes in this species was confirmed.</p><p>Additionally, we found five new cases of endogenization involving multiple EVEs from dsDNA viruses belonging to <italic>Nudiviridae</italic>, LbFV-like, and AmFV-like families.</p><p>Two of them involve parasitoid species, i.e., <italic>Platygaster orseoliae</italic> and an <italic>Aprostocetus</italic> species. For <italic>Aprostocetus</italic>, we detected six EVEs related to nudiviruses branching between the Chalcidoidea and the Diaprioidea superfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Among these EVEs we found four with an annotation: <italic>lef-4</italic>, <italic>Ac68/pif-6</italic>, GrBNV_gp19/60/61-like proteins, and a rep-like protein. In the absence of closely related sequences or RNA seq data, we cannot investigate if these elements have been domesticated.</p><p>The <italic>P. orseoliae</italic> case involves the recently characterized putative family of filamentous viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lepetit et al., 2016</xref>). The free-living LbFV virus is the only representative of this putative family and has been identified as a source of adaptive genes in <italic>Leptopilina</italic> wasps that parasitize <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, with 13 virally-derived genes involved in the production of VLPs protecting the wasp’s eggs from encapsulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Giovanni et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>P. orseoliae</italic>, 15 genes homologous to LbFV were detected (out of 108 ORFs in the LbFV genome; median E-value=9.39e-21 [min = 2.617e-76, max = 4.225e-08]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Among these 15 genes, five were also endogenized in <italic>Leptopilina</italic> species (named LbFV_ORF58:DNApol, LbFV_ORF78, LbFV_ORF60:LCAT, LbFV_ORF107, and LbFV_ORF85) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Giovanni et al., 2020</xref>). Assuming the ancestral donor virus contained the same 108 genes as LbFV, the number of shared genes in these two independent domestication events is higher than expected by chance (one-sided binomial test: x=5, n=15, p=13/108, p=0.02682), suggesting that similar functions could have been retained in both lineages. Notably, we also found within the <italic>P. orseoliae</italic> assembly 12 scaffolds that were annotated as free-living viruses (F-X scaffolds). They had a different sequencing depth compared to BUSCO containing scaffolds and encoded 136 complete ORFs for which 21 presented homology with LbFV ORFs (min bit score = 50, min ORF size = 150 pb, max overlaps = 23 pb). ORF density was 82.7% which is in the range of expected values for related free-living viruses. In order to identify additional scaffolds possibly belonging to this free-living virus, we searched for homology between the 136 putative viral proteins, and the scaffolds obtained from the assembly of <italic>P. orseoliae</italic>. These results allowed us to identify two additional scaffolds (scaffold_117128 and scaffold_18896). Because the total size of the 14 putative ‘free-living’ scaffolds were within the expected range for a dsDNA virus genome (136,801 bp) and because the average coverage was much higher than BUSCO-containing scaffolds (mean cov = 95.6 X [sd = 5.05 X] compared to 33 X in BUSCOs) and homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we believe that this set of scaffolds corresponds to the whole genome of a new virus, related to LbFV, which we propose to call Platygaster orseoliae filamentous virus (PoFV) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This virus is the closest relative to the EVEs found in <italic>P. orseoliae</italic>. Using this putative whole genome viral sequence to search for homologous genes in the <italic>P. orseoliae</italic> genome, we were able to detect a total of 139 convincing EVEs (deriving from 89 of the 136 ORFS found in PoFV). A large proportion of the EVEs (22.7%) presented premature stop codons within the sequences, further suggesting that these virally-derived genes are indeed endogenized since abundant pseudogenization is not expected in free-living virus genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). 44 of these 89 PoFV-derived EVEs presented signs of domestication, as the <italic>dN/dS</italic> (inferred using paralogs) were significantly lower than 1 (see <italic>Ac81</italic> and <italic>Integrase</italic> gene phylogenies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Among the 81/139 apparently intact EVEs (with ORF length &gt;= 50% of the PoFV ORF), some are likely implicated in DNA replication (integrase), in transcription (lef-8, lef-9, lef-5, lef-4), in packaging and envelopment (ac81, 38 k) and in infectivity (pif-1, pif-2, pif-3). Among the 139 PoFV-related EVEs found in <italic>P. orseoliae</italic>, 104 corresponded to putative paralogs whereas none of these 104 ORFs were present in multiple copies within the PoFV genome, suggesting that a major post-endogenization duplication event occurred or that multiple endogenization events did occur. Although functional studies are clearly needed to confirm that these virus-derived genes are involved in the production of VLPs as in <italic>Leptopilina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Giovanni et al., 2020</xref>), we see Platygaster orseoliae endogenous viral elements (PoEFVs) as good candidates for viral domestication, which could possibly be involved in counteracting the immune system of its dipteran host (from the Cecidomyiidae family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhl and Hidayat, 2016</xref>).

Most paralogs were found in scaffolds exceeding the expected size for any virus sequence (min = 23,726 bp, mean = 326,262 bp, max = 2,693,376 bp). In addition, all scaffolds do include transposable elements and eukaryotic genes making them undoubtedly endogenized.

Prior to the present analysis, 28 viral families had been described as involved in endogenization in arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbert and Belliardo, 2022</xref>). Our study of hymenopteran genomes which relied on sequence homology search, further revealed the ubiquity of this phenomenon, with 1261 EVEs found, belong to at least 40 viral families (or family-like clades). Because the identification of EVEs necessitates the availability of related viruses in the database, we should see these numbers as an underestimation of the real number of EVEs. In addition, our pipeline necessitates the availability of either related species sharing the same EVEs (or at least the presence of paralogs within a single species) or the availability of RNAseq data to infer domestication. Because these last conditions were only met for 701 out 1261 EVEs, the results we obtained here regarding domestication should be seen as an underestimation of the prevalence of the phenomenon. Of the 1,261 EVEs found, the average identity with the closest known viral proteins was 36.32% [min = 15.7%, max = 99.1%]. Although this large overall divergence suggests ancient events, it does not exclude the possibility that some of the integrations are recent, because free-living viral relatives of the true donors may be unknown or extinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Junglen and Drosten, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the following section, we will first discuss a hypothesis for why double-stranded DNA viruses, in comparison with other viral genomic structures (ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA), are more often endogenized than expected. We will then discuss hypotheses that could explain why we found a higher rate of endogenization of dsDNA viruses in endoparasitoids compared to ectoparasitoids or free-living hymenopterans, which also translates into more frequent events of domestication.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>dsDNA viruses are more frequently involved in endogenization than expected by chance</title><p>Despite the observations that all viral genomic structures can be involved in endogenization, we clearly identified differences in their propensity to do so. Based on a comparison between the respective proportions of the various viral categories in the inferred endogenization events and in public databases, we found that dsDNA viruses are much more represented than expected, while ssRNA viruses are under-represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We acknowledge that current knowledge on the actual diversity of free-living viruses (as approximated through the NCBI taxonomy database) remains incomplete, but the strength of the effect reported here makes this conclusion rather robust to variations in the null distribution. On the basis of current knowledge, RNA viruses, and in particular ssRNA viruses, appear to be much more diversified and prevalent than DNA viruses in insects. We note that viral-metagenomic studies often focus either on DNA or RNA viruses, and as such do not provide an accurate and unbiased picture of the extent of viral diversity. To gain insights on this topic, we may thus focus on model systems where long-lasting research efforts have likely produced a more reliable picture. The Honeybee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> is probably the most studied of all hymenopteran species. In honeybees, the great majority of known viruses belong to the RNA world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Siede, 2007</xref>), with very few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, until 2015, only RNA viruses were known to infect the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, despite the extensive research conducted on this model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). A very limited set of DNA viruses has now been described from this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wallace et al., 2021</xref>) but clearly, RNA viruses dominate the <italic>Drosophila</italic> viral community, both in terms of diversity and prevalence. In support of this view, recent studies revealed the very elevated absolute diversity of RNA viruses. For instance, a survey of 600 insect transcriptomes recovered more than 1,213 RNA viruses belonging to 40 different families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Although, obviously, this study does not inform on the diversity of DNA viruses, it shows that the RNA virome of insects is both prevalent (e.g. in this study, 15% of all insects were infected by a single Mononegales-like virus) and extremely diversified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Actually, this view appears to hold at the larger scale of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koonin et al., 2015</xref>). Taking into account this patent abundance of ssRNA viruses in insects, our study indicates they are by far less frequently endogenized than their dsDNA counterparts in hymenopterans. Notably, a similar trend was recently reported in a study including a diverse set of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Irwin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Most of the major endogenization events characterized so far in hymenopterans involve dsDNA viruses from the <italic>Nudiviridae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pichon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bézier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbert and Belliardo, 2022</xref>). Our study further confirms that this viral family represents a major source of exogenous and sometimes adaptive genes for Hymenoptera. Indeed, 28 new independent endogenization events involve in this family, among which 9 are shared by at least two related species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The major contribution of nudiviruses to endogenization may be explained by their wide host range in arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Their nuclear replication constitutes another plausible explanatory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Velamoor et al., 2020</xref>), since it may facilitate contact with host DNA. In addition, their tropism for gonads may favor the endogenization in germinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burand, 2009</xref>). In fact, nuclear replication is a feature shared by nearly all families of dsDNA viruses found in our analysis: <italic>Baculoviridae</italic>, <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>, <italic>Phycodnaviridae</italic>, <italic>Nimaviridae Caulimoviridae</italic>, <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>, <italic>Asfaviridae</italic> (although nuclear replication occurs only at early time post-infection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harrison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teycheney, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Verbruggen et al., 2016</xref>), Apis-filamentous-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark, 1978</xref>) and LbFV-like families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Varaldi et al., 2006</xref>) (the <italic>Poxviridae</italic> viruses, that replicate in the cytoplasm, are thus the only exception). In contrast, most RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm. Nuclear replication may thus constitute a general explanation for the elevated propensity of DNA viruses to endogenization. Additionally, we may expect that a DNA molecule, rather than an RNA molecule, is more likely to integrate the insect genome, because the latter requires reverse transcription before possible endogenization.</p><p>The <italic>Poxviridae</italic> case indicates that cytoplasmic replication does not necessarily impede endogenization. These viruses do not require nuclear localization to propagate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moss, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>) and were nevertheless found to be involved in many endogenization events (n=28). A similar pattern was observed in a recent study focusing on ant genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flynn and Moreau, 2019</xref>). Within <italic>Poxviridae</italic>, entomopoxviruses were particularly involved in endogenization events (n=18) with four cases of EVEs shared between several closely related species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Factors behind variation in endogenization and domestication rates</title><p>Several recent studies have uncovered abundant EVEs in insect genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flynn and Moreau, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ter Horst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Russo et al., 2019</xref>), with huge variations in abundance between species. For instance, in their analysis based on 48 arthropod genomes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ter Horst et al., 2019</xref> found that the number of EVEs ranged between 0 and 502. Although insect genome size and assembly quality may partly explain this variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbert and Belliardo, 2022</xref>), the underlying biological factors are generally unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the insect lifestyle may influence both the endogenization and domestication rates. We used a Bayesian approach to reconstruct ancestral states throughout the phylogeny of Hymenoptera, thus accounting for uncertainty, and found that endoparasitoidism, in comparison with other lifestyles, tends to promote dsDNA viral endogenization. Notably, this conclusion was not the artefactual consequence of differences in genome assembly quality. In fact, the quality of genome assemblies was correlated with the lifestyle in our data set, but the genomes of endoparasitoid species were generally less well assembled than those of free-living species. If anything, this difference should reduce the power for detecting endogenization events in endoparasitoids, where our analysis detected an excess of such events. Our estimate of the effect sizes (with 2.47 times more endogenization events in endoparasitoids than in free-living species) should thus be seen as conservative.</p><p>Why do endoparasitoid wasps tend to undergo more endogenization than others? We initially had in mind two non-exclusive hypotheses that remain plausible explanations for the observed pattern. First, endoparasitoids may be more intensively exposed to viruses. However, if this effect is at play, we expect to have an ‘endoparasitoid’ effect for all viruses, whatever their genomic structure. For instance, we would expect such an effect to be detected for ssRNA viruses, which are involved in the greatest number of endogenization events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was not the case, since only dsDNA viruses were more frequently endogenized in endoparasitoids. Thus, we argue that this hypothesis is unlikely to explain the observed pattern. In addition, or alternatively, endoparasitoids may have a higher propensity to endogenize and retain viral genes. This second hypothesis posits that endoparasitoids are more frequently selected for retaining virally-derived genes than ectoparasitoid or free-living hymenopterans. In our analysis, domestication events are most frequently observed in endoparasitoids (over three times more frequently than in other hymenopterans). Obviously, this may be at least partly explained by the higher input discussed above (the higher endogenization rate). Yet, once this effect is controlled for, a trend towards a higher rate of domestication remains. More specifically, the likelihood of domestication following endogenization was significantly higher in endoparasitoids than in ectoparasitoids, but was not significantly higher than in free-living species. This latter lack of significant difference may be biologically explained if a single domestication event precludes the domestication of additional EVEs, while not affecting the rate of non-adaptive endogenization. This would ‘dilute’ the signal along branches involved in domestication. If this effect is at play, then it reduces considerably the power of our analysis to detect any difference in the rate of domestication between lifestyles. Indeed, in all known cases, only one domesticated virus has been documented, suggesting that further domestications are not beneficial once a viral machinery has been recruited by a wasp lineage.</p><p>Whether or not the rate of domestication <italic>per se</italic> is higher in endoparasitoids than in other hymenopterans, the selective advantages brought by these viral genes in endoparasitoids should be discussed. It has been demonstrated in a few model systems that EVEs may confer antiviral immunity against related ‘free-living’ viruses via the piRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, to our knowledge, such an effect has only been demonstrated against RNA viruses, so that it would not explain the excess of DNA viruses documented here. Furthermore, the sequence identities with known viral sequences, which is needed for this mechanism to work, is generally low in our dataset. Accordingly, previous work revealed that EVE-derived piRNAs studied in 48 arthropod species were also probably too divergent to induce an efficient antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ter Horst et al., 2019</xref>). At that stage, the ability of EVEs to generate PIWI-interacting RNAs that play a functional role in antiviral immunity seems questionable. Further studies involving small RNA sequencing in hymenopterans would be required to shed light on this issue. Protection of the eggs and larvae against the host immune system is recognized as an important trait, where EVEs play a critical role. Because of their peculiar lifestyle, endoparasitoids are all targeted by the host immune system, a matter of life or death to which other hymenopterans are not exposed to. Several cases of endogenization and domestication in endoparasitoids, all involving dsDNA viruses, are thought to be related to this particular selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bézier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Volkoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pichon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Giovanni et al., 2020</xref>). The parasitoids appear to have co-opted the viral fusogenic property to address their own proteins (VLPs) or DNA fragments (polydnaviruses) to host immune cells, thereby canceling the host cellular immune response. The above-hypothesized high exposure of endoparasitoids to viruses, together with this unique selective pressure, may act in concert to produce the pattern documented here: a strong input, that is, a diverse set of putative genetic novelties, combined with a strong selective pressure for retaining some of them. The observed excess of dsDNA viruses may be an indication that these viruses display a better potential for providing adaptive material in this context. In the cases of polydnaviruses (found in some Braconidae and some Campopleginae), it appears that one way to efficiently deliver virulence factors to the host cell is by addressing DNA circles that ultimately integrate into the host immune cells and get expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chevignon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chevignon et al., 2018</xref>). The DNA which is packed into the mature particles typically encodes virulence proteins deriving from the wasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espagne et al., 2004</xref>). This means that, at least for these cases, the viral system should be able to pack DNA, which is most likely a feature that DNA viruses may provide. Such an argument does not hold in the VLP systems, where only proteins are packed in viral particles, and it is unclear why EVEs deriving from dsDNA viruses would be more able to fulfill such a function. Here other features of dsDNA viruses come into mind as possibly important factors: their large genome size, and their large capsids and envelopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaudhari et al., 2021</xref>). These may predispose dsDNA viruses to be domesticated, since abundant quantities of venoms have to be transmitted in order to efficiently suppress the host immune response. In conclusion our analysis has revealed a large set of new virally-derived genes in Hymenoptera genomes. Those genes were deriving from viruses with any genomic structures, although dsDNA viruses were disproportionately involved in endogenization and domestication. Importantly, our analysis revealed that endogenization rate and the absolute number of domestication events involving dsDNA viruses were increased for endoparasitoids compared to other lifestyles. Among the new cases of endogenization and domestication, we uncovered new events revealing common features with previously known cases of viral domestication by endoparasitoids, such as in the Platygastroidea <italic>Platygaster orseoliae</italic>. This is to our knowledge the first case reported in the superfamily Platygastroideae, thus extending the diversity of Hymenoptera concerned by viral domestication. We propose that the higher rate of endogenization and higher number of domestication events in endoparasitoids is a consequence of the extreme selective pressure exerted by the host immune system on endoparasitoids. This extreme selective pressure may select endoparasitoids for retaining a viral machinery that could helps them address virulence factors in their hosts. We expect this process to be widespread among insect species sharing the same lifestyle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genome sampling, assembly correction, and assembly quality</title><p>A bioinformatic pipeline mixing sequence homology search, phylogeny, genomic environment, and selective pressure analysis was built to search for viral endogenization and domestication events in Hymenoptera genomes.

Concerning the last 32 samples, DNA was extracted on single individuals (usually one female) or a mix of individuals when the specimens were too small using Macherey-Nagel extraction kit, the DNA was then used to construct a true seq nano Illumina library at Genotoul platform (Toulouse, France). The sequences were generated from HiSeq 2500 or HiSeq 3000 machines (15 Gb/sample). The paired-end reads were then quality trimmed using fastqmcf (-q15 –qual-mean 30 -D150, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ExpressionAnalysis/ea-utils">GitHub</ext-link>) and assembled using IDBA-UD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peng et al., 2012</xref>).

In addition, when the raw reads were available, we used the MEC pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) to correct possible assembly errors. Although some genomes were highly fragmented (such as the 32 genomes we generated since they were obtained using short reads only), the N50 values (min: 3542 bp) were equal to or larger than the expected sizes of genes known to be endogenized and domesticated (average size = 1244,4 bp (sd = 1105 bp)) indicating that most of the putative EVEs should be detected entirely.</p><p>Out of the 32 samples sequenced by our laboratory for this study, one (corresponding to <italic>Platygaster orseoliae</italic>) gave unexpected results. After assembly and BUSCO analysis, two sets of contigs were identified: one with only 4x coverage on average, and one with 33x on average. The phylogeny of these different BUSCOs gene sets showed that the low-coverage scaffolds likely belong to an early diverging lineage of Chalcidoidea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), whereas the 33x scaffolds belong to the target species <italic>P. orseoliae</italic>. This result suggests that the pool of 10 individuals used for sequencing was likely a mix of two species. A phylogenetic study based on Ultra Conserved Elements (UCEs) obtained from several species of Chalcidoidea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rasplus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cruaud et al., 2019</xref>) allowed us to identify the unknown species as a sister to <italic>Aprostocetus sp</italic> (Eulophidae). These UCEs (along with 400 bp of flanking regions) were extracted from the low coverage scaffolds with a custom script. We used a two-step process to assign the unknown sample to species.

Then, unknown sequences were analyzed with a larger set of species belonging to the identified family (Eulophidae; loci taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rasplus et al., 2020</xref>). In both cases, only loci that had a sequence for at least 75% of the samples included in the analysis were retained.

Positions with &gt;90% gaps and sequences with &gt;25% gaps were removed from the alignments using SEQTOOLS (package PASTA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mirarab et al., 2015</xref>).

The sequence homology search was performed with a BlastX equivalent implemented in Mmseqs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Steinegger and Söding, 2017</xref>) using each genome assembly as queries and the viral proteins collected as a database. The result gave a total of 81,953,678 viral hits (max E-value 5e-04 with an average of 660,916 hits per genome). We kept only candidates with a percentage coverage of the viral protein ≥ 30%, an identity score ≥ 20% and an E-value score &lt;5e-04 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Once all the viral hits were recovered, we formed putative EVEs loci (n=238,108) corresponding to the overlap of several viral hits on the same scaffold using the GenomicRanges R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To remove false positives corresponding to eukaryotic genes rather than viral genes, we then performed another generalist sequence homology search against the Nr database (downloaded the 09/11/20) using mmseqs2 search (-s 7.5, E-value max = 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). We did not select our candidate based on the best hit, since it does not necessarily reflect the true phylogenetic proximity. Instead, candidates with more than 25 hits with either eukaryotic non-hymenoptera species or prokaryotic species were removed, except if they also had hits with at least 10 different virus species (bits ≥ 50). We chose to eliminate Hymenoptera hits from the database because if a real endogenization event concerns both one of the 124 species of our dataset and some species in the NCBI database, then an apparent ‘Hymenoptera’ hit will be detected, possibly leading to its (unfair) elimination. Since viral diversity is poorly known, we also kept sequences with even one single viral hit, as long as it did not have more than 5 eukaryotic or prokaryotic hits. Using these filtering criteria we removed a total of 234,036/238,108 (98,3%) candidate loci leaving 4,072 candidates with convincing homology to viral proteins. Note that among these loci a certain proportion actually corresponded to non-endogenized ‘free-living’ viruses.

Accordingly, the scaffolds were scored as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>):</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A: scaffolds with a corrected coverage p-value &gt;0.05 and at least one eukaryotic gene and/or one repeat element,</p></list-item><list-item><p>B: scaffolds with at least one eukaryotic gene and/or one repeat element but no coverage data available,</p></list-item><list-item><p>C: scaffolds with a corrected coverage p-value &gt;0.05 and neither eukaryotic gene nor transposable element,</p></list-item><list-item><p>D: scaffolds with a corrected coverage p-value &lt;0.05 and whose coverage value was higher than the average of the scaffolds containing BUSCOs (as it is difficult to imagine that an endogenized scaffold presents a lower coverage than expected, whereas a higher coverage could correspond to the presence of repeated elements that inflate the coverage of the scaffold for example) but with at least five eukaryotic genes and/or a repeated element (in total),</p></list-item><list-item><p>E: scaffolds presenting no DNA seq coverage data available and no eukaryotic gene nor transposable element detected,</p></list-item><list-item><p>F: scaffolds presenting a corrected p-value of coverage &lt;0.05 and less than five eukaryotic genes without any transposable elements; this category may rather correspond to free-living viruses.</p></list-item><list-item><p>X: scaffolds with a corrected p-value &lt;0.05 and neither eukaryotic gene nor transposable element; This category may rather correspond to free-living viruses.</p></list-item></list><p>Only scaffolds scored as A, B, C, or D were considered as endogenized, whereas E scaffolds were not sufficiently supported by the data to be considered as endogenized.

We aggregated into a single event, firstly (i) all the EVEs present on the same scaffolds, and secondly (ii) all the EVEs that presented the same taxonomic assignment at the level of the viral family. These two steps were sufficient to aggregate EVEs in the simplest case of events involving only one species (but possibly several EVEs).</p><p>To further characterize the endogenization events including more than one Hymenoptera species, we also relied on phylogenetic inference. To this end, the protein sequences belonging to each of the clusters (containing both viral proteins and candidate EVEs) were first aligned with clustalo v1.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>) in order to merge possible candidate loci (which may in fact correspond to various HSPs). All loci (=HSPs) within the same scaffold presenting no overlap in the alignment were thus merged, as they probably correspond to multiple HSPs and are not duplications. We then performed a new codon alignment from the augmented sequences in the clusters using the MACSE v2 alignsequence program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ranwez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>). This alignment allowed us to obtain a protein and nucleotide codon alignment. We used the protein alignment to infer the phylogeny of each cluster with the program Iqtree2 v2.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Minh et al., 2020</xref>) (-m MFP -alrt 1000 (partitioned))(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">9</xref>). No trimming was performed at the amino-acid level, since this may result in a loss of topology information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ranwez and Chantret, 2020</xref>). However, since it can affect branch length, only codon alignment was trimmed at the protein level via Trimal v1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (-backtrans -automated1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>). We then exploited the information from the cluster phylogenies to form the endogenization events. EVEs potentially deriving from the same event should be supported by the formation of the same well-supported monophyletic clade (bootstrap score &gt;80) both in the gene tree and the Hymenoptera tree (allowing gene losses in 20% of the species concerned by the monophyletic group). EVEs were possibly aggregated within the same event only if the Hymenoptera belonged to the same family. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, the clustering of multiple EVEs within the same scaffold in one species was used to aggregate the homologous EVEs found in a related species within the same shared event, even if they were on different scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For details, see some canonical examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>The majority of EVEs were found within scaffolds considered as endogenized (A-D score) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8B</xref>). Besides, the distribution of EVEs among scores was roughly identical for each viral genomic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). The main difference was in the fraction of EVEs annotated as X or F. This fraction was higher for DNA viruses compared to RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8B</xref>). Because these scaffolds likely belong to free-living viruses that have been sequenced together with the insect DNA, it is not a surprise to observe an excess of DNA viruses, since DNA and not RNA were sequenced.</p><p>For events shared by several species, we were also able to analyze gene synteny around putative EVEs. To do this, we conducted the equivalent of an all vs all TblastX (Mmseqs2 search –search-type 4, max E-value=1e-07) between all the candidate loci within a putative event (deduced from the phylogenetic inference), and then looked for hits (HSPs) between homologous EVEs around the insertions. Because it is possible to find homology between two genomic regions that does not correspond to orthology, for example, because of the presence of conserved domains, we had to define a threshold to identify with confidence the orthology signal. We, therefore, conducted simulations to define this value, based on the well-assembled genome of <italic>Cotesia congregata</italic> (GCA_905319865.3) by simply performing the same all vs all blast analysis against itself (as if the two species considered had the same genome). Based on this, we defined two types of simulated EVEs, (i) independently endogenized EVEs in the genomes of the two ‘species’. This is simply simulated by randomly selecting two different regions in the genomes, and (ii) a shared simulated EVE that was acquired by their common ‘ancestor’. This is simulated by selecting the same random genomic location in both ‘genomes’. We then counted the total length of the HSPs found around the simulated insertions all along the corresponding scaffold (i and ii). As the result will obviously depend on scaffold length, we performed these simulations on several scaffold lengths (100000000 bp, 100,00,000 bp, 100,00,00 bp, 100,000 bp and 10,000 bp). We conducted 500 simulations in each scenario, and we measured the cumulative length of homologous sequences by counting the sum of HSPs (bit score &gt;50). We then defined a threshold for each windows size in order to minimize for the false-positive (FP) and maximize true-positifs (TP) (thresholds 100,000,000 bp = 172737 bp (FP = 0.012, TP = 0.922); 100,00,000 bp = 74262 bp (FP = 0.012, TP = 0.878); 100,00,00 bp = 21000 bp (FP = 0.014, TP = 0.28); 100,000 bp = 1332 bp (FP = 0.012 TP = 0.198) and 10,000 bp = 180 bp (FP = 0.008, TP = 0.208)).</p><p>Events were linked to viral families based on the closest match information between the viral blastx (GenBank accession number and/or viral protein and/or viral species) and the classification proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shi et al., 2016</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Arguments for domestication</title><p>One way to test for the domestication of an EVEs (dEVEs) was to estimate the ratio (omega) of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (<italic>dN</italic>), to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (<italic>dS</italic>). If EVEs are evolving neutrally, then the ratio is expected to be equal to 1, whereas if the EVE is under purifying selection, <italic>dN/dS</italic> is expected to be lower than 1. We conducted this analysis on trimmed codon alignments from (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) via the codeml algorithm from PAML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang, 2007</xref> used through the ETE3 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016</xref>) (model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Muse and Gaut, 1994</xref>). We then used a branch model to test the deviation from the null model in which marked branches (called foreground) wich corresponded to the monophyletic EVE clade evolved under a neutral scenario (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msup><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> test).

The p-values were then adjusted by selecting an FDR of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Puoliväli et al., 2020</xref>), and we estimated the standard errors of <italic>dN/dS</italic> that maximized the likelihood (option getSE = 1). <italic>dN/dS</italic> with dS greater than 10 were removed, since this indicates substitution saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The other way we choose to study the domesticated nature of a viral gene was to study their expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We reasoned that domesticated genes are likely to be significantly expressed. To test this, when RNAseq reads were available on NCBI (SRA), we mapped them on the assembled genomes (until reaching 300x coverage as far as possible). Using the TPMCalculator program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vera Alvarez et al., 2019</xref>), we measured expression in ovaries and the whole body if available or alternatively in any tissue (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). An EVE was considered as domesticated if the gene was expressed with a Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) index above 1000. This threshold was chosen based on the median value observed for control EVEs (718.70 TPM), rounded up to 1000 TPM to be conservative. We measured the accuracy of this metric using EVEs for which both TPM and <italic>dN/dS</italic> calculations were possible: among the 36 genes having a TPM &gt;1000, 33 also had a <italic>dN/dS</italic> significantly below 1 suggesting that inferring domestication based on TPM &gt;1000 was consistent with <italic>dN/dS</italic> test with a 0.9166 probability. Finally, based on the idea that an active EVE should encode a protein with a similar length to the donor virus, we calculated the actual viral protein sequence length using the orfipy algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Singh and Wurtele, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>A possible bias when comparing the effect of lifestyles on domesticated elements could come from a difference of RNAseq reads availability depending on the lifestyle, which may result in a different number of EVEs considered as domesticated.

The 11.14% false negatives corresponded to sequences that were too divergent or with a region of similarity is too small to be detected by our pipeline. We found that 88.7% of the control EVEs were located within that scaffolds scored as A (i.e. having a depth of coverage falling within the distribution of those containing BUSCO genes, as well as having one or more eukaryotic genes and/or transposable elements in the vicinity). Since the remaining 11.3% were scored either C (7.64%) or D (3.66%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), we considered candidates within the range A-D as valid candidates for endogenization. On the contrary, scaffolds annotated as F or X were rather considered as free-living viruses since they did not show eukaryotic genes or TE in their vicinity and had different coverage compared to BUSCO-containing scaffolds. Scaffolds classified as E were of unclear status and discarded. Capacity to find domesticated EVEs (dEVEs) An EVE was considered as domesticated if the <italic>dN/dS</italic> ratio was significantly below 1 or if TPM was above 1000.

Calibration of the root was done using a uniform law between 300 and 412 Mya. To verify that MCMC analyses converged to the same posterior distribution, for both steps we computed the effective sample size and applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using the package convenience v1.0.0 with a minimum ESS threshold of 100 (however, due to an excessive demand for resources, we were unable to achieve the sampling value of an ESS of a minimum of 100 for 46/389 parameters (min = 44.25)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Ancestral state reconstruction</title><p>To explore the dynamics of EVEs gain in relation to lifestyle, we first had to reconstruct the ancestral lifestyle states of the Hymenoptera used in this study.

Furthermore, a pairwise Wilcoxon test with p-values adjusted with the Bonferroni method revealed a significantly higher values of N50 and %complete + partial BUSCO in genome assemblies from free-living species compared to endo and ectoparasitoids species (p-value &lt;0.05). The same test using the total assembly length in bp did not reveal any difference between the three lifestyles (p-value &gt;0.05). Overall, free-living species have better assemblies. Because better assembly quality should facilitate the discovery of endogenous viral elements both by sequence homology detection and by a better assessment of the endogenized nature of the EVE (scaffolds A, B, C, and D), we should thus underestimate the number of EVEs in endo and ectoparasitoid species compared to free-living species.

The main conclusions of the manuscript, in particular regarding the link between endoparasitoidism and dsDNA virus endogenization and domestication, were consistently reached (see all statistical summaries of the Bayesian GLM models in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Summary statistics table for candidate EVEs.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85993-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>General information regarding the species used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85993-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Summary statistics table for control endogenous viral elements (EVEs).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85993-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Information for individual loci.</title><p>Endogenized loci (scoring from A to D) are displayed in the first sheet, whereas exogenous loci (from E to X) are displayed in the second sheet.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85993-supp4-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Table listing the names of virus species known to probably interact with insects.</title><p>The data is taken from the virushostdb database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mihara et al., 2016</xref>) (version of 24/03/2023), which lists a wide variety of virus species associated with their presumed hosts.

unravel how lifestyle modulates the acquisition and domestication of viral genetic elements in the genomes of hymenopteran insects.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Landry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers made excellent and very constructive comments that would greatly improve your manuscript. In particular, please address:</p><p>1) Lack of inclusion of genomic data from hymenopteran species made available after 2019.</p><p>2) Oversimplification of categorizing hymenopterans either as free-living, endoparasitoids, or ectoparasitoids and its impact on the results.</p><p>3) Examine the impact of the scoring system for EVE detection (Scaffold endogenization score).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please replace the use of &quot;Nb&quot; throughout the manuscript (is it meant to indicate &quot;number&quot;).</p><p>Line 104: are the authors referring to 13 EVE events or 13 EVE genes here? At this point, it would be good to include another example with EVE events enumerated so that readers can directly relate what's written to the numbers included in Figure 1. The given example is unverifiable without delving into the supplementary information.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>– The numbers listed in white boxes for the number of endogenization events do not seem to match with the number of EVEs plotted in the bar graph to the right. For example, how can Neodiprion leconti have 4 endogenization events but six EVEs from different virus families? Examination of the supplementary information makes it more clear that sometimes EVEs from different virus families are grouped together based on phylogenetic or genomic context. This should be stated early enough in the manuscript that readers don't get confused when trying to interpret Figure 1.</p><p>– The labels are very hard to see without using a magnified pdf viewer. I suggest that the journal moves the legend to the next page so that the figure can be printed larger.</p><p>– &quot;Campopleginae&quot; should be listed as &quot;Campopleginae sp&quot;. As written it suggests that this taxon represents the entire sub-family of wasps.</p><p>– The weight of the black line around the pie charts indicating shared endogenization events differs between charts. The line weight appears to have no meaning so would prevent confusion if they were consistent.</p><p>Line 118: Do the authors mean to say that 113 underwent more than or at least (&gt;) 1 endogenization event?</p><p>Line 126: It is mentioned that 12 endogenization events involved the integration of more than 4 viral genes. From Figure 1, I count 14 (Campopleginae sp, Venturia canescens, Fopius arisanus, Cotesia vestalis, Microplitis demolitor, three Leptopilina species, Platygaster orseoliae, Eurytoma brunniventris, Harpegnathos saltator, Pseudomyrmex gracilis, Aphaenogaster picea, Aprostocetus sp?). Which is correct?</p><p>Supplementary file 2 – when this file is opened in excel, the column headings are shifted so that they are not present in the correct column. Please define the headings in a separate tab or document – currently, it is very difficult to interpret the information within. Which column indicates domestication (or not)?</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>– In 2A, should an average/median &quot;+&quot; sign be present in the ssRNA column?</p><p>– In 2B, should IVSPERs be in orange?</p><p>– 2C, the numbers indicated don't make sense based on other results. Are the EVE numbers inclusive of dEVE numbers? Earlier in the results, it was stated that there are 12 events involving &gt;4 genes for dsDNA viruses. Is this figure depicting events or genes? Line 127 implies genes, and the figure legends and titles imply events.</p><p>– The reference to the &quot;excel tab&quot; information needs to be more explicit</p><p>Line 141 and 144: Is there conflicting information presented here about ssRNA viruses being &quot;under-represented&quot; and then &quot;over-represented&quot;? Where is the data presented to support these statements?</p><p>Figure 3: The colour in the legend is different from the colour in the figure for ectoparasitioids,</p><p>Figure 5: Where are the methods that were used to make this figure? It is surprising that 142 genes were used to make the alignment. What is the percentage of missing data for each taxon?</p><p>Line 242: After describing 139 convincing EVEs from P. orseoliae, then 44/89 are mentioned as presenting signs of domestication. Where does the denominator of 89 come from?</p><p>Line 255: Does AmFV have RNA polymerase subunits or just a single gene encoding the RNA polymerase? If the former, which subunit does AmFV_0047 encode?</p><p>Line 275: &quot;we will first discuss&quot;… &quot;a hypothesis for&quot; should be inserted here.</p><p>Line 510: &quot;transportable elements&quot; needs to be fixed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 117 – 118 – this sentence is unclear, please revise.</p><p>Figure 2 – I would advise adding grid lines to the plots. Now it is very difficult to see how high the bars go for certain lines (I had to use my ruler).</p><p>Line 152 – Looking at Figure 3A, it surprises me that ssDNA viruses are not underrepresented in endoparasitoid wasps. The observed percentage is half of the expected percentage.</p><p>Line 215 – 216 – is a gene-loss scenario not equally likely?</p><p>Figure 5 – what do the question marks exactly mean here?</p><p>Line 241 – this was on scaffolds of type A.

To further clarify this, we added a few sentences in this paragraph:</p><p>Lines 106-114</p><p>“As an example, let's consider the single endogenization event involving 13 EVEs that occurred in the common ancestor of <italic>Leptopilina</italic> species (Digiovanni et al., 2020). In this wasp genus, based on previous findings, we expect the 39 EVEs to be grouped into a single endogenization event. Our pipeline appropriately detected 36 EVEs (out of 39) and correctly aggregated them into a single endogenization event mapped on the branch leading to the <italic>Leptopilina</italic> genus. Thus, in Figure1 we can observe a pie chart at the node corresponding to the common ancestor of the three <italic>Leptopilina</italic> species <italic>L.boulardi</italic>, <italic>L.clavipes</italic> and <italic>L.heterotoma</italic>. Most of this pie chart is blue, which corresponds to the putative donor viral family, i.e., LbFV-like, and is surrounded by a black border, indicating that the genes involved are inferred as domesticated. The number of EVEs and dEVEs (n=12/13) for each of the 3 species is then plotted along the horizontal barplots with the same colour code (see Figure1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 for more canonical examples).” Additionally, another example is provided in the legend of Figure1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1:</p><p>– The numbers listed in white boxes for the number of endogenization events do not seem to match with the number of EVEs plotted in the bar graph to the right.

Examination of the supplementary information makes it more clear that sometimes EVEs from different virus families are grouped together based on phylogenetic or genomic context. This should be stated early enough in the manuscript that readers don't get confused when trying to interpret Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, we added a sentence at the very beginning of the result paragraph: “Since several EVEs may enter into the genome during a single endogenization event, we grouped into the same event EVEs that were localized in the same scaffold (only for viruses having similar genomic structure), and/or that derived from the same putative viral family.”.

The results were overall highly consistent with the previous analysis including only A,B,C and D scores. In particular, we do find the same main result as before: the number of Events and dEvents involving dsDNA viruses is significantly higher in endoparasitoids compared to freeliving species. This conclusion was reached with the whole dataset, and also when we focused on dsDNA viruses (with or without including the controls).</p><p>In this respect, we added a few lines at the end of the Material and Method section “Test of the lifestyle effect on viral endogenization and domestication” to discuss the impact of this scoring system on our conclusions. We also complemented the violin plots Figure 4—figure supplement 1 which now contains the GLM coefficients distribution of the model run using scaffolds scored as A only, A to D, and A to F.

This concerned the “Double-stranded DNA viruses are over-represented in endogenization events” section of the paper. We initially used virushostdb complemented with two recent papers (Wu et al., 2020 and Shi et al., 2016) to estimate the virus distribution in insects, in particular according to their genomic structure. However, the two additional papers used were only focusing on RNA viruses, thus biasing the analysis. Therefore, we corrected this mistake by only including data from the virushostdb. The conclusions remained unchanged: dsDNA viruses were much more endogenized compared to their relative abundance in insect species, while ssRNA viruses were under-represented. We took this opportunity to also test whether the distribution of viruses in Hymenoptera was similar to that found in the whole insect class. This was the case (chi^2 = 6.4, df=3, pvalue=0.09). We changed accordingly the values in the main manuscript (lines 147-152), modified the material and methods (lines 694-706), and the supplementary files 5 and 6.</p><p>– In line 467 we used to indicate the smallest EVE size found in the controls instead of indicating the average size which is much more informative compared to the minimum N50 value. Therefore, we changed as : “Although some genomes were highly fragmented (such as the 32 genomes we generated since they were obtained using short reads only), the N50 values (min: 3542bp) were equal to or larger than the expected sizes of genes known to be endogenized and domesticated (average size = 1244,4 bp (sd=1105bp)) indicating that most of the putative EVEs should be detected entirely.”</p><p>– We added two supplementary source data files including all clusters alignments for two analysis : Figure 1–source data 1 including all aligned cluster sequences scored from A to X and Figure 5–source data 1 including all aligned cluster sequences included in the <italic>Naldaviricetes</italic> phylogenetic analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
