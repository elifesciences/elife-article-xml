Here, we analyze their functional divergence using cellular co-culture assays, biochemical studies, and in vivo experiments. DLL1 and DLL4 activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 differently in cell-based assays and this discriminating potential lies in the region between the N-terminus and EGF repeat three. Mice expressing chimeric ligands indicate that the ectodomains dictate ligand function during somitogenesis, and that during myogenesis even regions C-terminal to EGF3 are interchangeable. Substitution of NOTCH1-interface residues in the MNNL and DSL domains of DLL1 with the corresponding amino acids of DLL4, however, does not disrupt DLL1 function in vivo. Collectively, our data show that DLL4 preferentially activates NOTCH1 over NOTCH2, whereas DLL1 is equally effective in activating NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, establishing that the ectodomains dictate selective ligand function in vivo, and that features outside the known binding interface contribute to their differences.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40045.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A small number of signaling systems control how an animal develops from a single cell into a complex organism made up of many different cell types. Signals pass back and forth between cells, switching genes on and off to direct the development of tissues and organs. One of these signaling systems, called Notch, is so ancient that it appears in nearly all multicellular organisms.</p><p>A cell sends a Notch signal using proteins called Delta or Jagged ligands that span membrane of the cell, so that part of the protein sits inside the cell and part remains outside. To change the behavior of another cell, the ligands bind to proteins called Notch receptors that span the membrane of the receiving cell.</p><p>Mammals have two types of Delta ligand, two types of Jagged ligand and four types of Notch receptor. Cells in different tissues display different combinations of these eight proteins. Two Delta ligands called DLL1 and DLL4 often appear together in developing organisms. Some tissues need both and some only the one or the other. In some cases one ligand can compensate if the other is missing, but in others not. It was not clear why this is, or which parts of the proteins are responsible.</p><p>Tveriakhina et al. used mouse cells to investigate how DLL1 and DLL4 interact with two Notch receptors, called NOTCH1 and NOTCH2. The results of these experiments show that while DLL1 can bind and activate both Notch receptors equally, DLL4 prefers to partner with NOTCH1. To find out which parts of the ligands are responsible for this selectivity, Tveriakhina et al. created hybrid ligands that contained a mixture of regions from DLL1 and DLL4. These suggest that the different binding preferences depend on parts of the ligands that sit outside cells and that lie outside the known sites of binding contact with the Notch receptors.</p><p>Further experiments studied mice that had been engineered to produce hybrid ligands as replacements for DLL1. A hybrid ligand consisting of the part of DLL1 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL4 found inside cells generated Notch signals in the tissue that depended on the activity of DLL1. However, a hybrid consisting of the part of DLL4 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL1 found inside cells did not, showing that in developing mice the parts that sit outside the cells contribute to the different functions of DLL1 and DLL4.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Tveriakhina et al. show that interactions between specific ligands and receptors play important roles in how mammals develop. Further efforts to understand which parts of the ligands affect selectivity could ultimately allow researchers to develop ways to modify how ligands and receptors interact. Such “molecular engineering” strategies could enable cell responses to be precisely controlled by pairing designer ligand-receptor pairs to develop cell-based therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DLL1</kwd><kwd>DLL4</kwd><kwd>notch receptor selectivity</kwd><kwd>functional divergence</kwd><kwd>ectodomain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>van Maanen Graduate fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarrett</surname><given-names>Sanchez M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-CA220340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blacklow</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GO 449/13-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gossler</surname><given-names>Achim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REBIRTH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gossler</surname><given-names>Achim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regions outside the major receptor binding interface of DLL1 and DLL4 contribute to context-dependent divergence of ligand function in vivo and differential Notch1 and Notch2 activation in vitro.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Notch signaling pathway mediates communication between neighboring cells in metazoans and thereby regulates a multitude of developmental processes in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoon and Gaiano, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolós et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gridley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Radtke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch and Radtke, 2011</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopan, 2012</xref>). This communication depends on the interaction of Notch receptors on the surface of the signal receiving cells with transmembrane ligands on the surface of adjacent cells. Ligand binding then leads to a sequence of proteolytic cleavages of the receptor releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane. NICD translocates into the nucleus where it enters into a complex with a CSL protein (<underline>C</underline>BF-1/RBPJ in mammals, <underline>S</underline>uppressor of Hairless in flies, and <underline>L</underline>ag-1 in worms) and a protein of the Mastermind family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petcherski and Kimble, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wilson and Kovall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2012</xref>) to regulate transcription of target genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bray, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mammals have four Notch receptors (N1-N4) and four activating ligands of the DSL (<underline>D</underline>elta, <underline>S</underline>errate, <underline>L</underline>AG-2) family: DLL1 and DLL4, orthologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Delta, and JAG1 and JAG2, orthologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Serrate. DLL1 and DLL4 are similar in domain structure, size and sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shutter et al., 2000</xref>). Both proteins contain an N-terminal MNNL (also referred to as C2) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chillakuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suckling et al., 2017</xref>), followed by a DSL domain and eight EGF-like repeats in their extracellular portion, and a less well conserved intracellular domain. The MNNL and DSL domains, required for high-affinity binding of Delta-like ligands to Notch receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rebay et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cordle et al., 2008</xref>), contact EGF repeats 12 and 11 of Notch, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luca et al., 2015</xref>). Contributions from adjacent EGF-like repeats, however, are required for signal transduction by Delta-like ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>) as well as for optimal interaction with Serrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>) and Jagged (JAG)-family ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luca et al., 2017</xref>). Although the biological activities of DLL1 and DLL4 are partially overlapping, the two proteins are not equivalent in vitro or in vivo. In cell culture studies, DLL4 is more effective than DLL1 in activating N1 signaling during T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besseyrias et al., 2007</xref>), consistent with its ten-fold higher binding affinity in binding studies using purified fragments of N1, DLL1, and DLL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>). In vivo, studies of adult intestinal epithelium in mice have shown that DLL1 and DLL4 are co-expressed in crypts and act redundantly to maintain the intestinal stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pellegrinet et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, however, mouse DLL1 cannot fully replace DLL4 in its ability to trigger T lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besseyrias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohtashami et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, endogenous DLL4 does not substitute for DLL1 in its ability to promote development of the arterial vascular epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sörensen et al., 2009</xref>), nor does it compensate for the function of DLL1 in the paraxial mesoderm, a tissue where these ligands are normally not co-expressed: mice in which DLL1 was replaced by DLL4 had severe somite patterning defects and showed premature myogenic differentiation leading to reduced skeletal muscles. However, the function of DLL1 during early retina development was rescued by DLL4 in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuße et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Collectively these studies indicate that the functionality of DLL1 and DLL4 strongly depends on context, but it remains unclear which portions of these similar DSL proteins account for their functional non-equivalence. A recent study in cell culture observed that DLL1 and DLL4 stimulate NOTCH1 receptors to produce responses with different dynamics, attributing differences between pulsatile signaling of DLL1 and sustained signaling by DLL4 to the intracellular, rather than the extracellular, regions of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nandagopal et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we investigate the influence of the extracellular and intracellular regions of DLL1 and DLL4 chimeric proteins on ligand function in cell culture assays, and for selected chimeras, in biochemical binding assays and in vivo in mice. We observe that in vivo differences of DLL1 and DLL4 function during somite patterning and myogenesis are encoded by the ligands ectodomains, that DLL1 and DLL4 are able to discriminate between NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in vitro, and that ligand residues outside of the known binding interface are important contributing factors for ligand function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The extracellular domain dominates ligand function during somitogenesis</title><p>Previous in vivo analyses indicated that DLL4 cannot substitute for DLL1 function during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuße et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether the inability of DLL4 to rescue the loss of DLL1 in the paraxial mesoderm in vivo resides in its extra- or intracellular domain we generated single copy transgenic mice allowing for the conditional expression of chimeric DLL molecules consisting of the extracellular domain of one ligand and transmembrane and intracellular domain of the other (D1<italic>ECD</italic>_D4<italic>ICD</italic> and D4<italic>ECD</italic>_D1<italic>ICD</italic>, II and VII in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The N1/N2 response ratios show that swapping the contact residues of DLL4 onto DLL1 do not substantially affect the activation ratio when compared to DLL1 itself, indicating that the differences between DLL1 and DLL4 in N1/N2 selectivity cannot simply be accounted for by interfacial residues in the MNNL-DSL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; numerical values used for calculations are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). Similarly, replacement of the DLL4 contact residues by the analogous residues of DLL1 slightly reduces the mean N1/N2 activation ratio (to ~13), but does not collapse the ratio to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), again strongly suggesting that residues outside of the MNNL-DSL contact interface contribute to the relative N1 selectivity of DLL4. These results are consistent with 1) the domain swap data, which argue that discrimination between DLL1 and DLL4 depends on the EGF repeats as well as on the MNNL-DSL region, and 2) the prior observation that variants of DLL4 selected for high N1 affinity accumulate mutations in the protein core, but not in the binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luca et al., 2015</xref>). Swapping the contact residues of DLL1 onto DLL4 did not reduce the binding affinity of DLL4 for N1 (D4contD1 K<sub>D</sub> = 0.327 ± 0.036 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2Ac</xref>), fully consistent with the interpretation that the protein core of DLL4 contributes to N1 binding affinity, likely by influencing the fraction of molecules in a binding-active conformation.

This resembles intrinsic functional differences that reside in the extracellular domains of mN1 and mN2 during kidney development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), whereas the N1 and N2 ICDs appear to be functionally equivalent in various developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Functional equivalence of DLL1’s and DLL4’s ICDs in vivo is further supported by the rescue of the skeletal muscle phenotype in our D1<italic>N-E3</italic>_D4 knock-in mice, which harbor the DLL4 ICD. In this developmental context even domains C-terminal to EGF3 of DLL1 appear to be interchangeable. Analyses of the ECD/ICD domain swaps in the cell-based assay also suggest that the discriminatory potential of the ligands tracks with the ECD, and not with the ICD, even though the ICD appears to affect the strength and/or dynamics of the signal in co-culture assays where ligand and receptor expression is enforced in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nandagopal et al., 2018</xref>). Additional sources of complexity in vivo, like the stronger cis-inhibitory potential of the DLL4 ECD on Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuße et al., 2015</xref>), or cyclic modulation of Notch by LFNG in the paraxial mesoderm, or different interactions with lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suckling et al., 2017</xref>) might account for the resistance to loss of function phenotypes from ligand ICD swaps in vivo.</p><p>EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of mouse N1 and N2 are highly similar (56/83 residues identical, 14 similar amino acids), and 13 of the 17 amino acid residues at the DLL4-binding interface are identical. Moreover, the x-ray structures of the EGF11-13 fragments of human N1 and N2 adopt a very similar arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suckling et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, DLL1 and DLL4 exhibit a &quot;discrimination potential&quot; of ~20 fold in terms of receptor response in culture assays, suggesting that either the few different contact amino acids in EGF 11 and 12 of N1 and N2 have a significant impact or interactions of DLL1 and DLL4 with N1 and N2 are not limited to the MNNL and DSL interfaces with receptor EGF repeats 11 and 12. Domain swaps carried out here show that the region responsible for this receptor discrimination maps to the MNNL-EGF3 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings are consistent with previous work uncovering the requirement of EGF repeats 1–3 of the DLL ligands for NOTCH1 activation, the importance of this region in the binding of Serrate family ligands to Notch receptors and in Serrate/Jagged-induced signaling, and the importance of EGF repeats 8–10 of NOTCH1 for signal activation by DLL ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shimizu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cordle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luca et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Together, this body of work suggests that interactions of the N-terminal EGF repeats of the DLL ligands with EGF repeats 8–10 of Notch also contribute to recognition and impart discriminatory potential. The D1<italic>N-E3</italic>_D4 knock-in mice also point a functional role for domains outside the known binding interface, since this chimeric ligand does not substitute fully for DLL1 in vivo during somite patterning despite harboring the MNNL and DSL domains and EGF1-3 of DLL1, supporting context-dependent contributions of additional C-terminal EGF repeats observed previously in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, the exchange of the contact amino acids in DLL1 with those of DLL4 in the D1contD4 protein does not alter receptor selectivity in cultured cells even though these changes increase N1 binding affinity. This result suggests that receptor selectivity of DLL1 and DLL4 is not determined exclusively by the differences in binding strength. The D1contD4 chimera even substitutes almost completely for DLL1 function in mice during somite patterning, which is highly sensitive to altered Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2009</xref>) and therefore a suitable in vivo read out to detect even minor differences of Notch ligand function. Together, our results also favor the conclusion that the contact amino acids in the MNNL and DSL domains do not make the dominant contributions to the functional divergence of DLL1 and DLL4 in vivo,

The cDNAs for expression of DLL1, DLL4, and all chimeric proteins extend from the N-terminus through EGF5. These proteins were also subcloned into pLexM as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>).

The media was collected, separated from the cells by centrifugation and supplemented with 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0.

After a wash with ten column volumes of 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 mM Imidazole, bound protein was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 250 mM Imidazole. Following elution, fractions containing the partially purified proteins were concentrated and further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The quality of the resulting purified proteins was assessed using non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Pure fractions were pooled, flash frozen and stored at −80° C.

For N1 binding, streptavidin biosensors were loaded with the biotinylated Notch1 fragment, equilibrated in buffer for 30 s, then dipped into ligand samples of varying concentration until equilibrium was observed. For N2 binding, protein A biosensors were used for the capture step. All ligand-receptor binding experiments were done in HBS-P buffer containing 0.005% surfactant P20, supplemented with 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.

The authors describe structure-function analyses, and functional divergence, of the Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4, using in vivo as well as in vitro techniques. The authors conclude that the DLL1 and DLL4 proteins activate the Notch1 and Notch2 receptors differently. DLL4 consistently activated NOTCH1 significantly better than DLL1, and DLL4 stimulated Notch2 significantly less efficiently than DLL1.To identify the domains of DLL1 and DLL4 that contributed to the observed differences in activating Notch1 and Notch2, domain swaps to generate a set of chimeric DLL1/DLL4 ligands was performed. These experiments revealed that the differences in activation potential of DLL4 and DLL1 toward Notch1 and Notch2 are encoded in the N-terminal part of the protein, comprising the MNNL-EGF3 domains, but also with a contribution from the third EGF repeat. This is interesting, as these regions lie outside the established receptor-ligand interaction domains.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Abstract the authors state, &quot;Collectively, our data show that DLL4 and DLL1 preferentially activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, respectively,&quot;; however, the N1/N2 ratio data in Figure 5A suggest that DLL1 has no preference for Notch1 over Notch2.

The authors demonstrate that, in cell based co-culture assays, the DLL1 and DLL4 proteins activate the NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 receptors differently. They generated mouse NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 reporter ES cell lines by integrating a Notch luciferase reporter in the Hprt locus of mouse E14TG2a ES (E14) cells, thus generating stable mN1 (N1rep) or mN2 (N2rep) reporter lines. These reporter lines were then co-cultured with ES cells with single copy integrations into the Hprt locus of the DLL1 or DLL4 coding sequences. Performing careful controls for total protein and cell surface protein expression levels, they showed that all DLL4 clones consistently activated N1 significantly better than all DLL1 clones, and all DLL4 clones stimulated mN2 significantly less efficiently than DLL1. To identify the domains of DLL1 and DLL4 that contributed to the observed differences in activating NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, they performed a series of domain swaps to generate a set of chimeric DLL1/DLL4 ligands. These experiments revealed that the differences in activation potential of DLL4 and DLL1 toward N1 and N2 are encoded in the N-terminal part of the protein, comprising the MNNL-EGF3 domains. Additional experiments showed that the third EGF repeat made an important contribution to receptor selectivity.</p><p>The authors then analyzed the importance of the amino acids that contact N1 in the binding interfaces of the MNNL and DSL domains in NOTCH receptor selectivity. In a series of biochemical experiments, the authors showed that swapping the contact residues of DLL4 onto DLL1 did not substantially affect Notch receptor activation compared to wildtype DLL1. Replacement of the DLL4 contact residues by the analogous residues of DLL1 slightly affected Notch receptor activation, but did not approach the activity difference of wildtype DLL1.</p><p>For in vivo analyses, the authors utilized a sophisticated genetic model system in which transgenes encoding chimeric DLL1/DLL4 ligands were introduced into the Hprt locus of E14 ES cells in a manner that requires Cre recombinase expression to permit expression of the chimeric ligand. Simultaneously, endogenous wildtype DLL1 expression was removed using a floxed Dll1 allele and a Cre driver (T(s):Cre) expressed in the primitive streak driven by a promoter derived from brachyury (T) locus. These experiments demonstrated that the extracellular domains of the DLL1 and DLL4 ligands regulated ligand function during somite formation. The authors then tested a chimeric ligand that contained the N-terminal region up to and including EGF3 of DLL1 fused to EGF4 and the remaining C-terminal portion of DLL4. Mice homozygous for this allele (and lacking the wildtype Dll1 allele) were still born and exhibited substantial axial skeletal defects, indicating that this chimeric allele cannot fully replace wildtype DLL1 function during development.</p><p>These experiments, as is characteristic of all the work from the Gossler and Blacklow laboratories, are carefully controlled, extremely thorough, and very convincing. This paper makes an important contribution to the literature on structure/function analysis of the Notch ligands.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors submit an interesting and compelling manuscript that focuses on using different in vivo and cellular assays to characterize the functional differences between Dll1 and Dll4. The work is of high quality and the manuscript is well written. Moreover, their findings address an important area of Notch signaling and biology in general, and impact other recent publications that characterize functional differences between Dll1/4. If the authors were to address my relatively minor comments summarized below, I would recommend their manuscript to be published <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In the Abstract the authors state, &quot;Collectively, our data show that DLL4 and DLL1 preferentially activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, respectively,&quot;; however, the N1/N2 ratio data in Figure 5A suggest that DLL1 has no preference for Notch1 over Notch2.

The in vivo evidence is strong and they nicely demonstrate context dependent contributions of Notch ligand extracellular EGF repeats in vivo. They further demonstrate, although the data raise some concerns, that Dll1 and Dll4 ligands exhibit different receptor selectivity and discriminate between Notch1 and Notch2 receptors and that this is caused by differences in ligand ECD domains outside the established receptor-ligand interaction domains (contact domains). The paper is well written, clear and concise. The data is well presented and for the most part support the conclusions. The work provides novel insight into the receptor-ligand interphase and presents protein regions that contribute to functional divergence of ligands and warrants publication, provided the authors address the concerns raised.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40045.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Abstract the authors state, &quot;Collectively, our data show that DLL4 and DLL1 preferentially activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, respectively,&quot;; however, the N1/N2 ratio data in Figure 5A suggest that DLL1 has no preference for Notch1 over Notch2.

However, because anti-DLL1 antibodies were used to detect endogenous DLL1, and anti-DLL4 antibodies to detect the chimeric ligand (as indicated in the panels of Figure 3C), which cannot be detected using the anti-DLL1 antibodies, the protein levels cannot be compared based on differences in staining intensity because the antibodies are different.</p><p>In addition, we have corrected spelling/formatting mistakes and errors, updated legends and references to figures, figure supplements and source data files, included the Key Resources Table and a statement concerning mycoplasma tests and cell line authentication in the Materials and methods section, and made other changes requested by the editorial support team (supplementary files changed to figure supplements, file type changes, adjustment of nomenclature, added information in the Materials and methods section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
