premutation-associated conditions including tremor/ataxia syndrome, a late-onset neurodegenerative disease and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency. One common pathomechanism of these conditions is the repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation of CGG repeats of mutant <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, resulting in production of FMRpolyG, a toxic protein containing long polyglycine tract. To identify novel modifiers of RAN translation we used an RNA-tagging system and mass spectrometry-based screening. It revealed proteins enriched on CGGexp-containing <italic>FMR1</italic> RNA in cellulo, including a ribosomal protein RPS26, a component of the 40 S subunit. We demonstrated that depletion of RPS26 and its chaperone TSR2, modulates FMRpolyG production and its toxicity. We also found that the RPS26 insufficiency impacted translation of limited number of proteins, and 5’UTRs of mRNAs encoding these proteins were short and guanosine and cytosine-rich. Moreover, <italic>the</italic> silencing of another component of the 40 S subunit, the ribosomal protein RPS25, also induced repression of FMRpolyG biosynthesis. Results of this study suggest that the two 40 S ribosomal proteins and chaperone TSR2 play an important role in noncanonical CGGexp-related RAN translation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FMR1</kwd><kwd>unstable CGG repeats</kwd><kwd>expansion of triplet repeats</kwd><kwd>polyglycine</kwd><kwd>ribosomal heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>near-cognate start codon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Polish National Science Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019/35/D/NZ2/02158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baud</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Polish National Science Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020/38/A/NZ3/00498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sobczak</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101003385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baud</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Initiative of Excellence–Research University at Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>140/04/POB2/0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baud</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016906</institution-id><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholarship for the best PhD Students</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tutak</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of ribosomal proteins RPS26 and RPS25, along with chaperone TSR2, as new important modifiers in the noncanonical translation process linked to fragile X premutation disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fragile X chromosome-associated syndromes are rare genetic diseases caused by dynamic mutations of the <italic>fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1</italic> (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene located on the X chromosome. The gene typically contains 25–30 CGG repeats in the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR). However, these triplet repeats are highly polymorphic and prone to expand, resulting in either a full mutation (FM; over 200 CGG repeats) or premutation (PM; 55–200 CGG repeats). On the molecular level, FM causes methylation of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter, leading to transcriptional silencing, loss of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, and a lack of the main protein product, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), which is involved in modulating synaptic plasticity. An FM causes early onset neurodevelopmental fragile X syndrome (FXS), while PM is linked to many fragile X-associated conditions (FXPAC) including fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), and fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND). The estimated prevalence of PM is 1 in 150–300 females and 1 in 400–850 males. However, due to incomplete penetrance, approximately 1 in 5000–10,000 men in their fifties or later will develop FXTAS. In female PM carriers, random X-inactivation lowers the risk of FXTAS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagerman and Hagerman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tassone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacquemont et al., 2004</xref>). FXTAS is a late-onset neurodegenerative disease. Its pathology includes neuropathy, white matter loss, mild brain atrophy, and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagerman and Hagerman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greco et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greco et al., 2006</xref>). Patients suffer from cognitive decline, dementia, parkinsonism, imbalance, gait ataxia, and tremors accompanied by psychological difficulties such as anxiety or depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagerman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagerman and Hagerman, 2016</xref>). To date, no effective treatment targeting the cause, rather than the symptoms, has been proposed for any PM-linked disorders.</p><p>Three main molecular pathomechanisms are believed to contribute to FXTAS, FXPOI, and FXAND development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glineburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagerman et al., 2018</xref>). First, high-content guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> cause co-transcriptional DNA:RNA hybrid formations (R-loops), which trigger the DNA damage response, thus compromising genomic stability, leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loomis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Diab et al., 2018</xref>). Second, RNA gain-of-function toxicity induces nuclear foci formation by mRNA containing expanded CGG repeats (CGGexp) which form stable hairpin structures, and sequester proteins leading to their functional depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sellier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sellier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sellier et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, mRNA containing CGGexp can act as a template for noncanonical protein synthesis called repeats-associated non-AUG initiated (RAN) translation. Protein production from expanded nucleotide repeats is initiated at different near-cognate start codons in diverse reading frames. The resultant toxic proteins contain repeated amino acid tracts, such as polyglycine (FMRpolyG), polyalanine (FMRpolyA), polyarginine (FMRpolyR), or hybrids of them produced as a result of frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Todd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wright et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glineburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kearse et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, the open reading frame for FMRP starting from the AUG codon downstream to the repeats is canonically synthesized. In FXTAS and FXPOI, the most abundant RAN protein is the toxic FMRpolyG, which aggregates and forms characteristic intranuclear or perinuclear inclusions observed in patient cells and model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greco et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Todd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sellier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derbis et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>According to the current RAN translation model of RNA with CGGexp, the eIF4F complex and 43 S pre-initiation complex (PIC) bind to the 5’-cap of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA and scan through the 5’UTR until encountering a steric hindrance, a hairpin structure formed by CGGexp, or a nearby 5’UTR sequence. This blockage increases the dwell time of PIC and lowers initiation codon fidelity. As a result, the stalled 40 S ribosome initiates RAN translation at less favored, near-cognate start codons (ACG or GUG) upstream of repeats (in the FMRpolyG reading frame) or within CGG repeats (in the FMRpolyA reading frame; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kearse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al., 2016</xref>). Unwinding stable RNA secondary structures appears to be crucial for initiating RAN translation, as several RNA helicases such as ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X, ATP-dependent DNA/RNA helicase DHX36, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4 A (eIF4A) are involved in its regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linsalata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kearse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tseng et al., 2021</xref>). Proteins indirectly involved in RAN translation can also contribute to RAN-mediated toxicity via pathways related to stress response and nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malik et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p>New insights into ribosome heterogeneity have explained rearrangements within ribosome components at different developmental stages or responses to environmental stimuli. This has led to a better understanding of events that shape local ribosome homeostasis and affect the translatome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Genuth and Barna, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi and Barna, 2015</xref>). For example, although ribosomes depleted of small ribosomal subunit protein eS26 (RPS26) stays functional in the cell, they are translating preferentially selected mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Karbstein, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, ribosomes containing small ribosomal subunit protein eS25 (RPS25) and Large ribosomal subunit protein uL1 RPL10A translate different pools of mRNA including those encoding key components of cell cycle process, metabolism, and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recently, different proteins involved in RAN translation regulation reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baud et al., 2022</xref> were uncovered. However, mechanistic insight into this process remains unresolved. Given the toxicity of RAN translation products, identification of its regulating factors, which may serve as potential therapeutic targets to combat RAN proteins-related toxicity in fragile X-associated conditions, is essential.</p><p>In this study, we adapted an RNA-tagging technique to identify proteins natively bound to the RNA of the 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> with CGGexp that mimics mutated transcripts in PM carriers. Among tens of identified proteins, we focused on the RPS26 and investigated its involvement in CGGexp-related RAN translation. Previously, it was shown that RPS26 can interact with mRNA associated with PIC and regulate the translation of selected transcripts depending on their sequence, 5’UTR’s length, and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Karbstein, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pisarev et al., 2008</xref>). By regulating RPS26 at the cellular level and its incorporation into the assembling 40 S subunit mediated by escortin TSR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Karbstein, 2022</xref>), we found that insufficiency of this ribosomal protein has negative effect on the level and toxicity of FMRpolyG with no impact on encoding mRNA and FMRP. As FMRP is the primary protein product of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, it indicates that RPS26 depletion selectively modulates CGG-related RAN translation. Furthermore, by using a proteomic approach, we found that the number of proteins sensitive to RPS26 insufficiency was limited.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mass-spectrometry-based screening revealed numerous proteins interacting with the 5’UTR of FMR1 mRNA</title><p>To uncover new modifiers of CGGexp-related RNA toxicity, we used an RNA-tagging method coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) that allows for the in cellulo capture and identification of native RNA-protein complexes. The RNA bait, <italic>FMR1 RNA</italic> (used to pull down interacting proteins) consisted of the entire sequence of the 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic>, which contained expanded, 99-times repeated, CGG tracts tagged with three times repeated MS2 RNA stem-loop aptamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These aptamers did not affect the RAN translation process as the synthesis of FMRpolyG was initiated from the near-cognate ACG start codon located upstream to CGGexp and terminated upstream to the MS2 aptamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We applied a label-free quantification analysis, which allowed us to elucidate 32 significantly enriched interactors of <italic>FMR1 RNA</italic> compared to <italic>GC-rich RNA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Next, we preselected eight proteins based on their biological function and possible role in modulating translation, and using short interfering RNA (siRNA)-based silencing, we investigated the effect of insufficiency of these proteins on the level of toxic FMRpolyG, which could indicate their role in modulating RAN translation. These experiments were conducted in HEK293T cells transiently expressing FMRpolyG containing 99 glycine residues tagged with GFP, named FMR99xG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Silencing of mRNA encoding for the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX15 and RPS26, but not six other analyzed proteins, resulted in a significant decrease in steady-state level of FMR99xG, with no effect on its mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, using other reporter system expressing polyglycine protein from short CGG repeats (16xCGG) fused with nanoluciferase tag, we showed that partial knock down of RPS26 resulted in significant FMRpolyG downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This indicates that the impact of RPS26 insufficiency on polyglycine level is independent of CGG repeat length, type of reporter used, and that even partial silencing of RPS26 is sufficient to significantly decrease RAN translation from <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA.</p><p>We also investigated whether RPS26 depletion affected the efficiency of FMRpolyG aggregates formation and cell toxicity. In HeLa cells transiently expressing FMR99xG, the frequency of GFP-positive aggregates was reduced upon RPS26 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, cells with depleted RPS26 exhibited significantly lower apoptosis tendencies evoked by toxic FMRpolyG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results suggest that decreasing level of RPS26 helps to alleviate FXPAC-related phenotype in cell models.</p><p>An orthogonal biochemical assay was used to confirm coprecipitation of RPS26 with the 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic>. We applied an in vitro RNA-protein pull-down using three biotinylated RNAs: 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> with 99xCGG repeats, synthetic RNA with 23xCGG repeats, and GC-rich RNA as a control. All three RNAs were incubated with an extract derived from HEK293T cells. The first two RNAs, but not GC-rich RNA, were enriched with RPS26, however, the anticipated interaction between RNAs containing CGG repeats and RPS26 was not solely dependent on the triplet number, as RPS26 was pulled down with similar efficiency by RNAs containing more or fewer repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In sum, we identified 32 proteins enriched on mutant <italic>FMR1 RNA</italic>. RPS26 and DHX15 insufficiency hindered FMR99xG RAN translation efficiency in a transient expression system. Notably, among proteins identified in the screening there were the ATP-dependent RNA helicase (DDX3X)—the protein previously described as RAN translation modifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linsalata et al., 2019</xref>), and the Src-associated in mitosis 68 kDa protein (SAM68)—the splicing factor sequestered on RNA containing CGGexp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sellier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Identified interactors can be involved not only in RAN translation, but potentially also in different metabolic processes of mutant <italic>FMR1</italic> RNA, such as transcription, protein sequestration, RNA transport, localization, and stability. Importantly, our data showed that silencing of RPS26 alleviated the pathogenic effect of toxic FMRpolyG produced from <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA containing CGGexp.

Similarly, the FMRP level was not affected by RPS26 depletion in other cell models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results imply that although the presence of RPS26 in 40 S subunit has a positive effect on RAN translation of FMRpolyG and other previously identified RPS26 responders, it does not affect the canonical translation of FMRP produced from the same mRNA. Moreover, a lack of significant differences in translation efficiency of long and short polyglycine-containing proteins in cells with insufficiency of RPS26 suggests that observed effect may depend on certain RNA sequences or structures within the 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA or other features of this mRNA, rather than the CGG repeat length.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RPS26 depletion affects only a small subset of the human proteome</title><p>To assess globally which proteins are sensitive to RPS26 insufficiency, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC).

For instance, if the 43 S recognizes the start codon, the RPS26 contacts position −4 from the start codon in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>) and from −11 up to −16 of attached mRNA in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>).

We investigated sequences containing 5’UTRs and coding sequences (CDSs) close to the start codon of mRNAs encoding positive and negative RPS26 responders. We used the total human transcriptome, named background (BG; N=22,160), as a reference. We did not observe any significant differences in the frequency of individual nucleotide positions in the 20-nucleotide vicinity of the start codon relative to the expected distribution in the BG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 9</xref>). However, we identified a significantly higher GC content in the 5’UTR sequences in the positive and negative responder groups relative to the BG at all analyzed positions from −6 to −30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Although the difference in the GC content in CDSs of responders relative to the BG was much smaller than for the 5’UTRs, we observed a significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) GC content in the close vicinity of the start AUG codon at upstream positions from +9 up to +14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, when we applied more stringent selection criteria (p&lt;0.01), the number of analyzed transcripts was significantly reduced (positive responders; N=42, negative responders; N=54), but the GC richness appeared to be more predominant for mRNAs encoding negative RPS26 responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, we found that 5’UTRs of proteins encoding positive and negative RPS26 responders were significantly shorter in comparison to reference represented by 1000 randomly selected transcripts from the complete human transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Although bioinformatic analyses did not reveal any importance of position −4 from the start codon in any group of RPS26 responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), we experimentally verified whether changes in this position in human cells would affect RAN translation initiation.

To further investigate importance of codon selection by RPS26, we simultaneously knocked down RPS26 and delivered short antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) blocker targeting ACG codon to cells expressing FMRpolyG.

We did not see any importance of A or G in –4 position from ACG initiation codon on FMRpolyG biosynthesis in cells having or lacking RPS26; however, we provided the evidence that cells with downregulated RPS26 display near-cognate start codon selection regulatory properties.

Currently, some RAN translation modifiers of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA have been described. For instance, RNA helicases such as DDX3X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linsalata et al., 2019</xref>) or DHX36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tseng et al., 2021</xref>), and others extensively reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baud et al., 2022</xref> have been identified as affecting CGG repeats-related RAN translation by facilitating ribosomal scanning via unwinding the structured RNA. Components of the endoplasmic reticulum ER-resident kinase (PERK) signaling pathway were shown to modulate RAN translation under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Green et al., 2017</xref>), and the activity of another kinase, SRPK1, retains mutated <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA containing CGGexp in the nucleus blocking its transport to the cytoplasm and subsequent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2021a</xref>). Recently, it was demonstrated that RAN translation activates ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, which prevents accumulation of RAN misfolded proteins by ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tseng et al., 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, mechanistic insights into RAN translation remain elusive.</p><p>Our research aimed to reveal proteins coprecipitating with the 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA containing expanded CGG repeats and discover novel modifiers of CGGexp-related RAN translation.

Some identified proteins overlapped with ones already described as binding to mutant <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA such as SRPK1 or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malik et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosario et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sellier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cid-Samper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sellier et al., 2017</xref>). Further, we described three new modifiers of RAN translation of this mRNA. Depletion of DHX15 helicase and two components of the 40 S subunit, RPS26 and RPS25, significantly decreased FMRpolyG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). Importantly, silencing RPS26 alleviated the aggregation phenotype and slowed the apoptosis process caused by FMRpolyG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E&amp;F</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, the presence or absence of Rps26 in the ribosomal structure leads to the expression of different protein pools influencing temporal protein homeostasis in response to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Karbstein, 2022</xref>). For instance, high-salt and high-pH stress induce the release of Rps26 from mature ribosomes by its chaperone Tsr2, enabling the translation of mRNAs engaged in stress response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Karbstein, 2022</xref>). A previous study indicated that RAN translation in human cells is selectively enhanced by activating stress pathways in a feed-forward loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Green et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, differences in concentration of ribosomal components may influence FMRpolyG production under certain stress conditions.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, RPS26 is involved in stress responses, however on the contrary to yeast model, RPS26 remains associated to the ribosome under energy stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>). It was demonstrated that cells with mutated C-terminus of RPS26 were more resistant to glucose starvation, than the wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, RPS26 was shown to be involved in other cellular processes such as the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2014</xref>), activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>) and cellular lineage differentiation by preferential translation of certain transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piantanida et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>). We evaluated global changes in the human cellular proteome under RPS26 depletion and found that the expression level was significantly changed in approximately 20% of human proteins, while most proteins’ expression levels remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 7</xref>). This suggests that many proteins, including FMRP, are not negatively affected by depleting RPS26, although FMRpolyG biosynthesis appears to be RPS26 level-sensitive. Our observation aligns well with current knowledge about how deficiency of different ribosomal proteins alters translation of some classes of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). It was shown that depletion of RPS26 affects translation rate of different mRNAs compared to depletion of other proteins of small ribosomal subunit. We also verified whether RPS26 silencing would affect FMRP endogenously expressed in FXTAS patient-derived and control fibroblasts, as they differ in CGG repeats content in natural locus of <italic>FMR1,</italic> which potentially might influence the effect of RPS26 deficiency. However, we did not observe any changes in FMRP levels upon RPS26 silencing in either genetic variant with the PM or normal <italic>FMR1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Given the role of TSR2 in incorporating or replacing RPS26 into the ribosome, we investigated whether the depletion of TSR2 modulates FMRpolyG production. In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>), we demonstrated that the RPS26 level decreases upon TSR2 silencing. We subsequently showed that TSR2 silencing incurs the same effect on RAN translation efficiency as the direct depletion of RPS26 and the observed regulation does not stem from global translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A&amp;C</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether this is an effect of hampering RPS26 loading to the 40 S subunit by TSR2 depletion, or a consequence of decrease of RPS26 level. The silencing of this chaperone also exhibited selectivity towards FMRpolyG over the FMRP reading frame without affecting the other 40 S ribosomal proteins, such as RACK1, RPS6, and RPS15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A&amp;B</xref>). Previously, it was shown that Tsr2 is responsible for replacing damaged Rps26, which undergoes oxidation on mature 80 S ribosomes under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, the activity of this chaperone may play an important role in modulating RAN translation <italic>via</italic> Rps26 assembly or disassembly from ribosomal subunits, also during different stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Karbstein, 2022</xref>). Importantly, we provided additional evidence that RPS26 specifically affects CGGexp-related RAN translation, as the depletion of another 40 S ribosomal protein, RPS6, did not affect the FMRpolyG biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, mutations in genes encoding RPS26 and TSR2 were associated with hematopoiesis impairment that underlies the genetic blood disorder Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piantanida et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doherty et al., 2010</xref>). Previously, analyses of DBA patient cells and RPS26-depleted HeLa cells found alterations in ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doherty et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, we found that proteins implicated in the eukaryotic PIC and components of large ribosomal subunits were altered upon RPS26 silencing in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting rearrangements in ribosomal composition. Similar observation was noted in case of RPS25 knockdown which resulted in changes in abundance of ribosomal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luan et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, our data is consistent with the fact that mutants of 40 S components accumulates more 60 S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>) and the knockdown of 40 S ribosomal proteins elicits the enhanced translation of 60 S ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luan et al., 2022</xref>). Altogether, our data supports the evidence regarding co-dependent regulation of stability and accumulation of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gregory et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, RPS26 is highly expressed in ovarian cells and was shown to be important for female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). It is necessary for oocyte growth and follicle development, and its depletion causes changes in transcription and chromatin configuration, leading to premature ovarian failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Our discovery that RPS26 regulates the level of FMRpolyG in cellular models sheds new light on the potential role of RPS26-related RAN translation in FXPOI, where FMRpolyG aggregates are detected in ovarian cells and contribute to the development and progression of fertility issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buijsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shelly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosario et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Given these findings, it is likely that the depletion of RPS26 from 40 S subunits contributes to its specialization and modulates the translation of specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Karbstein, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>). Remarkably, our experiments identified nearly 400 proteins responding to RPS26 depletion, which is similar to ca. 500 mRNAs, for which translation rate was altered upon Rps26 insufficiency in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, depletion or mutations in RPS26 resulted in the reduction of 40 S subunits level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>); however, overall translation rate was not impacted by RPS26 impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>). We also observed that RPS26 depletion did not elicit global translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which additionally strengthens our conclusion that decrease of polyglycine production is not a byproduct of global translation shut down but rather the specific response to RPS26 deficiency. Alternatively, the observed effect may be explained by the decrease of translationally active ribosomes, which in return, impacts the translation rate of selected mRNAs, including upstream ORF of <italic>FMR1</italic>. In fact, it was shown that RPS26 insufficiency resulted in the decrease of mammalian cells viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>), which is in line with our analysis regarding cells proliferation upon RPS26 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, RPS6 and RPS25 depletion also negatively impacted cells proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>), which is consistent with previously described data linking the ribosomal proteins deficiencies (both from 40 S and 60 S subunits) with a cellular growth rate inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that the C-terminal domain of RPS26 is essential for mRNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>), although whether RPS26 recognizes specific sequential or structural motifs within the mRNA remains unclear. Data derived from yeast models suggest that nucleotides in positions −1 to −10 upstream of the AUG codon, especially Kozak sequence elements, play an important role in Rps26 interactions and translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>). According to the established ribosome-mRNA structure, RPS26 contacts with mRNA upstream to AUG codon and the C-terminus reaches into mRNA exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). Recent findings indicate that in eukaryotic cells, positions −11 to −16 upstream of the start codon might be more significant for RNA recognition, stabilizing PIC, and translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havkin-Solomon et al., 2023</xref>). Our bioinformatic analysis of proteins sensitive to RPS26 depletion revealed that their transcripts were GC-rich (especially in the 5’UTR region) and enriched with <italic>k</italic>-mers mainly consisting of Gs and Cs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>); however, we did not identify the importance of any specific sequence positions from AUG codon. These data and the fact that <italic>FMR1</italic> 5’UTR is a GC-rich sequence (~90%) suggest that RPS26 level-sensitive translation is selective for transcripts rich with GC nucleotides. Moreover, we demonstrated that RPS26 depletion affected RAN translation initiated from ACG but not CTG and GTG codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which indicates that the start codon selection step may constitute an important part of RPS26 level-sensitive RAN translation regulation. Such hypothesis can be supported by the fact that blockage of ACG codon with ASO caused less effective RAN translation downregulation evoked by RPS26 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This may point to the importance of specific RNA structural motifs localized within 5’UTRs or the speed of PIC scanning, which depends on how effectively stable secondary/tertiary structures are resolved. Other explanation would be differences in dynamics of either scanning of PICs differing in the presence of RPS26 or assembling of 80 S on the initiation codon.</p><p>The ribosomal protein RPS25, a component of 40 S subunit was previously described in the context of GGGGCC and CAG repeats-related RAN translation corresponding to C9-ALS/FTD, HD, and SCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada et al., 2019</xref>). The depletion of RPS25 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> C9orf72 model, and in induced motor neurons derived from C9-ALS/FTD patients, alleviated toxicity caused by RAN translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada et al., 2019</xref>). On the contrary, in FXTAS <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, RPS25 knockdown led to enhancement of CGG repeats-related toxicity; however, underlying mechanism was not determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linsalata et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that RPS25 coprecipitated with the 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> and its depletion negatively affected the biosynthesis of FMRpolyG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus expanding current knowledge about RPS25 RAN translation modulatory properties in REDs.</p><p>Altogether, we have identified two ribosomal proteins, RPS26 and RPS25 as modifiers of CGGexp-related RAN translation of mutant <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, which imply that the downregulation of these two 40 S ribosomal proteins affects FMRpolyG biosynthesis. Importantly, we demonstrated that RPS26 depletion alleviated toxicity caused by FMRpolyG but did not affect FMRP, the main product of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene. This suggests that sequence/structure elements within <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, which make this transcript sensitive to the level of studied ribosomal proteins, may be potential therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetic constructs</title><p>For MS-based screening <italic>FMR1 RNA</italic> construct was generated based on backbone described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sellier et al., 2017</xref> (see also Addgene plasmid #63091), which contains 5’UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> with expanded 99xCGG repeats.

This is an important paper in which the authors sought out proteins that modulate RAN translation. They determined which proteins in Hela cells were enriched on CGG repeats and affected levels of polyG encoded in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 mRNA. They then showed that siRNA depletion of ribosomal protein RPS26 results in less production of FMR1polyG than in control. Experiments were performed in several cell lines and with several reporters with differences in repeats and transfection methods to increase confidence that changes were occurring. New data and details of the methods increase confidence that reporter translation but not global translation is diminished by RPS26 knockdown as concluded. The manuscript has been improved by data showing that new proteins are being synthesized in cells following RPS26 knockdown, and that near-cognate start codon usage is diminished in lines when RPS26 is knocked down, but the mechanism by which RPS26 depletion affects translation is still unclear.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The authors have proteomics data that show enrichment of a set of proteins on FMR1-polyG RNA but not a related RNA.</p><p>- Knockdown of RPS26, which was enriched on the FMR1 RNA, led to decreases in cell growth, but surprisingly did not strongly affect global translation, as assessed by puromycin incorporation</p><p>- There is some new evidence that near-cognate start codon selection is affected by RPS26 knockdown</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The mechanism for RPS26 knockdown affecting translation of the polyG sequences is unclear, whether knockdown is affecting ribosome levels, extra ribosomal RPS26 or ribosome composition is not known.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98631.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Tutak et al provide intriguing findings demonstrating that insufficiency of RPS26 and related proteins, such as TSR2 and RPS25, downregulates RAN translation from CGG repeat RNA in fragile X-associated conditions. Using RNA-tagging system and mass spectrometry-based screening, the authors identified RPS26 as a potential regulator of RAN translation. They further confirmed its regulatory effects on RAN translation by siRNA-based knockdown experiments in multiple cellular disease models. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the expression of some ribosomal proteins is sensitive to RPS26 depletion, while approximately 80% of proteins, including FMRP, were not influenced. Given the limited understanding of the roles of ribosomal proteins in RAN translation regulation, this study provides novel insights into this research field. However, certain data do not fully support the authors' critical conclusions.</p><p>(1) While the authors substituted the ACG near-cognate initiation codon with other near-cognate codons, such as GTG and CTG, in the luciferase assay (Figure 4F), substitution of the ACG codon with an ATG codon should also be performed. Although they evaluated RPS26 knockdown effect on AUG-dependent FMRP translation in Figure 3C, investigating its effect on AUG-dependent repeat-associated translation (e.g., AUG-CGG-repeat) is necessary to substantiate their claim that ACG codon selection is important for RAN translation downregulation by RPS26 knockdown.</p><p>(2) The results of the ASO-based ACG codon-blocking experiment in Figure 4G are difficult to interpret. While RPS knockdown reduces FMRpolyG expression, the effect appears attenuated by the ASO-ACG treatment compared to the control. However, this does not conclusively demonstrate that the regulatory effect is directly due to ACG codon selection during translation initiation for some reasons. For example, ASO-ACG treatment possibly interferes with ribosomal scanning rather than ACG-codon selection, or alters the expression of template CGG repeat RNA. To validate the effect of RPS26 knockdown on ACG codon selection, experiments using the ACG-to-ATG substituted CGG repeat reporter are recommended, as suggested in comment 1.</p><p>(3) The regulatory effects of RPS26 and other molecules on RAN translation have been investigated as effects on the expression levels of FMRpolyG proteins upon knockdown of these molecules in disease model cells expressing CGG repeat sequences (Figures 1C, 1D, 3B, 3C, 3E, 4F, 4G, 5A, 5C, 6A, 6D). However, FMRpolyG expression levels can be influenced by factors other than RAN translation in these cellular experiments, such as template RNA level, template RNA localization, and FMRpolyG protein degradation. Although the authors evaluated the effect on the expression levels of template CGG repeat RNA, it would be better to confirm the direct effect of these regulators on RAN translation by other experiments. In vitro translation assay that can directly evaluate RAN translation is preferable, but experiments using the ACG-to-ATG substituted CGG repeat reporter, as suggested in comment 1, would also provide valuable insights.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98631.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tutak</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznańskiego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Poznan</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Broniarek</surname><given-names>Izabela</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznańskiego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Poznan</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zielezinski</surname><given-names>Andrzej</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznańskiego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Poznan</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Niewiadomska</surname><given-names>Daria</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznańskiego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Poznan</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Skrzypczak</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Center of Advanced Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Poznan</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Baud</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznańskiego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Poznan</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sobczak</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznańskiego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Poznan</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><p>We thank Reviewers for highlighting the strengths of our work along with suggestions for future directions.</p><p>We agree with the Reviewers that RPS26 depletion may impact not only RAN translation initiation and codon selection (as showed in the experiments in Figure 4G), but also other mechanisms, such as speed of PIC scanning, as we stated in the discussion. Although, we did provide the data showing that mRNA of exogenous <italic>FMR1-GFP</italic> does not change upon RPS26 depletion (Figure 3B&amp;C), hence observed effect most likely stems from translation regulation. In addition, an experiment with ASO-ACG treatment (Figure 4G) suggests that near cognate start codon selection or speed of PIC scanning may be a part of the regulation of RAN translation sensitive to RPS26 depletion. In addition, our latest unpublished results (Niewiadomska D. et al., in revision), indicate that FMRpolyG in fusion with GFP is fairly stable, in particular, while derived from long repeats (&gt;90xCGG), suggesting that the protein stability is not at play in RPS26-dependent regulation.</p><p>We would like to stress that in order to avoid bias in result interpretation and to mimic the natural situation, the majority of experiments concerning levels of FMRpolyG were performed in cell models with stable expression of ACG-initiated FMRpolyG. Currently, we do not possess a cell model with stable expression of AUG-initiated FMRpolyG, and the experiments based on transient transfection system would not necessarily be comparable to the results obtained in stable expression system. However, we believe that the experiment presented in Figure 2B serves as a good control for overall translation level upon RPS26 depletion indicating that RPS26 insufficiency does not affect global translation and the observed regulation is specific to some mRNAs including the one encoding FMRpolyG frame. We also show that the level of ca. 80% of identified canonical proteins, including FMRP, did not change upon RPS26 silencing (SILAC-MS, Figure 4A). Indeed, we did not explore the ribosome composition upon RPS26 and TSR2 depletion, although, most likely the pool of functional ribosomes in the cell is sufficient enough to support the basal translation level (SUnSET assays, Figure 2B &amp; 5C). However, we cannot exclude possibility that for some mRNAs, including one encoding for FMRpolyG, the observed effect can be partially caused by lowering the number of fully active ribosomes, especially in experiments with transient transfection experiments where transgene expression is hundreds times higher than for average native mRNA.</p><p>Finally, we agree with the Reviewer that in vitro translation assay would provide the evidence of direct effect of RPS26 on FMRpolyG level, however, we did not manage to overcome technical difficulties in obtaining cellular lysate devoid of RPS26 from vendor companies.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>General Comments</p><p>We thank Reviewers for the critical comments and experimental suggestions. We considered most of the advices in the revised version of the manuscript, which allowed for a more balanced interpretation of the results presented, and further supported major statement of the manuscript that insufficiency of the RPS26 and RPS25 plays a role in modulating the efficiency of noncanonical RAN translation from <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, which results in the production of toxic polyglycine protein (FMRpolyG). Firstly, performing new experiments, we showed that silencing of the RPS26 and its chaperone protein TSR2, which regulates loading/exchange of RPS26 in maturing small ribosome subunit, did not elicit global translation inhibition. Secondly, we demonstrated that in contrary to RPS26 and RPS25 depletion, silencing the RPS6 protein, a core component of 40S subunit, did not affect FMRpolyG production, further supporting the specific effect of RPS26 and RPS25 on RAN translation regulation of mutant FMR1 mRNA. We also observed that depletion of RPS26, RPS25 and RPS6 had significant negative effect on cells proliferation which is in line with previously published results indicating that insufficiencies of ribosomal proteins negatively affect cell growth. Moreover, we showed that FMRpolyG production is significantly affected by RPS26 depletion while initiated at ACG, but not other near cognate start codons. Importantly, translation of FMRP initiated at canonical AUG codon of the same mRNA upstream the CGGexp was not affected by RPS26 silencing, similarly to vast majority of the human proteome. This implies that RAN translation of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA mediated by RPS26 insufficiency is likely to be dependent on start codon selection/fidelity. In essence, we provide a series of evidences indicating that cellular amount of 40S ribosomal proteins RPS26 and RPS25 is important factor of CGGrelated RAN translation regulation. Finally, we also decided to tone down our claims. Now, we state that the RPS26/25/TSR2 insufficiency or depletion, affects RAN translation, rather than composition of 40S ribosomal subunit <italic>per se</italic> influences RAN translation. We have addressed all specific concerns below and made changes to the new version of manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Tutak et al use a combination of pulldowns, analyzed by mass spectrometry, reporter assays, and fluorescence experiments to decipher the mechanism of protein translation in fragile X-related diseases.

We believe your guidance has been instrumental in significantly enhancing the quality of our research. Below, we have addressed your comments pointby-point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The topic is interesting and important.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In particular, there is very little data to support the notion that Rps26-deficient ribosomes are even produced under the circumstances. And no data that indicate that they are involved in the RAN translation. Essential controls (for ribosome numbers) are lacking, no information is presented on the viability of the cells (Rps26 is an essential protein), and the differences in protein levels could well arise from block in protein synthesis, and cell division coupled to differential stability of the proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that data presented in the first version of the manuscript did not directly address the following processes: ribosome content, global translation rate and cell viability upon RPS26 depletion. Therefore we addressed some of the issues in the revised version of the manuscript. In particular, we showed that RPS26 and TSR2 knock down did not inhibit global translation (new Figure 2B &amp; 4C), hence we concluded that the changes of FMRpolyG level did not arise from general translational shut down. On the other hand, RPS26, RPS25 and RPS6 depletion negatively affected cells proliferation (new Figure 2A,5D,6C), which is in line with a number of previously published researches (e.g. Cheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2019; Havkin-Solomon <italic>et al</italic>, 2023). However, the rate of proliferation abnormalities is limited. We agree that observed effects on RAN translation from mutant FMR1 mRNA may stem from the combination of altered protein synthesis, conditions of the cells but also cis-acting factors of mRNA sequence/structure. In new experiments we showed that single nucleotide substitution of ACG by other near cognate start codons change sensitivity of RAN translation to insufficiency of RPS26 (new Figure 4F). Also the inhibitory effect of antisense oligonucleotide binding to the region of 5’UTR containing ACG initiation codon (ASO_ACG) is different in cells differing in amount of RPS26 (new Figure 4G).</p><p>We also agree that our data only partially supports the role of RPS26-defficient ribosomes in RAN translation. Therefore, we have toned down our claims. Now, we state that the RPS26/25/TSR2 insufficiency or depletion affects RAN translation. We also changed the title of the manuscript to: “Insufficiency of 40S ribosomal proteins, RPS26 and RPS25, negatively affects biosynthesis of polyglycine-containing proteins in fragile-X associated conditions” Previously it was: “Ribosomal composition affects the noncanonical translation and toxicity of polyglycine-containing proteins in fragile X-associated conditions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points:</p><p>(1) Analysis of the mass spec data in Supplemental Table S3 indicates that for many of the proteins that are differentially enriched in one sample, a single peptide is identified. So the difference is between 1 peptide and 0. I don't understand how one can do a statistical analysis on that, or how it would give out anything of significance. I certainly do not think it is significant. This is exacerbated by the fact that the contaminants in the assay (keratins) are many, many-fold more abundant, and so are proteins that are known to be mitochondrial or nuclear, and therefore likely not actual targets (e.g. MCCC1, PC, NPM1; this includes many proteins &quot;of significance&quot; in Table S1, including Rrp1B, NAF1, Top1, TCEPB, DHX16, etc...).</p><p>The data in Table S6/Figure 3A suffer from the same problem.</p><p>I am not convinced that the mass spec data is reliable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer for the comment concerning MS data; however, we believe that it may stem from misunderstanding of the data presented in Table S3 and S6. Both tables represent the output from MaxQuant analysis (so-called ProteinGroup) of MS .raw files, without any filtering. As stated in the Material&amp;Methods, we applied default parameters suggested by MaxQuant developers to analyze MS data, these include identification of proteins based on at least 1 unique peptide, and thus some of the proteins with only 1 unique peptide are shown in Tables S1 and S3. Reviewer is also right that in this output table common contaminants, such as keratins are included. However, these identifications are denoted as “CON_”, and are further filtered out during statistical analysis in Perseus software. During the statistical analysis we first filtered out irrelevant protein groups identifications, such as contaminants, or only identified by site modifications.</p><p>We have changed the names of Supplementary Table files, giving more detailed description. We hope this will help to avoid misunderstanding for broader public. Secondly, when comparing the data presented in Table S3 and volcano plot presented in Figure 1B, one can notice that indeed the majority of identified proteins are not statistically significant (grey points), thus not selected for further stratification. Lack of significance of these proteins may be partially due to poor MS identification, however, they are not included in the following parts of the manuscript. Further, we selected only eight proteins (out of over 150) for stratification by orthogonal techniques, thus we argue that this step validates the biological relevance of chosen candidate RAN-translation modifiers. One should also keep in mind that pull down samples analyzed by MS often yield lower intensity and identification rates, when comparing to whole cell analysis, as a result of lower protein input or stringent washes used during sample preparation.</p><p>Regarding the data presented in Table S6 (SILAC data), we argue that these data are of very good quality. More than 2,000 proteins were identified in a 125min gradient, with over 80% of proteins that were identified with at least 2 unique peptides. Each of three biological replicates was analyzed three times (technical replicates), giving total of 9 high resolution MS runs. Together, we strongly believe that this data is of high confidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The mass-spec data however claims to identify Rps26 as a factor binding the toxic RNA specifically. The rest of the paper seeks to develop a story of how Rps26-deficient ribosomes play a role in the translation of this RNA. I do not consider that this makes sense.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we identified RPS26 as a protein that co-precipitated with <italic>FMR1</italic> containing expanded CGG repeats (Supplementary Figure 1G) and found that depletion of RPS26 hindered RAN translation of FMRpolyG, suggesting that RPS26 positively affects RAN translation. However, we did not state that RPS26 directly interacts with toxic RNA. In order to confirm the specificity of RAN translation regulation by RPS26 insufficiency, we tested whether depletion of other 40S ribosomal protein, RPS6, affects FMRpolyG synthesis. Our experiments showed that there was no any significant effect on RAN translation efficiency post RPS6 silencing (new Figure 5C). Importantly, we showed that RPS26 depletion did not inhibit global translation (new Figure 2B). In addition, mutagenesis of near-cognate start codon (new Figure 4F) and ASO_ACG treatment (new Figure 4G) provided the evidences that modulation of FMRpolyG biosynthesis by RPS26 level may depend on start codon selection. In essence, our data suggest that RPS26 depletion specifically affects synthesis of FMRpolyG, but not FMRP derived from the same <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA with CGGexp. However, we do not claim that the observed effect is the consequence of a direct interaction between RPS26 and 5’UTR of FMR1 mRNA. Downregulation of FMRpolyG biosynthesis could be an outcome of the alteration of ribosomal assembly, decrease of efficiency and fidelity of PIC scanning/initiation or impeded elongation or a combination of all these processes. In the manuscript we presented the results of experiments which tested many of these possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Rps26 is an essential gene, I am sure the same is true for DHX15. What happens to cell viability? Protein synthesis? The yeast experiments were carefully carried out under experiments where Rps26 was reduced, not fully depleted to give small growth defects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that RPS26 and DHX15 are essential proteins, similarly to all RNA binding proteins, and caution should be taken during experimental design. To address this, we titrated different concentrations of siRPS26, and found that administration of 5 nM siRPS26, which just partially silenced RPS26, decreased FMRpolyG by around 50% (new Figure 1D). This impact was even greater with 15 nM siRPS26, as we observed around 80% decrease of FMRpolyG.</p><p>Havkin-Solomon et al. (2023), showed that proliferation rate is decreased in cells with mutated C-terminus of RPS26, which is required for contacting mRNA. In accordance with this study, we showed that cells with knocked down RPS26 proliferate less efficiently (new Figure 2A), but depletion of RPS26 did not impact the global translation (new Figure 2B). In addition, our SILAC-MS data indicates that ~80% of proteins with determined expression level were not affected by RPS26 insufficiency, and ~20% of the proteins turned out to be sensitive to RPS26 decrease. Although, these data do not take into account the protein stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Knockdown efficiency for all tested genes must be shown to evaluate knockdown efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>The current version of the manuscript contains representative western blots with validation of knock-down efficiency (for example in Figure 3B, C, E, Figure 6A) and we included knock-down validations where applicable (Figures 1D, 2B, 4G and 5C).</p><p>(5) The data in Figure 1E have just one mock control, but two cell types (control si and Rps26 depletion).</p><p>Mock control corresponds to the cells treated with lipofectamine reagent and was included in the study to determine the “background” signal from cells treated with delivery agent and reagents used to measure the apoptosis process. These cells were neither expressing FMRpolyG, nor siRNAs. Luminescence signals were normalized to the values obtained from mock control. We added more details describing this assay in the Figure 1 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors' data indicate that the effects are not specific to Rps26 but indeed also observed upon Rps25 knockdown. This suggests strongly that the effects are from reduced ribosome content or blocked protein synthesis. Additional controls should deplete a core RP to ascertain this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that observed effects may stem from reduced ribosome content, however, we argue that this is the only possibility and explanation. Previously, it was shown that RPS25 regulates G4C2-related RAN translation, but knock out of RPS25 does not affect global translation (Yamada S, 2019, <italic>Nat. Neuroscience</italic>). Similarly, we showed that KD of RPS26 or TSR2 did not reduce significantly global translation rate (SUnSET assay; new Figure 2B and 5C, respectively).</p><p>Moreover, in a new version of manuscript we included a control experiment, where we silenced core ribosomal protein (RPS6) and found that RPS6 depletion did not affect RAN translation from mutant FMR1 mRNA (new Figure 5C), thus strengthening our conclusion about specific RAN translation regulation by the level of RPS26 and RPS25.</p><p>Finally, our observation aligns well with current knowledge about how deficiency of different ribosomal proteins alters translation of some classes of mRNAs (Luan Y, 2022, <italic>Nucleic Acids Res</italic>; Cheng Z, 2019, <italic>Mol Cell</italic>). It was shown that depletion of RPS26 affects translation rate of different mRNAs compared to depletion of other proteins of small ribosomal subunit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Supplemental Figure S3 demonstrates that the depletion of S26 does not affect the selection of the start codon context. Any other claim must be deleted. All the 5'-UTR logos are essentially identical, indicating that &quot;picking&quot; happens by abundance (background).</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary Figure 3D represents results indicating that the mutation in -4 position (from G to A) did not affect the RAN translation regardless of RPS26 presence or depletion. However, this result does not imply that RPS26 does not affect the selection of start codon of sequence- or RNA structure-context. We verified this particular -4 position, as it was suggested previously as important RPS26-sensitive site in yeasts (Ferretti M, 2017, <italic>Nat Struct Mol Biol</italic>). We agree with Reviewer that all 5’UTR logos presented in our paper did not show statistical significance for neither tested position for human mRNAs. On the contrary, we observed that regulation sensitive to RPS26 level depends on the selection of start codon of RAN translation, in particular ACG initiation (new Figure 4F&amp;G). RPS26 depletion affected ACG-initiated but not GTG- or CTG-initiated RAN translation.</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, we wrote that we did not identify any specific motifs or enrichment within analyzed transcripts in comparison to the background. On the other hand, we found that the GC-content among analyzed transcripts is higher within 5’UTRs and in close proximity to ATG in coding sequences (Figure 4D), what suggests the importance of RNA stable structures in this region. In addition, we showed that mRNAs encoding proteins responding to RPS26 depletion have shorter than average 5’UTRs (new Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Mechanism is lacking entirely. There are many ways in which ribosomes could have mRNA-specific effects. The authors tried to find an effect from the Kozak sequence, unsuccessfully (however, they also did not do the experiment correctly, as they failed to recognize that the Kozak sequence differs between yeast, where it is A-rich, and mammalian cells, where it is GGCGCC). Collisions could be another mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, collisions as well as other mechanisms such as skewed start codon fidelity may have an effect on efficiency of FMRpolyG biosynthesis. In the current version of the manuscript, we show that RPS26 amount-sensitive regulation seems to be start codonselection dependent (new Figure 4F&amp;G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Translation of CGG repeats leads to the accumulation of poly G, which is associated with neurological disorders. This is a valuable paper in which the authors sought out proteins that modulate RAN translation. They determined which proteins in Hela cells bound to CGG repeats and affected levels of polyG encoded in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 mRNA. They then showed that siRNA depletion of ribosomal protein RPS26 results in less production of FMR1polyG than in control. There are data supporting the claim that RPS26 depletion modulates RAN translation in this RNA, although for some results, the Western results are not strong. The data to support increased aggregation by polyG expression upon S26 KD are incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for critical comments and suggestions.

However, RPS26 reduction was also shown previously to affect ribosome levels, and reduced ribosome levels can result in ribosomes translating very different RNA pools.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous version of the manuscript we did not state that RPS26 binds directly to RNA with expanded CGG repeats and we did not show the experiment indicating direct interaction between studied RNA and RPS26. What we showed is that RPS26 was enriched on <italic>FMR1</italic> RNA MS samples, however, we did not verify whether it is direct or indirect interaction. We also tried to test hypothesis that lack of RPS26 in PIC complex may affect efficiency of RAN translation initiation via specific, previously described in yeast Kozak context (Ferretti M, 2017, <italic>Nat Struct Mol Biol</italic>). As we described this hypothesis was negatively validated. However, we showed that other features of 5’UTR sequences (e.g. higher GC-content or shorter leader sequence) are potentially important for translation efficiency in cells with depleted RPS26.</p><p>Indeed, RPS26 is involved in 40S maturation steps (Plassart L, 2021, <italic>eLife</italic>) and its insufficiency or mutations or blocking its inclusion to 40S ribosome may result in incomplete 40S maturation, which subsequently might negatively affect translation per se. However, we did not observe global translation inhibition after RPS26 depletion or depletion of TSR2, the chaperon involved in incorporation/exchange RPS26 to small ribosomal subunit (new Figure 2B and 5C). In addition, our SILAC-MS data indicates that majority of studied proteins (including FMRP, the main product of <italic>FMR1</italic> gene) were not affected by RPS26 depletion which can be carefully extrapolated to global translation. In revised manuscript we also showed that relatively low silencing of RPS26 also decreased FMRpolyG production in model cells (new Figure 1D).</p><p>We agree that reduced ribosome levels can result in different efficiency of translation of different RNA pools. We enhance this statement in revised manuscript. However, we also showed that the same mRNA containing different near cognate start codons (single/two nucleotide substitution) specific to RAN translation, or targeting this codon with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in altered sensitivity of FMR1 mRNA translation to RPS26 depletion (new Figure 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A significant claim is that RPS26 KD alleviates the effects of FMRpolyG expression, but those data aren't presented well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment.

They identified RPS26 as a potential regulator of RAN translation by RNAtagging system and mass spectrometry-based screening for proteins binding to CGG repeat RNA and confirmed its regulatory effects on RAN translation by siRNA-based knockdown experiments in multiple cellular disease models and patient-derived fibroblasts. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis found that the expressions of some ribosomal proteins are sensitive to RPS26 depletion while approximately 80% of proteins including FMRP were not influenced. Since the roles of ribosomal proteins in RAN translation regulation have not been fully examined, this study provides novel insights into this research field. However, some data presented in this manuscript are limited and preliminary, and their conclusions are not fully supported.</p><p>(1) While the authors emphasized the importance of ribosomal composition for RAN translation regulation in the title and the article body, the association between RAN translation and ribosomal composition is apparently not evaluated in this work. They found that specific ribosomal proteins (RPS26 and RPS25) can have regulatory effects on RAN translation (Figures 1C, 2B, 2C, 2E, 4A, 5A, and 5B), and that the expression levels of some ribosomal proteins can be changed by RPS26 knockdown (Figure 3B, however, the change of the ribosome compositions involved in the actual translation has not been elucidated). Therefore, their conclusive statement, that is, &quot;ribosome composition affects RAN translation&quot; is not fully supported by the presented data and is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for critical comments and suggestions. We agree that the initial title and some statements in the text were misleading and the presented data did not fully support the aforementioned statement regarding ribosomal composition affecting FMRpolyG synthesis. Therefore, in the revised version of the manuscript we included a control experiment indicating that depletion of another core 40S ribosomal protein (RPS6) did not impact the FMRpolyG synthesis (new Figure 5C), which supports our hypothesis that RPS26 and RPS25 are specific CGG-related RAN translation modifiers. To precisely deliver a main message of our work, we changed the title that will indicate the specific effect of RPS26 and RPS25 insufficiency on RAN translation of FMRpolyG. Proposed title: “Insufficiency of 40S ribosomal proteins, RPS26 and RPS25 negatively affects biosynthesis of polyglycine-containing proteins in fragile-X associated conditions”. We also changed all statements regarding “ribosomal composition” in main text of the new version of manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The study provides insufficient data on the mechanisms of how RPS26 regulates RAN translation. Although authors speculate that RPS26 may affect initiation codon fidelity and regulate RAN translation in a CGG repeat sequence-independent manner (Page 9 and Page 11), what they really have shown is just identification of this protein by the screening for proteins binding to CGG repeat RNA (Figure 1A, 1B), and effects of this protein on CGG repeat-RAN translation. It is essential to clarify whether the regulatory effect of RPS26 on RAN translation is dependent on CGG repeat sequence or near-cognate initiation codons like ACG and GUG in the 5' upstream sequence of the repeat. It would be better to validate the effects of RPS26 on translation from control constructs, such as one composed of the 5' upstream sequence of FMR1 with no CGG repeat, and one with an ATG substitution in the 5' upstream sequence of FMR1 instead of near-cognate initiation codons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data presented in the manuscript implies that insufficiency of RPS26 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of CGG-related RAN translation and in the revised version of the manuscript we included a series of experiments indicating that ACG codon selection seems to be an important part of RPS26 level-dependent regulation of polyglycine production (new Figure 4F&amp;G; see point 3 below for more details). Importantly, in the luciferase assay showed on Figure 4F we used the AUG-initiated firefly luciferase reporter as normalization control.</p><p>Moreover, to verify if FMRpolyG response to RPS26 deficiency depends on the type of reporter used, we repeated many experiments using FMRpolyG fused with different tags. The luciferase-based assays were in line with experiments conducted on constructs with GFP tag (new Figure 1D), thus strengthening our previous data. Moreover, in the series of experiments, we show that FMRP synthesis which is initiated from ATG codon located in <italic>FMR1</italic> exon 1, was not affected by RPS26 depletion (Figure 3E &amp; 4C), even though its translation occurs on the same mRNA as FMRpolyG. This indicates a specific RPS26 regulation of polyglycine frame initiated from ACG near cognate codon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The regulatory effects of RPS26 and other molecules on RAN translation have all been investigated as effects on the expression levels of FMRpolyG-GFP proteins in cellular models expressing CGG repeat sequences Figures 1C, 2B, 2C, 2E, 4A, 5A, and 5B. In these cellular experiments, there are multiple confounding factors affecting the expression levels of FMRpolyG-GFP proteins other than RAN translation, including template RNA expression, template RNA distribution, and FMRpolyG-GFP protein degradation. Although authors evaluated the effect on the expression levels of template CGG repeat RNA, it would be better to confirm the effect of these regulators on RAN translation by other experiments such as in vitro translation assay that can directly evaluate RAN translation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are multiple factors affecting final levels of FMRpolyG-GFP proteins including aforementioned processes. We evaluated the level of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, which turned out not to be decreased upon RPS26 depletion (Figure 3B&amp;C), therefore, we assumed that what we observed, was the regulation on translation level, especially that RPS26 is a ribosomal protein contacting mRNA in E-site. We believe that direct assays such as in vitro translation may be beneficial, however, depletion of RPS26 from cellular lysate provided by the vendor seems technically challenging, if not completely impossible. Instead, we focused on sequence/structure specific regulation of RAN translation with the emphasis on start-codon initiation selection. It resulted in generating the valuable results pointing out the RPS26 role in start codon fidelity (Figure 4F&amp;G). These new results showed that translation from mRNAs differing just in single or two nucleotide substitution in near cognate start codon (ACG to GUG or ACG to CUG), although results in exactly the same protein, is differently sensitive to RPS26 silencing (new Figure 4F). Similar differences were observed for translation efficiency from the same mRNA targeted or not with antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the region of RAN translation initiation codon (new Figure 4G). These results also suggest that stability of FMRpolyG is not affected in cells with decreased level of RPS26.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) While the authors state that RPS26 modulated the FMRpolyG-mediated toxicity, they presented limited data on apoptotic markers, not cellular viability (Figure 1E), not fully supporting this conclusion. Since previous work showed that FMRpolyG protein reduces cellular viability (Hoem G, 2019,Front Genet), additional evaluations for cellular viability would strengthen this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We addressed the apoptotic process in order to determine the effect of RPS26 depletion on RAN translation related toxicity (Figure 1F). In revised version of the manuscript, we also added the evaluation on how cells proliferation was affected by RPS26, RPS25, RPS6 and TSR2 depletion. Our data indicate that TSR2 silencing slightly impacted the cellular fitness (new Figure 5D), whereas insufficiencies of RPS26, RPS25 and RPS6 had a much stronger negative effect on proliferation (new Figure 2A, 5D, 6C), which is in line with previous data (Cheng Z 2019, <italic>Mol Cell</italic>; Luan Y, 2022, <italic>Nucleic Acids Res)</italic>. The difference in proliferation rate after treatment with siRPS26 makes proper interpretation of cellular viability assessment very difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p>(1) It would be nice to validate the effects of overexpression of RPS26 and other regulators on RAN translation, not limited to knockdown experiments, to support the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not performed such experiments because we believed that RPS26 overexpression may have no or marginal effect on translation or RAN translation. It is likely impossible to efficiently incorporate overexpressed RPS26 into 40S subunits, because the concentration of all ribosomal proteins in the cells is very high.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be better to explain how authors selected 8 proteins for siRNA-based validation (Figure 1C, 1D, S1D) from 32 proteins enriched in CGG repeat RNA in the first screening.</p></disp-quote><p>We selected those candidates based on their functions connected to translation, structured RNA unwinding or mRNA processing. For example, we tested few RNA helicases because of their known function in RAN translation regulation described by other researchers. This explanation was added to the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Original image data showing nuclear FMRpolyG-GFP aggregates should be presented in Figure 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>The representative images of control and siRPS26-treated cells are now shown in modified version of Figure 1E and described with more details in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Image data in Figure 2A and 2D have poor signal/noise ratio and the resolution should be improved. In addition, aggregates should be clearly indicated in Figure 2D in an appropriate manner.</p></disp-quote><p>The stable S-FMR95xG cellular model is characterized by very low expression of RANtranslated FMR95xG, therefore, it is challenging to obtain microscopic images of better quality with higher GFP signal. In the L-99xCGG model expression of transgene is higher. Therefore, we provided new image in the new version of Figure 3D (former 2D). Moreover, we showed aggregates on the image obtained using confocal microscopy (new Supplementary Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The detailed information on patient-derived fibroblast (age and sex of the patient, the number of CGG repeats, etc.) in Figure 2F needed to be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>This information was added to the figure legend (Figure 3F; previously 2F) and in the Material and Methods section as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It would be better to normalize RNA expression levels of FMR1 and FMR1-GFP by the housekeeping gene in Figure S2C, like other RT-qPCR experimental data such as Figure 2B.</p></disp-quote><p>Normalization of FMR1-GFP to GAPDH is now shown in modified version of Figure S2C (right graph) as requested by the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It would be better to add information on molecular weight on all Western blotting data.</p><p>(8) Marks corresponding to molecular weight ladder were added to all images.</p></disp-quote><p>Full blots, including protein ladders were deposited in Zenodo repository, under doi: 10.5281/zenodo.13860370</p><p>References</p><p>Cheng Z, Mugler CF, Keskin A, Hodapp S, Chan LYL, Weis K, Mertins P, Regev A, Jovanovic M &amp; Brar GA (2019) Small and Large Ribosomal Subunit Deficiencies Lead to Distinct Gene Expression Signatures that Reflect Cellular Growth Rate. <italic>Mol Cell</italic> 73: 36-47.e10</p><p>Havkin-Solomon T, Fraticelli D, Bahat A, Hayat D, Reuven N, Shaul Y &amp; Dikstein R (2023) Translation regulation of specific mRNAs by RPS26 C-terminal RNA-binding tail integrates energy metabolism and AMPK-mTOR signaling. <italic>Nucleic Acids Res</italic> 51: 4415–4428</p><p>Hoem,G., Larsen,K.B., Øvervatn,A., Brech,A., Lamark,T., Sjøttem,E. and Johansen,T.
