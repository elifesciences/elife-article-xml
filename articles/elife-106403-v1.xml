SPNs, which include both direct-pathway striatonigral and indirect-pathway striatopallidal neurons, can be further classified into subtypes based on distinct transcriptomic profiles and cell body distribution patterns. However, how these SPN subtypes regulate spontaneous locomotion in the context of environmental valence remains unclear. Using Sepw1-Cre transgenic mice, which label a specific SPN subtype characterized by a patchy distribution of cell bodies in the dorsal striatum, we found that these patchy striatonigral neurons constrain motor vigor in response to valence differentials. In a modified light/dark box test, mice exhibited differential walking speeds between the light and dark zones. Genetic ablation of these patchy SPNs disrupted restful slowing in the dark zone and increased zone discrimination by speed. In vivo recordings linked the activity of these neurons to zone occupancy, speed, and deceleration, with a specific role in mediating deceleration. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of patchy SPNs—and optical activation of striatonigral neurons in particular—reduced locomotion and attenuated speed-based zone discrimination. These findings reveal that a subtype of patchy striatonigral neurons regulates implicit walking speed selection based on innate valence differentials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>spiny projection neurons</kwd><kwd>striosome</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>environmental valence</kwd><kwd>dorsal striatum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA AG000959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Huaibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA DA000603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Da-Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Patchy striatonigral neurons regulate implicit locomotor speed selection based on environmental valence, revealing a subtype-specific mechanism by which striatal circuits shape adaptive motor control and value-dependent behavioral responses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motor control relies on the complementary and simultaneous regulation of downstream nuclei by the striatal direct and indirect pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</xref>). Striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are further hypothesized to encode implicit motivation through the regulation of action vigor, such as movement speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dudman and Krakauer, 2016</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which striatal microcircuitry achieves this remain poorly understood.</p><p>A subpopulation of SPNs, referred to as ‘patch’ or ‘striosome’ neurons, is organized into distinct patchy clusters of varying sizes within the broader striatal matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crittenden and Graybiel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>). Both patch and matrix compartments comprise a mixture of direct and indirect pathway SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crittenden and Graybiel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>). Despite this similarity, differences in neurochemical and genetic composition, along with distinct interactions with surrounding circuitry, suggest that patch and matrix territories have specialized roles in regulating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graybiel and Matsushima, 2020</xref>). Recent behavioral studies highlight the unique roles of patchy SPNs, implicating them in value-based learning and risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2020</xref>). However, the interplay between these valuative functions and the conventional role of the striatum in locomotor control remains poorly understood. Given their distinctive characteristics, patchy SPNs are a compelling candidate for linking external valence to implicit motivational processes, such as action vigor and movement speed.</p><p>Studies of patchy SPNs make it clear these neurons are themselves diverse, and that accessing this population in varied ways necessarily results in the study of various subpopulations. Patchy SPNs were first distinguished from the surrounding matrix based on gradients in histochemical markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pert et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerfen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graybiel, 1984</xref>). They have since been accessed in vivo by relying on prenatal injections, by targeting patchy SPN-preferring afferents, and most recently through the development of genetically modified mouse lines with transgene expression controlled by genes concentrated in patchy SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brimblecombe and Cragg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prager and Plotkin, 2019</xref>). For the present study, we selected the Sepw1-Cre (NP67) BAC transgenic line to label the patchy SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>). These patchy SPNs include both direct (80%) and indirect (20%) pathway neurons and, unlike the matrix, receive innervation by the anxiety-modulating bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). This line is well characterized to express Cre in roughly 15% of striatal territory, representing similar striatal coverage to that derived from classic histological characterization of patchy SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Using Sepw1-Cre mice, we tested whether the assessment or response to naturalistic contrasts in valence depends on patchy SPNs. We employed a modified Light/Dark box paradigm combined with genetically targeted ablation and enhancement, in vivo imaging of patchy SPN somas and terminals, and synapse-specific optogenetics. Our findings reveal that patchy SPNs control the speed at which mice navigate the valence differential between high- and low-anxiety zones, without affecting valence perception itself. This provides the first evidence that patchy SPNs regulate naturalistic motor behavior and demonstrate that they drive implicit motivation to align situational valence with speed selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic ablation of patchy SPNs in Sepw1-Cre mice</title><p>To investigate the impact of patchy SPNs on behavior, we employed Sepw1-Cre (NP67) BAC transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2016</xref>) and bilaterally injected either adeno-associated viral vector, AAV-DIO-taCasp3, to create dorsal striatal patch ablation (PA mice), or AAV-DIO-mCherry (controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We differentially sub-lit a U-shaped maze to mitigate light exchange across zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while permitting uninterrupted areal video recording. Behavior in control mice verified dark preference, as demonstrated by greater stay time in the dark zone. Similar to controls, PA mice also demonstrated dark preference through greater stay time in the dark zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Speed was higher during exploration of the anxiogenic light zone for both control and PA mice, despite higher dark zone speed following ablation (L vs D control p=0.001, PA p=0.0371; control vs PA in dark p=0.0015, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The similarity of PA mice to controls in terms of dark preference and relatively greater light zone speed indicates that patch SPNs are not critical for basic discrimination of situational valence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ablation of patchy SPNs reduces rest and unmasks anxious vigor at choice points</title><p>While zone preference was normal, average speed in the dark zones and the maximum speed obtained were higher for PA mice than for control mice (dark zone speed p=0.0015, max speed p=0.0434, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Importantly, the reflection of valence in speed distributions between light and dark zones, present in controls, was lost for PA mice. The loss was due to a significant reduction in the percent time spent at restful speeds (≤2 cm/s) in the dark zones among PA mice relative to controls (p=0.0018, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Given that PA mice retained zone discrimination and dark preference, reduced stillness in the dark zones suggests that ablation of patchy SPNs leads to a failure to slow down or rest under safe conditions.</p><p>Zone transitions were accompanied by speed peaks for all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), suggesting invigorated action selection at this choice point. For controls, differential speed due to surrounding valence is immediately apparent in this moment of transition, with greater speeds expressed on either side of a transition accompanying the body-in-light (BIL, i.e. preceding a transition into dark and following a transition into light) versus body-in-dark (BID) moments. As a proxy for valence differential, we defined BIL effect as the difference between BIL and BID at transition moments (See Methods). We then used a Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects (GLME) model to estimate the effects of different factors on speed during these transitions. Both factors of BIL and PA mice were shown to increase speed at this choice point (GLME coefficient fixed effects 95% CI for speed increase by PA [0.73218, 3.9241] and BIL [1.7464, 2.3911] on approach, or by PA [2.2344, 2.8761], and BIL [0.89109, 3.593] on retreat). We dug deeper into the BIL effect on transition speed over the two groups of mice separately. As with controls, PA mice responded to a shift in valence accompanying zone transitions with acutely elevated speed during BIL windows. However, BIL had a larger effect on transition speed for PA mice than for controls, indicating that PA mice exhibited elevated transition discrimination through velocity (GLME fixed effects 95% CI for impact of BIL on speed: PA approach [2.3376 3.347], retreat [3.2809, 4.2788]; control approach [0.9698, 1.7612], retreat [1.0784, 1.8056], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Collectively, the pattern of excess speed in PA mice suggests that patchy SPNs naturally lower speed, supporting rest in the dark and alleviating anxious vigor surrounding transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Speed modulation by patchy SPNs depends on a valence differential</title><p>LDb data implicate patchy SPNs in lowering speed without determining if speed reduction depends fundamentally on light level or on differential light levels and the associated choice in situational valence. To distinguish these possibilities, we tested mice in chambers having the same physical dimensions as the LDb but with homogeneous illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Half the cohort was tested in a uniformly brightly lit ‘LLb’ chamber and the other half in a uniformly dim ‘DDb’ chamber, with all mice receiving the alternative test one to two weeks later. We found no substantial difference between LLb from DDb performance in terms of average or maximum speed for either group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>). Moreover, no difference in speed distribution between LLb and DDb was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Local speed peaks persisted while transitioning between equally illuminated zones, perhaps due to the decision to turn a corner or pass through a relatively constricted point joining larger rooms. Yet these transition speeds did not differ between LLb and DDb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O–P</xref>, ‘BIA’ denotes body in start side ‘A,’ analogous to BIL as mice are started in LDb light). Thus, the zone-specific LDb speed profile is not related simply to light level but is dependent on a light versus dark valence differential. Therefore, the LLb/DDb data help to establish LDb speed as a behavioral reflection of differential situational valence. These data also indicate that PA elevates valence-specific speed without inducing general hyperactivity. These data support the utility of the modified LDb to test implicit speed choice during valence-driven locomotor performance. Collectively, these data show that locomotor speed modulation by Sepw1<sup>+</sup> patchy neurons depends on the presence of a salient valence differential.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dark preference and greater light-zone speed are preserved during in vivo calcium imaging</title><p>A majority of Sepw1-Cre positive patchy SPNs are the direct-pathway neurons known for promoting locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2016</xref>).

For each neuron, zone preference was determined through comparison of calcium activity in light zone to that in dark zone (see Materials and methods). Neurons showing preferential activation in the light zone substantially outnumbered neurons preferentially active in the dark zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). A recent study showed that striatal neurons display heterogeneous responses to movement speed, exhibiting both linear and nonlinear relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fobbs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2025</xref>). Similarly, we identified speed-tuned cell subtypes with both linear (positive L+ and negative L-) and quadratic (positive Q+ and negative Q-) speed-tuning profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>; Materials and methods). Approximately 53% of neurons demonstrated such speed-activity relationships (L+, L-, Q+, and Q-), with the largest fraction of speed-related cells having a quadratic negative relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Collectively, 76% of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>) could be defined by these relationships to zone and/or speed, and the distribution of neurons among these categories was highly consistent across mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Light preference and speed relationships coincided within neurons more often than predicted by chance (χ<sup>2</sup> (3, n=532)=78.63, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Interestingly, more than half of light-related neurons possess a Q-relationship to speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). These data suggest that many patchy neurons are engaged in speed modulation, particularly within the anxiogenic light.</p><p>We next tested for a relationship between calcium activity and change in locomotor speed. To do this, we identified periods of time in which each mouse accelerated or decelerated (see Materials and methods). For each neuron, we measured the activity acceleration preference using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, similar to that used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britten et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fobbs et al., 2020</xref>) (see Materials and methods). For most patchy neurons, we found a strong relationship between deceleration and calcium activity, represented through acceleration/deceleration preference index (ADI) (computed with area under ROC curve, see Materials and methods) values close to –1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). We then divided neurons into those with strong deceleration-prediction (DP, |ADI|&gt;0.8, n=1291 neurons) or other neurons (|ADI|&lt;0.8, n=274 neurons). Those neurons for which we had been unable to identify a speed or zone relationship were disproportionately apt to be DP cells (χ<sup>2</sup>(1,1565)=24.33, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>), providing for categorization of additional neurons. As a result, we were able to ascribe a significant relationship to some combination of zone, speed, or deceleration to approximately 98% (1531 of 1565 neurons) of imaged patchy neurons. Importantly, these data corroborate our finding that ablation of patchy neurons increased speed at select moments in the LDbox by showing that many imaged patchy neurons act in concert with locomotor deceleration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Light sensitivity and speed modulation are reflected in transition-active neurons</title><p>Given that ablation of patchy neurons induced excess locomotor vigor with respect to restful navigation in dark and during BIL transition periods, we hypothesized that patchy neurons active at these time points would possess negative correlations to speed. Limited neuronal activity at predominantly resting states in the dark zone meant that we were unable to perform meaningful analysis of neuron types in these moments, and we focused instead on zone transitions. We found a significant interaction between transition-active status and zone/speed relationships (χ<sup>2</sup>(4, n=1565)=137.3, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) such that cells jointly encoding both light and speed were most abundant among transition-active neurons. Meanwhile, purely speed-related cells, dark and speed-related cells, and cells with no identified zone or speed relationship were most abundant among neurons <italic>not</italic> active at transitions. The most common speed relationship remained quadratic-negative among transition-active neurons, like all neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J, L</xref>).

Comparison of neurons exclusively active while BIL or else selectively active while BID at transitions illustrated both sensitivity to zone, as well as a predominance of DP among zone-discriminating neurons at the transition moment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This was obscured when considering all neurons active during transition (whose coincident activity with transition could be random) rather than those selectively active while BIL or BID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M</xref>). Thus, neurons which appear to best discriminate zone transition based on acute shifts in relative valence are also DP neurons.

During LDbox behavior, we used fiber photometry to collect the activity of patchy neuron axon terminals at each of these efferent nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Moreover, these data show that activity of patchy striatonigral neurons precedes and may, therefore, lead to locomotor deceleration, and that patch neurons are more frequently active while mice reside within the dark zone of LDb.</p><p>We then investigated whether other types of striatal neurons, particularly those residing in the surrounding matrix compartments, play a similar role in LDb.

These results indicate that, despite similarity in coarse firing patterns at SNr, patchy neuron efferent activity is strongly tied to LDbox speed and deceleration at zone transitions, while matrix neuron efferent activity is not.

Neither average nor maximum speed distinguished ChR mice from controls, and speed histograms overlapped for the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). A difference between groups was only observed in transition speeds when crossing between light and dark zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–J</xref>). Whereas controls demonstrated the expected phenotype of enhanced BIL speed (i.e. while approaching dark zone and retreating into light zone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), this reflection of acute zone discrimination through speed was blunted in ChR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Unlike controls, speed enhancement by BIL was quite small for ChR mice during transition approach (GLME fixed effects by group 95% CI (cm/s) in brackets: BIL increases approach speed for controls [1.041, 1.6462] more than for ChR [0.05499, 0.5939]. BIL increases retreat speed for controls [1.3526, 0.7299] and ChR [1.034, 0.5346], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). This result matches findings from gross patchy neuronal activity enhancement using DREADDs, which also reduced BIL vigor approaching transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). It is possible that a weaker phenotype was observed after optogenetically targeting SNr compared to chemogenetically targeting DS due to light scatter reaching fewer SNr fibers, or that additional neurons were involved in the broader locomotor suppression achieved with chemogenetics. Regardless, this data shows patchy neuron action at SNr is sufficient to selectively reduce valence-driven locomotor speed.</p><p>To test the behavioral impact of SNr efferents originating in the matrix, we carried out an identical optogenetic experiment in <italic>Calb1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–T</xref>).

Both groups demonstrated unaltered, basic LDb performance with greater stay time in the dark zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>) and greater speed in the light zone (control L vs D p&lt;0.0001, ChR L vs D p=0.0012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). No group difference existed in average or in maximum speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N and O</xref>). However, speed histograms distinguished ChR mice from controls. Compared to controls, ChR mice spent less time at rest in the dark zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>). Whereas controls spent significantly more time at speeds less than or equal to 2 cm/s in the dark zone than in the light zone, this difference disappeared for ChR mice (control L vs D p&lt;0.0001, ChR p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>). Both controls and ChR mice demonstrated the expected phenotype of enhanced BIL speed during zone transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q-S</xref>). In summary, optogenetically activating matrix striatonigral neuron terminals at SNr failed to reproduce the effect seen when activating patchy neuron terminals, illustrating their functional distinction at this synapse. Moreover, activating matrix terminals at SNr reproduced the effect on the speed histogram seen after patchy neuron ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T</xref>). This suggests that a shift in relative strength between patch and matrix pathways modulate LDb speed, so that when patchy neuron efferents are outweighed by matrix efferents (as in PA as well as <italic>Calb1</italic>-Cre ChR at SNr), animals rest less in the safety of the dark. These data are complementary in ascribing a role to patchy striatonigral neurons acting at the SNr to decelerate mice with respect to a valence differential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By focusing on free exploration of an innate valence differential, the present work reveals a previously undescribed, ethologically relevant role for patchy striatonigral neurons in governing implicit speed selection. These findings extend, complement, and challenge various prior data. Since movement velocity could be regulated through dopamine-dependent plasticity of striatal direct and indirect pathway strength to serve operant performance, this capacity for plasticity might function to translate implicit motivation into action vigor, or speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</xref>). Our work not only demonstrates that patchy striatonigral neurons possess the capacity for locomotor speed regulation, but our unique focus on untrained, free locomotion in the Light/dark box shows that this patchy neuron subpopulation is indeed naturally acting to translate implicit motivation (due to naturalistic contextual valence) into changes in locomotor speed. Another recent study parsed evaluative roles for patchy neuron subsets and noted speed changes during conditioned place preference, but only in the absence of any neuronal manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). Considering the present findings, this speed difference almost certainly reflected implicit motivation, analogous to the LDb control phenotype, but the impact of patchy neurons on speed itself remained untested. It has been shown that broad striatal activity positively correlates with speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2013</xref>), yet here, we find genetically defined patchy neurons, comprising approximately 85% direct and 15% indirect pathway neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2016</xref>), suppress speed. This suppression of speed under naturalistic conditions is a substantial departure from often-cited, correlative reports linking patchy neuron activation due to psychomotor stimulants with hyperkinetic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canales and Graybiel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saka et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the present data implicate patchy striatonigral neurons in slowing locomotion, specifically by acting within the SNr to decelerate mice. This finding is consistent with recent results from independent lines of patchy neuron-specific mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lazaridis et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okunomiya et al., 2025</xref>), contradicting the traditional view that the direct-pathway striatonigral neurons exclusively promote locomotion.</p><p>Potential mechanisms by which striatal patchy neurons reduce locomotion involve the suppression of dopamine availability within the striatum. Dopamine, primarily supplied by neurons in the SNc and VTA, broadly facilitates locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dudman and Krakauer, 2016</xref>). Recent studies have shown that direct activation of patchy neurons leads to a reduction in striatal dopamine levels, accompanied by decreased walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nadel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okunomiya et al., 2025</xref>). Patchy neuron projections terminate in structures known as ‘dendron bouquets,’ which enwrap SNc dendrites within the SNr and can pause tonic dopamine neuron firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crittenden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2020</xref>). The present work highlights a role for patchy striatonigral inputs within the SN in decelerating movement, potentially through GABAergic dendron bouquets that limit dopamine release back to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2025</xref>). Additionally, intrastriatal collaterals of patch spiny projection neurons (SPNs) have been shown to suppress dopamine release and associated synaptic plasticity via dynorphin-mediated activation of kappa opioid receptors on dopamine terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hawes et al., 2017</xref>). This intrastriatal mechanism may further contribute to the reduction in striatal dopamine levels and the observed decrease in locomotor speed, representing a compelling avenue for future investigation.</p><p>We found that recorded differences in neural activity distribution while mice resided in the light depended on whether they were approaching the dark zone or retreating into the light zone. This, along with our LL/DDbox controls, powerfully illustrates that the Light/dark box models a dynamic response to perceived situational valence rather than to simple light level. Patchy neuron activity among cell bodies showed increased activity while the animal body resided in the light (BIL) to either side of a zone transition, but this was not true for patchy striatonigral efferents reaching to SNr. This suggests that distinct patchy neuronal subsets may be active depending not only on the current position of the mouse in light or dark zone, but on their current motivational state. Patchy neuron terminals in SNr showed BIL positively impacted ∆F/F entering light zone, but a negative BIL effect approaching transition, with a dip in activity in this moment. We believe this dip in deceleration-encoding activity helps to shape the control phenotype of greater BIL speed upstream of transition, particularly since BIL vigor on transition approach was dampened by exogenously enhancing patch neuron activity with chemogenetic or optogenetic manipulations. Although activity of matrix neuron efferents also differed in BIL impact surrounding transition, they showed no dip prior to the transition, and their activity was not correlated to speed or acceleration as was patch neurons’. It seems likely that a relative balance between patchy and matrix neuronal activity ultimately shapes locomotor speed, as is evidenced by the same speed histogram effect being achieved either by enhancing matrix or by ablating patchy neurons. Even without explicit patch neuron modulation, the BIL effect prior to the transition was lost in GRIN-implanted, mini scope-mounted mice. It is interesting to consider that excess handling and wearing of miniscopes may have led to natural patch neuron enhancement in this cohort, which is a documented response to chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>). Future experiments studying patchy neuron’s roles in valence-driven behavior will need to be designed cleverly to highlight distinctly valued moments while controlling for natural patchy neuron modulation by stress.</p><p>The potential conflict between findings of more abundant light-preferring neurons and more frequent neural activity in dark zone can be resolved with interesting implications. Determination of zone preference was made if a neuron expressed significantly higher net fluorescence while in one zone as opposed to the other. Net fluorescence takes area under the curve into consideration and is impacted by transient frequency, amplitude, and width. However, event frequency does not take into account transient amplitude or width. Moreover, due to the limitation of temporal dynamics of GCaMP fluorescence, transients with less than 1 s of separation between peaks could not be reliably distinguished, so that an aggregate of calcium influx cooccurring at greater than 1 Hz would be counted as a single event. Thus, our data suggest that many patchy neurons exhibit greater calcium influx while the animal resides within the light, potentially owing to summation of multiple large calcium entry events. At the same time, patchy neuron transients are more frequent within the dorsal striatum, GPe, GPi, and SNr (and matrix transients within SNr) while animals reside in the dark zone. It is appealing to consider that greater frequency of deceleration-encoding activity not only accompanies but promotes slower locomotion or more frequent pausing in the dark zone. Likewise, it is intriguing to consider that greater net fluorescence among patchy neurons in the light zone may translate to burst firing shown to differentially engage SNr-area efferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2020</xref>), potentially promoting locomotion through dopaminergic rebound firing.</p><p>Judicious interpretation of the present data must consider the technical limitations of the various methods and circuit-level manipulations applied. Patchy neurons are distributed unevenly across the extensive structure of the striatum, and their targeted manipulation is constrained by viral spread in the dorsal striatum. Somatic calcium imaging using single-photon microscopy captures activity from only a subset of patchy neurons within a narrow focal plane beneath each implanted GRIN lens. Similarly, limitations in light diffusion from optical fibers may reduce the effective population of targeted fibers in both photometry and optogenetic experiments. For example, the more modest locomotor slowing observed with optogenetic activation of striatonigral fibers in the SNr compared to the stronger effects seen with Gq-DREADD activation across the dorsal striatum could reflect limited fiber optic coverage in the SNr. Alternatively, it may suggest that non-striatonigral mechanisms also contribute to generalized slowing. Our photometry data do not support a role for striatopallidal projections from patchy neurons in movement suppression. The potential contribution of intrastriatal mechanisms, discussed earlier, remains to be empirically tested. Although the behavioral assays used were naturalistic, many of the circuit-level interventions were not. Broad ablation or widespread activation of patchy neurons and their efferent projections represent non-physiological manipulations. Nonetheless, these perturbation results are interpreted alongside more naturalistic observations, such as in vivo imaging of patchy neuron soma and axon terminals, to form a coherent understanding of their functional role.</p><p>Together with previous studies of naturally occurring shifts in patchy neuron activation, these data illustrate ethologically relevant roles for a subgroup of genetically defined patchy neurons in behavior. Recent works have shown cognitive conflict and stress lead to patchy neuron disinhibition, and to explicit choices favoring greater risk-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, our ablation data demonstrate that an innate cost-benefit choice present in Light/Dark box navigation leads to the patchy neuron-mediated implicit ‘choice’ to reduce speed in riskier settings (BIL). Together with earlier findings by Friedman, our results suggest that patchy neurons act to limit animals’ responsiveness to external stressors. These findings may also be unified if lower anxiety-related speed manifests lower anxiety, and, therefore, greater risk-taking and exploration. While dark preference was robust to patchy neuron manipulation, future experiments are warranted to probe the important relationship between anxious locomotor vigor and anxiety itself. The lowering of BIL speed may also indicate a change in allocation of energy or attention. Patchy neuronal activity has been shown to positively correlate with task engagement and perseveration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jenrette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nadel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nadel et al., 2021</xref>), implying support for habitual modes. Thus, by lowering BIL speed, patchy neurons may mediate a shift away from high alert and toward habit. We suspect that, by dampening response vigor to external valence, patchy neurons could conserve energy in safe (dark zone), familiar, or well-learned scenarios, alleviating cognitive demand at choice points and under duress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beste et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beste et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>The present findings may also be applied to interpret or predict patchy neuron’s contribution to disorders of attention, mood, and motor control, including Parkinson’s disease. However, because of the heterogeneity of patchy neurons, it will be important to employ additional mouse lines while continuing to study patchy neuron’s modulation by diverse afferents, including the prefrontal cortex and anxiety-related basal nucleus of the stria terminalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>), and to parse patchy neuron’s impact through efferent pathways including striosome-dendron bouquets and the lateral habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2020</xref>), in order to fully grasp patchy neuron’s importance in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animal work followed guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), NIH. Mice came from one of two lines: Sepw1-Cre (NP67) (gifted from Dr. Chip Gerfen of NIMH) or <italic>Calb1-</italic>IRES2-Cre-D (Stain #: 028532, The Jackson Laboratory). Mice were male and female on a C57BL/6 background and were 3–5 months old at the time of behavioral testing, except for two females aged 6 and 8 months to meet size requirements (&gt;25 g) for undergoing GRIN lens implantation. Mice were housed in a 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Behavioral tests were performed during the light cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotaxic injections</title><p>Stereotaxic survival surgery was performed with aseptic technique. Anesthetized mice were head-mounted to stereotaxic frames and Bregma and Lambda leveled to within 0.05 mm. Mice received an infusion of AAVs (5.85×10<sup>13</sup> g.c./mL AAV1-FLEX-taCasp3 from Vigene, 2.42×10<sup>13</sup> g.c./mL AAV5-EF1a-DIO-mCherry-WPRE from Vigene, 2.1×10<sup>13</sup> g.c./mL AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry from Addgene, 2.1×10<sup>13</sup> g.c./mL AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry from Addgene, 2.8×10<sup>12</sup> g.c./mL AAV9-syn-FLEX-jGCaMP8s-WPRE from Addgene, 2.3×10<sup>13</sup> g.c./mL AAV1-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-HGHpA from Addgene) through a vertically held syringe (2 µL Neuros Syringe, Hamilton). Infusion of these AAVs occurred at two points bilaterally for a total of four infusion sites per mouse with the following volumes, and at the following coordinates in mm relative to Bregma: 0.7–0.8 µL at AP 0.5, ML ± 2.2, DV –3; 0.5–0.6 µL at AP 1.5, ML ± 1.8, DV –3.5. Mice receiving GCaMP6s for calcium imaging (1.3×10<sup>13</sup> g.c./mL AAV8-CAG-FLEX-CGaMP6s-WPRE.25.641 from Vigene) were infused into the right hemisphere only through a 1700 series Gastight Hamilton syringe with 34 gauge needle and the tip entering the head angled 30 degrees toward rostral, delivering 0.5–0.6 µL to the following coordinates relative to Bregma: AP: −0.6 mm, M/L: +2 mm, D/V: −3 mm (D/V travel at 30 degrees from vertical, to avoid scar tissue in the future tract of the GRIN implant). All infusions were controlled by a motorized stereotaxic infusion pump (Stoelting) at a rate of 50–75 nL/min, with a 5 min wait between infusion completion and needle withdrawal. Scalp was closed with sutures and a small amount of Vetbond tissue adhesive (3 M) and coated in antibiotic ointment. Mice were given 5 mg/kg subcutaneous ketoprofen in lactated Ringer’s solution immediately following surgery, and daily for two subsequent days. Alternatively, mice were administered slow-release meloxicam subcutaneously for pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>GRIN lens implant</title><p>10–14 days following GCaMP6s infusion, mice underwent a second aseptic, stereotaxic survival surgery as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2019</xref> to implant a 1 mm diameter Gradient-Index (GRIN) lens to dorsal striatum. Briefly, this procedure involved the precise, robot-guided, vacuum excavation of a cylindrical tissue window centered at (relative to Bregma) A/P: +0.9 mm, M/L: +2 mm, and reaching –1.7 to –2 mm DV from dura. In later surgeries, implant depth was guided by epifluorescence signal detected during surgery using a stereo microscope fluorescence adapter (Night Sea). After lens placement, scalp was replaced by dental cement, extending up the sides of the GRIN lens to secure the implant, and mice were administered subcutaneous ketoprofen for three days as described above. Following 4 weeks recovery, non-surgical miniscope base-mounting was performed, permitting removable placement of the miniscope prior to experiments as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fiber implant</title><p>10–14 days following viral infusion, mice underwent a second aseptic, stereotaxic survival surgery to place fiber optics unilaterally for photometry (GCaMP8s) or else bilaterally for optogenetics (hChR2).

The light zone had white walls and was sub-lit by white light; the dark had black walls and was sub-lit by red light. Translucent chamber flooring diffused light and eliminated a visual cliff. A lux meter held at the zone division and perpendicular to the floor read 500 lux toward light versus 40 lux toward dark. The test was conducted in an otherwise dark room, to which mice acclimated 30 min prior to testing. For testing, each mouse was gently placed into the light zone and video recorded aerially for 10 min. Ethanol and water were used to wipe down chamber surfaces between mice. TopScan 3.0 (CleverSys Inc) was used for animal tracking in videos. Mice were scored as being either in the light zone or else in the dark zone, with a zone transition scored at the time (t=0) when the tail base follows the nose from one zone to the other. Surrounding zone transition, body-in-light (BIL) moments were defined by the tail base residing in light preceding a transition into dark and following a transition into light; body-in-dark (BID) moments were defined by the tail base residing in dark preceding a transition into light and following a transition into dark. Speed was extracted from mouse center of mass. Maximum speed attained was defined for each mouse as the greatest speed recorded for ≥20 behavioral video frames (30 frames per second collection rate). Data exported from TopScan were organized in R and MATLAB and analyzed in Prism 10. A total of 8–15 mice per group were used to detect moderate-to-large effects. Mice were randomly assigned, and their prior treatments were blinded to the experimenters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>LL/DD box</title><p>The same chambers used for LDb were used, with either entirely red lighting and black walls (Dark/Dark box), or entirely white sub-lighting and white walls (Light/Light box). Because chambers were constructed of slick, black plastic, wall color was reversibly modified by the application or removal of adhesive dry-erase laminate. The side the mice were initially placed into was deemed Side A and opposite side (analogous to LDb dark zone in terms of order of entry) was deemed Side B.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Behavior with DREADD</title><p>Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of JHU37160 at 0.3 mg/kg body weight 30 min before placement on the maze.

Mice were placed in a transfer cage within the testing room and allowed to acclimate 30 min prior to testing. Imaging experiments occurred in six 5 min sessions separated by 5 min rests in the home cage with LED powered off for cooling; the light and dark sides were switched between third and fourth sessions to control for spatial preference and to extend exploration. Otherwise, testing was completed identically to Light/Dark box described above. A total of 5–8 mice per group were used to detect moderate-to-large effects. Mice were randomly assigned, and their prior treatments were blinded to the experimenters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Behavior with fiber photometry or optogenetics</title><p>After acclimation to the test room, mice were scuffed briefly to attach unilateral (photometry) or bilateral (optogenetic) implanted fibers to fiber optic cables using ceramic cannula.

In the case of optogenetic experiments, 1 mW 465 nm blue light was delivered continuously beginning several seconds before placement on the maze and ending with the test. A total of 5–8 mice per group were used to detect moderate-to-large effects.

Brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and cryoprotected in 30% Sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich). 40 µm coronal or sagittal brain slices were sectioned using Leica cryostat CM3050S (Leica Biosystems) and stored at 4 °C in 0.03% Sodium Azide (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS until use. Sections were rinsed in 0.3 M Glycine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature to quench autofluorescence, washed 3×5 min in PBS, and then incubated in blocking solution, rocking at 4 °C overnight. The same blocking solution was used to block and to prepare all antibody dilutions and consisted of 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% Donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% bovine serum albumen (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Primary antibodies specific to TH (Rabbit 1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #P40101150; Chicken 1:500, Aves Labs, TYH), GFP (Chicken 1:500, Aves Labs, #GFP-1020), RFP (Mouse, Rockland Inc, #200301379) and MOR1 (Rabbit 1:3000, ImmunoStar, #24216) were freshly diluted and incubated rocking at 4 °C for two nights. Following 3×5 min rocking in PBS, Hoechst 33342 (1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich) or DAPI (1:10,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #62248) was combined in blocking solution together with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 488- (anti-chicken, #A11039), 568- (anti-Rb, #A10042; anti-Ms, #A-21124), or 647- (anti-Rb, #A21244). Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500. Tissue was incubated in secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature, or else rocking at 4 °C overnight. Fluorescence images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscopy LSM 780 (Zeiss). A 10× objective lens with 10% overlap in tiling was used to capture entire striatal hemispheres, while a 20× objective lens was used to capture higher magnification zones of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calcium image processing</title><p>Calcium images were processed and analyzed using scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks). Calcium images were first stabilized using motion correction toolbox NoRMCorre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017</xref>). Constrained non-negative matrix factorization-based calcium image processing toolbox CaImAn-MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>) was used to extract calcium signals. Images of all recording sessions were concatenated and temporally sub-sampled to half for calcium signal extraction. The calcium trace (ΔF/F) was set to zero if the value was below 3× baseline noise level, and ΔF/F was then normalized by ΔF/F/max (ΔF/F) for further data analysis. For each session, a global cell map was generated, including all the extracted neurons in that session, with a neuron denoted as active in one trial if it displayed calcium transient above 3× baseline noise level. To register the spatial footprints of neurons identified across different sessions, the displacement fields of the correlation image among sessions were first calculated using the MATLAB function (imregdemons) to estimate the shift due to the remounting of the miniscope and slow shift between the brain tissue and GRIN lens over time. The displacement fields were then applied to cell spatial footprints to align the rest of the sessions to the first session. Cell registration toolbox CellReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sheintuch et al., 2017</xref>) was then used for cell registration. Both distance model and spatial footprint model were used. Cosine similarity was used in our data. Pair-wise cell-cell distance and spatial footprint similarity was calculated from all recording sessions of all mice to decide the threshold of whether two cells in different sessions were the same or not. P<sub>same</sub> of 0.5 was used to choose the threshold. The cell with the highest spatial footprint similarity was chosen as the cell pair (same cell) if there were multiple cells that were above the threshold. Cell-to-cell mapping indices were then generated to indicate the relationship of the cell identity among sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>A Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) system was used to stimulate and collect GCaMP transients emitted at 465 nm along with simultaneous, non-specific emissions at 405 nm. Raw data were imported to MATLAB for analysis. A double exponential was fit to the demodulated signals and then was subtracted from the signals to flatten signals prior to normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Behavior and histology data were analyzed in Prism 10 software (GraphPad). Data normality or non-normality was determined by the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test before selection of parametric or non-parametric tests. Unless otherwise stated in the text, comparison between two groups was done through paired or unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests, Wilcoxon signed rank, or two-tailed Mann-Whitney (as appropriate). Comparison among more than two groups was done through repeated measures ANOVA or (where missing data precluded ANOVA) through Mixed-effects analysis prior to post hoc analysis by the above-mentioned tests. Comparison of the distribution of categorical variables among neurons was done through application of Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Significance was determined at the p&lt;0.05 level, and exact p-values are given for significant tests unless p&lt;0.0001, in which case p&lt;0.0001 is reported for brevity. Speed or ∆F/F surrounding zone transitions is analyzed –2 s to –0.6 s (approach) or +0.6 s to +2 s (retreat) from transition; significant divergence in these values is determined by non-overlap in 95% confidence intervals from generalized linear mixed-effects (GLME) models generated by MATLAB function fitglme with fixed effects of time, BIL, experimental group where applicable, and random effect of subject.

A cell was defined as light zone cell if ∆F/F<sub>light</sub> is significantly greater than ∆F/F<sub>dark</sub> (p&lt;0.05 /n, where n is the number of identified neurons in each mouse), and similarly, a cell was defined as dark zone cell if ∆F/F<sub>dark</sub> is significantly greater than ∆F/F<sub>light</sub>.</p><p>Identification of speed cells: For each cell, the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) between ∆F/F and locomotion speed was calculated. A cell was defined as linear+ (or linear-) cell if the SCC is significant (p&lt;0.05 /n, where n is the cell number for a given mouse; linear+: positive SCC and linear-: negative SCC). For cells lacking a significant SCC relationship, we fitted the activity speed relationship with quadratic curve (ax<sup>2</sup>+bx + c). A cell was defined as quadratic + (a&gt;0) and quadratic- (a&lt;0) if the goodness of fit is above 0.3.</p><p>Relationship between neural activity and acceleration: We first calculated the movement acceleration and binarize the acceleration by a threshold of 0.4 cm/s<sup>2</sup>.

ROC curves were calculated by comparing the distribution of calcium activity within acceleration period versus the distribution of calcium activity within deceleration period. We then calculated the acceleration/deceleration preference by adjusted area under ROC curve (auROC) i.e., (auROC-0.5)×2.</p><p>Identification of transition-active cells: Those neurons active above a threshold of 0.0238 AU (determined by group activity) any time from 2 s preceding to 2 s following t=0 zone transition moments were defined as active during transitions.</p><p>Correlation to speed or acceleration: For photometry data (and aggregate fluorescence from single-cell imaging), acceleration events were identified as 4 s windows centered on an acceleration onset and having average speed exceeding 6 cm/s. Acceleration events were then separated into those for which the central acceleration moment falls in one of four groups: within light, within dark, or within a transition window in either direction. The MATLAB function xcorr was used to calculate R-values and lags for cross-correlation between ∆F/F and speed or else acceleration for each of these groups using all qualifying acceleration events.</p><p>Event frequency detection: For photometry data (and aggregate fluorescence from single-cell imaging), fluorescent events were detected as peaks with minimum distance of 1 s and exceeding 1.5 standard deviations from the mean of the flattened, normalized signal.

Using Sepw1-Cre line, the authors combined a modified version of the light/dark transition box test that allows them to examine locomotor activity in different environmental valence with a variety of approaches, including cell-type-specific ablation, miniscope calcium imaging, fiber photometry, and opto-/chemogenetics. First, they found ablation of patchy striatal neurons resulted in an increase in movement vigor when mice stayed in a safe area or when they moved back from more anxiogenic to safe environments. The following miniscope imaging experiment revealed that a larger fraction of striatal patchy neurons was negatively correlated with movement speed, particularly in an anxiogenic area. Next, the authors investigated differential activity patterns of patchy neurons' axon terminals, focusing on those in GPe, GPi, and SNr, showing that the patchy axons in SNr reflect movement speed/vigor. Chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of these patchy striatal neurons suppressed the locomotor vigor, thus demonstrating their causal role in the modulation of locomotor vigor when exposed to valence differentials. Unlike the activation of striatal patches, such a suppressive effect on locomotion was absent when optogenetically activating matrix neurons by using the Calb1-Cre line, indicating distinctive roles in the control of locomotor vigor by striatal patch and matrix neurons.

Although similar findings were reported previously, the authors' results will be of value owing to multiple levels of investigation. In my view, this study will add to the important literature by demonstrating how patch (striosomal) neurons in the striatum controls movement vigor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106403.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Hawes et al. combined behavioral, optical imaging, and activity manipulation techniques to investigate the role of striatal patch SPNs in locomotion regulation.

Specifically, we wrote:</p><p>“Judicious interpretation of the present data must consider the technical limitations of the various methods and circuit-level manipulations applied. Patchy neurons are distributed unevenly across the extensive structure of the striatum, and their targeted manipulation is constrained by viral spread in the dorsal striatum. Somatic calcium imaging using single-photon microscopy captures activity from only a subset of patchy neurons within a narrow focal plane beneath each implanted GRIN lens. Similarly, limitations in light diffusion from optical fibers may reduce the effective population of targeted fibers in both photometry and optogenetic experiments. For example, the more modest locomotor slowing observed with optogenetic activation of striatonigral fibers in the SNr compared to the stronger effects seen with Gq-DREADD activation across the dorsal striatum could reflect limited fiber optic coverage in the SNr.Alternatively, it may suggest that non-striatonigral mechanisms also contribute to generalized slowing. Our photometry data do not support a role for striatopallidal projections from patchy neurons in movement suppression. The potential contribution of intrastriatal mechanisms, discussed earlier, remains to be empirically tested. Although the behavioral assays used were naturalistic, many of the circuit-level interventions were not. Broad ablation or widespread activation of patchy neurons and their efferent projections represent non-physiological manipulations. Nonetheless, these perturbation results are interpreted alongside more naturalistic observations, such as in vivo imaging of patchy neuron somata and axon terminals, to form a coherent understanding of their functional role”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Hawes et al. investigated the role of striatal neurons in the patch compartment of the dorsal striatum. Using Sepw1-Cre line, the authors combined a modified version of the light/dark transition box test that allows them to examine locomotor activity in different environmental valence with a variety of approaches, including cell-type-specific ablation, miniscope calcium imaging, fiber photometry, and opto-/chemogenetics. First, they found ablation of patchy striatal neurons resulted in an increase in movement vigor when mice stayed in a safe area or when they moved back from more anxiogenic to safe environments. The following miniscope imaging experiment revealed that a larger fraction of striatal patchy neurons was negatively correlated with movement speed, particularly in an anxiogenic area. Next, the authors investigated differential activity patterns of patchy neurons' axon terminals, focusing on those in GPe, GPi, and SNr, showing that the patchy axons in SNr reflect movement speed/vigor. Chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of these patchy striatal neurons suppressed the locomotor vigor, thus demonstrating their causal role in the modulation of locomotor vigor when exposed to valence differentials. Unlike the activation of striatal patches, such a suppressive effect on locomotion was absent when optogenetically activating matrix neurons by using the Calb1-Cre line, indicating distinctive roles in the control of locomotor vigor by striatal patch and matrix neurons. Together, they have concluded that nigrostriatal neurons within striatal patches negatively regulate movement vigor, dependent on behavioral contexts where motivational valence differs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s thorough summary of our main findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my view, this study will add to the important literature by demonstrating how patch (striosomal) neurons in the striatum control movement vigor. This study has applied multiple approaches to investigate their functionality in locomotor behavior, and the obtained data largely support their conclusions. Nevertheless, I have some suggestions for improvements in the manuscript and figures regarding their data interpretation, accuracy, and efficacy of data presentation</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s overall positive assessment and have made substantial improvements to the revised manuscript in response to reviewers’ constructive suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The authors found that the activation of the striatonigral pathway in the patch compartment suppresses locomotor speed, which contradicts with canonical roles of the direct pathway. It would be great if the authors could provide mechanistic explanations in the Discussion section. One possibility is that striatal D1R patch neurons directly inhibit dopaminergic cells that regulate movement vigor (Nadal et al., Sci. Rep., 2021; Okunomiya et al., J Neurosci., 2025). Providing plausible explanations will help readers infer possible physiological processes and give them ideas for future follow-up studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the recommended data interpretation and future perspectives on Page 30 of the revised Discussion section. Specifically, we wrote:</p><p>“Potential mechanisms by which striatal patchy neurons reduce locomotion involve the supression of dopamine availability within the striatum. Dopamine, primarily supplied by neurons in the SNc and VTA,broadly facilitates locomotion (Gerfen and Surmeier 2011, Dudman and Krakauer 2016). Recent studies have shown that direct activation of patchy neurons leads to a reduction in striatal dopamine levels, accompanied by decreased walking speed (Nadel, Pawelko et al. 2021, Dong, Wang et al. 2025, Okunomiya, Watanabe et al. 2025). Patchy neuron projections terminate in structures known as “dendron bouquets”, which enwrap SNc dendrites within the SNr and can pause tonic dopamine neuron firing (Crittenden, Tillberg et al. 2016, Evans, Twedell et al. 2020). The present work highlights a role for patchy striatonigral inputs within the SN in decelerating movement, potentially through GABAergic dendron bouquets that limit dopamine release back to the striatum (Dong, Wang et al. 2025). Additionally, intrastriatal collaterals of patch spiny projection neurons (SPNs) have been shown to suppress dopamine release and associated synaptic plasticity via dynorphin-mediated activation of kappa opioid receptors on dopamine terminals (Hawes, Salinas et al. 2017). This intrastriatal mechanism may further contribute to the reduction in striatal dopamine levels and the observed decrease in locomotor speed, representing a compelling avenue for future investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) On page 14, Line 301, the authors stated that &quot;Cre-dependent mCheery signals were colocalized with the patch marker (MOR1) in the dorsal striatum (Fig. 1B)&quot;.

For the sake of better interpretation, it may be good to add a statement in Lines 365-366 that these experiments suggest the absence of hyperactive locomotion in general by ablating these specific neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added the following statement on Page 17 of the revised manuscript: “These data also indicate that PA elevates valence-specific speed without inducing general hyperactivity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Line 536, where Figure 5A was cited, the author mentioned that they used inhibitory DREADDs (AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherrry), but I could not find associated data on Figure 5.

Using Sepw1-Cre transgenic mice, they found that patch SPNs encode locomotion deceleration in a light-dark box procedure through optical imaging techniques. Moreover, genetic ablation of patch SPNs increased locomotion speed, while chemogenetic activation of these neurons decreased it. The authors concluded that a subtype of patch striatonigral neurons modulates locomotion speed based on external environmental cues. Below are some major concerns:</p><p>The study concludes that patch striatonigral neurons regulate locomotion speed. However, unless I missed something, very little evidence is presented to support the idea that it is specifically striatonigral neurons, rather than striatopallidal neurons, that mediate these effects. In fact, the optogenetic experiments shown in Fig. 6 suggest otherwise. What about the behavioral effects of optogenetic stimulation of striatonigral versus striatopallidal neuron somas in Sepw1-Cre mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Our photometry data implicate striatonigral neurons in locomotor slowing, as evidenced by a negative cross-correlation with acceleration and a negative lag, indicating that their activity reliably precedes—and may therefore contribute to—deceleration. In contrast, photometry results from striatopallidal neurons showed no clear correlation with speed or acceleration.</p><p>Figure 6 demonstrates that optogenetic manipulation within the SNr of Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> striatonigral axons recapitulated context-dependent locomotor changes seen with Gq-DREADD activation of both striatonigral and striatopallidal Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal striatum but failed to produce the broader locomotor speed change observed when targeting all Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal striatum using either ablation or Gq-DREADD activation. The more subtle speed-restrictive phenotype resulting from ChR activation in the SNr could, as the reviewer suggests, implicate striatopallidal neurons in broad locomotor speed regulation. However, our photometry data indicate that this scenario is unlikely, as activity of striatopallidal Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> fibers is not correlated with locomotor speed. Another plausible explanation is that the optogenetic approach may have affected fewer striatonigral fibers, potentially due to the limited spatial spread of light from the optical fiber within the SNr. Broad locomotor speed change in LDbox might require the recruitment of a larger number of striatonigral fibers than we were able to manipulate with optogenetics. We have added discussion of these technical limitations to the revised manuscript. Additionally, we now discuss the possibility that intrastriatal collaterals may contribute to reduced local dopamine levels by releasing dynorphin, which acts on kappa opioid receptors located on dopamine fibers (Hawes, Salinas et al. 2017), thereby suppressing dopamine release.</p><p>The reviewer also suggests an interesting experiment involving optogenetic stimulation of striatonigral versus striatopallidal somata in Sepw1-Cre mice. While we agree that this approach would yield valuable insights, we have thus far been unable to achieve reliable results using retroviral vectors. Moreover, selectively targeting striatopallidal terminals optogenetically remains technically challenging, as striatonigral fibers also traverse the pallidum, and the broad anatomical distribution of the pallidum complicates precise targeting. This proposed work will need to be pursued in a future study, either with improved retrograde viral tools or the development of additional mouse lines that offer more selective access to these neuronal populations as we documented recently (Dong, Wang et al. 2025).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the abstract, the authors state that patch SPNs control speed without affecting valence. This claim seems to lack sufficient data to support it. Additionally, speed, velocity, and acceleration are very distinct qualities. It is necessary to clarify precisely what patch neurons encode and control in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer’s interpretation pertains to a statement in the Introduction rather than the Abstract: “Our findings reveal that patchy SPNs control the speed at which mice navigate the valence differential between high- and low-anxiety zones, without affecting valence perception itself.” Throughout our study, mice consistently preferred the dark zone in the Light/Dark box, indicating intact perception of the valence differential between illuminated areas. While our manipulations altered locomotor speed, they did not affect time spent in the dark zone, supporting the conclusion that valence perception remained unaltered. We appreciate the reviewer’s insight and agree it is an intriguing possibility that locomotor responses could, over time, influence internal states such as anxiety. We addressed this in the Discussion, noting that while dark preference was robust to our manipulations, future studies are warranted to explore the relationship between anxious locomotor vigor and anxiety itself. We report changes in scalar measures of animal speed across Light/Dark box conditions and under various experimental manipulations. Separately, we show that activity in both patchy neuron somata and striatonigral fibers is negatively correlated with acceleration—indicating a positive correlation with deceleration. Notably, the direction of the cross-correlational lag between striatonigral fiber activity and acceleration suggests that this activity precedes and may causally contribute to mouse deceleration, thereby influencing reductions in speed. To clarify this, we revised a sentence in the Results section:</p><p>“Moreover, patchy neuron efferent activity at the SNr may causally contribute to deceleration, asindicated by the negative cross-correlational lag, thereby reducing animal speed.”. We also updated the Discussion to read: “Together, these data specifically implicate patchy striatonigral neurons in slowing locomotion by acting within the SNr to drive deceleration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the major results relies on chemogenetic manipulation (Figure 5). It would be helpful to demonstrate through slice electrophysiology that hM3Dq and hM4Di indeed cause changes in the activity of dorsal striatal SPNs, as intended by the DREADD system. This would support both the positive (Gq) and negative (Gi) findings, where no effects on behavior were observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unable to perform this experiment; however, hM3Dq has previously been shown to be effective in striatal neurons (Alcacer, Andreoli et al. 2017). The lack of effect observed in GiDREADD mice serves as an unintended but valuable control, helping to rule out off-target effects of the DREADD agonist JHU37160 and thereby reinforcing the specificity of hM3Dq-mediated activation in our study. We have now included an important caveat regarding the Gi-DREADD results, acknowledging the possibility that they may not have worked effectively in our target cells:</p><p>“Potential explanations for the negative results in Gi-DREADD mice include inherently low basal activity among patchy neurons or insufficient expression of GIRK channels in striatal neurons, which may limit the effectiveness of Gicoupling in suppressing neuronal activity (Shan, Fang et al. 2022).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, could the behavioral effects observed in the current study, resulting from various manipulations of patch SPNs, be due to alterations in nigrostriatal dopamine release within the dorsal striatum?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important potential implication of our work, especially given that we and others have shown that patchy striatonigral neurons provide strong inhibitory input to dopaminergic neurons involved in locomotor control (Nadel, Pawelko et al. 2021, Lazaridis, Crittenden et al. 2024, Dong, Wang et al. 2025, Okunomiya, Watanabe et al. 2025). Accordingly, we have expanded the discussion section to include potential mechanistic explanations that support and contextualize our main findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Here are some minor issues for the authors' reference:</p><p>(1) This work supports the motor-suppressing effect of patchy SPNs, and &gt;80% of them are direct pathway SPNs. This conclusion is not expected from the traditional basal ganglia direct/indirect pathway model. Most experiments were performed using nonphysiological approaches to suppress (i.e., ablation) or activate (i.e., continuous chemo-optogenetic stimulation). It remains uncertain if the reported observations are relevant to the normal biological function of patchy SPNs under physiological conditions. Particularly, under what circumstances an imbalanced patch/matrix activity may be induced, as proposed in the sections related to the data presented in Figure 6. A thorough discussion and clarification remain needed. Or it should be discussed as a limitation of the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added discussion and clarification of physiological limitations in response to reviewer feedback. Additionally, we revised the opening sentence of an original paragraph in the discussion section to emphasize that it interprets our findings in the context of more physiological studies reporting natural shifts in patchy SPN activity due to cognitive conflict, stress, or training. The revised opening sentence now reads: “Together with previous studies of naturally occurring shifts in patchy neuron activation, these data illustrate ethologically relevant roles for a subgroup of genetically defined patchy neurons in behavior.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 499-500: How striato-nigral cells encode speed and deceleration deserves a thorough discussion and clarification.

Clarifications are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>For mice undergoing constant ChR2 activation of Sepw1-Cre+ SNr efferents, overall locomotor speed does not differ from controls. However, the BIL (bright-to-illuminated) effect on zone transitions isdisrupted: activating Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> fibers in the SNr blunts the typical increase in speed observed when mice flee from the light zone toward the dark zone. This impaired BIL-related speed increase upon exiting the light was similarly observed in the Gq-DREADD cohort. The reviewer is correct that this optogenetic manipulation within the SNr did not produce the more generalized speed reductions seen with broader Gq-DREADD activation of all Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal striatum. A likely explanation is the difference in targeting—ChR2 specifically activates SNr-bound terminals, whereas Gq-DREADD broadly activates entire Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells. Notably, many of the generalized speed profile changes observed with chemogenetic activation are opposite to those resulting from broad ablation of Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells. The more subtle speed-restrictive phenotype observed with ChR2 activation targeted to the SNr may suggest that fewer striatonigral fibers were affected by this technique, possibly due to the limited spread of light from the fiber optic. Broad locomotor speed change in LDbox might require the recruitment of a larger number of striatonigral fibers than we were able to manipulate with an optogenetic approach. Alternatively, it could indicate that non-striatonigral Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> projections—such as striatopallidal or intrastriatal pathways—play a role in more generalized slowing. If striatopallidal fibers contributed to locomotor slowing, we would expect to see non-zero cross-correlations between neural activity and speed or acceleration, along with negative lag indicating that neural activity precedes the behavioral change. However, our fiber photometry data do not support such a role for Sepw1-Cre<sup>+</sup> striatopallidal fibers. We have also referenced the possibility that intrastriatal collaterals could suppress striatal dopamine levels, potentially explaining the stronger slowing phenotype observed when the entire striatal population is affected, as opposed to selectively targeting striatonigral terminals. These technical considerations and interpretive nuances have been incorporated and clarified in the revised discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Lines 632: &quot;compliment&quot;: a typo?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it should be “complement”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Figure 4 legend: descriptions of panels A and B were swapped</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.
