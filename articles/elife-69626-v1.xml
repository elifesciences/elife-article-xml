modulates spinal pruriceptive transmission. RVM ON cells are activated by noxious algesic and pruritic stimuli and are pronociceptive. Many RVM-spinal projection neurons express the neurokinin-1 receptor (Tacr1), and ON-cells are excited by local administration of substance P (SP). We hypothesized that Tacr1-expressing RVM ON cells exert an inhibitory effect on itch opposite to their pronociceptive action. Intramedullary microinjection of SP significantly potentiated RVM ON cells and reduced pruritogen-evoked scratching while producing mild mechanical sensitization. Chemogenetic activation of RVM Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons also reduced acute pruritogen-evoked scratching. Optotagging experiments confirmed RVM Tacr1-expressing neurons to be ON cells. We conclude that Tacr1-expressing ON cells in RVM play a significant role in the modulation of pruriceptive transmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>itch</kwd><kwd>descending modulation</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>RVM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR076434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carstens</surname><given-names>Earl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR057194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carstens</surname><given-names>Earl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR063772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS096705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS113371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Eileen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Eileen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of Tacr1-expressing neurons including ON cells in the rostral ventromedial medulla inhibits acute and chronic itch-related behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transmission of somatosensory information in the spinal cord is under top-down modulation and has been extensively studied in the context of pain signaling. Descending modulation of pain is reflected by phenomena such as expectation (placebo and nocebo), diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartels et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chebbi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Damien et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Bars, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lockwood and Dickenson, 2020</xref>). Descending modulation is also thought to underlie stress mediated changes in pain threshold, with acute stress inhibiting and chronic stress facilitating nociceptive transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler and Finn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jennings et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wager and Atlas, 2015</xref>). Recent studies indicate that the spinal transmission of pruriceptive information is also under descending modulatory influences, but it is not known whether itch is modulated in the same way as pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agostinelli and Bassuk, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samineni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) contains neurons with descending projections to the spinal cord which bidirectionally modulate spinal nociceptive transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fields and Basbaum, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fields and Heinricher, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heinricher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Millan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ossipov et al., 2014</xref>). RVM ON cells are excited and OFF cells are inhibited by noxious stimulation just prior to a nocifensive withdrawal reflex, and respectively facilitate and inhibit spinal nociceptive transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fields et al., 1983</xref>). Increased ON cell and decreased OFF cell firing are thought to contribute to the chronification of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ossipov et al., 2014</xref>). Neutral cells do not exhibit any significant response to noxious stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbaro et al., 1986</xref>). Many RVM neurons project to the spinal cord via the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF), terminating in layers I, II, and V, and are implicated in the analgesic effects of opioids. It is still unknown whether the RVM ON and OFF cells are involved in the modulation of itch transmission.</p><p>A recent study reported that neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) expressing Tac1, the gene for substance P (SP), project to and make an excitatory glutamatergic connection with neurons in the RVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of these PAG neurons promotes scratching. A population of GABAergic neurons originating in the RVM synapse onto spinal neurons that express the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), which are considered to be essential for spinal pruriceptive transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun and Chen, 2007</xref>). Activation of GABAergic and inhibition of glutamatergic neurons in PAG reduced scratching behavior in both acute and chronic itch conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samineni et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, pruritogens were shown to excite ON and inhibit OFF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Follansbee et al., 2018</xref>). Cervical cold block, which diminishes activity in descending modulatory pathways, decreased pruritogen-evoked activity and facilitated algogen-evoked activity of spinal cord neurons implying opposing effects of descending modulatory pathways on nociceptive and pruriceptive transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carstens et al., 2018</xref>). The current evidence suggests that at least two classes of PAG neurons, via connections to RVM cells, exert bimodal effects on the spinal pain and itch signaling pathways. Since activation of PAG <italic>tac1r</italic> neurons facilitates itch this implies that activation of RVM Tacr1-expressing neurons may likewise facilitate itch. However, RVM ON cells are known to facilitate pain, and thus may have an opposing effect on itch transmission.</p><p>Here we investigated the role of Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons in itch modulation. In the present study, we used pharmacological and opto/chemogenetic methods to selectively activate RVM Tacr1-expressing cells, which we hypothesize represent a population of RVM ON cells, and assessed the effects on pruritogen-evoked scratching, and thermal and mechanical nociceptive behavior. When RVM Tacr1-expressings cells were activated, we observed that itch related behaviors were inhibited, while producing mild mechanical sensitization. We used optotagging to characterize these RVM Tacr1-expressing neurons as RVM ON cells. These results are the first to demonstrate an inhibitory effect of RVM ON cells on itch transmission, contrary to their known pronociceptive function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SP enhances RVM ON-cell responses to pinch</title><p>In rats, responses of RVM ON cells were potentiated by intramedullary microinjection of the Tacr1 agonist SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budai et al., 2007</xref>) and we wished to determine whether this is true in mouse. We identified RVM ON cells using in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recordings, with the criterion that noxious pinch elicited a &gt;30% increase in firing that preceded the onset of the hindpaw withdrawal. Using a microinjection cannula attached to a recording microelectrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), SP or saline was microinjected while recording from an ON cell in anesthetized mice.

Four weeks later, the mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital for single-unit recording with a microelectrode whose tip extended a few hundred micrometers beyond the tip of an optic fiber it was affixed to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Injected mice exhibited robust expression of eYFP in the RVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). ON and OFF cells were identified based on their response to a pinch stimulus. Once identified, blue light (473 nm, 0.25â5 mW) was applied and the cell was tested for entrainment to the light stimulus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows an example of an ON cell in RVM that responded to pinch prior to the onset of EMG activity and was faithfully entrained to 5 hz light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This neuron received a total of 37 light pulses at 2 hz and fired 32 action potentials within 20ms of the light onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) with a calculated efficiency index of 0.86 (see below), and an average latency of 8.14ms. The latencies measured presently compare favorably with those reported previously for hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The latency, or on rate, of neuronal activation differs by cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herman et al., 2014</xref>) and increases with diminishing light density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). Out of 22 identified ON cells, 17 were entrained to the light stimulus, 1 was inhibited and 4 were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). It is possible that our estimate is an under representation since viral transduction was not completely efficacious. At the end of the recording a lesion was produced which we histologically verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Since the majority of RVM ON cells were entrained to light stimulation, we conclude that the majority of ON cells likewise express Tacr1.</p><p>While our primary interest was RVM ON cells, we wanted to determine whether Tacr1 is also expressed in other cell types, such as RVM OFF cells. During our recordings we often found RVM OFF cells. Out of 14 identified OFF cells, none were directly activated by the light stimulus, with 7 showing a clear inhibitory response to the light stimulation while the other 7 were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Often the degree of inhibition of the OFF cell increased proportionately to the stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâI</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that RVM ON cells provide an inhibitory input onto RVM OFF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fields and Heinricher, 1989</xref>) and may underlie the RVM OFF cell mediated pause during noxious stimulation.</p><p>Occasionally, Neutral cells were identified by their response to optic stimulation (n=3), and each was strongly entrained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Since Neutral cells are numerous, not affected by noxious stimulation and their contribution, if any, to descending modulation is unknown, they were not investigated further. We thus conclude that while most presently-recorded light-sensitive cells were ON cells, other cell types including Neutral cells also expresses Tacr1.</p><p>To validate our results from optotagging, we used several metrics to determine whether a light-sensitive neuron was truly entrained to the optic stimulus. We assumed that each optic stimulus was likely to directly excite a neuron expressing ChR2 and tested this in different ways. An efficiency index was calculated to determine whether a neuron was entrained to the optic stimulus, by counting the number of evoked action potentials divided by the number of optic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The 3 Neutral cells had the highest efficiency index (&gt;1), which was due to occasional firing of âdoubletâ action potentials in response to the optic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>). ON cells classified as light sensitive also had a high efficiency index, which decreased with increasing optic stimulation frequency most likely due to desensitization of ChR2. We additionally assumed that the neuronal firing rate would reflect the number of optic stimuli. Indeed, the neuronal firing rate in light sensitive neurons increased with the stimulation frequency, while non-light sensitive neurons showed no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In neurons which were inhibited by optic stimulation, there was a decrease in firing rate following light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>, OFF cells). Finally, we assumed that the light-evoked latency of neuronal action potentials would be consistent. For the population of light-sensitive ON cells, the average latency of responses to the optic stimuli delivered at 2 hz was 7.6 (+/-1.12) ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, these experiments strongly support the hypothesis that the majority of RVM ON cells express Tacr1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies indicate a pronociceptive role for SP acting at Tacr1 expressing neurons in RVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budai et al., 2007</xref>), many of which have descending spinal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinto et al., 2008</xref>). A novel finding of the present study is that pharmacological and chemogenetic activation of Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons inhibited itch-related scratching behavior, with mild mechanical sensitization and no effect on thermal nociception. Our optotagging experiments provide evidence that the majority of ON cells express Tacr1. These results argue for a causal role of a subpopulation of Tacr1-expressing ON cells in the inhibition of itch-related scratching behavior, in contrast to their pronociceptive role.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of SP in RVM in descending modulation of pain and itch</title><p>SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ljungdahl et al., 1978</xref>) and Tacr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saffroy et al., 2003</xref>) are present within the RVM. SP acting in the RVM potentiated ON cells, induced pronociceptive behavioral effects and sensitized spinal wide dynamic range dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khasabov et al., 2017b</xref>). SP appears not to be released in the RVM in the absence of injury, but is released under inflammatory conditions elicited by CFA or capsaicin to induce Tacr1-dependent hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brink et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamity et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khasabov et al., 2017a</xref>). The present study expands on this work in important ways. Firstly, we confirm that SP potentiates noxious pinch-evoked responses of mouse RVM ON cells. Secondly, our optotagging data provide evidence that the Tacr1-expressing neurons are ON cells. Importantly, our results support a role for these neurons in the inhibition of acute and chronic itch. Intra-RVM microinjection of SP or chemogenetic activation of Tacr1-expressing neurons in two different Tacr1 cre lines significantly decreased pruritogen-evoked as well as chronic itch related scratching behavior, while facilitating mechanical nociception in most experiments with no effect on thermal nociception. This latter observation contrasts with a previous report that intra-RVM microinjection of an SP agonist enhanced thermal nociceptive behavior in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khasabov et al., 2017b</xref>) a discrepancy that might be attributed to a species difference.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Descending modulation of itch</title><p>Optogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in RVM facilitated mechanical, but not thermal nociception in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">FranÃ§ois et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with our data. The latter authors suggested that the GABAergic RVM neurons might represent ON cells, which descend to presynaptically inhibit mechanonociceptor input onto spinal inhibitory enkephalinergic interneurons that in turn contact the spinal mechanonociceptive pathway. Thus, activation of the descending GABAergic neurons would facilitate mechanical nociception via disinhibition.</p><p>Our study shows that RVM Tacr1 neurons represent a population of RVM ON cells, which when activated, reduce pruritogen-evoked scratching. A limitation of this study is that we were not able to directly demonstrate that inhibition of spinal pruriceptive transmission caused the reduction in scratching behavior. Previous studies have shown that 31% of functionally identified RVM ON cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vanegas et al., 1984</xref>), and 42.5% of Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinto et al., 2008</xref>), project to the spinal cord, supporting the descending modulation of spinal itch processing. Moreover, recent studies report that activation of spinal projection neurons originating in the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koga et al., 2020</xref>) or somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2021</xref>) suppress itch-related scratching behavior. Given this and the historical evidence of the spinal action of RVM ON cells, the most parsimonious explanation is that RVM Tacr1-expressing neurons with descending axons exert an inhibitory effect on spinal pruriceptive transmission to reduce scratching behavior. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons lacking spinal projections exert an antipruritic effect via an unknown supraspinal action.</p><p>It was recently reported that activation of neurons in RVM that express the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) suppresses signs of acute and chronic itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). It is currently not known if GPER-expressing neurons co-express Tacr1.</p><p>Electrical stimulation of the PAG inhibited nocifensive behavior in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayer et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reynolds, 1969</xref>), and the PAG projects directly to the RVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behbehani and Fields, 1979</xref>). Activation of PAG GABAergic neurons, and inhibition of glutamatergic neurons, reduced scratching behavior under both acute and chronic itch conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samineni et al., 2019</xref>) but facilitated nocifensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Samineni et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of Tac1 (SP-expressing) neurons in the PAG was shown to facilitate pruritogen-evoked scratching via release of glutamate onto neurons in the RVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, our results indicate that activation of RVM Tacr1 neurons inhibited pruritogen-evoked scratching behavior. This potentially represents a difference in the synaptic connections of PAG Tac1-expressing neurons with glutamate- and/or Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons. Previous studies have reported projections to RVM from SP-expressing neurons located in dorsolateral PAG, dorsal raphe nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, and lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holden and Pizzi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). It is thus possible that Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons that inhibit scratching are activated by different SP inputs than the RVM neurons activated by PAG TAc1-expressing neurons that facilitate scratching.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Modality specific role of RVM ON cells</title><p>For decades, the role of RVM ON cells has been considered faciliatory for spinal nociceptive transmission. Our results suggest that the role of RVM ON cells is modality specific, with RVM ON cells facilitating spinal nociceptive while inhibiting pruriceptive transmission. Pruritogens and algogens similarly excited RVM ON and inhibited OFF cells, implying that the opposing modulatory effects of ON cells on spinal nociceptive vs. pruriceptive transmission likely occurs via separate spinal circuits. RVM ON cells have a GABA-mediated inhibitory connection to spinal enkephalinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">FranÃ§ois et al., 2017</xref>), raising the possibility that spinal enkephalinergic tone accounts for the opposing effects on spinal nociceptive and pruriceptive transmission. Since pain suppresses itch, we cannot exclude the possibility that activation of spinal pronociceptive circuitry inhibits itch transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Treatment of chronic itch with Tacr1 antagonists</title><p>The Tacr1 antagonists aprepitant and serlopitant were recently shown to be partially effective in reducing chronic itch of various etiologies. Tacr1 antagonists might act at Tacr1 that is expressed by spinothalamic and spinoparabrachial neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2021</xref> &amp; Todd, 2010) to reduce pruriceptive transmission. Indeed, ablation of Tacr1-expressing spinal and medullary neurons reduces pruritogen-evoked scratching behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carstens et al., 2010</xref>). The present results suggest that Tacr1 antagonists also have an opposite effect to block Tacr1-mediated descending inhibition of itch. Systemic administration of Tacr1 antagonists thus appear to have offsetting supraspinal and spinal effects, potentially explaining the limited efficacy of Tacr1 antagonists for chronic itch.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tacr1 cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dong Lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tacr1 creER</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dong Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2016</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">aav5-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">44361-AAV5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">aav5-hSyn-DIO-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">50459-AAV5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">aav5-Ef1a-hChR2-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">20297-AAV5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse monoclonal: anti-Tacr1 conjugated 488</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCBT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sc-365091 AF488</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Substance P (SP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tocris</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1156/5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Histamine Dihydrochloride (HA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H7250</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chloroquine Diphosphate (CLQ)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C6628</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pentobarbital Sodium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P3761</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Buprenorphine Hydrochloride</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Amerisoucebergen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NDC42023-179-05</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5 Prism</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Graphpad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed using wild type mice (c57BL/6 j, Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor ME), Tacr1 cre<sup>+/-</sup> (courtesy of Dr. X.

Only discrete bouts of spontaneous hindlimb scratches directed towards the application site were counted, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akiyama et al., 2016</xref>) and summed over the 30 min period. Alloknesis was assessed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2012</xref>). The mouse was placed in an enclosed area and a 0.07 g von Frey monofilament was applied to the perimeter of the imiquimod application area five consecutive times. The alloknesis score consisted of the number of immediately occurring hindlimb scratch bouts directed to the stimulus site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Four weeks after intra-RVM injection of AAV5:hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry or the control vector (AAV5:hSyn-DIO-mCherry) in Tacr1 cre mice, clozapine (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected, followed 1 hr later by perfusion (4% paraformaldehyde), harvesting of brains and post-fixation overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were sectioned (20 Î¼m) on a freezing microtome and stained as free floating sections. DREADDs-expressing neurons were counterstained for Tacr1 expression with a conjugated Tacr1 antibody (D-11, sc-365091, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas TX) at 1:50 overnight at 4 Â°C. mCherry expressing neurons were identified in the RVM and then observed for Tacr1 expression. All slides were mounted with vectashield and imaged with confocal microscopy. Staining intensity was measured relative to the red fluorescence (from DREADDs) and was quantified using FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Values are presented as mean +/-SEM. Statistical significance was assessed using students t-test or a two-way, repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroniâs correction, unless otherwise specified. Significance was indicated by p&lt;0.05. Sample sizes were based on pilot data and are similar to those typically used in the field.</p><p>For analysis of effects of intracranial microinjections, a paired students t-test was used to compare the effects of intracranial injection of saline versus SP on behavioral measures. Two-way ANOVA determined a lack of significant sex x SP microinjection interaction, so the data from both sexes were pooled. For chemogenetic experiments, a paired t-test was used to compare scratch counts and nociceptive measures following vehicle vs. clozapine or CNO injection, or between vector controls and DREADDs mice following clozapine or CNO. For optogenetic experiments a paired t-test was similarly used to compare behavioral measures during and in the absence of optic stimulation.</p><p>For experiments with imiquimod, paired students t-tests compared the effects of ip injection of saline versus clozapine on spontaneous scratch bouts and alloknesis scores. A two-way ANOVA revealed no interaction for sex x clozapine administration, so the data were pooled for further analysis.</p><p>For single-unit recordings, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with bonferroni post-hoc test was used to compare the neuronal responses to pinch following intra-RVM injection of saline or SP for 60 min post-injection.</p><p>For immunohistochemical staining for c-fos, students t-test compared the staining intensity of c-fos and the proportion of c-fos-positive neurons in Tacr1-expressing neurons following administration of clozapine, in mice receiving DREADDs or control vector injections.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Hoon (Reviewer #2); Vijay K Samineni (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Perform further experiments to show more convincingly that descending inhibition of itch signal in the spinal cord is the mechanism the tacr1 rvm 'on' neurons are using to reduce scratching. Consider direct functional evidence for descending modulation, as opposed to indirect spinal consequences of local modulation in the RVM, and report the proportion of the tacr1 rvm neurons that send descending projections to the spinal itch circuitry.</p><p>2. Include essential controls in experiments involving DREADDs</p><p>3. Address the caveat of heterogeneity of tacr1 cells in association with the claim of their identity as ON cells; accordingly either provide additional evidence or temper down claims.</p><p>4. Undertake changes in text and figures recommended by reviewers under the 'recommendations' section of individual reviews, as appropriate</p><p>5. If you have not already done so, please ensure your manuscript complies with the <italic>eLife</italic> policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full Report exact p-values wherever possible alongside the summary statistics, degrees of freedom, and 95% confidence intervals. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.</p><p>6. Please also include a key resource table.</p><p>7. Please include housing details, including number of animals/cage (e.g., single v. pair v. group housed), light-dark cycle, cycle at test etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Decades of penetrating investigation of nociception at the level of the brainstem has revealed a complex circuitry including ON and OFF cells that activate or deactivate, respectively, in response to noxious input. This manuscript begins to unwind the relationship of these cells and circuits to the signaling of itch. The main conclusion, that a population of Tacr1 expressing neurons in the rostroventral medulla are &quot;ON&quot; cells and that activation of these cells suppresses scratching is supported by anatomical, behavioral, and functional data. The strengths of these conclusions rest on the use of several approaches to manipulate activity (optogenetic, chemogenetic, and pharmacological) and from single unit recordings in anesthetized animals, which provide a high level of internal consistency. The use of appropriate blinding, detailed analysis of sex differences, and several experiments offering detail on the precision of optogenetic activation are other methodological strengths. While the data are strong, the interpretations at times stray into areas of less certainty, and a singular vision is presented where alternate possibilities still exist.</p><p>One alternate possibility is that the activation of Tacr1 RVM neurons with substance P enhances nociception, and it is this enhanced pain that limits the scratching behavior, rather than a decrease in the itch sensation per se. This is supported by the lowered mechanical withdrawal threshold after DREADD activation of TacR1 neurons. Perhaps scratching becomes too painful, or perhaps the effectiveness of scratching is increased, and therefore fewer scratches are required for the same itch suppressing effect. Although Liu 2019 is cited in support (p. 20) of the authors' conclusions, there is not data in the present manuscript showing that the Tacr1 RVM ON cells under study directly modulate the spinal itch circuitry, or the GRPR cells.</p><p>The experiments in figure 2 are missing a control â DREADDs may have some constitutive activity, and therefore it is important to show with and without the DREADD activator CNO or clozapine (the authors use both interchangeably for some reason).</p><p>There is also the nagging problem that somehow motor systems are compromised by the activation of RVM neurons (the spinal cord appears to be fully labeled with mcherry Figure 4f, including the ventral horn). Although the contrasting findings between less scratching and more von Frey withdrawal suggest an intact system at the most basic level, more convincing would be showing enhanced scratching activity via inhibition of the Tacr1 RVM ON cells (a positive behavioral output). This would both put aside motor concerns and strengthen the functional role of these cells. Since according to the recordings in Figure 6c, ON these on cells have ongoing activity prior to the pinch stimulus, it should be possible to inhibit this tonic activity.</p><p>Figure 7 should include more of the findings from the results. No OFF cells are represented, lack of involvement of 5HT not shown.</p><p>Finally, the text generally needs more methodological details to understand the experiments. I realize this is a trend with some journals to put the methods at the end, which is fine, but additional basic information must be presented to understand and interpret the experiments. Specific instances are listed below.</p><p>Line 78+ state briefly what prep is being used (anesthetized, in vivo).</p><p>Indicate volume and concentration of drugs (ie substance P, hist, cq). This could even be in figure legend.</p><p>Figure 1 (also Figure 6) Please confirm accuracy of the Bregma coordinates.</p><p>Line 86: âenhancement of responses lasted 1 hrâ please show.</p><p>Figure 1 e: it looks like blue light is shining in this figure. Please use a different style for clarity.</p><p>Figure 2 â Are the figures a and e mixed up?</p><p>Figure 2 â I couldn't understand the value of including i-k, seems duplicative.</p><p>Figure 2 â legend âmean number of c-fosâ, but figure shows percentage, correct; also see line 119-121; again, this needs a no CNO control.</p><p>Figure 3B would be more convincing for the authorsâ statement that âexpression of hM3Dq-mcherry was limited to the RVMâ if the area outside the RVM was included in the figure.</p><p>Data between Figure 4 and Figure 3 are a bit different re: von Frey. Please explain the added value of the tac1rcre-er mice versus the previous mouse line and offer some insight into this discrepancy.</p><p>Figure 5 â this figure was awkward (particularly a and b). What is meant by the bars and stars on the side? The shades of green are hard to distinguish. The legend states âimiquimodâ¦produced a significant increase in spontaneous scratchingâ â but I could not identify the statistical test used. There is an indication that something is âredâ, but I see no red in the figure. Why is clozapine used instead of CNO? Why are imiquimod-evoked scratches âspontaneousâ?</p><p>Line 187 â âtip extended a few millimetersâ This seems too far. Iâm not sure it would work properly. The methods says micrometers.</p><p>Line 189 (and elsewhere), light used is given as less than 5mW. This is vague, and could be 0mW.</p><p>Line 191 â âfaithfully entrained 10Hz (6d)â but only 5 hz is shown.</p><p>Line 219 â âdoubletâ action potentials. I was expecting a picture.</p><p>Line 227 â Figure 4 (should be supplemental).</p><p>Line 234 â reword; it sounds like the actual force of the limb withdrawal was greater.</p><p>Line 246 â Please define what is the fev-cre line upon first introduction.</p><p>Line 305 â reference to Figure 4, but I think maybe Figure 2 is meant?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Strengths: The results from this study broadly indicate that RVM TacR1-neurons can alter itch responses and are mainly ON-cells which are new findings that define important elements in the itch sensory system.</p><p>Weaknesses: neurochemical experiments suggest that TacR1 is expressed in a heterogeneous population of RVM neurons. Further, the results from the use of two different mouse lines where TacR1-neurons are chemogenetically manipulated, differ from each other. These two issues make it difficult to completely unambiguously interpret results from chemogenetic experiments.</p><p>Overall, the data in this manuscript is interesting and show important new findings. However, several of the interpretations made in the manuscript go beyond the results described and a revision of the manuscript is needed to reasonably reflect the presented results. There are also other questions about the Results and errors in the way that data is presented. First, the TacR1-neurons recorded from and manipulated are not directly shown to be descending. This is inferred from other studies and spinal cord staining but, what proportion of them are descending and could some of the effects reported be through indirect pathways? Further, the study does not directly establish that the effects seen occur in the spinal cord. For instance, some of the TacR1 neurons may be interneurons and some of the effects of activating TacR1 neurons may occur in other brain regions. Second, another concern is the incomplete characterization of the TacR1-cre mouse lines; the second TacR1-creERT2 mouse line does not seem to have been neurochemically characterized and the characterization of the one TacR1-cre line is not thorough (see comments below). Third, the parts of the manuscripts on 5HT signaling are not well connected with the other parts of the paper and need to be integrated or removed. Fourth, although it is not unreasonable to suggest that the OFF-cells are downstream of ON-cells, the manuscript does not provide direct proof of this; TTX, GABA inhibition experiments and measurements of latency responses relative to optogenetics are probably required to demonstrate this.</p><p>I realize that all these requests would likely require considerable additional experimentation, and this may go beyond <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines. In the absence of performing new extra studies, the title, abstract and discussion will all need revisions to tone down conclusions to better reflect the data presented.</p><p>Below is an itemized list of concerns:</p><p>a) The data in figure1c is a bar graph, scatter plots should be used to allow a better assessment of the data.</p><p>b) Figure 1h, are the values on the y-axis correct? (8-2g, presumably 0.8g to 0.2g). This increase in sensitivity would be better described as a mild mechanical sensitization, similarly data in figure 3 should be described as mild-mechanical sensitization.</p><p>c) Figure 2, panels a and e have been switched. The staining for mCherry is different for each panel, what is the reason for this? â are they the same region or is A in the reticular region of the RVM and other images taken in the midline? i.e. were images taken from the same area of the RVM and if not, how was data normalized? Since the RVM encompasses several separate brain nuclei, the authors should detail these, for instance; raphe magnus, raphe pallidus, PGRNL, and MARN. In addition, in the electrophysiology experiments described in figure 6, ON-cells and OFF-cells were probed in many areas of the general medulla â was the characterization of the lines used also similarly widely distributed? Images in figure 2 (or a new supplement) should be of whole coronal sections of the medulla in order to see the locations of all the TacR1-neurons in the medulla.</p><p>d) Images in figure 2ab and c indicate 4 double positive and 4 TacR1 alone neurons, but the graph reports there is an 80% overlap. A move representative image should be presented.</p><p>e) Figure 2d, h, and l should be presented as scatter plots.</p><p>f) Figure m, n, o same comment as d), an image showing more neurons would better illustrate the data presented in panel p.</p><p>g) Figure 2m shows endogenous TacR1 expression and does not report cells where cre mediated excision occurs. Therefore, this does not prove that cells chemogenetically manipulation or recorded from are GABAergic. The ISH should be on tissues from TacR1-cre mice infected with AAV-cherry and if different serotypes of AAV were used in different experiments this should be noted as a limitation of the study.</p><p>h) All numbers of counted neurons for figure 2 need to be reported.</p><p>i) Were similar neurochemical characterization studies performed on the second TacR1-creERT2 line? If they were not, then the authors should acknowledge that the differences in results between these lines may be because different populations of neurons might be activated.</p><p>j) Line 115, sentence needs rewording.</p><p>k) Line 129, this sentence repeats the previous one and is less accurate giving a false impression the presented data shows that all Tacr1-neurons are inhibitory. Similar inaccuracies are repeated throughout the manuscript.</p><p>l) Are the TacR1-neurons the same as those described in Francois et al. 2017?</p><p>m) Different serotypes of AAV are used in Figure 3 and 4, a comment on this should be added as this may additionally contribute to the differences in effects of chemogenetic manipulation between these experiments.</p><p>n) 50ug of chloroquine produces different numbers of itch bouts in controls in figure 3 and 4, what's the reason?</p><p>o) Given that these experiments are suggested to confirm each other, is there a reason why in figure 3 von Frey thresholds are not affected but in figure 4 they are? This difference needs to be acknowledged in interpreting these results.</p><p>p) Figure 4e, the staining for mCherry seems to extend beyond the cell bodies of neurons in the raphe magnus (dorsal and lateral), are these dendrites and could the AAV retrogradely infect, in the RVM, terminals of neurons in other brain regions? A larger image would help resolve whether the staining is from dendrites.</p><p>q) Figure 4f, the contrast used for this image makes it hard to see any staining. Is there bilateral staining and which lamina are these terminals projecting to and are projections the same in all spinal cord segments?</p><p>r) The electrophysiology of optogenetic responses of ON and OFF-cells- optotagging. What were the waveforms and latency of the proposed directly activated versus indirectly activated neurons and were there any indications there is more than one class of ON-cells? Was supervised/unsupervised clustering used to distinguish cell-types? Even though the evoked response reliability of ON-cells is high, the latency of these neurons in slow compared to other optotagging studies reported. What is the response reliability of OFF-cells is the distribution of latency for ON-cells suggest more than one class? And what's the average latency of response of OFF-cells? Were experiments with NBQX and bicuculine performed to show direct activation?</p><p>s) Figure 6b shows a small area of where recordings were made (versus panel j). A larger view would be good.</p><p>t) Were studies performed to show ON-cells are synaptically connected to OFF-cells? I.e. for OFF-cells could responses be blocked with TTX, or since the TacR1-cells are suggested to be mainly GABAergic are these responses blocked with bicuculline? Without these results, it is possible that TacR1 is expressed in both ON and OFF-cells.</p><p>u) The section on sex differences is odd. It needs to be integrated with the other parts of the paper.</p><p>v) Section of 5HT RVM cells does not connect with other parts of the paper and basic control data are not presented for these studies. I would recommend this section be removed as it does not add to the main theme of the paper and the data is too preliminary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript looks at contributory role of a RVM Tacr1-expressing neurons in the acute and chronic pruritis. Authors demonstrate that RVM ON and neutral cells express Tacr1 and send projections to the spinal cord, implicating possible role in descending inhibition of spinal pruriceptive transmission. Overall, the study used well established and complementary methods to support their findings. This work fills significant gaps in the descending itch literature. Largely I think the paper is well presented, data supports the conclusions of the study. There are some concerns regarding the figures. The manuscript could improve if authors address these concerns.</p><p>1. Authors show that in Figure 1, SP injections into the RVM significantly reduced evoked itch and von Frey behaviors. It is confusing as the data is presented, authors say they are using Paired student test. But in the methods, it is not clear if they use same mice for saline and SP injections. Paired T test would be appropriate if pre and post were conducted on same mice.</p><p>2. SP microinjections did not always decrease evoked itch behaviors.

The manuscript is now more modest, yet still contributes significantly to our understanding of brainstem processing of scratching behavior in rodents. The main conclusion, that activation of Tacr1 expressing ON cells in the RVM reduces itch-evoked scratching, is supported by the data. The authors have also corrected some errors and improved some figures and clarified text. A number of careless errors still remain, however (listed below), and although the original hypothesis for a descending mechanism was unable to be supported by experimental evidence, the discussion still reaches this original conclusion with both hands.</p><p>Line 247 â &quot;Importantly, our results support a role for these neurons in descending inhibition of acute and chronic itch.&quot; The results do not address descending inhibition.</p><p>It's a shame that a few more cells like in Figure 1 from the response to reviewers could not be found.</p><p>Here is a list of items that could be improved:</p><p>Figure 2: Legend and Results text: There are ambiguities regarding the percentages reported that should be written more clearly.

Perform further experiments to show more convincingly that descending inhibition of itch signal in the spinal cord is the mechanism the tacr1 rvm 'on' neurons are using to reduce scratching. Consider direct functional evidence for descending modulation, as opposed to indirect spinal consequences of local modulation in the RVM, and report the proportion of the tacr1 rvm neurons that send descending projections to the spinal itch circuitry.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent comment. We attempted to perform several functional experiments to demonstrate that the descending component of RVM activation was necessary for inhibition of spinal itch transmission. We first attempted to record from lumbar itch sensitive neurons which received an AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP injection in the RVM of Tacr1-cre mice. Once an itch sensitive neuron was identified we applied 10 hz blue light stimulation to the spinal cord to selectively activate the descending fibers of RVM Tacr1 +/ChR2 + neurons (Author response imge 1). Unfortunately, technical difficulties limited the number of pruritogen-sensitive spinal neurons we were able to record. In the provided example we did observe a clear inhibition of chloroquine evoked activity during blue light stimulation which returned once the stimulation ended. However, given the low sample size this is only anecdotal which we will not include in the revision.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Response of spinal neuron to intradermal injection of chloroquine (CLQ) is suppressed by optogenetic stimulation in RVM.</title><p>(a) diagram of experimental design.

Using this paradigm, we hoped to transfect TacR1 + neurons which project to the lumbar spinal cord including the RVM Tacr1 neurons, which would be selectively activated with optogenetic stimulation. Unfortunately, these mice did not show a consistent decrease in pruritogen evoked scratching during optogenetic stimulation (Autor response image 2). This is likely the result of poor efficaciousness in the retrograde labeling of RVM projecting neurons, which were sparse when verified histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>,c).</p><p>Previous studies have reported that 31% of RVM ON-cells project to spinal cord (Venegas et al., 1984) and that 42.5% of NK-1R-expressing RVM cells project to spinal cord (Pinto et al., 2008). While we believe that descending modulation of itch-signaling spinal neurons is the most parsimonious explanation for our results, our additional experiments do not provide unequivocal support for this. Rather than performing even more experiments, we opt instead to change the language of the manuscript. We maintain that descending modulation is still a possibility but cannot exclude the possibility of a supraspinal mechanism being responsible for our observed effect.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Inability of optogenetic stimulation of spinally projecting RVM Tacr1 expressing neurons to suppress scratching behavior.</title><p>(a) retrograde AAV was injected into the dorsal spinal cord of Tacr1 cre mice.

This manuscript begins to unwind the relationship of these cells and circuits to the signaling of itch. The main conclusion, that a population of Tacr1 expressing neurons in the rostroventral medulla are &quot;ON&quot; cells and that activation of these cells suppresses scratching is supported by anatomical, behavioral, and functional data. The strengths of these conclusions rest on the use of several approaches to manipulate activity (optogenetic, chemogenetic, and pharmacological) and from single unit recordings in anesthetized animals, which provide a high level of internal consistency. The use of appropriate blinding, detailed analysis of sex differences, and several experiments offering detail on the precision of optogenetic activation are other methodological strengths. While the data are strong, the interpretations at times stray into areas of less certainty, and a singular vision is presented where alternate possibilities still exist.</p><p>One alternate possibility is that the activation of Tacr1 RVM neurons with substance P enhances nociception, and it is this enhanced pain that limits the scratching behavior, rather than a decrease in the itch sensation per se. This is supported by the lowered mechanical withdrawal threshold after DREADD activation of TacR1 neurons. Perhaps scratching becomes too painful, or perhaps the effectiveness of scratching is increased, and therefore fewer scratches are required for the same itch suppressing effect. Although Liu 2019 is cited in support (p. 20) of the authors' conclusions, there is not data in the present manuscript showing that the Tacr1 RVM ON cells under study directly modulate the spinal itch circuitry, or the GRPR cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewerâs last sentence and this has been addressed above. We agree that a pronociceptive effect of ON cells might reduce itch and mention this possibility; however there is currently limited evidence to support this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments in figure 2 are missing a control â DREADDs may have some constitutive activity, and therefore it is important to show with and without the DREADD activator CNO or clozapine (the authors use both interchangeably for some reason).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. Our c-fos data (original manuscript Figure 2e-I; revised manuscript Figure 2 h), does show that there is some baseline activity in the DREADDs expressing neurons without clozapine. This is not surprising since most RVM ON cells we recorded from (Figure 6 and Supp Figure 3) exhibited baseline firing and were transiently excited by the ip injection. That is why we chose to directly compare the DREADDs activation with a control vector group, to demonstrate an increase in activity in the DREADDs positive cells following injection of clozapine. Our behavioral experiments are intrinsically controlled through ip injection of clozapine versus saline in the same animal. We performed the suggested experiment and compared i.p. saline versus i.p. clozapine in our DREADDs mice to confirm (Figure 2 i). We observed a similar result and have updated figure 2 to reflect this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also the nagging problem that somehow motor systems are compromised by the activation of RVM neurons (the spinal cord appears to be fully labeled with mcherry Figure 4f, including the ventral horn). Although the contrasting findings between less scratching and more von Frey withdrawal suggest an intact system at the most basic level, more convincing would be showing enhanced scratching activity via inhibition of the Tacr1 RVM ON cells (a positive behavioral output). This would both put aside motor concerns and strengthen the functional role of these cells. Since according to the recordings in Figure 6c, ON these on cells have ongoing activity prior to the pinch stimulus, it should be possible to inhibit this tonic activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. However, we did not perform the experiment with inhibitory DREADDs and rely on the observation of enhanced mechanical withdrawal as evidence against generalized motor suppression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 should include more of the findings from the results. No OFF cells are represented, lack of involvement of 5HT not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

Figure 3 was the result established in our lab. Serendipitously, we found that our collaborating lab had performed a similar set of experiments which was consistent regarding the effect on itch related behavior (Figure 4). Since these two sets of experiments were conducted entirely independently, there were several differences in the experimental approach (Different Tacr1 cre lines, use of clozapine vs CNO, different labs, and different experimenters). We are not sure why the von Frey results differ between these two experiments, but speculate that it is related to the numerous differences in the experimental design. We have decided to move the results of our collaborators to the supplemental section to reduce confusion, since the results are largely duplicative.

Further, the results from the use of two different mouse lines where TacR1-neurons are chemogenetically manipulated, differ from each other. These two issues make it difficult to completely unambiguously interpret results from chemogenetic experiments.</p><p>Overall, the data in this manuscript is interesting and show important new findings. However, several of the interpretations made in the manuscript go beyond the results described and a revision of the manuscript is needed to reasonably reflect the presented results. There are also other questions about the Results and errors in the way that data is presented. First, the TacR1-neurons recorded from and manipulated are not directly shown to be descending. This is inferred from other studies and spinal cord staining but, what proportion of them are descending and could some of the effects reported be through indirect pathways? Further, the study does not directly establish that the effects seen occur in the spinal cord. For instance, some of the TacR1 neurons may be interneurons and some of the effects of activating TacR1 neurons may occur in other brain regions.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct and this comment is consistent with that of other Reviewers.

Therefore, this does not prove that cells chemogenetically manipulation or recorded from are GABAergic. The ISH should be on tissues from TacR1-cre mice infected with AAV-cherry and if different serotypes of AAV were used in different experiments this should be noted as a limitation of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the section pertaining to GABA colocalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) All numbers of counted neurons for figure 2 need to be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed and included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) Were similar neurochemical characterization studies performed on the second TacR1-creERT2 line?

Similar inaccuracies are repeated throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have changed our language throughout the manuscript to be more explicit and not misleading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l) Are the TacR1-neurons the same as those described in Francois et al. 2017?</p></disp-quote><p>Francois et al. drove expression in GABAergic cells, so any RVM cells which project to the spinal cord and express GABA would have been manipulated. Sarah Ross has evidence that OFF cells are also GABAergic, so some of the neurons described by Francois et al. may have been OFF cells. Our optotagging experiments suggest that OFF cells do not express Tacr1, while many ON cells do. Francois suggested they were activating RVM ON cells due to the predominant behavioral effect (mechanical sensitization) following activation of RVM spinally projecting GABAergic neurons. We have some limited evidence that RVM ON cells express GABA, thus it is possible that Francois activated Tacr1-expressing RVM ON cells, but the population of neurons they activated was likely more extensive and not limited to RVM ON cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>m) Different serotypes of AAV are used in Figure 3 and 4, a comment on this should be added as this may additionally contribute to the differences in effects of chemogenetic manipulation between these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. These experiments were conducted independently, without either investigator being aware the other was also conducting a similar experiment, so we werenât able to coordinate these details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>n) 50ug of chloroquine produces different numbers of itch bouts in controls in figure 3 and 4, what's the reason?</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were performed by completely different investigators, independently, and in a different line of mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o) Given that these experiments are suggested to confirm each other, is there a reason why in figure 3 von Frey thresholds are not affected but in figure 4 they are? This difference needs to be acknowledged in interpreting these results.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a great point. These two experiments were conducted entirely independently, without knowledge of each other. Figure 3, was conducted by TF in the Carstens Lab while (Previous version Figure 4) was conducted by EN in the Ross lab. Thus, there were numerous differences including: Lab location, mouse line, virus serotype, behaviorist, behavior apparatus, DREADDs actuator (clozapine vs CNO), etc. We found the similarity of our results astounding and included both sets of data as validation of the reproducibility of our results. However, this led to confusion and we decided to put the secondary results from the Ross lab (Previous Figure 4) in the supplemental section and focus primarily on the results generated from the Carstens lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p) Figure 4e, the staining for mCherry seems to extend beyond the cell bodies of neurons in the raphe magnus (dorsal and lateral), are these dendrites and could the AAV retrogradely infect, in the RVM, terminals of neurons in other brain regions? A larger image would help resolve whether the staining is from dendrites.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of mCherry is not limited to the cell bodies and we frequently see strong expression of mCherry throughout the entire neuron (mainly soma and dendritic field), but additionally in the axons. In our injections, we see strong expression of mCherry at the injection site in the RVM, but not a lot of expression elsewhere. A lower-power image of the brainstem has been included in revised figure 3b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>q) Figure 4f, the contrast used for this image makes it hard to see any staining. Is there bilateral staining and which lamina are these terminals projecting to and are projections the same in all spinal cord segments?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and this image has been removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>r) The electrophysiology of optogenetic responses of ON and OFF-cells- optotagging. What were the waveforms and latency of the proposed directly activated versus indirectly activated neurons and were there any indications there is more than one class of ON-cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe any striking difference in spike waveforms between different cell types. There was no indication of more than one class of ON cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was supervised/unsupervised clustering used to distinguish cell-types?</p></disp-quote><p>No.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even though the evoked response reliability of ON-cells is high, the latency of these neurons in slow compared to other optotagging studies reported.</p></disp-quote><p>The latency from optotagged neurons varies drastically across cell type and light intensity. We found it necessary to use latency, efficiency index and firing rate to determine whether the cell was responding directly. Another study of hippocampal cells (Zhang et al., 2013) reported latencies of similar duration (~9 msec) compared to our present data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the response reliability of OFF-cells is the distribution of latency for ON-cells suggest more than one class?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry, we donât understand the question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And what's the average latency of response of OFF-cells?</p></disp-quote><p>No OFF cells we recorded from responded with excitation to the light stimulus, but 6/12 responded with inhibition to the light stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were experiments with NBQX and bicuculine performed to show direct activation?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we did not try to block synaptic transmission in these experiments because this paper was largely focused on Tacr1 expressing ON cells. But we thought the OFF cell response was of interest and wanted to include the observation in this manuscript. We did not try applying NBQX or bicuculine because it was too difficult to construct a microinjection/optic fiber/microelectrode device which would be required for these experiments and thus was beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>s) Figure 6b shows a small area of where recordings were made (versus panel j). A larger view would be good.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Unfortunately, at the time of these recordings, we were limited in our microscopy experiments and could only image at 20-40x. The injections for these experiments are quite similar to the injections made for our chemogenetic experiments (same injection coordinates and virus serotype). Figure 5b is not a lesion site but demonstration of expression of YFP, and thus ChR2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>t) Were studies performed to show ON-cells are synaptically connected to OFF-cells? I.e. for OFF-cells could responses be blocked with TTX, or since the TacR1-cells are suggested to be mainly GABAergic are these responses blocked with bicuculline? Without these results, it is possible that TacR1 is expressed in both ON and OFF-cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, RVM OFF cells were never excited by light, but were instead inhibited by optic stimulation. While Tacr1 expressing cells might be heterogenous, we have no evidence to suggest RVM OFF cells express Tacr1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>u) The section on sex differences is odd. It needs to be integrated with the other parts of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have integrated the sex differences in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) Section of 5HT RVM cells does not connect with other parts of the paper and basic control data are not presented for these studies. I would recommend this section be removed as it does not add to the main theme of the paper and the data is too preliminary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed this from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript looks at contributory role of a RVM Tacr1-expressing neurons in the acute and chronic pruritis. Authors demonstrate that RVM ON and neutral cells express Tacr1 and send projections to the spinal cord, implicating possible role in descending inhibition of spinal pruriceptive transmission. Overall, the study used well established and complementary methods to support their findings. This work fills significant gaps in the descending itch literature. Largely I think the paper is well presented, data supports the conclusions of the study. There are some concerns regarding the figures. The manuscript could improve if authors address these concerns.</p><p>1. Authors show that in Figure 1, SP injections into the RVM significantly reduced evoked itch and von Frey behaviors. It is confusing as the data is presented, authors say they are using Paired student test. But in the methods, it is not clear if they use same mice for saline and SP injections. Paired T test would be appropriate if pre and post were conducted on same mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. In these experiments the same mice received both saline and SP and were analyzed using a paired t test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. SP microinjections did not always decrease evoked itch behaviors. Any differences observed in the location of injections that explains this variance in the data?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a distinct possibility, although we did not observe a correlation between injection location and the degree of suppression of scratching. Itch behavior is notoriously variable. Especially for saline injections that produce low initial scratch bouts, it could be a floor effect. Nonetheless, the overall decrease is significant and consistent across several lines of evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2a and 2e seemed to be switched. Authors should address this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your observation. We have fixed this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. cFos is a nuclear protein. In the images authors show, it seems like they are just capturing background autofluorescence instead of cFos signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this astute comment. We only measured cfos expression in mCherry positive cells. The acquisition settings were maintained constant for DREADDs and Control vector imaging and apologize for the bright image provided. In addition to the measurement of mean intensity, we also used the traditional method of visually counting cfos positive cells and achieved similar numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Authors claim Tacr1 neurons are Vgat+ve. Could authors comment on if they have looked to see any Tacr1 neurons are Vglut positive. It is possible because it has not been tested there could be neurons Tacr1+ve neurons that could be Vglut+ve.</p></disp-quote><p>We have decided to remove the section colocalizing Tacr1 and GABA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3, authors seem to use same panels for histamine and chloroquine evoked scratching.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this astute observation and apologize for this inadvertent error. We have replaced the panel showing chloroquine-evoked scratching behavior. The conclusions remain the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 4b is not clearly explained. What treatment was done to these mice to elicit spontaneous scratching?</p></disp-quote><p>The spontaneous scratching observed was with no treatment. The mice used for this behavior demonstrated some amount of âbaselineâ scratching bouts, which were reduced during administration of CNO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Authors should make Figure 6 to figure 2. Current location of this figure is not appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We ultimately decided to remove this figure at the suggestion of other reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In opto-tagging experiments, authors have found that all the recorded neutral cells are excited by the optical stimulation. This indicates both RVM ON and neutral cells express Tacr1. But authors do not acknowledge this in most of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. This study did not include a comprehensive investigation of Neutral cells. Qualitatively speaking, the large majority of Neutral cells were not light sensitive, but I felt it important to acknowledge that some (n=3) were light sensitive. For example, in the neutral cells we recorded from, there was no baseline activity and they do not respond to nociceptive stimuli, so it would be impossible to record from similar cells if it werenât for the occasional light sensitive neurons. We agree with the reviewer that we should explicitly mention the heterogeneity of Tacr1 expressing cells and have revised the manuscript to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Current study shows role for RVM Tacr1 neurons in itch modulation, there is no direct evidence to show that its only via ON cells not via neutral cells or both.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our conclusions are on RVM Tacr1 expressing cells. However, our evidence, suggests that this is likely overlapping with RVM ON cells. The reviewer makes a good point, but we are reluctant to suggest a role for Neutral cells in descending itch modulation since their firing does not change in response to noxious stimulation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

In the author guide it states: âIn some cases, it might be unwieldy to have this information in the legend of a figure, in which case the information can be provided in a source data fileâ.

The manuscript is now more modest, yet still contributes significantly to our understanding of brainstem processing of scratching behavior in rodents. The main conclusion, that activation of Tacr1 expressing ON cells in the RVM reduces itch-evoked scratching, is supported by the data. The authors have also corrected some errors and improved some figures and clarified text. A number of careless errors still remain, however (listed below), and although the original hypothesis for a descending mechanism was unable to be supported by experimental evidence, the discussion still reaches this original conclusion with both hands.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and careful review of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 247 â &quot;Importantly, our results support a role for these neurons in descending inhibition of acute and chronic itch.&quot; The results do not address descending inhibition.</p><p>It's a shame that a few more cells like in Figure 1 from the response to reviewers could not be found.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and are likewise disappointed that we could not find more neurons in an appropriate amount of time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here is a list of items that could be improved:</p><p>Figure 2: Legend and Results text: There are ambiguities regarding the percentages reported that should be written more clearly.

For this analysis we evaluated Tacr1 expression specifically in the mCherry-expressing population. The result is the percentage of mCherry expressing neurons which also express Tacr1 and not all cells in the RVM. We have added clarifying statements in the figure legend as well as in the methods under Immunofluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>// &quot;â¦there was significant increase in the number of c-fos positive cells following ip administration of clozapineâ¦&quot; p.6 â is this a percent of the total cells in RVM or a percent of mcherry-labelled cells?
