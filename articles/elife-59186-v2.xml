LARP4 was shown to promote poly(A) tail (PAT) lengthening and stabilization of individual mRNAs presumably by protection from deadenylation (Mattijssen et al., 2017). We developed a nucleotide resolution transcriptome-wide, single molecule SM-PAT-seq method. This revealed LARP4 effects on a wide range of PAT lengths for human mRNAs and mouse mRNAs from LARP4 knockout (KO) and control cells. LARP4 effects are clear on long PAT mRNAs but become more prominent at 30–75 nucleotides. We also analyzed time courses of PAT decay transcriptome-wide and for ~200 immune response mRNAs. This demonstrated accelerated deadenylation in KO cells on PATs &lt; 75 nucleotides and phasing consistent with greater PABP dissociation in the absence of LARP4. Thus, LARP4 shapes PAT profiles throughout mRNA lifespan with impact on mRNA decay at short lengths known to sensitize PABP dissociation in response to deadenylation machinery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>poly(A)</kwd><kwd>PABP</kwd><kwd>polyA tail</kwd><kwd>deadenylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD000412-31 PGD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maraia</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LARP4 protects mRNAs against deadenylation over a wide range of poly(A) lengths but with most apparent functional impact on short lengths known to sensitize PABP binding and mRNA stability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Critical aspects of mRNA metabolism are controlled by the 3' poly(A) tail (PAT) and the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABP, PABPC1) which contribute to mRNA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nicholson and Pasquinelli, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson and Gilbert, 2017</xref>). PABP is a translation factor which by binding to eIF4G can link the mRNA 5' cap and associated initiation factors with translation termination factors and the 3' PAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Uchida et al., 2002</xref>). Beyond translation, PABP is a key factor involved in control of PAT length and mRNA stability. Nascent precursor-mRNAs acquire PATs in the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm with lengths of ~250 nt that shorten thereafter with gene-specific multifaceted kinetics (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jalkanen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nicholson and Pasquinelli, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Multiple PABP molecules can bind to poly(A) with a periodicity of ~27 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baer and Kornberg, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nicholson and Pasquinelli, 2019</xref>). PABP architecture is conserved, consisting of four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), followed by a helix, a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schäfer et al., 2019</xref>) and a globular C-terminal Mademoiselle (MLLE) domain with a binding site for a PAM2 peptide. About 20 distinct proteins contain PAM2 peptides, of which several play key roles in mRNA metabolism and/or translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While earlier experiments had shown PAT shortening after PABP depletion from cell extracts, PATs became longer after PABP depletion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sachs and Davis, 1989</xref>). PABP promotes PAT shortening by recruiting the PAM2-containing proteins, PAN3, Tob1, Tob2, GW182 and their associated deadenylases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). The PAN2–PAN3 and CCR4–NOT (CNOT) complexes employ multiple deadenylases that can act during different phases of PAT shortening and are activated or blocked by PABP in ways that yield complex mRNA decay patterns reflective of varying deadenylation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Webster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, deadenylases can be actively recruited in response to different cues, for example, involving AU-rich element binding proteins or miRNA-mediated mRNA decay factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fabian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huntzinger et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, deadenylation is a major target for mRNA regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Shyu, 2011</xref>), and several of the activities involved noted above are integrated by PABP including by the PAM2 system.</p><p>LARP4, which is also known as LARP4A directly binds poly(A) RNA and PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz-Gallardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). LARP4 is a short-lived protein whose accumulation levels can span a wide range due in part to control by independent instability elements located in the coding region and in the 3’UTR of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mattijssen and Maraia, 2016</xref>). As with other La-related proteins (LARPs), LARP4 contains a La motif followed by a RNA recognition motif (RRM), and LARP-specific domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>). LARP4 binds PABP via two motifs, an N-terminal variant PAM2 named PAM2w and a downstream PABP-binding motif (PBM), both of which are required for efficient polysome association and stabilization of poly(A)<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>LARP4 effects on PATs were documented as their apparent net-lengthening on reporter as well as endogenous mRNAs. This reflects that the poly(A) on existing or newly synthesized mRNA is relatively protected from deadenylation in cells in which LARP4 is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>). In this model, the mRNA PATs are longer because they undergo less deadenylation. The PAT length of stable GFP mRNA bearing a short 3' UTR was dose-dependent on LARP4 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>). PAT lengthening and stabilization were also observed for a β-globin reporter mRNA with an AU-rich element (ARE) that was previously known to be destabilized via recruitment of the CCR-NOT deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>). Endogenous mRNAs exhibited shorter PATs and decreased stability in LARP4 KO cells relative to LARP4 WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>). Full PAT net-lengthening and mRNA stabilization activity of LARP4 requires its PABP-interaction motifs albeit the PBM more so than the PAM2w (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although the LARP4 activities of PAT lengthening and mRNA stabilization appear to be coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>), a challenge has been to uncover their mechanistic link. Moreover, aspects of these activities may reflect more generally on relationships between PAT length and mRNA decay. For example, although LARP4 promotes lengthening of long PATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>) how this leads to mRNA stabilization may be revealing in the context of a model in which mRNAs are turned over only when their PATs become very short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Shyu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisen et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>We developed a transcriptome-wide, SM-PAT-seq method that revealed a general effect of LARP4 on ~13,500 human and ~10,500 mouse mRNAs. Metagene analysis revealed that mRNA PAT length is increased by LARP4 in a dose-dependent manner and decreased by its genetic deletion, providing evidence that LARP4 is a general factor in mRNA PAT homeostasis. While LARP4 effects are clear on long PATs, its absence is most pronounced as PATs shorten to ≤75 nts. The data indicate that LARP4 shapes deadenylation profiles throughout the lifespan of mRNA, with most obvious impact when PAT length is in the size range known to affect mRNA turnover. We then used SM-PAT-seq for time course analysis of poly(A) decay which better resolved the differences between the LARP4 KO and WT profiles. The data provide new insight linking LARP4 to PAT protection from deadenylation and associated mRNA stabilization. An interpretation of our data in the context of recently published results led to a model of LARP4 action in which it protects against deadenylation and mRNA decay by contributing to the stabilization of PABP complexes on short PATs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome wide, long-read, single-molecule poly(A)-tail, SM-PAT-seq</title><p>Pacific Bioscience Sequel technology uses single‐molecule sequencing of long amplicons. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> outlines library preparation of circular templates.

However, an unexpected exception was the set of nuclear-encoded mitochondrion mRNAs. The PATs on the mRNAs that comprise this set are significantly shorter than on most other mRNAs in cells with 1X LARP4, and their lengths increased less in response to higher LARP4 levels relative to the PAT length increases in the other mRNA GO sets. This reflects a highly significant difference including by comparison to the RNA binding GO set as both are comprised of ~2000 mRNAs and represented by 35,000–50,000 CCS read counts in each LARP4 condition.</p><p>Prior analysis provided indirect evidence of PAT lengthening of GFP mRNA by LARP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>).

We developed a single molecule mRNA sequencing method for measuring and quantifying PAT lengths transcriptome-wide to study effects of LARP4 on poly(A) metabolism. A major conclusion is that LARP4 is a general factor that slows deadenylation transcriptome-wide, impacting a large fraction of mRNAs. For HEK293 cells and MEFs, LARP4 protects PATs from deadenylation over a wide spectrum of lengths, long and short. By examining PAT length after inhibition of transcription we conclude that mRNAs are deadenylated faster in KO than in WT cells. The data indicate that PATs of ≤75 nt are more susceptible to deadenylation in the absence of LARP4 than in its presence. The functional relevance of this is clear as LARP4 is an mRNA stabilization factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>). Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–C</xref> provide evidence that LARP4 slows conversion of long PAT- to short PAT-mRNAs. The PATs of the stable GFP mRNA expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 were longer than the cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,F</xref>) likely reflecting that they are newly transcribed whereas the latter comprise a steady state population of mixed species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eisen et al., 2020b</xref>). Nonetheless LARP4 expression led to dose-dependent increases in their PAT lengths. More importantly, SM-PAT-seq and northern blot data for GFP mRNA showed that increased PAT length was associated with their greater accumulation. It is notable that increasing LARP4 activity protected long PATs on GFP mRNA as reflected by northern and violin plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Thus, it would appear that LARP4 can increase the stability of this stable GFP mRNA by protecting against deadenylation during its lifespan when PATs are long.</p><p>Multiple mechanisms can control LARP4 levels over a wide range, including via the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mattijssen and Maraia, 2016</xref>).

Second, this higher peak is associated with a transition from long to short PATs that is of steeper incline in KO than WT, annotated by the upward red arrow. Third, the WT and KO transitions from long to short PATs intersect at ~110 nt (inverted triangle), a length known to be associated with transition from deadenylation of long PATs by PAN2/3 to shorter PATs by CNOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed working models for differential deadenylation profiles in LARP4 KO and WT MEFs (derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and select panels of 5C).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LARP4 effects on phasing of a set of ~80 ribosomal protein mRNAs at steady state was revealed by plotting the fraction of CCS reads vs. PAT lengths. A green triangle points to where the KO and WT transitions from long to short PATs intersect, at ~110 nt. The upward red dashed arrow denotes a steeper incline in KO as compared to WT of long to short PAT length transition. The red asterisk denotes the ~60–75 nt PATs whose peak is comprised of a substantially higher fraction of reads in KO as compared to WT cells. The black dashed arrow denotes conversion of longer to shorter PAT complexes in the peaks denoted by the corresponding asterisks. In this model, the peak denoted by the red asterisk would correspond to PATs bound by three PABPs that include peeling off/dissociation intermediates schematized in the upper part of panel C, and the peak denoted the black asterisk would correspond to PATs bound by two PABPs. As the two profiles transition from long to shorter PATs they begin to overlap at PAT lengths of ~110 nt which would correspond to mRNP complexes containing four PABPs or two PABP-dimers. These profiles suggest that as PATs shorten from this transition point and the distal PABP would begin to dissociate, CNOT may be less impeded in the absence of LARP4 (see text).

By extrapolation, PATs bound by two PABP<italic>-dimers</italic> would appear in the approximate 100–110 nt range in which the KO and WT profiles overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The steeper incline of the KO transition profile might suggest more efficient formation of the 60–75 nt PATs, consistent with LARP4 impeding deadenylation by CNOT. Also consistent with this is the more irregular shape of the ascending WT profile. Likewise, different shapes of the peaks suggest they may represent different intermediates in the presence and absence of LARP4. In any case, it would appear that formation of PABP<sub>(3)</sub>-PAT complexes by CNOT may occur more readily in the absence of LARP4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> legend). It is also possible that differences may reflect the presence/absence of proteins other than PABP.</p><p>Kinetic profiling affords additional considerations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At time zero the major PAT peak was 75 nt in KO and WT. Further deadenylation occurred sooner thereafter in KO cells as shorter peaks appeared at 30 min (arrows) that had not yet appeared in WT. The overall profile kinetics suggest that the proposed ~75 nt PABP<sub>(3)</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) is less stable in LARP4 KO than in WT cells. An intermediate (dashed arrow) appeared between the 75 and 38 nt (solid arrow) peaks in the KO profile at 30 min that was not distinguished in WT (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Evidence of this is also in the 60 min KO profile more broadly (bracket) and may reflect a deadenylation intermediate in LARP4 KO cells whose formation is otherwise blocked/inhibited or masked by LARP4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> depicts schematized PABP<sub>(3)</sub>-PABP<sub>(2)</sub> PAT intermediates.</p><p>These analyses have advanced insight into the role of LARP4 action in PAT lengthening and associated mRNA stabilization. Our findings in the PAT size range in which deadenylation is known to promote mRNA decay in mammalian cells provide a mechanistic link of the activities of PAT 3’ end protection and mRNA stabilization of LARP4. It was proposed that LARP4 could protect PATs from deadenylation by RNA 3’ end binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>). The data here leave open the possibility that LARP4 may directly protect RNA 3’ ends, and also support a model in which it stabilizes PABP on short PATs to shield them from deadenylases. In this model, decreased PABP-PAT stability would be compensated by interactions with LARP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz-Gallardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Such interactions are likely intricate as LARP4 can employ two motifs for PABP binding including by its unique PAM2w which can also be used to alternatively bind poly(A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz-Gallardo et al., 2019</xref>). As noted, PAM2 peptides that associate with PABP via its MLLE domain are also found on PAN3 as well as Tob1 and Tob2 which interact with the CAF1 subunit of CNOT. Thus, in the milieu of the cellular deadenylation machinery, the PAM2w would appear to contribute to an intricate network of factors in competition for poly(A) and PABP.</p><p>CNOT is an intricate multimeric complex with much regulatory potential for general and mRNA-specific deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Raisch et al., 2019</xref>), refs therein). Effects on long PATs and stable mRNA demonstrated here suggest the possibility that LARP4 can influence mRNA early in its lifespan with penetrant consequence later. Thus this work on LARP4 raises issues regarding the long and short of PAT metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>SM-PAT-Seq</title><p>PolyA-selected RNA was generated from 4 µg of total RNA using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads from illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit.

for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jack D Keene (Reviewer #1); Maria R Conte (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors showed before that La-related protein 4 (LARP4) promote poly(A) tail (PAT) lengthening and stabilization of mRNAs.

They also showed that LARP4 shapes PAT profiles throughout the mRNA lifespan.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers ask for the addition of statistical data (p-values) and changes in the Discussion including its shortening. It is too long (&gt; 5 pages). Please see below the full reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study of LARP4 functions is consistent with previous publications of the authors and other investigators regarding its importance for binding to the polyA-binding protein and the polyA RNA. Indeed, one of the most poorly understood problems in RNA biology has been how and why the length of polyA tail varies in cells. This paper presents a novel &quot;single molecule&quot; approach termed &quot;SM-PAT-seq that demonstrated LARP4's interactions with different lengths of polyA. To test the biological dynamics of this phenomenon, the authors quantified polyA length by activating a TNFa immune response and comparing the time course of wild-type versus knockout of LARP4.

In the proposed model of LARP4-PABP-sensitive protection from critical deadenylation the authors suggest that LARP4 slows deadenylation process from 75 nt (two PABP) to 37 nt (one PABP) by interacting to polyA and PABP (and this stabilises PABP on the PAT). In other words, could the small transition peak in Figure 5E at approximately 60 nt be one PABP and one LARP4 molecule bound to polyA? I am not sure this is what the authors are suggesting and I would appreciate some clarity.

This is indeed a new method designed to have attributes for transcriptome-wide PAT analysis. Multiple of the <italic>p</italic> values in the revised manuscript strengthen SM-PAT-seq data that compare different LARP4 activity states including null. However, we also added <italic>p</italic> values to strengthen data demonstrating the performance of the SM-PAT-seq method itself, as quantitative of transcript abundance as compared to RNA-seq, <italic>p</italic> value of 2.2e-16 (subsection “Transcriptome wide, long-read, single-molecule poly(A)-tail, SM-PAT-seq”, and legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). And also, as quantitative of transcript abundance in triplicate compared to triplicate northern blotting for GFP mRNA; R<bold><sup>2</sup></bold> = 0.96, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000035 noted in the subsection “LARP4 expression leads to poly(A) tail net-lengthening of thousands of mRNAs” and as a new figure panel, Figure 2G. The graphic data in Figure 2G strengthens the point that protection of long PATs by LARP4 appears to confer stability to stable mRNA (GFP mRNA). Other attributes of our SM-PAT-seq method are notable. Although it reports sequence from single mRNA molecules, each CCS read is derived from multiple subreads of the same molecule. Thus a CCS read of a ~1 kb amplicon (e.g., a 3’ UTR) would correspond to ~200 Illumina reads dispersed on an mRNA, but with confidence in its single molecule derivation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), the latter of which is lacking from the short read technology. Finally, the method was designed to produce small circles as amplicons rather than try to obtain native mRNA 5’ ends because this improves read accuracy by increasing the number of subreads per unit time during the run (see Figure 1).</p><p>We appreciate that the reviewer recognizes that use of SM-PAT-seq with ActD advances understanding of regulatory mechanisms. We discuss the findings in the context of the model developed in response to the reviewer’s comment 3 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) However, the Discussion overall seems unnecessarily long (5+ pages) and even rambling issues that would be better presented in a review paper.

We revised the Discussion accordingly and it was shortened to ~3.5 pages. We followed this reviewer’s suggestion to focus on the potential of the proposed model. The new Figure 6 panels are graphics to help describe and interpret the differences in the SM-PAT-seq profiles that reflect the presence and absence of cellular LARP4. The C panel is relevant to interpretation of the A and B panels and specific issues raised by reviewer #2. We are thankful for the suggestion to focus on the model. We believe that the model and the manuscript have been improved.</p><p>In summary, I am thankful to have received such a constructive critique.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Mattijssen et al., reports the effect of the RNA binding protein LARP4 on mRNA deadenylation, emphasising its impact on short polyA tails.

This resulted in our realization that some details should be revised. The comments and questions raised by the reviewer indeed reflect inconsistencies that were revised. We replaced the small graphic that comprised previous Figure 5E and created the new Figure 6 as an expanded working model to serve to help interpret our data. The presentation also specifically addresses the points raised by the reviewer. To accompany the graphic and also focus more on the potential of the model as suggested by reviewer #1, the Discussion was reorganized to more clearly describe it.</p><p>Panel C of the new Figure 6 schematically depicts various states of three and two PABP molecules bound to poly(A) of different lengths, in a style similar to Webster et al., 2018) to help model the different size PATs in the figure panels A and B as potential PAT-PABP complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My only critique regards some of the Discussion. In the proposed model of LARP4-PABP-sensitive protection from critical deadenylation the authors suggest that LARP4 slows deadenylation process from 75 nt (two PABP) to 37 nt (one PABP) by interacting to polyA and PABP (and this stabilises PABP on the PAT). In other words, could the small transition peak in Figure 5E at approximately 60 nt be one PABP and one LARP4 molecule bound to polyA? I am not sure this is what the authors are suggesting and I would appreciate some clarity. If this is the case, a PAM2w mutant of LARP4A or ΔNTR should behave differently, as these mutants have a lower ability to associate with polyA (Cruz-Gallardo et al).</p></disp-quote><p>To be clear, I want to note that I believe I was mistaken to assign the ~75 nt peak in previous Figure 5E as having a number of PABPs. I have come to believe that according to current models, peaks of 75 nt in PAT profiles would likely be bound by three PABPs. In the Results section of the revised manuscript we now note “The ~75 nt peak seen in Figure 5C is consistent with mRNAs that would harbor three PABP molecules (Webster et al., 2018)”. This is also detailed in the Discussion.</p><p>With regard to clarification on the issue of whether the small transition peak at approximately 60 nt could include a LARP4 molecule, we are confident that LARP4 is undetectable in the KO cells, however, we revised the Discussion to note “It is also possible that profile differences may reflect presence/absence of proteins other than PABP.”</p><p>Finally, we agree that if LARP4 uses its NTR to stabilize the PABP-PAT complex by poly(A) binding or MLLE binding, a ΔNTR mutant should behave differently. We indeed look forward to analyze results from the suggested mutant and its controls, however this data is not presently available and the analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other confusing point, to me, is the seventh paragraph of the subsection “A proposed model of LARP4-PABP-sensitive protection from critical deadenylation” – [By extrapolation…the point at which only 2 PABP remain on the PAT would fit with this transition point at 100-110 nt]. I am somewhat confused here by whether the authors mean the transition point at 110nt is 2 or 3 PABP – the sentence here seems to contradict previous statements.</p></disp-quote><p>I apologize for the confusion and unintentional contradiction. The revised Discussion is hopefully clear: “We suspect that the 60-75 nt peak in KO represents PATs bound by three PABPs in intermediate states of dissociation/peeling off (Webster et al., 2018) (below) that are being shortened to accumulate as the peak of ~40-50 nt PATs bound by two PABPs. By extrapolation, PATs bound by two PABP-dimers would appear in the approximate 90-110 nt range in these profiles, the region of KO and WT overlap (Figure 6A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, to understand this mechanism in more depth, it may be interesting to elaborate on the role of PAM2 competition binding between LARP4 and Tob2 (of the Ccr4-Not-Caf1-Tob2 deadenylation complexes).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest in elaborating on the role of PAM2 competition binding between LARP4 and Tob2 of the Ccr4-Not-Caf1-Tob2 deadenylation complexes. We expanded on this as suggested.</p><p>The last two paragraphs of the revised Discussion include:</p><p>“In this model, decreased PABP-PAT stability would be compensated by interactions with LARP4 (Cruz-Gallardo et al., 2019; Mattijssen et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2011). […] Effects on long PATs and stable mRNA demonstrated here suggest the possibility that LARP4 can influence mRNA early in its lifespan with penetrant consequence later. Thus LARP4 raises issues regarding the long and short of PAT metabolism.”</p><p>In conclusion, I thank the Reviewer for a very helpful critique.</p></body></sub-article></article>
