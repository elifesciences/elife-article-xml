To what extent batch effects, measurement error in biomarker levels between slides, affects TMA-based studies has not been assessed systematically. We evaluated 20 protein biomarkers on 14 TMAs with prospectively collected tumor tissue from 1448 primary prostate cancers. In half of the biomarkers, more than 10% of biomarker variance was attributable to between-TMA differences (range, 1–48%). We implemented different methods to mitigate batch effects (R package <italic>batchtma</italic>), tested in plasmode simulation. Biomarker levels were more similar between mitigation approaches compared to uncorrected values. For some biomarkers, associations with clinical features changed substantially after addressing batch effects. Batch effects and resulting bias are not an error of an individual study but an inherent feature of TMA-based protein biomarker studies. They always need to be considered during study design and addressed analytically in studies using more than one TMA.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>To understand cancer, researchers need to know which molecules tumor cells use. These so-called ‘biomarkers’ tag cancer cells as being different from healthy cells, and can be used to predict how aggressive a tumor may be, or how well it might respond to treatment.</p><p>A popular technique for assessing biomarkers across multiple tumors is to use tissue microarrays. This involves taking samples from different tumors and embedding them in a block of wax, which is then cut into micro-thin slices and stained with reagents that can detect specific biomarkers, such as proteins. Each block contains hundreds of samples, which all experience the same conditions. So, any patterns detected in the staining are likely to represent real variations in the biomarkers present.</p><p>Many cancer studies, however, often compare samples from multiple tissue microarrays, which may increase the risk of technical artifacts: for example, staining may look stronger in one batch of tissue samples than another, even though the amount of biomarker present in these different arrays is roughly the same. These ‘batch effects’ could potentially bias the results of the experiment and lead to the identification of misleading patterns.</p><p>To evaluate how batch effects impact tissue microarray studies, Stopsack et al. examined 14 wax blocks which contained tumor samples from 1,448 men with prostate cancer. This revealed that for some biomarkers, but not others, there were noticeable differences between tissue microarrays that were clearly the result of batch effects. Stopsack et al. then tested six different ways of fixing these discrepancies using statistical methods. All six approaches were successful, even if the arrays included tumors with different characteristics, such as tumors that had been diagnosed more or less recently.</p><p>This work highlights the importance of considering batch effects when using tissue microarrays to study cancer. Stopsack et al. have used their statistical approaches to develop freely available software which can reduce the biases that sometimes arise from these technical artifacts. This could help researchers avoid misleading patterns in their data and make it easier to detect real variations in the biomarkers present between tumor samples.</p></abstract><kwd-group

microarrays (TMAs) were first developed in the 1990s as an efficient way to examine tissue-based biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kononen et al., 1998</xref>). Since then, TMAs have been used in thousands of studies to evaluate histologic and molecular biomarkers, mostly in cancer tissue. Individual TMAs consist of cylindrical cores from hundreds of tissue samples embedded in one recipient block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kononen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kallioniemi et al., 2001</xref>). Studies often include more than one TMA. Even when biomarker assays are well standardized and run conditions are diligently kept fixed, some TMA slides (batches) may have measurements systematically too low or too high, and some batches may have wider spread around the true values of the biomarker than others. In general, such batch effects can have a profound impact on the validity of biomarker studies, such as those using RNA microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tworoger and Hankinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leek et al., 2010</xref>). Contrary to popular belief, whether such measurement error induces upward or downward bias in results is not guaranteed to follow simple heuristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Smeden et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Whether and to what extent TMAs are affected by batch effects has not been empirically assessed. TMAs pose unique challenges. For example, when tumor tissue is collected prospectively for inclusion on TMAs, tumor characteristics may differ between batches due to nonrandom assignment of cases, as well as temporal trends in tumor risk factors, screening, and diagnosis. Differences in tissue processing or storage across tissue specimens may have differential impact on biomarkers. Including calibration samples for quality control is also more challenging for TMAs than, for example, assaying of blood samples, because repeat sections from a tumor may differ due to intratumoral heterogeneity rather than only batch effects.</p><p>In this study, we assess batch effects in a large set of centrally constructed TMAs from prostate cancer tissue from 1448 men in two nationwide cohort studies. We quantify the extent to which protein biomarker variation could be explained by batch effects. We probe different methods for mitigating batch effects while maintaining true, “biological,” between-TMA variation, including in a plasmode simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of handling batch effects on commonly performed biomarker analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extent and type of batch effects</title><p>To evaluate the presence of batch effects in studies using TMAs, we studied tumor tissue from 1448 men with primary prostate cancer on 14 TMAs (labeled “A” through “N”), each including multiple tumor cores from 47 to 158 patients per TMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Notably, between-TMA differences were present with any of these approaches. For example, batch effects were not only present when considering intensities of biomarker staining, as for the estrogen receptor alpha and beta example.

First, that between-TMA differences in biomarkers reflect different patient and tumor characteristics that need to be retained. Second, that between-TMA differences are artifacts due to systematic measurement error that need to be removed (batch effects).</p><p>In support of the first hypothesis, there were noticeable differences in patient and tumor characteristics between TMAs that are likely associated with biomarker levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Along with a 14-year range between the per-TMA medians of cancer diagnosis year, there were differences in the proportion of tumors with a Gleason score of 8 or higher (between 11% and 33%) and rates of lethal disease (between 2 and 16 events per 1000 person-years of follow-up).</p><p>In support of the second hypothesis, we observed that certain TMAs had consistently higher or lower biomarker values for the majority of tested biomarkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For example, the same batches that showed higher-than-average biomarker values for stathmin also had higher-than-average values for PTEN. This example is noteworthy because both markers were assayed together on the same section of each TMA using multiplex immunofluorescence, and stathmin would be expected to be expressed in more aggressive tumors with activation of the PI3K signaling pathway while PTEN expression would be expected to be low in the same tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stopsack et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Further supporting the second hypothesis, we did not observe any meaningful reduction in ICCs when we considered tumors that had the same clinical features in terms of Gleason score and stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the association between Gleason score and biomarker levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) was considerably lower than between TMAs and biomarker levels, as underscored by less pronounced visual separation of principal components by Gleason score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) than by TMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Gleason score differences explained no more than 13% of the variance in biomarker levels (for prostate-specific membrane antigen, PSMA; 95% CI for ICC, 0.02–0.29), and 13 of the 20 biomarkers had ICCs by Gleason score of 1% or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To directly disentangle both hypotheses, we further examined data on 10 tumors with a total of 53 tumor cores for which some cores were included on different TMAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These were not included in the previous analyses and had estrogen receptor scoring data. This design allowed us to estimate biomarker differences directly attributable to between-TMA variability within the same tumors while controlling for the between-core variability expected due to intratumoral heterogeneity. Of the total variance in estrogen receptor alpha levels, 30% (95% CI, 0–67) was explained by between-TMA variation; for estrogen receptor beta, 24% (95% CI, 0–60) was explained by between-TMA variation. For comparison, between-tumor variation explained 37% (95% CI, 4–68) of the variance of estrogen receptor alpha levels and 26% (95% CI, 0–57) of the variance of estrogen receptor beta levels.</p><p>Collectively, while these observations highlighted moderate differences in clinical and pathological characteristics between TMAs, they suggested that between-TMA differences were largely due to batch effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mitigation of batch effects</title><p>We implemented six different approaches for batch effects mitigation and compared these to the uncorrected biomarker levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two mitigation approaches, batch means (approach 2) and quantile normalization (approach 6), assumed no true difference between TMAs is arising from patient and tumor characteristics, while all other approaches attempted to retain such differences between TMAs. It is possible that the choice of mitigation approaches may be optimized using knowledge of the source of the batch effect. This would be the case if each method “specialized” in mitigating effect from specific sources. We have not investigated this possibility here. Overall, correlations between values adjusted by different approaches were higher (mean Pearson r, 0.97–1.00) than between uncorrected values and corrected values (r, 0.90–0.95), regardless of mitigation approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Approaches 2–7 reduced visible separation by batch on plots of the first two principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Consequently, batch effect-corrected values by approaches 2–4 were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

A drawback of both stratification-based approaches is that they do not explicitly estimate batch effect-adjusted biomarker values that could be visualized directly.</p><p>Scenarios evaluated thus far were based on the actual, modest imbalance of confounders between batches and at most weak associations between the biomarker and confounders, resulting in weak confounding overall.

Bias occurred when using uncorrected biomarker levels in the presence of any batch effects, except if there was no association between biomarker and outcome (i.e., a hazard ratio of 1), and with mean-only approaches 2–4 if variance was also affected by batch effects. In no situation, except possibly with the quantile regression-based approach 5, were estimates after batch effect mitigation farther from the expected values than results based on uncorrected biomarker levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Impact of batch effects</title><p>To illustrate how batch effect mitigations alter the results of commonly conducted tumor biomarker analyses, we estimated how uncorrected and corrected biomarker levels were associated with Gleason score and with rates of lethal disease.

However, for markers with higher between-TMA variability (higher ICC) and stronger associations with the outcome, adjustment approaches led to noticeable differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Similar to other high-throughput platforms, batch effects have to be considered in every TMA biomarker study. As we demonstrated, for some of the biomarkers, batch effects can be of substantial magnitude. We show that batch effect mitigation is possible and can enhance study findings.</p><p>In our study of prostate tumor specimens, between-TMA differences explained 10% or more of the variance in biomarker levels for half of the included biomarkers, considerably more than one of the strongest pathological features in prostate cancer, Gleason grade. All analytical mitigation approaches to reduce batch effects, whether they attempted to retain real differences between tumors from different TMAs or not, led to corrected biomarker levels that were more similar to each other than they were, in general, to the uncorrected biomarker levels. In drawing from a large set of protein tumors biomarkers in prostate cancer, we show how appropriately mitigating batch effects strengthens results and their validity for biomarkers affected by batch effects.</p><p>Ideally, batch effects between TMAs are minimized when designing a study. Standardizing how tumor samples are obtained, stored, processed, and assayed is critical, as are stratified or random allocation of tumor samples to different TMAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tworoger and Hankinson, 2006</xref>) when possible. However, the batch effects that we observed occurred despite all feasible standardization efforts. Moreover, samples will be collected sequentially, and TMAs may be constructed sequentially in large-scale prospective studies over time. There were modest differences in the clinical and pathological characteristics between our TMAs, an issue that may be inevitable in larger-scale biobank studies. Allocation schemes of tumors to TMAs that appear ideal retrospectively, for example by matching “cases” of lethal tumors with “controls” of non-lethal tumors, may not be feasible prospectively. Likewise, in few of the thousands of studies using TMAs will it be possible to reallocate tumors to different TMAs and repeat all pathology work merely to reduce the implications of batch effects.</p><p>An additional challenge in the design phase is that tissue samples are inherently heterogeneous and cannot simply be diluted, like blood samples. “Quality control” tumor samples that could serve as a quantitative calibration series suitable for all future biomarkers do not exist. One potential strategy is to include cell lines that have been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded on each TMA. While cell lines address issues of heterogeneity, the cell lines are often genomically unique and as such may not be relevant for all biomarkers. Another potential approach is to include samples from the same tumor case across TMAs, which would allow for direct estimation of batch effects. For these reasons, a principled approach that anticipates batch effects and addresses them analytically is critical.</p><p>Beyond efforts to prevent batch effects during the study design phase, we suggest the following best practices when undertaking TMA-based tissue biomarker studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, the extent of potential batch effects should be explored and reported in any study of cancer tissue using TMAs. Inspecting TMA slides and plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manimaran et al., 2016</xref>) is important. Between-TMA variation should be quantified, for example by calculating ICCs, that is, to contrast variation of biomarker levels between TMAs compared to that between or within tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2010</xref>). In our study, for half of the biomarkers, ICCs for between-TMA variation were low, at less than 10%, although the proportion of tolerable batch variation should be chosen based on the context. Whether TMAs differ in terms of average biomarker levels, low levels (possibly reflective of background), or variability between tumors will also inform what impact of between-TMA differences to expect.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Recommended workflow for anticipating and handling batch effects between tissue microarrays (TMAs).</title><p>Following prevention approaches at the design phase of a project, all TMA-based studies should explore the potential for batch effects once a biomarker has been measured. Addressing batch effects should only be skipped there is no indication for their presence. Batch effect-corrected biomarker levels can easily be generated by the <italic>batchtma</italic> R package.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71265-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Second, the source of between-TMA differences should be elucidated. Ideally, including multiple cores from the same tumors in more than one TMA will help estimating, again using ICCs, how biomarker levels vary between TMAs, between tumors, and within tumors. Alternatively, ICCs between TMAs can be estimated by restricting to or adjusting for tumor features associated with differences in the biomarker, if known. In our study, both approaches indicated that the largest share of between-TMA differences was likely due to batch effects rather than due to true differences between tumors on different TMAs. However, one should not simply assume this to be the case in other settings, and also explore between-tumor differences as one source of between-TMA differences.</p><p>In multidisciplinary team discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marrone et al., 2019</xref>), it may be possible to directly pinpoint the source of batch effects and eliminate its cause. All study steps, including the pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic phases, should be considered. If sources of batch effects can be identified, it is preferable that they be addressed directly during the pre-analytical or analytical phase, rather than applying the post-analytical methods that we have described here and that may not adequately incorporate knowledge on the source of batch effects. For example, if immunohistochemical staining was performed separately for each TMA, then immunohistochemistry and quantification should be repeated using new sections from all TMAs at once. Imaging of pathology slides can also be a source of batch effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kothari et al., 2014</xref>), as could be image analysis. In other cases, particularly if such obvious reasons for batch effects were avoided through standardized processing, as in our examples, it may remain elusive whether batch effects were induced through subtle differences in how tumors were cored and embedded during TMA construction, how long they had been stored, how they were sectioned, how well the staining process was standardized, or how successfully background signal was eliminated during software-based quantification. Yet even biomarkers scored by manual quantification were not free from batch effects.</p><p>Third, if a biomarker is affected by batch effects and no “physical” remediation is possible, then post-analytical approaches should be used to reduce bias in results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tworoger and Hankinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leek et al., 2010</xref>). We demonstrate that in all plausible or exaggerated real-world scenarios, estimates after applying batch effect mitigations were consistently closer to the true underlying values than they were without. If batches do not only differ in terms of mean values, but also in terms of their variances, then methods that focus solely on means may be insufficient. A simple quantile-normalization-based approach was successful in reducing bias in real-world scenarios and could be preferred for its simplicity. It is important to note that any method tested in this study is preferable over not addressing batch effects, and thus the choice between methods should be secondary to the choice to address batch effects altogether. Only results for biomarkers that are affected by batch effects and that are associated with the outcome of interest will show large changes in estimates, as the vitamin D receptor in our example. In contrast, for the majority of our example biomarkers, results did not change appreciably because batch effects were low, associations with the outcome were close to null, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We recommend that researchers openly address batch effects in their TMA-based studies: they are not an error of an individual study, but an inherent feature of TMA-based studies. Batch effects have long been recognized in studies of the transcriptome using microarrays and next-generation sequencing, where batch effect mitigations are a component of standard workflows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leek et al., 2012</xref>). Our data strongly suggest that protein biomarker studies using multiple TMAs are at risk of batch effects just like any other biomarker study. The extent of batch effects is difficult to predict, and empirical evaluation is necessary each time. Future studies should quantify between-TMA differences and, if they deem batch effect mitigations to be unnecessary, provide evidence for absence of batch effects, rather than merely assuming their absence. The methods that we provide facilitate the appropriate migration of batch effects between TMAs and help strengthen scientific inference. It may be prudent to extend this approach to in-situ tissue biomarkers other than proteins, such as RNA in-situ hybridization, even if our study only demonstrated batch effects for proteins. Having mitigated batch effects will allow researchers to focus on increasing study validity by addressing other sources of measurement error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Smeden et al., 2020</xref>), selection bias (e.g., from tumor biospecimen availability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), and confounding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>TMAs and biomarkers</title><p>Tumor tissue in this study was from men who were diagnosed with primary prostate cancer during prospective follow-up of two nationwide cohort studies.

This approach assumes that all TMAs, if not affected by batch effects, would have the same mean biomarker value. Differences in mean biomarker values per batch are corrected by estimating batch-specific mean effects (differences from the overall mean level) using a linear regression model with uncorrected biomarker values as the outcome and batch indicators as predictors. Corrected biomarker values are then obtained by subtracting batch-specific effects from the uncorrected biomarker values. Mean differences can either indicate the difference of each batch mean to the overall mean, as implemented here, or be defined by comparison to a reference batch.</p><p>(3) Standardized means. This approach estimates marginal means per batch using model-based standardization (in the epidemiologic sense). It assumes that batches with similar characteristics have the same means if not affected by batch effects. A linear regression model for a specific biomarker is fit, adjusting for tumor variables that differ in distribution between TMAs, similar to an approach described in the epidemiology literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosner et al., 2008</xref>.

Like the preceding approach, this approach assumes that batches with similar characteristics have the same means if not affected by batch effects. While the preceding approach assumes a constant association between covariates and biomarker levels across batches, this approach allows for associations to differ between batches. We first used inverse probability weighting for marginal standardization of the distribution of clinical and pathological features per batch to the distribution in the entire study population. Stabilized weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cole and Hernán, 2008</xref>), truncated at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile, were obtained through multinomial regression models, modeling the probability of assignment to a specific batch based on same clinical and pathological variables as in approach 3. In the weighted pseudopopulation, we then used a marginal linear model to estimate batch-specific mean differences, which were further used as in approaches 2 and 3.</p><p>(5) Quantile regression. This approach assumes that batches with similar characteristics have the same values for a selected set of batch-specific quantiles, in this application the upper and lower quartile. The lower quartile may be particularly affected by background noise, while the upper quartile may more likely reflect differences in batches due to covariates. A corollary of separately modeling the two differently is that clinical and pathological variables are allowed to have different effects on these quartiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bann et al., 2020</xref>). These assumptions contrast with approaches 2–4 that focus on mean levels only. We used quantile regression with the Frisch-Newton approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Portnoy and Koenker, 1997</xref>) separately for the first and third quartile of biomarker values with batch indicators to predict adjusted batch-specific quantile values with the same confounders as above.

We implemented quantile normalization using <italic>limma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolstad et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A conceptually related approach, for example, employed in molecular epidemiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tworoger and Hankinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marrone et al., 2019</xref>), would be to use within-batch ranks as the batch-corrected biomarker, often grouped into data-driven categories such as batch-specific quartiles. We did not further consider these derivatives because they do not retain absolute biomarker levels and can distort rank distances.</p><p>(7) ComBat. For comparison, we additionally included the ComBat algorithm, which like approach 4 attempts to retain differences in batch means due to covariate differences; it is frequently applied together with approach 6. ComBat and its derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) were initially designed for microarray studies of gene expression, which include considerably more than one biomarker per sample. This property would typically limit their use for a protein biomarker quantified on a TMA unless a large number of biomarkers is available, as in our study. Mitigation depends on values of other biomarkers on the same batches. Even if multiple protein biomarkers were available, the non-randomly selected set of concomitantly available biomarkers may influence how batch effects are corrected. ComBat scales means and (optionally) variances while (optionally) retaining adjustment variables. ComBat is implemented using an empirical Bayes approach to achieve more favorable properties for small batches. The underlying model is similar to the regression above and has been emulated by a two-way analysis of variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nygaard et al., 2016</xref>). In using ComBat, we scaled both means and variances, adjusting for the same clinical and pathological variables as before. Because ComBat cannot handle biomarkers if they are missing on entire batches, we ran ComBat separately for groups of biomarkers measured on 8, 9, 10, or 14 TMAs.</p><p>(8) Stratification with inverse-variance pooling. An alternative approach to treating batch effects is to estimate outcome regression models separately by batch. This approach can be applied for a variety of regression models but does not result in corrected values. We pooled estimates with inverse variance-weighting to obtain summary estimates.</p><p>(9) Stratification in Cox proportional hazards regression. In a special case of stratification for time-to-event outcomes, Cox proportional hazards models allow for nonparametric batch effect mitigation by including batch as a stratification factor in the model specification. Comparisons are performed within batches. Unlike approach 8, only batch-specific baseline hazard functions but no batch-specific effects are estimated.</p><p>For approaches 1–7, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between uncorrected and corrected biomarker levels. Additionally, we repeated ICC and principal components analyses with corrected levels, and we estimated associations between Gleason score and biomarker levels after batch effect mitigation, stratifying by batch using approach 8.</p><p>Approaches 2–6, which result in batch effect-adjusted biomarker levels, are implemented in the R package <italic>batchtma</italic>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stopsack.github.io/batchtma">https://stopsack.github.io/batchtma</ext-link> and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Plasmode simulation</title><p>We evaluated the impact of batch effect mitigation approaches on known, investigator-determined biomarker–outcome associations using plasmode simulation, an approach used, for example, for evaluating confounding control for binary exposures in pharmacoepidemiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franklin et al., 2014</xref>). We used observed data from all tumors included on the 14 TMAs to determine covariates (Gleason grade, pathological stage) and outcome (lethal disease), preserving the observed correlation structure (e.g., joint distribution of clinical characteristics across TMAs). The only simulated elements were the biomarker levels and the strengths of biomarker–outcome associations (hazard ratios ranging from 1/3 to 3) that we fixed by simulating event times with flexible parametric survival models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crowther and Lambert, 2013</xref>). Models used a baseline hazard function consisting of cubic splines with three knots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jackson, 2016</xref>). Group differences were based on proportional hazards for the observed confounder–outcome coefficients in the real data and the fixed biomarker (exposure)–outcome hazard ratios.</p><p>First, we used plasmode simulation to generate the fixed associations of the biomarker levels with the outcome, which are unknowable outside simulation studies, generating 200 plasmode data sets for each association. Second, we introduced batch effects. Batch effects were either only for the mean or for both mean and variance, using the actual standardized between-TMA differences in means and variances for the estrogen receptor-alpha protein, a biomarker with high ICCs. We also added batch effects for mean and variance with effect modification, making mean and variance changes due to batch effects strongly correlated with Gleason scores. Third, we calculated batch effect-adjusted biomarker levels using approaches 2–6. Finally, we compared the expected hazard ratios for the biomarker–outcome association, fixed during simulations, with the estimated hazard ratios from Cox regression (with normality-based 95% CIs) before and after batch effect mitigation approaches 2–6 and using the two stratification-based approaches 8 and 9.</p><p>In sensitivity analyses, we simulated “moderate” associations between the biomarker and confounders (0.2 standard deviations difference in biomarker levels per Gleason grade group, 0.1 per stage category), “strong” associations (differences of 0.4 and 0.2 standard deviations, respectively; stronger than observed for any biomarker in our study), as well as “strong” associations and additional imbalance in Gleason grade and stage between TMAs (by excluding tumors with low grades from TMAs with higher-than-average means and excluding tumors with high stage from TMAs with low-than-average means), all before the four steps described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Impact of batch effects</title><p>To quantify the impact of different approaches to batch-effect handling on scientific inference, we focused on two commonly employed types of analyses in biomarker research in prostate cancer: first, a cross-sectional analysis of Gleason score and biomarker levels, using linear regression models; second, a time-to-event analysis of biomarker levels and rates of lethal disease, using Cox proportional hazards regression. Gleason scores were modeled as ordinal variables and biomarkers as linear variables to obtain one single estimate per model. We also categorized biomarkers into four quartiles and compared hazard ratios for lethal disease of the extreme quartiles. Models were designed only for investigating issues of batch effects and not for subject matter inference on specific biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The batchtma R package is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stopsack.github.io/batchtma">https://stopsack.github.io/batchtma</ext-link> and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

Please note our responses to reviewer comments in detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Based on the first paragraph of the methods, it seems the overall TMA set included 14 different TMA blocks labeled A through N as illustrated in Figure 1, while in Figure 3, panel B, it appears as if multiple blocks/slides are included in a single TMA (e.g., A, H, K, N). It would be useful to provide a clear description of the actual unit of analysis with respect to whether a single TMA consisted of multiple blocks, or if each TMA (e.g., A-N) was a single block. This would be particularly useful information given potential batch effects could be introduced during the analytic phase as not all 14 TMAs would be assayed simultaneously, or not at all for smaller sets that could be assayed in a single run.</p></disp-quote><p>Each tissue microarray (TMA) was one block, named “A” through “N” in the manuscript, and was the unit of analysis throughout. We have edited the manuscript to clarify this point.</p><p>Modifications to the manuscript:</p><p>Results, first paragraph, first sentence (additions): “To evaluate the presence of batch effects in studies using TMAs, we studied tumor tissue from 1,448 men with primary prostate cancer on 14 TMAs (labeled “A” through “N”), each including multiple tumor cores from 47 to 158 patients per TMA (Figure 1).”</p><p>Results, second paragraph, second sentence (additions): “Biomarker values showed noticeable between-TMA variation, despite immunohistochemical staining having been conducted at the same time for all 14 TMAs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors only investigated whether pre-analytic factors such as tumor stage, grade, and date of diagnosis were associated with the observed batch effects it should be acknowledged that batch effects could be introduced during the pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic phases of biomarker investigations. For example, the authors could compare the ICCs for biomarkers assessed using software vs. eye, and % cells vs. area to provide the reader a sense of how these analytic factors influence between batch variation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that batch effects can be introduced during any study phase, and that it is important to acknowledge this. We now do so in the discussion. In our analysis, while we focus on pre-analytic factors, we have standardized analytic and post-analytic factors to the best of our ability, leaving no known sources of variance for quantitative exploration. However, the potential exists for different approaches to image analysis to affect the extent and nature of pre-analytic batch effects. We have also added the terminology of “pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic” to the relevant section of the Discussion.</p><p>As a team, we discussed to what extent we could attribute higher between-TMA variance to factors such as the quantification approach (software vs. eye) or the staining measure (intensity vs. % “positive” vs. area positive). Ultimately, given the sample size of “only” 20 biomarkers (three of which were analytically identical, but had quite different ICCs; see Results, second section, third paragraph), we do not feel comfortable highlighting any contrasts, given the substantial statistical uncertainty around ICC estimates and a risk of overinterpretation. We are interested in this problem but addressing it rigorously would be beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Modifications to the manuscript:</p><p>Discussion, sixth paragraph (addition): “In multidisciplinary team discussions (10), it may be possible to directly pinpoint the source of batch effects and eliminate its cause. All study steps, including the pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic phases, should be considered. If sources of batch effects can be identified, it is preferable that they be addressed directly during the pre-analytical or analytical phase, rather than applying the post-analytical methods that we have described here and that may not adequately incorporate knowledge on the source of batch effects. For example, if immunohistochemical staining was performed separately for each TMA […] at once. Imaging of pathology slides can also be a source of batch effects (11), as could be image analysis.”</p><p>To Results, fourth paragraph (previously starting with “The method of scoring…”), we added the following sentence at the beginning: “Some biomarkers were stained using automated staining systems, other stains were done manually (Figure 2). Moreover, the method of scoring…” At the end of that paragraph, we added: “Our data do not allow distinguishing which of these approaches, if any, were less prone to batch effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, it should also be acknowledged that the six statistical approaches to correcting the observed batch-effects were evaluated agnostically with respect to the source of the systematic measurement error for each biomarker. The authors may want to comment on whether these approaches, or others not evaluated, are suited for situations in which the source of the batch effect is known.</p></disp-quote><p>We prefer directly addressing the source, if known; how to do that and whether the methods we describe would be applicable is probably best decided on a case-by-case basis. We now alert the reader to the fact that none of mitigation approaches leverages information about the source.</p><p>Modifications to the manuscript:</p><p>Results, third section (“Mitigation of batch effects”), first paragraph (addition): “Two mitigation approaches, batch means (approach 2) and quantile normalization (approach 6), assumed no true difference between TMAs is arising from patient and tumor characteristics, while all other approaches attempted to retain such differences between TMAs. It is possible that the choice of mitigation approaches may be optimized using knowledge of the source of the batch effect. This would be the case if each method “specialized” in mitigating effect from specific sources. We have not investigated this possibility here. Overall, correlations between values …”</p><p>See the previous point for modifications to paragraph six of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the TMA set was nested within two large epidemiologic cohorts and constructed using standard protocols on a rolling basis as new events occurred and tissue was acquired, its not clear whether the null association between the pre-analytic factors and the batch effects observed in the 20 biomarkers could be generalizable to TMAs constructed using different protocols leveraging archived tumor samples and to other tissue biomarkers that may be influenced by the tumor microenvironment such that TMAs may not be ideal for certain biomarker investigations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Modifications to the manuscript: Discussion, sixth paragraph (addition): “In our study, both approaches indicated that the largest share of between-TMA differences was likely due to batch effects rather than true differences between tumors on different TMAs. However, one should not simply assume this to be the case in other settings, and also explore between-tumor differences as one source of between-TMA differences.”</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Generally this reviewer does not make major comments on structure, but the Results section jumps from Figure 1 to Figure 4 to Figure 2. It makes sense in the narrative of the story, but figures should be reorganized to suite the order of discussion. It is a detriment to the work the authors have put in and shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reordered the supplementary figures to link to a main figure, and all figures are now numbered in the order they are first mentioned.</p></body></sub-article></article>
