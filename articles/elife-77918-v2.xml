function. However, systematic atlasing across modalities is limited by challenges to effective image alignment. We combine highly spatially resolved electron microscopy (EM) and highly temporally resolved time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (FM) to examine the emergence of a complex nervous system in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryogenesis. We generate an EM time series at four classic developmental stages and create a landmark-based co-optimization algorithm for cross-modality image alignment, which handles developmental heterochrony among datasets to achieve accurate single-cell level alignment. Synthesis based on the EM series and time-lapse FM series carrying different cell-specific markers reveals critical dynamic behaviors across scales of identifiable individual cells in the emergence of the primary neuropil, the nerve ring, as well as a major sensory organ, the amphid.

This data has revolutionized our ability to observe the development, structure, and function of the nervous system. However, interpretation and synthesis of this data remain challenging. Combining multiple modalities typically provides complementary information yielding a more holistic view of structural and functional dynamics across spatial and temporal scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, 2021</xref>). Despite this, systematic atlasing that explicitly combines modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vergara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lalit et al., 2020</xref>) is limited, in part due to the technical difficulties in cross-modality image alignment. Most automated alignment methods such as those used in brain and whole organism atlases focus on appearance-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vergara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kunst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) which align areas with similar appearances. However, in cross-modality applications there is generally little shared appearance. Another class of alignment methods use anatomical landmarks, typically represented as points, and take known correspondences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>) or match points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lalit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heckscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yemini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toyoshima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Long et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhary et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preibisch et al., 2010</xref>) to compute an alignment. To account for complex variation of landmark positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toyoshima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Insley and Shaham, 2018</xref>), a variety of approaches are used to exploit relative position to improve matching accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lalit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Long et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhary et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preibisch et al., 2010</xref>), but performance is limited with dense landmarks (typically 50–60% accuracy, at best). Efforts to build in additional information such as multi-color labeling to distinguish the landmarks, while technically difficult, can greatly improve matching performance (to 81–86%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yemini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhary et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Developmental data, which encompass dynamic anatomical changes over an extended time period, contain even more challenges. Different developmental processes show slight variation of developmental speed, creating heterochrony among anatomical structures. Between samples of comparable developmental stage, certain cell types and tissues/organs may or may not be present, causing a mismatch in the landmarks present. These potentially significant differences between samples complicate alignment and matching. More quantitatively, heterochrony in cell movement (from active migration or tissue shape change) may cause systematic positional variation that confounds approaches with naïve assumptions. Alignment using manually selected landmarks that are always present across samples partially bypasses these challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Efforts at alignment that largely ignore these discrepancies between individuals have also been attempted, with limited accuracy (&lt;50%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lalit et al., 2020</xref>). However, generally, heterochrony and the associated challenges in developmental data are unaddressed.</p><p>Here, we address these limitations in a cross-modal study of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neural development. Specifically, we address two methodological difficulties, the challenge of annotating identities in developmental EM data, and that of collating the spatial detail of EM with the temporal detail of FM. We build an EM time series of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryonic development and conduct cross-modality synthesis with time lapse FM to examine neural development with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution.</p><p>EM studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have made profound contributions to neuroscience including the first connectome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">White et al., 1997</xref>, sexual dimorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2019</xref>), variability among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brittin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>), and principles of structural organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brittin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moyle et al., 2021</xref>). However, these efforts are focused on the larval and adult nervous system, which leaves unanswered many questions about how the complex structure of the nervous system arises. Some EM work examines distinctive embryonic structures that can be readily identified such as the excretory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soulavie et al., 2018</xref>), amphid dendrite tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Low et al., 2019</xref>), or the general appearance of the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rapti et al., 2017</xref>). However, since neurons are typically identified in EM based on specialized adult morphologies it is challenging to identify them in the embryo during their emergence. It is primarily work using live FM that has examined the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system during embryogenesis, providing insight into neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shah et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>), organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Low et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2019</xref>), neuropil formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moyle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rapti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kennerdell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shah et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sengupta et al., 2021</xref>), synaptic specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berghoff, 2021</xref>), as well as lineage differentiation and brain asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cochella and Hobert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masoudi et al., 2021</xref>). Lineage tracing in FM establishes definitive identities for cells via ancestry even when they lack distinctive positions or morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shah et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2006</xref>) and light sheet microscopy allows imaging to extend into embryonic motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). However, these efforts are limited by the lack of spatial resolution and availability of cell-specific markers needed to resolve individual cell shape. To fill in this gap, we generate an EM embryonic series, develop and apply a landmark-based co-optimization algorithm for cross-modality alignment in the presence of developmental variation. Furthermore, we synthesize the EM series and live FM series data representing over a dozen markers. The cross-modality synthesis reveals critical dynamic behaviors of identifiable individual cells across scales in the emergence of the primary neuropil, the nerve ring, as well as the sensory end of a major sensory organ, the amphid. Our study paves the way for systematic cross-modality data synthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and demonstrates a powerful approach that may be applied broadly. We present the resulting annotated series as a resource for the community in an online format that facilitates additional community-based curation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multi-modal developmental time series of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis</title><p>We first image an EM time series of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis with data at four classic stages, the bean, comma, 1.5-fold and 2-fold stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The EM series spans a critical 150-min time window during which most tissues undergo major morphological changes: pharyngeal and intestinal lumens develop, distinctive morphologies develop in muscles and the excretory system, the epidermis spreads and closes over the embryo, and the body length doubles. In the nervous system, most of the major nerve tracts emerge. The nerve ring is not yet present at the first time point, but densely populated at the end of this period. As part of the effort to test and demonstrate the feasibility of EM time series acquisition, the bean and comma stage embryos are imaged with Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) while the 1.5- and 2-fold stage embryos are imaged with Array Tomography (AT).

These image series typically begin at the four-cell stage and continue for approximately 8 hr until the 1.75-fold stage and the onset of embryonic movement, with a temporal resolution of 60 or 75 s. The nuclear labels are used to trace the entire cell lineage and provide the position and lineage identity of every cell at every time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katzman et al., 2018</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>).</p><p>In order to correlate a FM series to the EM series, we use the nuclear positions, which are also annotated for the EM series, as the common reference (i.e. a Rosetta stone) which allows us to identify cells in the EM. Given nuclei in both data sets we find the optimal 4D (3D+time) alignment between cells in the FM and EM series which conveys the lineage based identities to cells in the EM series. We then relate the dynamic cell behaviors as observed in the FM and EM series based on the correlated cell identities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The co-optimization algorithm for cross-modality alignment of developmental images</title><p>We present a landmark-based approach for cross-modality image alignment, which accounts for developmental variation and functions well with challenging dense landmarks. Alignment here takes the form of assigning landmark identities from a set of labeled data to novel unlabeled data, this involves both the computation of a geometric alignment proper and matching. The landmarks, which could be of any anatomical scale that originate from any imaging modality and segmentation method, are represented as spatial point clouds. As detailed below, our algorithm involves an ensemble model of example data to represent the anatomical structure of landmarks in the labeled data and a co-optimization approach for alignment.</p><p>The ensemble model contains three parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) in order to capture the regularity and developmental variations of the anatomy: the set of labeled data; a neighbor graph representing consistent estimated adjacencies (see Materials and methods) observed between landmarks across individual labeled datasets; and the set of variable landmarks whose presence is inconsistent among labeled data. First, the ensemble, like instance-based learning approaches that use training data to directly model a distribution, can better preserve the complex positional variation observed in the labeled data. Second, the consistent adjacencies graph summarizes the structural consistency in three-dimensional spatial relationships. The adjacency graph captures relative positions, which makes it insensitive to body size variation, or shifting between organs and tissues due to posture, sample distortion or heterochrony in development, since the invariant positional relationships within a given organ/tissue are preserved in the graph. The approach is further motivated by biology. Physical adhesion between cells and tissues underlie anatomical regularity. Consistent adjacencies over multiple samples enrich for the bona fide regularity caused by some underlying physical driver and removes coincidental adjacencies. Third, and most importantly, the set of inconsistent landmarks provides a data-driven approach to handle discrepancies in landmarks between labeled and unlabeled data, which has been a major challenge and source of error in using alignment to establish identity via matching. Inconsistent landmarks are likely discrepancies, which can be used to deliberately modify a labeled dataset by adding or removing these landmarks to reduce discrepancies and improve the success of alignment and identity assignment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The co-optimization algorithm for cross-modality alignment of developmental data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Components of the ensemble model.

Adding or removing inconsistent landmarks in labeled data L<sub>i</sub> creates a modified L<sub>i</sub>’ to be aligned with the unlabeled data. We score the resulting alignment by counting missing consistent adjacencies. This score is used as an objective function to drive optimization as we modify the set of inconsistent landmarks.

We term this process by which we optimize to pick a set of modifications, scoring them by the alignment quality co-optimization.

We use the FM series, where cells were tracked and lineage identities assigned, to generate the ensemble model for each developmental stage in the EM series and transfer cell identities to the EM (see Materials and methods). Due to the lack of lineaged FM data at the 2-fold stage, we align only the bean, comma and 1.5-fold stages in the EM series. Based on the timing of known developmental events in the FM series, the aligned EM data are timed as approximately 320, 345, and 380 min post first cell division (pfc), see Materials and methods for details.

The early time points in the correlated EM series reveal the first outgrowths that establish each entry point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a, b, c</xref>). Sublateral neurons, namely SIAD and SMDD, are the first neurons to initiate outgrowth into the ring, with their initial outgrowth captured at the bean stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This observation is consistent with these neurons serving as early pioneers for the NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moyle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rapti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kennerdell et al., 2009</xref>). In less than a half hour after this outgrowth (comma stage), all entry points have been populated with the corresponding early neurites. Moving from the dorsal midline to the ventral midline: at the dorsal midline, RMED and ALA have grown bilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>); supralateral neurons, namely AVD, AVH, and AVJ have entered and grown dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>); lateral neurons, namely SMDV and RIV have also entered the ring almost reaching the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2d</xref>); and at the ventral midline, RIR, RMEV, and RIH have bilaterally advanced dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2g</xref>). While the EM series provide a comprehensive and definitive set of entry points and first outgrowths due to its label-free nature, the FM series provide much finer temporal resolution of outgrowth dynamics. In terms of the timing of neurite initial outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>), outgrowths observed as having occurred in EM by the bean stage span almost 30 min in the FM while outgrowths observed in EM by the comma stage span an hour as measured in FM. Most of the FM times are congruent with the upper bound of timing provided by EM. Further data would clarify if the occasional contradiction in timing is due to biological variability or technical issues in temporal alignment (see Materials and methods).</p><p>In addition to defining the first outgrowths and the initial outgrowth times, the cross-modality synthesis also reveals dynamics of subsequent neurite growth in the NR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Assayed in a cross section near the lateral entry point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, arrow g in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), the number of processes visible in the NR increase rapidly from 12 at the comma stage to 51 by the twofold stage. Outgrowth dynamics is not reducible to the timing of first outgrowth, subsequent extension also has striking temporal dynamics. For example, the first outgrowths into the amphid commissure, namely ASH, RIB, and AWC, show initial outgrowth at the bean stage, which make them one of the first neurons to grow out in the entire nervous system along with the sublateral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a, c</xref>). However, these neurites, and additional followers from the amphid neurons pause soon after their initial outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moyle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes, 2020</xref>) near the sublateral entry point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a, e</xref> ) before they enter the NR (by the 1.5-fold stage).</p><p>Finally, the spatial resolution of the EM series highlights the precision of control in neurite outgrowth kinetics. For example, comparing the left- and right-side behavior of the first cells to grow into the NR, namely SIADL/R and SMDDL/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2f</xref>), suggests strong symmetry in behavior. Both sides have broken out at the bean stage, with similar sized outgrowths. The contralateral pairs then reach the midline simultaneously at the comma stage: their tips meet precisely beneath the midpoint of the ALA nucleus, which marks the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). This level of precision is not limited to the first sublateral outgrowths. Left and right counterparts among the lateral and supralateral first outgrowths have also reached nearly identical positions relative to the dorsal midline at the comma stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Quantification of the length of the most advanced sublateral neurite pairs SMDDL/R and SIADL/R shows left-right counterparts differ in both cases by less than 2 µm, a few percent of overall length. It is not clear how such level of precision is achieved, or if there is signaling to coordinate between the two sides at this stage though asymmetric sensitivity to guidance molecules has been shown in amphid axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grossman et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cell-cell interactions and ultrastructure during amphid organogenesis</title><p>The amphid is a major sensory organ of <italic>C. elegans</italic> consisting of 12 neurons and two glial cells (the socket and sheath cells).

The sheath cell starts on the anterior side of the amphid rosette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Subsequently, the sheath cell body moves dorsal-posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Lamellipodia-like protrusions from the sheath cell during this process are visible at the bean stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Meanwhile, the anterior portion of the sheath cell wraps itself around the collected mass of the dendrite tips, which is evident by the comma stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). The socket cell exhibits more complex behaviors. One set of behaviors follows a similar course as the sheath cell. The cell body migrates posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), creating transient posterior protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>), while the anterior end remains close to the dendrite tips. Subsequently, after the sheath cell has wrapped the dendrites, the socket cell starts to wrap over the sheath cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). The wrapping is complete by the 1.5-fold stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Low et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oikonomou et al., 2011</xref>). Distinctively, the socket cell must also interface with the epidermis to create the open sensory end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Noteworthy details hint at the dynamic role of the socket cell in the process. During dendrite extension, the socket cell makes elongated protrusions, one of which appears to reach out and contact the advancing epidermal cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Later, the anterior end of the socket cell is juxtaposed between epidermal cells and exposed to the outside of the embryo like a plug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), which may play a role in creating the opening to the environment in the sensory end. The socket cell is fully surrounded by the epidermis by the 1.5-fold stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Overall, the dynamic details from the cross-modality synthesis suggest that the strategy of amphid sensory end assembly is successive wrapping of interior structures with additional layers.</p><p>Furthermore, the series illustrates the elaboration of distinctive ultrastructure. Centrioles move to the dendrite tips between the bean and comma stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2017</xref>). By the twofold stage, centrioles have disappeared, presumably degraded or remodeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nechipurenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2017</xref>), and microtubule bundles (9 bundles per dendrite) are visible growing into the short proto-dendrite tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Their appearance is essentially the same, aside from length, as adult structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doroquez et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, the dendrite tips begin to elaborate their complex morphology. The shape of the dendrite tips remains simple up to the 1.5-fold stage. By the twofold stage, some diversity in length and shape is visible. Notably, two dendrites, namely ADF and ADL, show short bifurcated tips, each with its own set of microtubules branching from a central location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doroquez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). Dendrites tips are not yet individually embedded within the sheath cell by the twofold stage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrates a powerful co-optimization algorithm to align and assign identity to landmarks. Because each cell in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is unique, with well-characterized molecular and morphological traits, it is often desirable to identify individual cells. For postembryonic cell identification, people combine cell position with the characteristic cell/neurite morphology to make a positive identification. In the embryo, before such morphology becomes prominent, cell identification has been challenging. In his seminal work, Sulston suggested that cells in the late embryo can be identified by careful examination of relative positions within small neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>), but he remained the only person who could do so systematically. Instead, researchers use live imaging-based lineage tracing for reliable cell identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schnabel et al., 1997</xref>). By paying attention to relative position through the adjacency graph, our algorithm essentially follows Sulston’s suggestion, and achieves unprecedented accuracy in cell identification. Additional information can be readily added to the adjacency graph to better score matched landmarks and improve the alignment, such as size, appearance and other features of the landmarks when available. Furthermore, while our study is focused on the wild type, one could use live FM to build the appropriate ensemble models to analyze mutants. It should also be possible to adapt our methods to partially imaged embryos. Thus, by eliminating the bottleneck in data acquisition as well as data interpretation, we envision a broad use of EM and cross-modality synthesis of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. As a proof of concept, we present the image data and identity annotation of our correlated WT EM series as an accessible public resource. Existing annotation provides a navigational aid and the seed of a community effort that we hope will fully validate annotation of the series. Extending our method to mutants is conceptually similar, requiring positional information from several lineaged FM data sets and an EM time series. This data could be efficiently assembled, at least in the case of highly penetrant mutants.</p><p>More broadly, the co-optimization algorithm provides a general solution for cross-modality and cross-scale alignment. Representation of landmarks as a point cloud is modality- and scale-free. In our study, we use individual cells/nuclei as landmarks due to the desired single-cell resolution for <italic>C. elegans</italic> biology, but the point cloud can easily represent a mixture of landmarks at different scales, enabling ambitious future work. With advances in deep learning and image analysis, landmarks can be extracted from complex organs such as the mammalian brain by learned region detectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) with increasing reliability. While the mammalian brain is orders of magnitude larger in terms of cells, it is worth noting that in state of the art atlases it is currently annotated with hundreds of regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), which makes alignment at this level of detail a similar scale problem to ours. We postulate that at an optimal level of landmark density consistent adjacencies provide an effective implicit model of anatomy that can maximize available prior information about structure and constrain accurate automated alignment. The data-driven modification in the co-optimization algorithm further facilitates such a vision for future automated alignment and annotation of complex brain images. It readily handles not only biological variability in landmarks (developmental or between individuals) but also technical variability such as errors in landmark extraction or systematic differences between modalities. This model only becomes more powerful as data accumulates. Ultimately, we imagine a multi-modal fusion process built on our approach will be capable of systematically collating information from multiple modalities and discovering consistent landmarks, likely at the level of organs and anatomical structures rather than single cells. Our approach provides spatial alignment robust to landmark variability. Aligning between individuals and over time, and incorporating molecular information to allow segmentation of aligned landmarks into spatio-temporal regions would automate the decision making involved in defining the regions of a digital atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) making a full spatio-temporal atlas of developing anatomy possible.</p><p>Last but not least, or experience provides broader insights on the usefulness of various forms of whole embryo EM in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and beyond. Firstly, our post-hoc correlation of EM and FM data provides a useful alternative to true correlative EM a powerful, but complex to implement, approach for targeted EM based on the expression pattern of fluorescence markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Boer et al., 2015</xref>). The identity of landmarks obtained from our post-hoc correlation can be used to select relevant targets for re-imaging with AT at higher resolution, similar to the use of correlative methods in identifying regions for EM imaging. Dense correspondences could also in principle be used to visualize correlated FM data superimposed on EM. Secondly, our efforts provide broad insights on the relative ease and usefulness of AT and FIB-SEM in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. FIB-SEM excels in axial resolution and avoids alignment artifacts, making it easier to follow small neurites between planes. This is however balanced by greater difficulty in achieving good results due to exacting preparation requirements and slow acquisition of a limited area. As the embryo is close to the maximal size of the imaging area there is danger that only late in acquisition will it become apparent that parts of the embryo are found to be out of the ROI captured. In addition, it can be difficult to precisely stage the embedded embryos until time has been expended on imaging them. In contrast, AT is more artifact prone, but a more flexible and forgiving process. With AT it is possible to section first, then inspect sections and select appropriate samples for imaging. In our application, this is particularly useful for selecting appropriately staged embryos from sections containing multiple embryos before spending time on imaging. AT acquisition is less automated and post-acquisition internal stack alignment can be challenging and require extensive manual effort. However, largely because of its reduced risk of acquisition failure, we have found AT to be more reliable in yielding useful data.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>EM imaging</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>High-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution</title><p>A generous amount of <italic>E. coli</italic> was placed into 0.5 µm carriers filled with 20% BSA solution.

At the bean stage elongation is a weaker cue and we take advantage of the readily identifiable anterior gut cell Ealaa which undergoing mitosis in our bean stage EM embryo to refine our initial estimate. Isolated distinctive divisions are scattered throughout late embryogenesis making this a generally useful strategy. We then visualize the quality of spatio-temporal alignment by applying the pre-alignment as described above and plotting the EM aligned to a randomly selected FP data set. A visualization of manual correspondences under this pre-alignment is then used to adjust the temporal staging if alignment results appear to contain a systematic AP shift related to the elongating body axis.</p><p>We note that quantitative constraint violation scores from the alignment method described below can be used for more precise temporal alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>) which would be useful in implementing fully automated methods of spatio-temporal alignment. A wide and smooth minima around the manual temporal alignment demonstrates that a minimization of constraint violations over different possible temporal alignments would provide a similar temporal alignment to our manual assessment. The absolute minima being offset by a few minutes from our manually assessed staging suggests the approach might even improve on manual time estimate.

The hypothesis that a cell in the labeled data that will soon divide has already done so in the unlabeled dataset is entertained by splitting the parent cell into two cells sharing the same location. Note that while it would be possible to use prior information about the expected division axis to create more accurate daughter positions, this seems over complicated as the main goal is to prevent cascading errors due to qualitative discrepancies in the size of the set of landmarks present.</p><p>A simple, greedy, gradient descent process optimizes the labeled data. The optimization first considers the (limited in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) possible divisions and then deaths and accumulates changes that improve total adjacency constraint violations. For each of these hypotheses a match of the unlabeled dataset against the modified labeled data (L<sub>i</sub>’) is made and adjacency constraint violations are counted under the corresponding alignment (A<sub>i</sub>). A proposed change is kept if it results in a significant (in our case ≥ 3) reduction in adjacency violations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Linear assignment and scoring via consistent adjacencies</title><p>For a given pre-aligned unlabeled dataset and modified labeled dataset, matching is framed as a linear assignment problem (LAP) minimizing the total distance between pairs of points. Missing consistent adjacencies are then used to score these matching results to evaluate modifications and to identify and prohibit incorrect matches.</p><p>Given an alignment between a modified version of the labeled data and unlabeled data that alignment can be evaluated by computing the Gabriel graph for the unlabeled data and, using the predicted identities under the alignment, counting missing consistent adjacencies. The total number of missing consistent adjacencies for the alignment is used to score the modification process described above.</p><p>In addition, a high number of missing consistent adjacencies for an individual landmark’s predicted identity (summed over all expected adjacencies of that landmark only) indicates it is likely wrong (note this can be assessed only given the context of the global alignment, this cannot be assessed independently for a single landmark match). These individual match scores are used to identify and attempt to correct incorrect matches in an iterative process. The individual identity assignment with the worst score, (i.e. the most missing consistent adjacencies) if any exists, is made impossible (set to infinite cost) and LAP matching is repeated. This process is repeated for N iterations, and at the end of those iterations the global alignment with the lowest total violations is selected. Iterative error correction (200 steps) is performed after each modification, before judging its quality. Once a labeled dataset is fully co-optimized an additional 1400 iterations are performed and the best alignment and matching for this is A<sub>i</sub>max.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Voting and reiteration</title><p>Voting picks an identity for each landmark from the set of predicted identities corresponding to an alignment of the unlabeled data against each labeled data set. The most common name out of these independent answers for each landmark in the unlabeled data is taken as its identity. This procedure can result in multiple cells in the unlabeled data being assigned the same identity. Although it would be possible to force a unique set of identities by using an additional linear assignment between landmarks and available identities scored by total votes for each identity per landmark, we do not perform this step as we found this marginally reduces accuracy (data not shown).</p><p>Highly reliable landmark names can be used to reinitialize the alignment more accurately improving matching results. Landmarks in the sample where all or nearly all assignments agree are most reliable, (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Taking landmarks where the winning identity has a 75% supermajority in place of the TGMM automated nonlinear alignment we compute a new landmark based TPS alignment based only on these ‘known good’ matches. These reliable automatic matches are greater in number than initial manual landmarks and can potentially provide a better nonlinear pre-alignment than TGMM. We then repeat the exact same co-optimization based matching for only the subset of uncertain cases, (the certain cases are reinserted with their fixed identities when evaluating adjacency constraints). All reported results include one round of iterative re-alignment.</p><p>Understanding of the overall structure of these steps is aided by pseudo code illustrating how these steps fit together:</p><p>Pseudo-code of the algorithm:</p><p>1. Alignment per labeled data: For each set of labeled data L<sub>i=1..n</sub></p><p> • Two-step spatial pre-alignment between labeled and unlabeled data</p><p>  • Pre-Align via manually ID’d landmarks in L<sub>i</sub> and unlabeled data</p><p>  • Correspondence-less GMMCPD nonlinear pre-alignment</p><p> • Modification and co-optimization of inconsistent landmarks:</p><p>  • L<sub>i</sub> max =L<sub>i</sub>; A<sub>i</sub>max = LAP_with_iteration(L<sub>i</sub> max, unlabeled data)</p><p>  • For each inconsistent landmark present in L<sub>i</sub></p><p>   • Make modification to L<sub>i</sub> max (adding or removing landmark) creating L<sub>i</sub> max’</p><p>   • A<sub>i</sub> = LAP_with_iteration(L<sub>i</sub> max’,unlabeled data)</p><p>   • Score(A<sub>i</sub>)=missing consistent adjacencies in A<sub>i</sub></p><p>   • If Score(A<sub>i</sub>)&lt;Score(A<sub>i</sub>max)</p><p>    • L<sub>i</sub> max = L<sub>i</sub> max’; A<sub>i</sub>max = A<sub>i</sub></p><p>2. Voting: For each landmark j in unlabeled data:</p><p> • Pick most common identity for landmark j over the set of identities in A<sub>i</sub>max <sub>i=1…n</sub></p><p> • If 75% supermajority then the identity of landmark j is considered confident</p><p>3. Reiteration: Repeat steps 1–2 above with the modifications:</p><p> • Substitute TPS warping using confident identities in place of pre-alignment using manual landmarks and GMCCPD</p><p> • Confident identities in unlabeled data remain fixed and are not recomputed</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Algorithmic ablation results</title><p>To evaluate the contributions of distinct components of our method to performance we compare performance after ablating parts of the algorithm to our full algorithms’ performance (71–78%). Ablating all of the unique components of our approach leaves the prior method of an LAP matching based on distance (after pre-alignment) to each labeled example followed by voting, this has accuracy of 43–66%. The most novel component of our system the co-optimization of unstable landmarks makes a significant contribution to accuracy; if we skip this step single cell accuracy ranges from 67% to 75%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Computational considerations</title><p>Our implementation has a significant runtime but could be significantly optimized if desired. Our co-optimization algorithm was implemented in Matlab. Alignment was performed on a Xeon Gold 6128 3.4 GHz CPU with 500 mb of memory (alignment is however not particularly memory intensive). Runtime was variable depending on the temporal stage and number of modifications to be considered but took about a day. The vast majority of run time is taken by the tens of thousands of iterations of linear assignment implicit in the modification and constraint optimization process. Results are fairly insensitive to the number of constraint iterations used. Reducing iterations and total computation time by 3/4 results in only a small decrease in accuracy. Given the small number of datasets computation is not a major issue and reported timing and accuracy results reflect a large number of iterations run after initial landmarks and parameters were optimized using runs with a low number of iterations. A more efficient approximate LAP implementation would significantly decrease computational costs as over 95% of computational time is spent in this function. Runtime would also be significantly reduced by an explicitly parallelized implementation as alignment of individual labeled datasets, currently sequential, is completely independent; this was not attempted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Additional validation</title><p>To further assess our algorithm, we test its ability to name additional independent point clouds based on FM microscopy. In all experiments we use the same staging method, model, parameters, and same set of initial landmarks for pre-alignment as in EM experiments. Our additional test set contains 3 embryos imaged for 8 hr with a spinning disc confocal microscope. All embryos are lineaged and globally curated through 1.5-fold to ensure accurate cell identities for validation. Note that while our model is based on light sheet FM on uncompressed embryos, these additional test data sets are compressed while imaged, representing a challenge to alignment at least as significant (though distinct) as distortions from AT EM. We blind ourselves to identities except for the exact same pre-alignment landmarks used in the EM. Alignment is performed on a point cloud taken from the equivalent stage of each data set and accuracy is then assessed over all cells, since a complete ground truth is available. Result accuracy is comparable to EM and presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Manual curation</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Manual curation of cell identities</title><p>A significant number of cells in each EM dataset were manually curated to establish their identities at the tissue or individual cell level. Tissue level annotation was created completely manually, moving one by one through each cell and annotating cells whose type could be readily assigned visually. This was possible based on overall morphology for the majority of pharynx, epidermis, gut, and body wall muscle cells, as well as some neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Single-cell annotation</title><p>Verified individual cell identities fall into two conceptually distinct categories: a. landmarks used in pre-alignment b. additional curated identities used in evaluation and for navigation.</p><p>The majority of pre-alignment landmarks are individual cells within readily identifiable tissues such as the gut, body wall muscles, and epidermis. The individual identities of cells within these tissue blocks can be unambiguously established by counting cells along the body axes within the block of tissue types. We found this most easily done by visualizing the cell centroids in 3D within WormGUIDES for comparison to a labeled data set. First, we identify tissues in the EM images and mark these cell centroids in a 3D visualization. Then, taking the gut as an example we count our way down the AP axis in the 3D model, identifying which gut nucleus centroid is which gut cell by comparing position to an identical 3D centroid visualization of a FM data set with all identities. In addition, there are a few landmarks which have dramatically distinct appearances (such as the excretory cell) or occupy highly distinctive positions on the dorsal, ventral or lateral midlines, or both (such as AVL precisely on the ventral midline, directly anterior of the excretory cell, and ALA, on the midline, and sharing an elongated left-right shape with its sibling RMED). These landmarks are very difficult to confuse with any other cell and are used as initial landmarks.</p><p>Additional curated identities for evaluation were first established for highly distinctive cells not used in pre-alignment but identifiable with the same procedures described above. Then, moving essentially in a ring out from these highly reliable landmarks we examine labeled and unlabeled data sets as 3D point clouds and identify cells with consistent position relative to a landmark in labeled data sets and the corresponding cell in EM. At the stages examined we have found this kind of relative position to be very reliable, with all observed discrepancies being local displacements traceable to variability of nuclear position within extended cell bodies. These tentative positional identifications are further validated against EM morphology, tissue boundaries, and known neuronal appearance at this developmental stage, when this is available from FM experiments. At the comma and 1.5-fold stages individual neuronal shape provides strong hints for identification. Identified patches are expanded checking for inconsistencies until all cells in a local patch are identified. Though user errors are possible initially, once a patch of identities is extended sufficiently to span the area between highly distinctive cells/tissues, and all cells within an area are accounted for there is relatively little opportunity for human error. Total time spent on annotation varied between a few days for the least annotated data set and a bit more than a week for the best annotated comma data set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Neuronal outgrowth</title><p>Assigning cell identities in FM: In all FM data the identities of cells were determined via lineage tracing (see details in Section 2 above). Individual embryos were lineaged to identify individual cells or small clusters of cells expressing the membrane bound GFP transgenes detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>. Note that due to mosaicism the outgrowth dynamics of single cells can sometimes be assessed when expression in a region in potentially broader. Expressing cells once identified have their initial outgrowth times recorded. Assessing initial outgrowth in FM: Neurite initial outgrowth was defined in time lapse FM recordings as the first frame in which a distinct outgrowth was visible on a neuron cell body. This was further formalized as a protrusion reaching, and continuing to reach in future, in the direction of final outgrowth. This is distinct from possible earlier contractility of the cell surface which does not display this directedness. In small clusters of expressing cells, the cell used to name the cluster was confirmed to have an elongated shape aligned with nearby expressing cells, suggesting the outgrowth observed comes from multiple cells sharing the same orientation. Initial outgrowth timings from distinct embryos were aligned to a common temporal reference frame based on a linear normalization using cell division timings as landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Assigning cell identities to neurites in EM: To identify individual neurite cross-sections labeled in figures, we manually traced neurites back to a cell body. Once neurites were traced back to cell bodies, nuclei were identified with the procedure described in section Additional validation above.</p><p>Assessing initial outgrowths in EM: Every cell in the vicinity of the ring was assessed for visible neurite outgrowth (though not all cells are pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). A cell was scored as broken out if it contained a significantly elongated structure extending in the direction expected from adult morphology. There is some ambiguity when observing static images between initial outgrowths and cells with elongated tear drop shapes that might precede outgrowth. The examples discussed have neurite outgrowths long enough to be unambiguously neurites, rather than tapered cell bodies. Other more ambiguous cells, other sublaterals, are arguable and may or may not have neurites at the bean stage. Temporal staging of samples was performed as described in section Temporal staging above.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing -

The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew D Chisholm (Reviewer #1).</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this is very nice work that we would like to see published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, all three reviewers feel that the manuscript would very much profit from significant editorial revisions that emphasize the biological findings more and also contextualizes a number of these findings more effectively. You are also much encouraged to move material from the Supplement into the Main text, particularly those figures that provide novel biological insight. You will find below a quite extensive list of suggestions for editorial changes and we encourage you to consider them well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some issues in the presentation of the manuscript could be improved prior to publication.

Since the two techniques are used &quot;to demonstrate feasibility&quot; it appears key to discuss (later in the manuscript) the comparison of the two approaches in terms of their use in such project, i.e. effort/ implementation of sample preparation/data analysis, the influence of resulting resolution/stitching to cell identity registration, other pros/ cons. More importantly, if a single embryo is analyzed per timepoint, this would be one of my main critiques of the manuscript. At least 2 samples per timepoint will allow assessing the method's feasibility, robustness, reproducibility, variability.</p><p>92 &quot;sparsely expressed cell membrane marker […] (Figure 1b, S1)&quot;: For the detailed understanding of <italic>C. elegans</italic> specialists, the authors should provide in supplementary data the exact lineage-derived expression pattern of used markers similarly to the Lineagomics project (https://epic.gs.washington.edu/), or else cite studies that provide these.</p><p>160-162 &quot;Correlated cell identities […] using individual cells/nuclei as landmarks&quot;: It appears key that the authors present the variability in cell/nuclei positioning across embryos (and for different cell types) used for FM-lineaging. Especially given the use of these positions as landmarks on a single EM sample per timepoint.</p><p>165 &quot;Based on timing of known developmental events in the FM series, the aligned EM data are timed&quot;: What are the known developmental events? This is not adequately or comprehensively explained. The authors should expand as necessary for a broader audience.</p><p>168 &quot;We assess the accuracy of the correlated cell identities&quot;: Here and elsewhere in the manuscript, it appears important to compare the accuracy of cell identification and process tracing to other techniques of identification in electron microscopy studies such as CLEM, connectomics studies, or studies of EM-FM registration in other organisms (i.e. in Vergara, 2021 where nuclear-alignment results in 99.0% accuracy and stepwise image registration uses STAR Methods).</p><p>187-190 Figure 3g: &quot;auto-fusion of the excretory canal, duct, pore and gland cell.&quot;: The images and notions concerning this topic and data should be explained in detail. Text and images lack context and details necessary even to <italic>C. elegans</italic> readers (unless they are specialists of this structure). Relevant studies should be discussed and cited (Soulavie et al., 2017,PMID: 29717108).</p><p>201 &quot;These results are deposited on webKnossos.&quot;: The accessibility of the data is commendable. The authors are encouraged to explain what possibilities of annotations/ data-browsing are allowed in the interface. Given the study emphasizes describing fine cell morphologies, providing images with higher resolution and traces of the studied cells/processes across sections would allow better data visualization and integrating community work/ feedback.</p><p>215 &quot;appear around the bean stage and a ring around the pharynx becomes visible by the comma stage&quot;: Earlier paper showing this should be cited here (Rapti et al., 2017, PMID: 28846083).</p><p>246 Figure 4c: &quot;NR showing pioneers, entry points, the approximate extent at bean and comma.&quot;</p><p>Given there is one schematic in 4c, it is unclear if it corresponds to bean or comma. This should be explained. Entry points/growth can be different between bean and comma stages, being 25min apart.</p><p>246,262, 272 The authors often use the term pioneers to denote early growing neurites in the specific entry points. However, in other neuroscience studies including <italic>C. elegans</italic> studies (also cited by the authors), the term pioneers is used for early entering axons that are functionally important for entry of others. AVJ-AVD (referred to as supralateral commissure pioneers) ASH, RIB, and AWC (referred to as amphid commissure pioneers) have not been shown functionally important. The authors should refer to early entering neurites and not pioneers. Otherwise, pioneer roles should be established with ablation/functional studies, or other studies showing functional importance should be cited accordingly.</p><p>252 &quot;Figure 4e: Each dot represents a single neuron or small cluster of neurons. (lim-4:red, unc-86:green, zag-1:blue, ttx-3:magenta, egl-13:cyan, cnd-1:black, ceh-37:gray, ceh-10:purple).&quot;: The expression patterns of the used labels are missing here, or please indicate the published source.. Given their expertise in lineaging, it is important that the authors provide (supplementary) the lineage-related expression pattern of used markers as in Lineagomics project (https://epic.gs.washington.edu/). Secondly, at least some of these reporters do not label single cells (i.e. mgIs18, Table S4 labels AIY but also SMDD as per Bertrand and Hobert, 2009; Rapti et al., 2017). Moreover, many of these labels used (Table S4) appear to be non-integrated arrays (egl-13, ceh-37, zag-1, lim-4?) and thus are prone to mosaicism. It is unclear if/how the breakout times of specific neurons are identified in the single-cell resolution. In FM, are these identified by lineaging these markers and identifying processes in single-cell resolution? In EM, are these identified through registration of cell identities and EM-tracing of single-cell axons? The authors should explain. Replying to the above is key to allow contextualizing the findings with other published information on neuropil assembly, for a better understanding of the reader.</p><p>255 and 260 &quot;Figure 4f […] Number of neurites visible in g across the EM series.&quot;: The authors should explain in detail what each dot represents in EM timepoints: is this the total number of neurites organized in bundles or also includes single neurites visible across EM sections? Does it refer to neurites across the whole embryo or the ones contributing to the NR neuropil? In the latter case, are the NR-contributing neurites defined by cell identities or by tracing in the NR?</p><p>279-280 &quot;a sensory structure that is open to the environment […] The dendrites grow via a distinctive mechanism, a collective retrograde extension&quot;: Authors should cite earlier papers demonstrating this structure by EM, including in embryos! (Ward et al., 1975,PMID: 1112927; Oikonomou, et al., PLoS Biol. 2011) (Low et al., Development, 2019, PMID: 30683663). The first paper demonstrating the mechanism of retrograde extension should also be cited (Heiman, Shaham, 2009, PMID: 19344940). I find it puzzling that these are missing.</p><p>281 “Formation of the embedded opening and elaboration of dendrite morphology occur in embryogenesis but are less understood.”: In fact, mechanisms of the channel’s formation are significantly studied. A series of relevant publications investigate this process, with mechanistic findings (Perens and Shaham, 2006 PMID: 15935778; Oikonomou, et al., PLoS Biol. 2011 PMID: 21857800; Oikonomou et al., 2012 PMID: 22138055; Wang et al., 2017 PMID: 28803967; Bacaj, Lu, Shaham, 2008 PMID: 18245347; Low et al., 2019, PMID: 30683663). These should be discussed and cited.</p><p>361 &quot;Last but not least, our post hoc correlation of EM and FM data provides a useful alternative to true correlative EM. Correlative EM is a powerful, but complex to implement […]&quot;: For this first demonstration of cell identification with post hoc FM-to-EM correlation, it appears important to validate the method with CLEM of one sample. An embryo expressing a cell landmark marker with sparse labeling (i.e. Pttx-3) could be prepared by correlative EM so as to identify the labeled cells (AIY,SMDD) by CLEM labeling and by the new co-optimization algorithm. This will allow evaluating the accuracy of nuclei estimation. It should be hopefully feasibly, given the author's previous expertise/use of Correlative EM (Kolotuev et al., 2009, PMID: 19807690; Kolotuev et al., 2012,PMID: 22857930; Burel et al.,2018, PMID: 29802150).</p><p>339 &quot;While our study is focused on the wild type, one could use live FM to build the appropriate ensemble models to analyze mutants&quot;: Using this methodology to study mutants is an exciting perspective! Yet, WT-mutant comparisons require analysis of more than a single individual per genetic condition. The study in its current form does not allow to evaluate the feasibility of larger-scale usage. Also, EM analysis of one sample per condition/timepoint does not inform on possible variability across samples of one timepoint. Performing EM analysis of a second sample for at least one timepoint per technique will allow addressing the issues.</p><p>341-343 &quot;We present the image data and identity annotation of our correlated EM series as an accessible public resource […] seed of a community effort that we hope will fully validate annotation&quot;</p><p>The public accessibility of the resource is commendable. It would be important to understand what type of data-browsing and annotations are allowed by the interface and the resolution of the data provided. In order for effective browsing, 3D data could be available with the identified cell identities annotated on the data. Process tracing of the identified cells could also be provided on the browsed/ downloadable data. In order for validation and future use of this resource by the community, the data would need to be provided in a downloadable format with the required resolution.</p><p>354 &quot;The data-driven modification in the co-optimization algorithm further facilitates such a vision for automated alignment and annotation of complex brain images.&quot;: It is unclear to the broader audience to which degree this is feasible, what advances the current method requires. The authors should explain what limitations or difficulties may be faced for the implementation of the approach in more complex images.</p><p>Figure S7d &quot;socket cell over three successive frames in the same cnd-1 promoter&quot;</p><p>By Lineagomics (https://epic.gs.washington.edu/) cnd-1 is expressed in many more cells than the amphid socket, including cells partaking in the amphid channel (AMsh sheath, AWC, ASG). AMso and AMsh could be imaged distinguishably by performing mosaic experiments or photoconversion or using less broad promoters. If not, it is unclear how the authors distinguish in FM between processes of all these cells in Figure 5d and Figure 7d, given the FM resolution. Because of this, it is unclear what the FM imaging is adding to the EM data and conclusions. The authors should explain.</p><p>Recommendations and corrections for text and figures:</p><p>62 &quot;EM studies [contributed to] principles of structural organization&quot;</p><p>Despite this being a more comprehensive study of embryonic tissues by EM, few past studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos contributed principles of structural organization (Soulavie et al., 2017, PMID: 29717108, Rapti et al., 2017, PMID: 28846083, Low et al., 2019, PMID: 30683663). It appears appropriate that such studies are cited here.</p><p>98 “we use the nuclear positions, which are also annotated for the EM series, as the common reference (i.e., a Rosetta stone)”: Authors should expand and explain adequately/ comprehensively as necessary for a broader audience.</p><p>185 Aligning color-codes to use the same in Figure 3e and b-c-d, will allow the following cell identities.</p><p>189 EM images can be shown both with and without color-coding to better visualize cell fusion.</p><p>213 “The NR emerges in the later half of embryogenesis”: Earlier paper showing this should be cited here (Rapti et al., 2017, PMID: 28846083).</p><p>217 “even neurite topography through combinations of two-color imaging”: Earlier studies with <italic>C. elegans</italic> two-color FM imaging of neurites (including in the embryo!) can be cited (Heiman, Shaham, 2009, PMID: 19344940, Rapti et al., 2017, PMID: 28846083, Moyle et al., 2020, PMID: 33627875)</p><p>220 “We scan through EM data to identify neurites, and backtrace them to soma”: The authors should explain the exact approach used for process tracing (manual, semi-/ automatic, etc).</p><p>240-250 Figure 4b-4e. Color-coding is not consistent between models, FM, EM images, i.e. sublateral pioneers are red in Figure 4b EM but light blue in Figure 4c, and Plim-4 which labels sublateral pioneers is red in Figure 4e. Consistent color-coding would help the reader.</p><p>Figure 4c, S5a It is unclear if the drawn arrows’ length is proportional to the actual neurite total growth (across EM sections of the same embryo)? For example, what is the relative length of SIA/SMD and ASH, in the model (Figure S5a) and in the actual EM (Figure S5f,g)?</p><p>268-271 “comparing the left- and right-side behavior of the first cells to grow into the NR, namely SIADL/R and SMDDL/R, suggests strong symmetry in behavior. Both sides have broken out at the bean stage, with similar-sized outgrowths […] their tips meet precisely beneath the midpoint of the ALA […].”</p><p>This is in line with previous studies, indicating such symmetries and ALA’s position, these studies should be cited (Rapti et al., 2017, PMID: 28846083; Insley and Shaham, 2018, PMID: 29590193; Moyle et al., 2021, PMID: 33627875). In order to establish symmetry beyond previous observations, it appears key to providing quantitative data, calculating the length of bilateral processes by tracing them in EM series.</p><p>282 The first paper demonstrating this dynamic process should be cited (Heiman, Shaham, 2009, PMID: 19344940).</p><p>Figure S5B Shading of EM figure in Box b doesn’t allow neurite visualization.

Also, scale bars are missing in many supplementary figures and when present, there is no reference of scale bar size in the legend.

However much of these biological discoveries were buried in the supplementals. To create more relevance and excitement for this journal’s audience, the authors should re-write parts of the manuscript, with a stronger emphasis on what the limitations of current imaging methods are, what cross-modality analyses improve upon, and particularly by bringing focus to the biological discoveries and putting them into the main article.</p><p>In addition to the inherent challenges of EM-FM cross-comparison, in this article, the cross-modality alignment method overcomes two distinct issues: the challenges associated with manual annotation of embryo developmental EM series; as well as integration of spatial resolution of EM with the temporal resolution with FM. These concepts are briefly mentioned in the introduction and throughout the article, but do not become apparent to a non-specialist reader until the end. These current challenges should be further emphasized in the introduction when describing these imaging methods to highlight the benefits of the analysis method presented.</p><p>Note: supplemental figures are mis-numbered (there are two Figure S3s, and the following figures do not match figure captions). I will refer to supplemental figures as they are numbered in the figure captions.</p><p>Most of Figures S5, S6 and S7 should be integrated into or added as additional main figures. These data beautifully highlight both the temporal and spatial resolution achieved by the cross-modality method used.</p><p>How is “adjacency” defined between nuclei that are not physically touching? Are there specific parameters for what distance between cell nuclei counts as adjacent?</p><p>Line 236: what is meant by “breakouts observed in the EM at the comma stage span an hour?”. Is this referring to lack of temporal resolution? This statement is confusing because Figure 4e and Table S4 referenced doesn’t seem to show this to be the case.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77918.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some issues in the presentation of the manuscript could be improved prior to publication.

However, we have added a section to Discussion further contextualizing the pros and cons of the two techniques in the context of the worm embryo and cross-modality analysis.</p><p>Regarding the need for multiple data points per stage there are two goals served by replication: I. Establishing the reproducibility of our alignment process itself. II. Investigating the consistency of the biological processes observed.</p><p>Regarding I, we have added additional quantification of our alignment method’s accuracy in predicting cell identity. These are derived by aligning additional independent FM embryos against the same three FM embryos used to name the EM data. Since data sets are represented in all cases by abstract point clouds this experiment provides a valid quantitation of our algorithm’s success in identifying cells in a larger set of embryos. Furthermore, the cell names in these independent FM data sets are derived from lineaging and as such provide an orthogonal ground truth, which is more certain and definitive than the manually curated cell identities in the main EM alignment experiments. Finally, it is worth nothing that these FM embryos were imaged compressed between coverslips (unlike the 3 FM embryos used as the model or the EM embryos). The compression creates nonlinear deformations throughout the embryo and success in identifying cells in these compressed embryos further demonstrates the robustness of our method. These additional experiments are now mentioned in results, described in Methods, and performance in them added as Supplementary File 1f.</p><p>Regarding II, the biological consistency of events, we believe that in terms of temporal consistency as well as coarse level spatial consistency (e.g. cell soma positions), one should turn to FM for data coverage that cannot be afforded by EM in the foreseeable future. In terms of fine spatial consistency, we agree that one wants additional EM experiments, and we are in the process of doing this, but we also feel that this is outside the scope of the current study, which seeks to establish the feasibility of the approach and provide an initial time series for the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>92 “sparsely expressed cell membrane marker […] (Figure 1b, S1)”: For the detailed understanding of C. elegans specialists, the authors should provide in supplementary data the exact lineage-derived expression pattern of used markers similarly to the Lineagomics project (https://epic.gs.washington.edu/), or else cite studies that provide these.</p></disp-quote><p>The global expression pattern of these markers is not used to ID cells, and in some cases has not been fully established.

Variability is a complex topic with spatial and temporal aspects and many perspectives on whether, for example, cell position, at each developmental stage is unimodal and can be meaningfully represented by a mean. The field of development has struggled with this problem and to our knowledge, not come up with succinct or definitive answers.

We argue that variability in adjacency is a natural framework in which to characterize positional variability. While we acknowledge our adjacency measure is a computational approximation of the underlying reality of cell contacts, it has the same strong advantages here as in our alignment method such as simplicity and invariance to absolute position. Any other characterization of variability will have its own limitations and caveats.</p><p>While our alignment method uses only universally present adjacencies in alignment, there is significant, more granular variation in how consistently adjacencies are observed. We briefly present this adding an additional supplemental figure and supplemental data characterizing the quantitative variability in adjacency at each stage. We illustrate that this model of position can be used to characterize changes between stages and to capture groups of cells with related behaviors over time. This approach may serve as a promising framework for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>165 “Based on timing of known developmental events in the FM series, the aligned EM data are timed”: What are the known developmental events?

An embryo expressing a cell landmark marker with sparse abelling (i.e. Pttx-3) could be prepared by correlative EM so as to identify the abellin cells (AIY,SMDD) by CLEM abelling and by the new co-optimization algorithm.
