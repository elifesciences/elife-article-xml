leading to chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. In obesity, several proinflammatory subpopulations of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) identified hitherto include the conventional ‘M1-like’ CD11C-expressing ATM and the newly discovered metabolically activated CD9-expressing ATM; however, the relationship among ATM subpopulations is unclear. The ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated in the adipocytes and immune cells under obesity. It is unknown whether targeting IRE1α is capable of reversing insulin resistance and obesity and modulating the metabolically activated ATMs. We report that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α RNase significantly ameliorates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in male mice with diet-induced obesity. IRE1α inhibition also increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure, and hence protects against high fat diet-induced obesity. Our study shows that the ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs in obese white adipose tissue. Notably, IRE1α inhibition diminishes the accumulation of obesity-induced metabolically activated ATMs and ‘M1-like’ ATMs, resulting in the curtailment of adipose inflammation and ensuing reactivation of thermogenesis, without augmentation of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage population. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting IRE1α for the therapeutic treatment of insulin resistance and obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue macrophage</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>adipose remodeling</kwd><kwd>IRE1 alpha</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK116017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Weidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK128848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Weidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK130174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Weidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and proinflammatory macrophage activation and accumulation in adipose tissue can be counteracted through the inhibition of ER stress sensor IRE1alpha.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Overnutrition and obesity are closely associated with insulin resistance which serves as a common precursor to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic disorders. Under chronic energy overload, adipose tissue expands significantly for the storage of the excess energy in the form of lipids and this expansion coincides with the recruitment and accumulation of immune cells, in particular macrophages, in adipose tissue. Once the lipid storage capacity is reached, adipocytes can no longer incorporate lipids from the circulation but instead release fatty acids into the circulation through lipolysis. Meanwhile, the excess accumulation of immune cells in the adipose tissue leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, including aberrant proinflammatory cytokine production, in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). Both aberrant adipocyte lipolysis and adipose tissue inflammation are known to exacerbate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foley et al., 2021</xref>) and are regarded as key factors contributing to insulin resistance in obesity.</p><p>The accumulated adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) were initially thought to undergo a phenotypic polarization from an anti-inflammatory M2 to a pro-inflammatory M1 state, promoting local and systemic inflammation with the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>). However, there is a growing body of evidence that does not support this obesity-induced M1/M2 polarization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coats et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, recent studies have identified a predominant population of ATMs that emerge in obesity and present a metabolically activated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coats et al., 2017</xref>). The metabolically activated ATMs have lately been shown to express CD9 and/or Trem2 by studies using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). These obesity-associated metabolically active ATMs not only potentiate inflammation but also promote dead adipocyte clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coats et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>). However, the relationship between the previously identified ‘M1-like’ CD11c+ATMs and the new CD9<sup>+</sup> and/or Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATM subpopulations is unclear.</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site for protein synthesis and folding and the synthesis of lipid and sterol. When the demand for protein folding in the ER exceeds its capacity, ER stress occurs. The three ER stress sensors, inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE)–1, PKR-like ER-regulating kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF)–6, are then activated to trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) that initially serves as an adaptive means to resolve ER stress, but will eventually become maladaptive if the perturbation persists. IRE1α, the most evolutionarily conserved among the UPR sensors, is an ER transmembrane protein with dual serine/threonine kinase and RNase domains and once activated, can catalyze the unconventionally cleavage of <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA for XBP1 translation or initiate a process termed regulated IRE1-dependent decay of RNA (RIDD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonseca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Back and Kaufman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hetz et al., 2013</xref>). IRE1α activation was reported to induce/potentiate inflammatory cytokine production and inflammation through the control of transcriptional regulation and intracellular signaling pathways via its dual enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oslowski et al., 2012</xref>). ER stress and IRE1α activation has been reported in both human and rodent obese adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boden et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gregor et al., 2009</xref>) and in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue where ATMs are enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies have implicated ER stress as an early event of nutrient excess in the development of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boden et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cnop et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawasaki et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, targeting ER stress/IRE1α has been proposed as a direction for the improvement of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marciniak et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>However, thus far, the exact role of IRE1α on the adipose function and remodeling remains inconclusive. For example, adipocyte-specific knockout of IRE1α was shown to promote brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and alleviate diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by suppressing its RNase-mediated degradation of the mRNA of thermogenic gene <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and hence elevating UCP1 level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, other studies reported that the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway is required for the transcriptional induction of UCP1 in brown adipocyte in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asada et al., 2015</xref>) and is indispensable for proper adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sha et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, inhibiting IRE1α kinase activity was found to be sufficient enough to block the inflammation-induced lipolysis in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foley et al., 2021</xref>), which contrasts with the observation that adipocyte deletion of IRE1α promotes β3-AR agonist-stimulated WAT lipolysis as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The function of IRE1α on adipose tissue remodeling and insulin resistance has also been shown through its activity in ATMs. Deletion of IRE1α in myeloid lineage including macrophage was recently shown to prevent mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). The IRE1α deletion was reported to achieve this by reversing the obesity-induced M1/M2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>), leading to the augmented M2 population in adipose tissue that induces BAT activation and WAT remodeling through the synthesis and action of catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). However, it was recently reported that the alternatively activated M2 macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, as mentioned above, the obesity-associated ATMs were recently shown to not undergo the classical M1/M2 switch but to adopt a metabolic activation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore unclear what changes in the ATM under IRE1α deletion are accountable for the protection against obesity and insulin resistance as observed in the myeloid-specific IRE1α knockout model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). It is unknown whether IRE1α inhibition has any effect on the obesity-induced metabolically activated ATM population.</p><p>In this study, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of IRE1α STF-083010 (STF) to investigate the effect of IRE1α inhibition on insulin resistance and obesity in the adult male mice. We observed that STF treatment improves insulin sensitivity and protects against weight gain in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. IRE1α inhibition also reverses the high fat diet (HFD)-induced whitening of BAT and WAT remodeling and increases thermogenesis. Notably, STF treatment suppressed the M2 ATM subpopulation in the DIO mice. Our studies also showed that IRE1α inhibition diminishes the obesity-elicited pro-inflammatory ATM subpopulations including the newly identified CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs and adipose inflammation which is known to suppress thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakamoto et al., 2016</xref>). In all, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which IRE1α inhibition protects against obesity and insulin resistance and serves as a foundation for targeting IRE1α as a therapeutic means in the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRE1α RNase inhibition ameliorates insulin resistance in mice with diet-induced obesity</title><p>We first examined whether the ER stress response/UPR pathway was altered in the adipose tissues of animals with obesity.

BAT is an organ specialized for energy expenditure through the action of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). During obesity, lipid-droplet content is increased in BAT (whitening of BAT), which impairs its ability to dissipate the energy. We observed that STF treatment reversed the whitening of BAT, as reflected in much less lipid droplet intensity in BAT, in DIO mice, compared to vehicle treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining showed the elevated staining intensity of UCP1 protein in BAT per unit area in DIO mice compared to vehicle treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>). Furthermore, STF-treated mice showed increased expression of genes involved in thermogenic and mitochondrial functions, including <italic>Prdm16</italic>, <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Ppara</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Cox5b</italic>, and <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> (<italic>Pgc1α</italic>), in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). These data thereby suggest that STF promotes BAT activation. Induction of beige fat in the WAT also plays important role in the adaptive thermogenesis and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kajimura et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore examined the effect of STF on the status of beiging activation in the WAT. The immune-signal intensity of UCP1 protein was markedly increased in the eWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and iWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>) of DIO mice treated with STF.

These results suggest the involvement of beige fat activation in thermogenesis and energy expenditure in STF-treated mice. Moreover, we also investigated the effect of STF on the expression -adrenoceptors, which play important role in adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold stimulation, on adipose tissues and observed that STF treatment elevated the levels of both β2-adrenoceptor (<italic>Adrb2</italic>) and β3-adrenoceptor (<italic>Adrb3</italic>) in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>) and the levels of <italic>Adrb3</italic> in iWAT and eWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E-F’</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Effect of STF treatment on obesity-associated macrophage activation</title><p>Since adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) accumulation plays important role in contributing to insulin resistance and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>), we investigate whether STF treatment impacts ATM accumulation in DIO mice as IRE1α activity was observed to be heightened in obese macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>).

macrophages that accumulated in adipose tissues undergo a ‘phenotypic switch’ from an anti-inflammatory M2 (alternatively activated) phenotype to a proinflammatory M1 (classically activated) state, a process believed to be critical for the development of systemic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore investigated the effect of STF treatment on such an ATM switch. We observed that under HFD, the percentage (14.59% (ND) vs. 52.95% (HFD), p=0.007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b</xref>), total number/eWAT/mouse (0.25±0.16 × 10<sup>4</sup> (ND, n=8) vs 0.75±0.11 × 10<sup>6</sup> (HFD, n=8), 299.58-fold, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b</xref>), and density/g of eWAT/mouse (0.59±0.23 x 10<sup>4</sup> (ND) vs. 4.11±0.96 x 10<sup>5</sup> (HFD), 70-fold, p=0.0018, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b</xref>) of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> triple positive cells, which are typically characterized as the classical ‘M1-like’ adipose tissue macrophages, were markedly increased in the eWAT. Unexpectedly, we found that the bulk majority of these CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs were also positive for CD206, a marker thought for M2 macrophages, in the eWAT under HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and that approximately half the population is positive for both CD11c and CD206 in DIO ATMs, whereas there are only 8.55% CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> ATMs under ND when gated against CD11c and CD206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting the enrichment of a mixed M1/M2 phenotype, which is consistent with recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wentworth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sica and Mantovani, 2012</xref>). Moreover, we found that the total number and density of CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> ATMs increased by 337- and 75-fold respectively under HFD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1c</xref>; ND: n=8; HFD: n=8), a greater increase than those of CD11C-postive alone (CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup>) ATMs under HFD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; ND: n=8; HFD: n=8). On the other hand, for CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATM subpopulation, a presumed M2-like ATM subpopulation which accounted for the majority of ATMs under ND as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1d</xref>), HFD drove the increase in the total cell number and density of this population by over 16- and 4-fold respectively despite the diminished percentage given the huge expansion of total ATMs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1d</xref>; ND: n=8; HFD: n=8), although to a lesser degree than that for CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Moreover, CD206<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATM subpopulation also exhibited a trend similar to that of CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>; ND: n=8; HFD: n=8). Our findings confirm the notion that ATMs do not follow the classic M2 to M1 switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that the germline deletion of IRE1α in myeloid lineage reverses the switch in M1/M2 polarization with the increase in M2 population to induce BAT activation and WAT remodeling and protect mice against diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). However, in light of increasing evidence from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>) and our current findings that do not support a HFD-triggered classical M1/M2 polarization, we sought to interrogate the effect of IRE1α inhibition on ATM subpopulations, which by far is poorly understood. In DIO mice treated with STF for 4 weeks, we found that consistent with the overall reduction of ATM population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1a</xref>), the percentage, total number, and density of the posited ‘M1-like’ F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> triple positive cells were substantially diminished in the SVF of eWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b</xref>), but to an even greater extent than the overall ATM population. The trend in the reduction of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs by STF remains similar regardless of whether CD206<sup>+</sup> was positive (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup>) or negative (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). In addition, the total number and density of M2-like CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c <sup>–</sup> ATMs were also significantly reduced in the SVF of eWAT of STF-treated DIO animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1d</xref>), but to a lesser degree than CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs. In contrast, STF treatment even slightly increased the total number and density of the CD206 CD11c double-negative ATMs (CD206<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) or non-macrophage (F4/80<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup>) populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b and c</xref>), although none of them reaching statistically significance.</p><p>As the ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> and M1/M2 mixed ATMs were reported to be associated with pro-inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wentworth et al., 2010</xref>), we examined the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokine genes —<italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, and <italic>monocyte chemoattractant protein-1</italic> (<italic>Ccl2</italic>)— and found that they were down-regulated in the SVFs of eWAT from STF-treated DIO mice compared to vehicle-treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), which correlates with our observed decreased populations of ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> and M1/M2 mixed ATMs in the STF-treated DIO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). Similarly, STF treatment also inhibited the mRNA levels of these cytokine genes in the SVFs of iWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, in CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) sorted from the eWAT SVFs of DIO mice, which expectedly expressed higher mRNA levels of <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Ccl2</italic> than CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), STF treatment remarkably reduced the expression levels of <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Ccl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). STF inhibited the IRE1α RNase activity in these cells as reflected by the diminished <italic>Xbp1s</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These results reveal that STF treatment suppresses the adipose tissue inflammation and the accumulation of pro-inflammatory ATM without augmenting (suppressing instead) M2-like ATMs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Metabolically active ATMs are suppressed in DIO mice by STF treatment</title><p>Recent studies have shown that instead of the classical proinflammatory M1 polarization, obesity drives the expansion of metabolically active heterogeneous ATM populations.

These studies reported that the CD9<sup>+</sup> macrophages have high amounts of intracellular lipid in lysosome‐like structures, express genes related to lysosomal‐dependent lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>) and represent the majority of total adipose tissue macrophages in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). Given our findings on the significant inhibitory effect of STF on ATM accumulation and inflammation, we therefore investigated whether STF impacts these alterations in the adipose tissues of DIO mice. We first determined the effect of STF treatment on the metabolic activation of ATMs. Proteins involved in lipid metabolism including ABCA1, CD36, and PLIN2 were reported to be specifically up-regulated in metabolically active macrophages in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>).

Moreover, genes involved in lysosomal biogenesis and phagocytosis including <italic>Atp6v1b2</italic>, <italic>Atp6v0d2</italic>, <italic>Lipa,</italic> and <italic>Lamp2</italic> were also reported to be induced in the ATMs in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coats et al., 2017</xref>).

distribution of CD11c expression in CD9<sup>+</sup> and/or Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs under HFD. We observed heightened percentages of CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs that co-express CD11c (63.25 ± 10.85%, 78.25 ± 12.35%, and 78.65 ± 13.05%, respectively) relative to the CD9<sup>-</sup>, Trem2<sup>-</sup>, and CD9<sup>-</sup>Trem2<sup>-</sup> ATMs that co-express CD11c (29.90 ± 9.10%, 49.55 ± 9.85%, or 24.60 ± 5.90%, respectively), in the eWAT of HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3b</xref>; ND: n=8; HFD: n=8). We also observed that higher percentage of CD9<sup>hi</sup> ATM subpopulation expresses CD11c than CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (90.60 ± 1.4% vs 63.25 ± 10.25%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results showed that while CD11c expression is not exclusively expressed in CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, or CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs, it is highly enriched in all of these subpopulations. Together, these results reveal that in the eWAT under HFD, the majority of CD11c<sup>+</sup> or CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs expresses CD9 or CD11c, respectively. Indeed, up to half (45.45 ± 5.05%) of ATMs in the obese eWAT co-express CD9 and CD11c (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3c</xref>; ND: n=8; HFD: n=8). Notably, similar to its effects on CD9<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>), STF treatment substantially decreased the percentage, total number /eWAT/mouse, and density (per gram of fat pad/mouse) of the CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs in the eWAT of DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3c</xref>). As CD9<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs were reported to be pro-inflammatory, we next compared the expression levels of proinflammatory genes in these ATM subpopulations from HFD-fed mice and observed that the mRNA levels of <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Ccl2</italic> were all up-regulated in sorted CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>, CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs compared to the CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs, with the CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs expressing higher level of <italic>Ccl2</italic> and the CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs expressing lower level of <italic>Il1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), suggesting that these ATM subpopulations are all proinflammatory but yet heterogeneous in nature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that the RNase activity of ER stress sensor IRE1α is up-regulated in the adipose tissue of mice with diet-induced obesity and that the increased IRE1α activity precedes the onset of diabetes in the mice with obesity. By pharmacologically inhibiting IRE1α using the chemical STF, we found that the inhibition of IRE1α activity is able to reverse HFD-induced insulin resistance and comorbidities, indicating that the increased IRE1α activity is an important contributor to obesity-associated insulin resistance. We showed that STF promotes thermogenesis and energy expenditure and counters diet-induced obesity. Our results also showed that the IRE1α inhibition by STF suppresses the accumulation of proinflammatory ATMs, including previously identified CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs and the recently identified CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs, and adipose inflammation. Our study also reveals that the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs in the eWAT under HFD.</p><p>ER stress and its sensor IRE1α are activated in adipose tissues of subjects with obesity. IRE1α activation is known to be linked to inflammation via its dual enzymatic activity and its control of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oslowski et al., 2012</xref>) while macrophage activation and inflammation in adipose tissue is tightly associated with metabolic dysfunction. Targeting ER stress/IRE1α has thus been proposed for its potential in countering obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marciniak et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, recent studies using tissue-specific deletion of IRE1α in mouse have shown that embryonic IRE1α deletion in macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>) and in adipocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>) prevents diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. In the present study, we have showed that STF inhibition of IRE1α is capable of reversing existing insulin resistance and obesity and therefore validate the notion of targeting IRE1α inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p><p>In obese adipose tissue, IRE1α was activated in both adipocytes and ATMs. Activated IRE1α was reported to cause its RNase-mediated degradation of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> mRNA and in turn suppression of PGC1α-dependent UCP1 level in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the present study observed that STF treatment decreases the level of IRE1α target RNA <italic>Xbp1s</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and elevates the RNA levels of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> in adipose tissue of DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L and N</xref>). In the adipose tissue macrophage, IRE1α deletion in myeloid lineage using Ern1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Lyz2-cre was reported to induce the beiging of WAT and protect against diet-induced obesity by augmenting M2 macrophage population through its synthesis and secretion of catecholamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>). It is well established that catecholamines play critical roles on thermogenesis through the activation of β-adrenoceptor signaling in the adipocyte tissue, which is critical for BAT activation and WAT remodeling. Catecholamines are normally synthesized and secreted from sympathetic nerves to induce adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold stimulation. It was reported that M2 macrophages also produce catecholamines to sustain adaptive thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>). However, this finding was disputed by a recent study showing that M2 macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, in contrast to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2017</xref>), our present study showed that STF treatment does not promote M2 macrophage in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1d</xref>), arguing against the possibility that STF inhibition of IRE1α promotes thermogenesis by increasing M2 ATMs. Instead, STF treatment diminishes the M2 ATM population along with the decline of ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b</xref>). Notably, STF treatment also significantly diminished the newly identified CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and dual CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATM subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2a–c</xref>). Like CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs, CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, and dual CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATM express higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5K–L </xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7I</xref>), indicative of their pro-inflammatory nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). STF treatment accordingly diminishes the expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes in both bulky adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and sorted ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6M–N</xref>). Our in vitro experiments showed that STF treatment directly suppressed the ATM population and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in these primary ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1Q-S</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, our study indicates that STF inhibition of IRE1α reverses diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation and proinflammatory ATM subpopulations including the newly identified metabolically active CD9 ATMs.</p><p>Macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL1b have been reported to directly suppress the induction of <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in adipocytes and to impair cold-induced thermogenesis in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakamoto et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, TNFα was shown to down-regulate the expression of β-adrenoceptor in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadri et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valentine et al., 2022</xref>). HFD-induced obesity and chronic adipose inflammation are associated with the reduced expression of thermogenic/mitochondrial oxidation genes and the repression of thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). In present study, we observed that STF treatment increases the expression of UCP1, β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptor, and other thermogenic genes in obese adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L, N and O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D-F</xref>). These results suggest that the suppression of ATM population/inflammation by STF inhibition of IRE1α is associated with the reversal of the obesity-suppressed expression of thermogenic/mitochondrial oxidation genes in adipose tissue to promote thermogenesis, in conjunction with STF’s action on the PGC1α expression in adipocytes.</p><p>We noticed that STF treatment protects against diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) and metabolic improvements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). It exists a possibility that STF may cause body weight reduction, which results in secondary beneficial effects on glucose and insulin sensitivity, as well as on ATM accumulation. We argue that such a possibility is unlikely as STF was previously reported to have no effect on body weight in two other studies: one in mouse model of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tufanli et al., 2017</xref>), and the other in Akita mouse model of beta cell death/failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herlea-Pana et al., 2021</xref>). Second, in our study, we did not observe any apparent difference in food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) that could otherwise affect body weight. Third, STF directly suppresses ATM population and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Finally, STF-treated DIO mice expended more energy than their vehicle-treated counterparts even at lower body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). Although it is known that energy expenditure per unit body weight appears to be lower in subjects with obesity than in lean controls because obesity is associated with reduced thermogenesis, subjects with obesity still expend more energy than the lean controls at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prentice et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trayhurn and Arch, 2020</xref>). If there exists leanness-associated thermogenesis increase per unit weight in STF-treated DIO mice, it cannot fully account for the energy expenditure increase at the organismal level as observed in STF-treated DIO mice, arguing for the notion that STF treatment stimulates thermogenesis which in turn leads to body weight reduce in a positive feedback loop. We also note that as specific IRE1α RNase inhibitors, STF and other members of hydroxy-aryl-aldehyde class have been studied in mouse models of multiple diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tufanli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lebeaupin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herlea-Pana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marek-Iannucci et al., 2022</xref>), with beneficial effects and non-toxicity in general. Further studies on pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters will be needed before any potential clinical trial is initiated.</p><p>Our study also shed new insight into the macrophage remodeling under obesity. Macrophage accumulation and activation in adipose tissue is known to contribute to insulin resistance in obesity. It was initially reported that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) undergo an M2 to M1 polarization switch under obesity. Recent studies have however indicated that obese ATMs do not follow the canonical M1 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we found that first, ‘M1-like’ ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup> cells) significantly increase under HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b–c</xref>); second, M2-like ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> cells) also increase in total cell number and density in response to HFD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1d</xref>), albeit to a smaller extent than the ‘M1-like’ ATMs, a phenomenon previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>); and third, there is a significant increase (up to half of the ATMs gated with CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD206<sup>+</sup>) in ATMs co-expressing both CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD206<sup>+</sup> in the adipose tissue of HFD-induced mice with obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1c</xref>), supporting a mixed phenotype rather than distinct M1 or M2 phenotype. Previous studies have identified such ATM subpopulation that express both M1 and M2 surface markers in both human and rodent adipose tissues under obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wentworth et al., 2010</xref>). These findings are consistent with the notion that ATMs do not follow the classic M2 to M1 switch. Instead, recent studies employing single-cell RNA-seq technology have revealed the expansion/emergence of ATMs that express cell surface markers CD9 or Trem2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we found that the percentage, density, and total number of CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup>) in the eWAT are drastically increased under HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2a</xref>). Similarly, Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs (F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup>) expand significantly in the eWAT of mice with obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2b</xref>), most of which also express CD9.</p><p>Our present study further investigated the relationship between the newly-identified CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs and the originally identified ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs as it remains unclear whether they are related or different ATM populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu and Ballantyne, 2020</xref>). Our results showed that CD9 and Trem2 are highly enriched but not exclusively expressed in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs under HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Reciprocally, CD11c expression is highly enriched but not exclusively expressed in CD9<sup>+</sup>, Trem2<sup>+</sup>, or CD9<sup>+</sup>Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). As such, in the obese eWAT, up to half (49.95 ± 0.65%) of ATMs co-express CD9 and CD11c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). These results demonstrate that CD9<sup>+</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup> populations are highly overlapping. We further found that CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>, CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are all pro-inflammatory as the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Ccl2</italic> are up-regulated in all these subpopulations than CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). However, the mRNA levels of individual <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, or <italic>Ccl2</italic> are differentially expressed among CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>, CD9<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and CD9<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), suggesting functional heterogeneity even among proinflammatory ATMs during obesity.</p><p>In summary, our present studies reveal two significant findings. First, we confirmed that the newly identified populations of proinflammatory ATMs (i.e. CD9<sup>+</sup> and Trem2<sup>+</sup>) are induced under HFD-mediated obesity and determined their relationships with the originally identified ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs. Second, we showed that STF inhibition of IRE1α reverses the accumulation of pro-inflammatory ATM populations including the new metabolically active CD9<sup>+</sup> and Trem2<sup>+</sup> ATMs and adipose tissue inflammation to promote thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity. These studies validate the potential of IRE1α inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of obesity, insulin resistance and comorbidities, which sets the foundation for further clinical development of IRE1α inhibitors as a therapeutical direction for diabetes and obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>C57BL/6 J mice were obtained from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
