Genetic mutations have been extensively studied but explain less than 20% of cases. Mechanical forces generated by beating hearts drive valve development, but how these forces collectively determine valve growth and remodeling remains incompletely understood. Here, we decouple the influence of those forces on valve size and shape, and study the role of YAP pathway in determining the size and shape. The low oscillatory shear stress promotes YAP nuclear translocation in valvular endothelial cells (VEC), while the high unidirectional shear stress restricts YAP in cytoplasm. The hydrostatic compressive stress activated YAP in valvular interstitial cells (VIC), whereas the tensile stress deactivated YAP. YAP activation by small molecules promoted VIC proliferation and increased valve size. Whereas YAP inhibition enhanced the expression of cell-cell adhesions in VEC and affected valve shape. Finally, left atrial ligation was performed in chick embryonic hearts to manipulate the shear and hydrostatic stress in vivo. The restricted flow in the left ventricle induced a globular and hypoplastic left atrioventricular (AV) valves with an inhibited YAP expression. By contrast, the right AV valves with sustained YAP expression grew and elongated normally. This study establishes a simple yet elegant mechanobiological system by which transduction of local stresses regulates valve growth and remodeling. This system guides leaflets to grow into proper sizes and shapes with the ventricular development, without the need of a genetically prescribed timing mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>congenital heart defect</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>maturation</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL128745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL143247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL160028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>821615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Mingkun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URoL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020415</institution-id><institution>Additional Ventures</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Single Ventricle Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Local coordination between shear and hydrostatic stress regulates valve shape and size.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital heart disease is the most common birth defects and affects about 0.5â2.0% of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsao et al., 2022</xref>). Congenital heart valve defects accounts for over 25% of all congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilboa et al., 2016</xref>). They can be immediately life threatening at birth or impair the long-term cardiac function in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zimmerman et al., 2020</xref>). Heart valve development starts with endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), in which valvular endothelial cells (VEC) gain mesenchymal markers and invade into the subendothelial matrix to form endocardial cushions. Post-EMT, these cells proliferate and differentiate into extracellular matrix (ECM) producing valvular interstitial cells (VIC). With precise regulation of VEC and VIC, the cellularized endocardial cushions undergo ECM remodeling and elongate into thin mature leaflets or cusps. During this process, disturbed growth and remodeling will result in valve malformation and cause clinically relevant cardiac defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gould et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindsey et al., 2015</xref>). Genetic causes of this disturbance have been extensively studied, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacGrogan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sifrim et al., 2016</xref>) but can explain less than 20% of clinical cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pierpont et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gelb and Chung, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruneau, 2008</xref>). The importance of mechanical forces in regulating valve development has become well appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daems et al., 2020</xref>). Oscillatory shear stress (OSS) promotes EMT, and its cellular and molecular mechanisms have been well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">OâDonnell and Yutzey, 2020a</xref>). By contrast, the role of mechanical forces in clinically important post-EMT growth and remodeling remain poorly understood.</p><p>The flowing blood generates shear and hydrostatic stress on valves. The shear stress is in direct contact with VECs, while the hydrostatic stress causes compression and tension in valves and can be transmitted to VICs. Multiple mechanosensitive signaling pathways have been identified in adult tissues, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Belly et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Souilhol et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vining and Mooney, 2017</xref>) but their involvement in valve morphogenesis is unclear. Although it has been shown in zebrafish that shear stress regulates early valvulogenesis (namely EndMT) via bioelectric signaling, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukui et al., 2021</xref>) the near universal VEC in zebrafish heart valves limits study of these later growth and remodeling phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">OâDonnell and Yutzey, 2020b</xref>). The contributions of VICs and hydrostatic stress, including potential collaborations with VEC, in valvulogenesis are not known. YAP signaling is another widely investigated mechanoactive pathway, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and transcriptional cofactor of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moya and Halder, 2019</xref>). YAP signaling is known to regulate cardiac ventricular development by promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). However, its role in post-EndMT valvular morphogenesis is poorly understood. Moreover, whether YAP pathway responds differently to different forces in different cell types, and how these mechanoresponses collaboratively regulate multiple cell types for a specific tissue morphogenesis, are not known.</p><p>Here, we explored the mechanism by which the shear and hydrostatic stress regulate valve growth and remodeling. We used in-vitro and ex-vivo models to decouple the effects of shear and hydrostatic stress on the size and shape of valves. We also studied the role of YAP mediated mechanotransduction in those effects by gain- and loss-of-function tests. To verify our findings in vivo, we performed left atrial ligation (LAL) in chick embryonic hearts. The four-chambered chick hearts develop in a manner that mirrors human heart development. The LAL manipulates mechanical forces in vivo and has been shown to replicate some important features of congenital heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gould et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2021</xref>). By combining those models, we elaborate how shear and hydrostatic stress regulates VEC and VIC to determine proper size and shape for valves.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YAP expression is spatiotemporally regulated</title><p>We collected embryonic hearts at different developmental stages from wild type mice and examined the YAP activation in heart valves.

The expressions of those genes then reduced significantly during later stages of remodeling.

Indeed, the spatiotemporal activation of YAP correlated with the changes in the mechanical environment. During valve remodeling, unidirectional shear stress (USS) developed on the inflow surface of valves, where YAP was rarely expressed in the nuclei of VECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other side, OSS developed on the outflow surface, where VECs with nuclear YAP localized. The YAP activation in VICs also correlated with hydrostatic pressure.

The VEC was obtained from AV cushions of chick embryonic hearts at HH25. The cushions were placed on collagen gels with endocardium adherent to the collagen and incubated to enable the VECs to migrate onto the gel. We then removed the cushions and immediately applied the shear flow to the monolayer for 24 hr. The low stress OSS (2 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) promoted YAP nuclear translocation in VEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>), while high stress USS (20 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) restrained YAP in cytoplasm.</p><p>To study the effect of hydrostatic stress on the YAP activation in VICs, we used media with different osmolarities to mimic the CS and TS. CS was induced by hypertonic condition while TS was created by hypotonic condition, and the Unloaded (U) condition refers to the osmotically balanced media. Notably, in vivo hydrostatic pressure is generated by flowing blood, while in vivo osmotic pressure is generated by cardiac contractility and plays a critical role in the mechanotransduction during valve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vignes et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the different in vivo origination, the osmotic pressure provides a reliable model to mimic the hydrostatic pressure in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassen et al., 2021</xref>). We cultured HH27 AV cushion explants under different loading conditions for 24 hr and found that the trapezoidal cushions adopted a spherical shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The VP inhibits the interaction between YAP and TEAD, which in turn, blocks transcriptional activation of targets downstream of YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kagawa et al., 2022</xref>). We cultured cushion explants under CS, CS + VP and U+VP. We confirmed that the concentration of VP we used (5 mM) did not compromise cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

In contrast to the spherical shape of cushions cultured under CS, valves cultured in media with VP maintained their trapezoidal shape, which was characterized by circularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Further investigation demonstrated that loss of YAP significantly inhibits the proliferation of VIC, as characterized by pHH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>). In addition, the YAP inhibition significantly strengthened the expression of VE-cadherin between VECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and G</xref>).

The LAL restricted the blood flow in the left ventricle, resulting in a reduced hemodynamic stress and shear stress on left AV valves but augmented forces on the right AV valves.

These forces include shear and hydrostatic stress. Our results reveal that they can regulate YAP activity in valvular cells, and the mechanically regulated YAP activity can affect the size, shape and stiffness of valves. First, the shear stress regulates YAP activity in the VEC: OSS (oscillatory shear stress) promotes YAP nuclear translocation while USS (unidirectional shear stress) restricts YAP in cytoplasm. The hydrostatic stress regulates YAP activation in the VIC: CS (compressive stress) activated YAP while TS (tensile stress) deactivated YAP. Secondly, these mechanoresponsive YAP activities have morphological functions. YAP activation in VICs promotes their proliferation and increases valve size, YAP deactivation in VICs leads to valve compaction. In terms of shape, cushion explants tend to form a sphere in a way similar to the clustering of cells to minimize the surface tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ninomiya and Winklbauer, 2008</xref>). By contrast, YAP inhibition promotes valve shaping and leaves a densely packed endothelium. The densely packed endothelium could be a result of the large shrinkage in surface area, during which the endothelium at 0 hr could be geometrically too large for the valves at 24 hr. Consequently, the endothelium could be forced to cluster into multiple layers. Another possibility is that YAP activity can affect cell-cell junctions between VECs. For example, studies reported that YAP can break cell-cell junctions via SMADs mediated TGF-Î² signaling during the EMT process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In short, shear stress can control valve shape: USS promotes an elongated shape while OSS promotes a globular shape, and hydrostatic stress modulates valve size: CS increases the size while TS leads to compaction. In fact, the simple interactions between mesenchymal and endothelial provide basic elements for tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>). Here we propose a simple model to achieve the complex leaflet structure via local collaboration between VEC and VIC in response to shear and hydrostatic stress. We use an ideal model (a symmetric cushion in a cylindrical tube) to elaborate this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The blood flow initiates an asymmetric deformation of the cushion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), leaving a gradient stress distribution with highest stress on the top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buskohl et al., 2012b</xref>). A combination of OSS and CS drives a globular growth, while USS and CS work together to induce a flat and directional growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Due to the gradient stress distribution, CS localizes on the top even when the rest part of cushions is not compressed. The localized CS promotes a continuous local growth to fine tune the size and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). USS tightens the inflow surface while OSS loosens the outflow surface. This generates a residual stress in the counterflow direction for the compaction of cushions. When the size and length are adequate, TS collaborates with USS to terminate growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In this way, the spatiotemporally developed local forces ensure the proper size, length, and thickness of leaflets.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Local collaboration of shear and hydrostatic stress can guide complex morphogenesis via YAP signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

Shear stress drives cushion remodeling into leaflet structure by modulating the cell-cell adhesions between VECs. (<bold>E</bold>). Tensile Stress (TS) inhibited YAP nuclear translocation worked together with USS for a compact and elongated morphology.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83209-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>On the other hand, disrupted flow with abnormally developed forces may cause errors in valve growth and remodeling. For example, a combination of delayed OSS and insufficient CS would result in a globular shape and small size, which are the features of underdeveloped valves. Whereas the delayed OSS and overloaded CS could cause a hypertrophic phenotype with globular shape and abnormally big size. In addition, early occurrence of high USS and TS would promote a compacted and elongated shape but with an insufficient length. Such malformations have been verified by in vivo mechanical manipulation. LAL diverted blood flow from the constricted left ventricle toward the untreated right ventricle, decreasing the hemodynamic stress on the left ventricle wall and cushions. This decreased CS in left AV cushions led to insufficient growth. Furthermore, according to the Law of Laplace, the decreased stress also results in a diminished ventricle wall tension that delays the transition from CS to TS, thus hindering cushion compaction. The LAL also altered shear stress environments with a decrease of 40% and over 50% in mean WSS applied on superior cushions and inferior cushions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salman et al., 2021</xref>). The level and duration of OSS of the left ventricle also increased significantly with LAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2021</xref>). The delayed emergence of USS could also contribute to the underdeveloped phenotype of the left AV by interfering valve shaping. By contrast, the OSS to USS transition was not significantly affected in the right ventricle, and the right AV cushion compacted and elongated as normal.</p><p>In general, YAP works like a mechanobiological switch, converting mechanical signaling into the decision between growth and maturation. When YAP is activated the growth programs are turned on and the maturation programs are suppressed. When YAP is inhibited the growth programs are paused and the maturation programs are released. Unlike the pro-growth function, the pro-maturation side of YAP has been less studied. During valve remodeling, cushions elongate into mature leaflets with increased stiffness. Although both YAP activation and inhibition increased valve stiffness, the stiffness of YAP activated valves was only about half of that of YAP inhibited valves, and only YAP inhibited valves exhibited an in vivo-like stiffness increase. We have previously shown a linear relationship between valve stiffness and valve maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buskohl et al., 2012a</xref>). This suggests that YAP inhibition promotes a more mature phenotype.</p><p>This mechanism explains a major difference between contributions of cell lineage to the EMT and post-EMT growth and remodeling. During the EMT, cell lineage is a determinant factor. Cells derived from the second heart field make the major contribution to the OFT walls, and neural crest cells make a major contribution to the OFT cushions but a minor contribution to AV and intercalated cushions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>). However, during the post-EMT growth and remodeling, all valves with various morphologies are formed by identical VECs and VICs. Our study supports that the collaboration between VECs and VICs, instead of a specific cell lineage, determines the valve growth and remodeling.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows that the spatiotemporally coordinated mechanotransduction of shear and hydrostatic stress is required for proper valve growth and remodeling. The shear and hydrostatic stress can regulate VEC tensions and VIC proliferation by YAP pathways and thus determine the valve size and shape. Malfunctional YAP signaling could cause valve malformation, but improper local mechanical signaling imposes a more important malformation risk, even if the YAP signaling is fully functional and no genes are mutated. The presented mechanobiological system could also open an opportunity to control valve growth and change valve shape by influencing forces or targeting YAP pathway at a specific stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Shear stress bioreactor system</title><p>The bioreactor included a histology microscope slide, biocompatible double-sided tape (W.W.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Julien Vermot (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improved analysis of Yap activation status relative to valve areas under different mechanical stresses is needed. Immunostaining for total Yap is inadequate to support the major findings in the study.</p><p>2) Additional manipulation of Yap activation is needed to support the major conclusion that Yap-medicated mechanotransduction has a role in fetal heart valve remodeling response to shear and hydrostatic stress.</p><p>3) Additional major conclusions in the study are not supported by rigorous data. Please see the reviewers' comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Additional data are needed to determine Yap activation status as might be indicated by nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and Yap phosphorylation. The Yap immunostaining is widespread and does not seem to relate to localized mechanical forces. Other indicators of Hippo signaling status might be informative.</p><p>2. There are no clear conclusions regarding Yap signaling status, cell proliferation, or valve morphogenesis under different biomechanical conditions. This is described in Figures 3A, B, but localized Yap activation in specific regions or cell types is not clear in these panels. The data are confusing largely due to the widespread Yap expression shown in VIC, VEC, and other cell types throughout the valves.</p><p>3. Conclusions regarding endothelial folding and altered junctions between endothelial cells are not supported by data.</p><p>4. It is not clear what tissue rounding or increased &quot;stiffness&quot; of valve explants means in the context of leaflet elongation, ECM remodeling, cell density, or growth.</p><p>5. In the chicken embryo heart unloading study (Figure 6), Yap is widely expressed in the controls, but regions of Yap activation are not apparent. It is not clear how the ratios of positive Yap were calculated or if there were specific regions of activation in response to specific blood flow dynamics.</p><p>6. Figure 7 is described as a &quot;pseudo model&quot; but it should probably be just a &quot;model&quot;. The dynamics of Yap activation shown in the model were not clearly demonstrated in the figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Addressing the weaknesses outlined below would greatly strengthen the significance and impact of the work.</p><p>Identified weaknesses of the manuscript include:</p><p>â Figure 1 demonstrates dynamic YAP expression in the developing mouse; however, all experimental studies are performed in chick. Comparative temporal and spatial expression studies in the avian model should be performed</p><p>â The relevance of YAP1 and LEF1 co-staining (or lack of) in Figure 2 adds little value to the study. At E11.5, yellow cells are identified suggesting that there is an overlap. The authors comment that the data supports &quot;that YAP has different functions at early EndMT than later remodeling stages&quot;. However, based on this expression data, this conclusion is difficult to interpret and support.</p><p>â In Figure 3, data presented in panel D should be quantitated. In addition, what are the axis referring to on the graphs of Figures 3E, F?</p><p>â In the text referring to Figure 3, the authors discuss examining the &quot;YAP signaling pathway&quot; but this is not being examined here. In addition, the authors claim that USS restrains YAP in the cytoplasm, but this is not detectable.</p><p>Throughout the study, the authors solely rely on the quantitation of nuclear YAP expression based on IHC. An addition supporting experimental readout is highly recommended, including nuclear/cytoplasmic extraction and western blot to detect YAP in cellular fractions for Figures 3C, and 3D.</p><p>â For Figures 4E, 4F, 4G, 5E-H, the US control is needed.</p><p>â In Figure 4B, there is a large decrease in circularity with YAP inhibition, yet proliferation changes appear minimal. What other YAP-dependent mechanisms might contribute to this drastic change in valve morphology? Likewise, Figure 4F indicates 10% pHH3 reactivity, yet this is not represented in Figure 4C. Which cells are proliferating?</p><p>â The phenotype in Figure 4D is interesting and unusual. The authors conclude that loss of YAP leads to endothelium folding, but again, there is little evidence to support this. If this is true, then additional supporting readouts are needed including another endothelial cell marker. How do the authors explain an increase in VE-cadherin with so little pHH3 reactivity in the VECs?</p><p>â On Page 4, the authors comment that VP treatment led to &quot;successful YAP inhibition&quot; but this data is not included.</p><p>â When referring to Figure 5, the authors comment that PY-60 treatment dose-dependently promoted the association of YAP and TEAD. This data is not included.</p><p>â Figure 5E is confusing and suggests that YAP gain of function has no effect on stress-induced increases in circularity, yet the authors conclude that YAP activation reverses the compaction of valves under TS and U conditions.</p><p>â The conclusion of findings from Figure 5D is that &quot;VE-cadherin in the YAP activated endothelium was significantly weakerâ¦showing that YAP activation led to a relaxed endothelium.&quot; Again, this conclusion needs to be supported by additional data.</p><p>â Figure 5H is mislabeled in the text.</p><p>â The authors should comment further on how and why YAP inhibition decreases the strain energy density. How can YAP influence the material properties of avian valves?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83209.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Fold changes of those genes in chick cushions followed the same trend. These data were also consistent with YAP activation measured from immunofluorescence. The results showed that YAP was independent of the Hippo pathway. It is worth noting that the PCR data mainly reflect gene transcriptions of the VIC, as it was the dominant cell population in valves.</p><p>We have also revised the first two sections of Results:</p><p>âYAP expression is spatiotemporally regulated</p><p>We collected embryonic hearts at different developmental stages from wild type mice and examined the YAP activation in heart valves. We found that YAP was expressed in both mesenchyme and endothelium of outflow tract (OFT) and atrioventricular (AV) cushions at E11.5 (Figure 1A). YAP activation in VIC increased significantly at E14.5 (Figure 1B) then dropped at E17.5 (Figure 1C). This decrease in YAP activation during later remodeling stages was significant in AV valves but insignificant in SL valves, as the development was not uniform across all valves.

The expressions of those genes then reduced significantly during later stages of remodeling. In comparison, gene expressions of LATS1/2, the upstream of YAP in the Hippo pathway, had little change during the valve growth and remodeling. This result supports that YAP activation is operated independently of the Hippo pathway.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have now improved the annotations in Figure 2A and 2B. In Figure 2A, solid lines are used for the USS domain and dash lines for the OSS domain. Solid arrows highlight nuclear YAP, and dash arrows highlight nuclei without YAP. In Figure 2B, the CS domain is highlighted by a solid circle with force direction and the TS domain by a dash circle with force direction. We have also changed the color scheme in Figure 2 for a better visualization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Conclusions regarding endothelial folding and altered junctions between endothelial cells are not supported by data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out our lack of clarity. The term âendothelial foldingâ was poorly chosen. In fact, by âfoldingâ, we meant the shrinkage of surface areas. Due to the compaction of cushion explants, their surface areas became much</p><p>smaller, and the shrinkage is approximately proportional to (<italic>d/D</italic>)<sup>2</sup>. Even a small compaction will cause a large reduction in surface areas. As a result, the endothelium at 0-hour was geometrically too large for the cushions at 24-hour. Therefore, the endothelium could be forced to cluster into multiple layers. Indeed, we observed extra thick and densely packed VE-cadherin positive layers in YAP inhibited valves. Another possibility is that YAP activity can affect cell-cell junctions between VECs. For example, some studies reported that YAP can break cell-cell junctions between VECs via SMADs mediated TGF-Î² signaling during the EMT process. The detailed mechanisms by which YAP affects the cell-cell junctions and endothelium behaviors is important but requires further studies to elaborate.</p><p>We have moved this discussion from the first section of the Results to the Discussion, we have also revised titles of the third and fourth sections of the Results and titles of Figure 3 and Figure 4.</p><p>The revised third section of the Results, as well as the title of Figure 3 are as follows:</p><p>âLoss of YAP limited cell proliferation and promoted valve shaping</p><p>To study the function of YAP in valve growth and remodeling, we added a pharmacological inhibitor of YAP, verteporfin (VP), into the CS (pro-growth) and U conditions. The VP inhibits the interaction between YAP and TEAD, which in turn, blocks transcriptional activation of targets downstream of YAP. (31) We cultured cushion explants under CS, CS+VP and U+VP. We confirmed that the concentration of VP we used (5mM) does not influence cell viability (Figure 3âfigure supplementary 1A). Successful YAP inhibition (Figure 3âfigure supplementary 1C) reduced the cushion size (Figure 3A vs. Figure 3B), regardless of the media condition. In contrast to the spherical shape of cushions cultured under CS, cushions cultured in media with VP maintained their trapezoidal shape, which was characterized by circularity (Figure 3E). Further investigation demonstrated that loss of YAP significantly reduces the expression of the proliferation maker, pHH3 in the VIC (Figure 3C, 3F). In addition, the YAP inhibition significantly strengthened the expression of VE-cadherin between VECs (Figure 3D, 3G). Cushions normally just had a single layer of endothelium, but the YAP inhibited valves showed five or more layers of endothelium.&quot;</p><p>The revised title of fourth section of the Results and Figure 4 is:</p><p>âActivation of YAP promoted cell proliferation and inhibited valve elongationâ</p><p>The new first paragraph of the Discussion is as follows:</p><p>âCardiac valves form in response to mechanical forces generated by the flowing blood. These forces include shear and hydrostatic stress. Our results reveal that they can regulate YAP activity in valvular cells, and the mechanically regulated YAP activity can affect the size, shape and stiffness of valves. First, the shear stress regulates YAP activity in the VEC: OSS (oscillatory shear stress) promotes YAP nuclear translocation while USS (unidirectional shear stress) restricts YAP in cytoplasm. The hydrostatic stress regulates YAP activation in the VIC: CS (compressive stress) activated YAP while TS (tensile stress) deactivated YAP. Secondly, these mechanoresponsive YAP activities have morphological functions. YAP activation in VICs promotes their proliferation and increases valve size, YAP deactivation in VICs leads to valve compaction. In terms of shape, cushion explants tend to form a sphere in a way similar to the clustering of cells to minimize the surface tension (32). By contrast, YAP inhibition promotes valve shaping and leaves a densely packed endothelium. The densely packed endothelium could be a result of the large shrinkage in surface area, during which the endothelium at 0-hour could be geometrically too large for the valves at 24-hour. Consequently, the endothelium could be forced to cluster into multiple layers. Another possibility is that YAP activity can affect cell-cell junctions between VECs. For example, studies reported that YAP can break cell-cell junctions via SMADs mediated TGF-Î² signaling during the EMT process (33).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is not clear what tissue rounding or increased &quot;stiffness&quot; of valve explants means in the context of leaflet elongation, ECM remodeling, cell density, or growth.</p></disp-quote><p>During valve remodeling, cushions elongate into mature leaflets with increased stiffness. We have previously shown a nearly linear relationship between strain energy and leaflet elongation in-vivo.</p><p>The new fourth paragraph of Discussion is as follows:</p><p>âIn general, YAP works like a mechanobiological switch, converting mechanical signaling into the decision between growth and maturation. When YAP is activated the growth programs are turned on and the maturation programs are suppressed. When YAP is inhibited the growth programs are paused and the maturation programs are released. Unlike the pro-growth function, the pro-maturation side of YAP has been less studied. During valve remodeling, cushions elongate into mature leaflets with increased stiffness. Although both YAP activation and inhibition increased valve stiffness, the stiffness of YAP activated valves was only about half of that of YAP inhibited valves, and only YAP inhibited valves exhibited an in-vivo-like stiffness increase. We have previously shown a linear relationship between valve stiffness and valve maturation (32). This suggests that YAP inhibition promotes a more mature phenotype.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors conclude that loss of YAP leads to endothelium folding, but again, there is little evidence to support this. If this is true, then additional supporting readouts are needed including another endothelial cell marker. How do the authors explain an increase in VE-cadherin with so little pHH3 reactivity in the VECs?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out this issue. The term âendothelial foldingâ was poorly chosen. In fact, by âfoldingâ, we meant the shrinkage of surface areas. In fact, by âfoldingâ, we mean the shrinkage of surface areas. Due to the compaction of cushion explants, their surface areas became much smaller, and the shrinkage is approximately proportional to (<italic>d/D</italic>)<sup>2</sup>. Even a small compaction will cause a large reduction in surface areas. As a result, the endothelium at 0-hour was geometrically too large for the cushions at 24-hour. Therefore, the endothelium could cluster into multiple layers Therefore, the increased VE-cadherin expression does not require VEC proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â On Page 4, the authors comment that VP treatment led to &quot;successful YAP inhibition&quot; but this data is not included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this reminder.

In fact, however, circularity evaluates whether the valves are spherical, while compaction evaluates how small valves became. YAP gain of function maintained a large size, probably due to enhanced cell proliferation, but its shape became round.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The conclusion of findings from Figure 5D is that &quot;VE-cadherin in the YAP activated endothelium was significantly weakerâ¦showing that YAP activation led to a relaxed endothelium.&quot; Again, this conclusion needs to be supported by additional data.</p></disp-quote><p>We again appreciate the reviewer for raising this issue. As mentioned in previous answers, the terms âendothelium foldingâ and ârelaxed endotheliumâ were chosen. Here, the ârelaxed endotheliumâ meant the opposite to the âclustered endothelial geometryâ. We have also moved this discussion from the first section of the Results to the Discussion, we have also revised titles of the third and fourth sections of the Results and titles of Figure 3 and Figure 4.</p><p>The revised third section of the Results, as well as the title of Figure 3 are as follows:</p><p>âLoss of YAP limited cell proliferation and promoted valve shaping</p><p>To study the function of YAP in valve growth and remodeling, we added a pharmacological inhibitor of YAP, verteporfin (VP), into the CS (pro-growth) and U conditions. The VP inhibits the interaction between YAP and TEAD, which in turn, blocks transcriptional activation of targets downstream of YAP. (31) We isolated HH34 OFT SL cushion explants and cultured them under CS, CS+VP and U+VP. We confirmed that the concentration of VP we used (5mM) does not influence cell viability (Figure 3âfigure supplementary 1A, B). Successful YAP inhibition (Figure 3âfigure supplementary 1C) reduced the valve size (Figure 3A vs. Figure 3B), regardless of the media condition. In contrast to the spherical shape of valves cultured under CS, valves cultured in media with VP maintained their trapezoidal shape, which was characterized by circularity (Figure 3E). Further investigation demonstrated that loss of YAP significantly reduces the expression of the proliferation maker, pHH3 in the VIC (Figure 3C, 3F). In addition, the YAP inhibition significantly strengthened the expression of VE-cadherin between VECs (Figure 3D, 3G). Valves normally just had a single layer of endothelium, but the YAP inhibited valves showed five or more layers of endothelium.â</p><p>The revised title of fourth section of the Results and Figure 4 is:</p><p>âActivation of YAP promoted cell proliferation and inhibited valve elongationâ</p><p>The new first paragraph of the Discussion is as follows:</p><p>âCardiac valves form in response to mechanical forces generated by the flowing blood. These forces include shear and hydrostatic stress. Our results reveal that they can regulate YAP activity in valvular cells, and the mechanically regulated YAP activity can affect the size, shape and stiffness of valves. First, the shear stress regulates YAP activity in the VEC: OSS (oscillatory shear stress) promotes YAP nuclear translocation while USS (unidirectional shear stress) restricts YAP in cytoplasm. The hydrostatic stress regulates YAP activation in the VIC: CS (compressive stress) activated YAP while TS (tensile stress) deactivated YAP. Secondly, these mechanoresponsive YAP activities have morphological functions. YAP activation in VICs promotes their proliferation and increases valve size, YAP deactivation in VICs leads to valve compaction. In terms of shape, cushion explants tend to form a sphere in a way similar to the clustering of cells to minimize the surface tension (32). By contrast, YAP inhibition promotes valve shaping and leaves a densely packed endothelium. The densely packed endothelium could be a result of the large shrinkage in surface area, during which the endothelium at 0-hour could be geometrically too large for the valves at 24-hour. Consequently, the endothelium could be forced to cluster into multiple layers. Another possibility is that YAP activity can affect cell-cell junctions between VECs. For example, studies reported that YAP can break cell-cell junctions via SMADs mediated TGF-Î² signaling during the EMT process (33).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 5H is mislabeled in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this mistake, we have corrected the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors should comment further on how and why YAP inhibition decreases the strain energy density. How can YAP influence the material properties of avian valves?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that YAP inhibition promotes pro-maturation programs, which increase valve stiffness. We have now added a discussion in the new fourth paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>âIn general, YAP works like a mechanobiological switch, converting mechanical signaling into the decision between growth and maturation. When YAP is activated the growth programs are turned on and the maturation programs are suppressed. When YAP is inhibited the growth programs are paused and the maturation programs are released. Unlike the pro-growth function, the pro-maturation side of YAP has been less studied. During valve remodeling, cushions elongate into mature leaflets with increased stiffness. Although both YAP activation and inhibition increased valve stiffness, the stiffness of YAP activated valves was only about half of that of YAP inhibited valves, and only YAP inhibited valves exhibited an in-vivo-like stiffness increase. We have previously shown a linear relationship between valve stiffness and valve maturation (32). This suggests that YAP inhibition promotes a more mature phenotype.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
