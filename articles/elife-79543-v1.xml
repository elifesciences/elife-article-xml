disease. Lung tissue, sputum, and sera of individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) show alterations in miRNA expression. We designed this study to test whether urine and/or tissue derived exosomal miRNAs from individuals with IPF carry cargo that can promote fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Exosomes were isolated from urine (U-IPFexo), lung tissue myofibroblasts (MF-IPFexo), serum from individuals with IPF (n=16) and age/sex-matched controls without lung disease (n=10).

In vivo bio-distribution experiments detected bioluminescent exosomes in the lung of normal C57Bl6 mice within 5 min after intravenous infusion, followed by distribution to other organs irrespective of exosome source. Exosomes labeled with gold nanoparticles and imaged by transmission electron microscopy were visualized in alveolar epithelial type I and type II cells. Treatment of human and mouse lung punches obtained from control, non-fibrotic lungs with either U-IPFexo or MF-IPFexo produced a fibrotic phenotype. A fibrotic phenotype was also induced in a human ex vivo skin model and in in vivo lung models.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results provide evidence of a systemic feature of IPF whereby exosomes contain pro-fibrotic miRNAs when obtained from a fibrotic source and interfere with response to tissue injury as measured in skin and lung models.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported in part by Lester and Sue Smith Foundation and The Samrick Family Foundation and NIH grants R21 AG060338 (SE and MKG), U01 DK119085 (IP, RS, MTC).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Urine</kwd><kwd>Fibrosis</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lester and Sue Smith Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliot</surname><given-names>Sharon</given-names></name><name><surname>Glassberg</surname><given-names>Marilyn K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Samrick Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glassberg</surname><given-names>Marilyn K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systemic feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis whereby urine-derived exosomes contain pro-fibrotic microRNAs and interfere with response to tissue injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over 200,000 older Americans currently suffer from chronic age-associated fibrotic lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cordier and Cottin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lederer and Martinez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richeldi et al., 2017</xref>) annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hecker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lederer and Martinez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raghu et al., 2016</xref>). Alveolar epithelial cell damage, proliferation of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation lead to irreversible disruption of the lung architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinoshita and Goto, 2019</xref>). While the etiology of IPF remains unknown, there is an ongoing need for understanding mechanisms of disease and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drakopanagiotakis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tzouvelekis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are potential candidates for elucidation of a biomarker signature for IPF and other fibrotic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">H Rashed et al., 2017</xref>). As a key component of cell–cell communication, EVs deliver miRNAs, mRNA, and tRNA into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yáñez-Mó et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, their systemic distribution in body fluids may reflect the presence of disease. The ease of collection and presence of exosomes in most body fluids, including blood, breast milk, saliva, urine, bile, pancreatic juice, cerebrospinal, and peritoneal fluids, have facilitated recent studies investigating their use as diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013</xref>). Because exosomes are released by all cells and contain cargo from the cell of origin, it is conceivable that they deliver pathogenic materials leading to a disease phenotype. Whether the content of exosomes from different sources are the same has not been studied previously.</p><p>Molecular analysis of lung biopsies from individuals with IPF reveal a unique miRNA transcriptome compared with the miRNA transcriptome found from non-fibrotic lung biopsy samples providing evidence supporting the disease conferring properties of exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guiot et al., 2019</xref>). In serum isolated from individuals with IPF compared to control serum samples, there were 47 differentially expressed miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Njock et al. reported a signature of <italic>miR-142–3 p, miR-33a-5p, miR-let-7d-5p</italic> in sputum of individuals with IPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Njock et al., 2019</xref>). Parimon et al. found that in lung tissue EVs isolated from mouse alveolar spaces and IPF lungs, TGF-β and Wnt signaling were increased after bleomycin (Bleo) treatment. These data trigger a hypothesis that dysregulation of miRNAs packaged in exosomes in diseased sources are involved in the development and progression of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guiot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parimon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies using exosomes from urine of individuals with IPF (U-IPFexo) or any urine-derived exosomes in the investigation of fibrotic lung disease. In the present study we isolated and characterized exosomes isolated from the urine of 16 male individuals with IPF and 10 age and sex-matched control individuals to test the hypothesis that U-IPFexo cargo could promote a fibrotic phenotype. We found a a fibrotic miRNA expression pattern in serum and urine derved from the same individual with IPF. Our results also confirmed that several miRNAs previously reported in the lung, serum, and sputum from individuals with IPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Njock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pandit and Milosevic, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rajasekaran et al., 2015</xref>) could be identified in urine, lung, and serum IPFexo.</p><p>Intravenous infusion of urine exosomes isolated from both normal and diseased individuals using in vivo bioluminescent imaging system, revealed fairly rapid biodistribution to the lung. Ex vivo human and mouse lung punch studies and in vivo mouse models were used to functionally assess the effect of tissue (lungs) and systemic (urine and serum) exosomes isolated from individuals with IPF and ‘control’ exosomes isolated from urine and fibroblasts from control lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habermann et al., 2019</xref>). U-IPFexo conveyed a pro-fibrotic lung phenotype and inhibited skin tissue repair. The unique signature was specific to IPFexo, and not only transferred a pro-fibrotic lung phenotype to control mice but further increased markers of lung fibrosis in vivo. Since body weight is independently associated with survival of individuals with IPF, we used body weight as a surrogate for stage of disease and found that mice lost more body weight after treatment with U-IPFexo than with Bleo treatment alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mogulkoc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakatsuka et al., 2018</xref>). We also included urine exosomes from subjects with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis or asthma (non-fibrotic lung diseases) in in vivo experiments. Mice receiving these exosomes did not exhibit changes in fibrotic markers. These findings suggest that markers of lung fibrosis are specific, may be detected systemically, outside of the lung, and can communicate the pathology to different tissues. Importantly, urine exosomes have the potential to be used as disease-defining biomarkers in patients with IPF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A complete list of source data including antibodies and primer sequences are included as supplement 1.

Written informed consent was obtained from the participants with an approved Institutional Review Board protocol (IRB# 20060249) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Control urines were obtained from subjects that did not have underlying kidney, heart, or lung comorbidities and had normal albumin creatinine ratios sampled in an aliquot of each urine. Urine was processed within 3 hr of collection and spun at 3000xg for 15 min to remove sediment; supernatant was aliquoted at 10 ml/tube. Patients with known kidney disease or diabetes were excluded from the study and a small aliquot of urine was used to measure urine albumin and creatinine to exclude samples with albuminuria (Creatinine LiquiColor Test, Stanbio Laboratory Boerne, TX and albumin Elisa, Bethyl laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Tubes were frozen at –80 ° C until exosome isolation. Blood was collected during the same clinic visit as urine collection. Blood was left to clot for up to an hour and serum separated after centrifugation at ~2500 RPM for 15 min. Serum was aliquoted and frozen at –80 ° C until exosome isolation.

Mice treated with Bleo +IPF exosomes lost 35±2.6% BW compared to mice treated with Bleo (29 ± 2.6% of BW; p=0.05 compared to IPF) or mice receiving Bleo +control exosomes (19 ± 3.2% of BW; p&lt;0.05 compared to Bleo, p&lt;0.01 compared to IPF). Bleo-treated mice that received urine derived exosomes from individuals with non-CF bronchiectasis lost more weight (39 ± 5.7% BW; p&lt;0.05) than Bleo-treated mice.

Most recently, studies on exosomes have focused on miRNAs, small noncoding RNA molecules able to influence protein expression. Since exosomes act as an interface for cell-cell communication, we investigated IPF disease exosomes and the ability of these ‘diseased’ exosomes to promote fibrotic lung disease and impair skin wound healing.

When distinct regions of lung tissue were analyzed from the same IPF lung and the histology labeled as minimal, moderate and end-stage disease severity divergent sets of genes and miRNA expression were dependent on the severity of diseased tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDonough et al., 2019a</xref>). <italic>MicroRNA let-7</italic>, a critical marker in our studies, was associated with end-stage fibrotic lung disease. In a recent study, PBMC miRNA expression correlated with survival in individuals with IPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casanova et al., 2021</xref>), supporting the disease conferring role of miRNA expression as a potential signature of disease. In the present study, we compared expression of miRNAs from urine-derived exosomes and serum-derived exosomes isolated from the same individuals with IPF. We acknowledge that the absence of differences in miRNA expression between urine and serum-derived exosomes may reflect our small sample size. These data warrant a larger study that is currently ongoing.</p><p>To demonstrate delivery of exosomes to the lungs, we performed biodistribution experiments using U-IPFexo and urine exosomes from control subjects (without lung disease). The urine-derived exosomes were located in the lungs of 18-month-old male mice within 5 min followed by a diminished signal at 24–48 hr; similar transit time was recorded whether the urine exosomes were prepared from individuals with IPF or controls. Additional studies showed that an exosome signal was no longer visualized in the mouse at 19 days post-injection. Our studies used ExoGlow-Vivo that employs an amine binding dye emitting in the near infrared (NIR) range instead of infrared lipophilic cyanine dye, DiIC18 (DiD) to label urine derived exosomes. Since the ExoGlow dye is non-lipophilic it provides a more specific signal when used in vivo. Similar transit times have been reported using DiD to label bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell- derived exosomes showing delivery after intravenous infusion to the lung at 5 min and to the liver and spleen at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grange et al., 2014</xref>). Exosomes derived from breast cancer cells have a similar profile of biodistribution: lung,&gt;liver &gt; spleen, kidney &gt;heart &gt; bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To study cellular and tissue interplay in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uhl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zscheppang et al., 2018</xref>) we evaluated how the exosomes integrated in ex vivo lung punches by loading exosomes with nanoparticles and performing TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zeringer et al., 2013</xref>). We found that the punch architecture was preserved after injection of exosomes compared to non-injected and PBS injected punches, and urine-derived exosomes were integrated into AEC I or AEC II cells. Our studies could not distinguish whether homing of the ‘diseased’ exosomes favored a specific cell type compared to injection with control exosomes. These extensive studies are ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p>Further studies using ex vivo lung punches from human non-fibrotic lung tissue and naïve 18-month-old male mice noted minimal effect on the histology of the lung punch after treatment with PBS or urine-derived exosomes isolated from age and sex-matched controls without lung disease. We found that treatment with U-IPFexo increased expression of fibrotic markers and pathways (α<sub>v</sub>-integrin, collagen type I and TGFβ mRNA expression, c-Jun protein expression and MMP-9 and AKT activation). Additionally, there was a notable decrease in SPC positive cells in punches (AEC II cells) receiving U-or MF-IPFexo. Since AEC II are regarded as the progenitor population of the alveolus responsible for injury repair and homeostatic maintenance, these data suggest that IPFexo may be inhibiting the repair mechanism in AEC II.</p><p>We have previously reported an increase of ERα protein expression in cells and tissue isolated from lungs of male individuals with IPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elliot et al., 2019</xref>). Studies suggest that activation of ERα may be profibrotic in multiple organs including the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pedram et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). In the current investigation, we found at least ~1.4-fold increase in ERα protein expression in human and mouse punches treated with U-IPFexo or MF-IPFexo. Punches injected with MF-IPFexo also induced other components of fibrotic pathways consistent with data derived from punches injected with U-IPFexo. Furthermore, U-IPFexo impaired the wound healing response, supporting our hypothesis that exosome cargo delivered signals impairing wound repair in skin. This suggests that the systemic feature of IPF exosomes may predispose impaired tissue healing, which can have significant clinical implications and will be further investigated.</p><p>We recognize that under our experimental conditions, lung punches lack immune recruitment, systemic perfusion and are under potentially hypoxic conditions. Therefore, we sought to determine if these exosomes would confer lung injury in vivo under normoxic conditions (21% oxygen) in old male C57BL/6 mice. We injected U-IPFexo into naive 18-month-old C57BL/6 mice and collected the lungs 21 days post-exosome treatment. Although there was no change in Ashcroft score, we noted increased collagen content (measured by hydroxyproline) and evidence of inflammatory cells including increased macrophages in lung tissue from mice treated with U-IPFexo compared to tissue from mice treated with control exosomes.</p><p>Another group of mice were treated with Bleo. Ashcroft score, collagen content, α<sub>V-</sub>integrin and TGFβ mRNA expression increased in the lungs of mice treated with Bleo +U-IPFexo compared to mice treated with Bleo +vehicle and Bleo +control exosomes, suggesting that U-IPFexo escalated fibrotic pathways induced by Bleo in old male mice. There was no increase of TGFβ in lungs of mice treated with non-fibrotic exo. As reviewed, TGFβ is ubiquitous in chronic inflammatory lung diseases including COPD, IPF and asthma and may contribute to an immune-suppressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also found an expected increase in MMP-2 activity in the lungs of U-IPFexo treated mice, as MMP-2 increases migration and invasiveness of lung myofibroblasts during Bleo-induced pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). This was in contrast to urine derived control exosomes or exosomes from urine of individuals with bronchiectasis or asthma. BW, historically shown to decrease with Bleo treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowley et al., 2019</xref>) was decreased in mice receiving Bleo +U-IPFexo compared to Bleo alone or Bleo +control exosomes.

Parimon et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parimon et al., 2019</xref>) showed that antifibrotic microRNAs (<italic>miRs-144–3 p, –142–3 p, –34b-5p, –503–5</italic> p) packaged into EVs regulate epithelial plasticity and potentially pulmonary fibrosis. Martin-Medina et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin-Medina et al., 2018</xref>) reported an increase in the number of EV in BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) from Bleo-treated mice as well as from patients with IPF, that function as carriers for signaling mediators, such as WNT5A. Both studies reported that isolated EV preparations consisted predominantly of exosomes, although microvesicles were present, unlike our preparations that did not contain microvesicles. Neither study investigated urine-derived exosomes. In the present study, lung tissue isolated from naïve or Bleo-treated mice injected with U-IPFexo also exhibited the same changes in miRNA expression as found in ex vivo lung punches. The present study illustrates the potential correlation between changes in mRNA and protein expression (TGFβ, MMPs) and dysregulated miRNA expression suggesting that a miRNA signature could function as a potential biomarker for fibrotic lung disease. Reproducible biomarkers would enable early diagnosis and non-invasive detection methods are currently under investigation for multiple diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tatler, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We further analyzed lungs from Bleo mice that were treated with exosomes derived from subjects with asthma or non-CF bronchiectasis, non-fibrotic lung diseases. We did not find an increase in the fibrotic markers studied and in fact noted a decrease in collagen content and integrin in the lung tissue. A limitation of our current studies includes a limited number of mice which will need to be expanded in future experiments. In addition, we recognize that subjects with asthma were not age matched to the control or IPF subjects.

Because exosomes contain non-coding and other small coding RNAs, derived from transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berrondo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lv et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Omote and Sauler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pérez-Boza et al., 2018</xref>), we attempted to characterize the more easily studied expression of mRNA and mRNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batagov and Kurochkin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peake et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, we found no evidence of mRNA expression for our selected targets (supplement). However, the presence of 3’ UTR mRNA fragments which could bind miRNA and allow for RNA transcription to proceed in target cells ultimately altering the phenotype of otherwise healthy cells has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batagov and Kurochkin, 2013</xref>). This is an attractive hypothesis and warrants investigation especially in urine-derived exosomes that elicit a pathologic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batagov and Kurochkin, 2013</xref>). Further studies are in progress to expand our data and include determination of other disease provoking cargo that may be carried by IPF exosomes including tRNAs.</p><p>Our study provides the first evidence of circulating cargo found in U-IPFexo that confers disease in two target organs (lung and skin) and suggests a potential mechanism for initiation and/or progression of disease. To the best of our knowledge, the technology to completely empty exosome cargo to allow us to confirm the fibrotic role of specific miRNAs without damaging the exosomes, is not available. Our data suggest that IPF may have a systemic feature. In addition, urine-derived exosomes potentially represent a novel way to identify biomarkers for lung and fibrotic diseases and that miRNA profiling of urine-derived exosomes as biomarkers may lead to noninvasive assessments for earlier diagnosis. Overlap of miRNA expression yielding a fibrotic profile to produce a personalized panel of urine-derived miRNAs or fibromiRs to detect IPF and other lung and fibrotic diseases may be a future diagnostic and prognostic tool.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>holds pending patent applications for Family - Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles and uses thereof for treating and diagnosing fibrotic diseases (30309-001*), Family - Diagnostic and therapeutic uses of compositions comprising purified, enriched potent exosomes containing disease-based and therapy based signature cargo (130309-003*), and Family - Urine-derived exosomes from individuals with IPF carry pro-fibrotic cargo and impair tissue repair (130309-004*)</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>ZenBio</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>participated on a paid role on the Scientific Advisory Board for Akron Biotech and roles on the Scientific Advisory Board for ICN2 and on the Board of Trustees for BIST.

But there are a few caveats. First, exosomes carry small cargoes other than RNAs. The authors ruled out the presence of mRNAs in exosomes, but there still could be cargoes other than miRNAs and mRNAs that play pro-fibrotic roles. Second, the authors showed the fibrotic pathways are activated in lung punches. They characterized the expressions of several miRNAs and discussed their roles found in published literature. However, the fibrotic pathways may not be necessarily activated by these miRNAs. MiRNAs are known to have multiple gene targets and are involved in many gene pathways. It would be helpful to include another experiment to show direct connections between these miRNA expression levels and the fibrotic protein levels.</p><p>1. It would be helpful to include a demographic feature table and a description of subjects in the method section.</p><p>2. Figure 1: Any reason HSP70 is not shown?</p><p>3.

Using in vivo models they show that these exosomes traffic to the lung and can be found in alveolar epithelial cells. The authors show that these exosomes support the development of fibrosis both in vitro, using a lung punch model, and in the in vivo bleomycin model. The authors conclude that exosomes may have a role in the development of fibrosis and that they might a indicate that IPF is a systemic disease. The manuscript is interesting and clearly written. There is potential for the development of novel biomarkers from this work.</p><p>Why were only exosome from male patients studied?</p><p>The authors show that isolated myofibroblasts from IPF lung produce profibrotic exosomes. Do the authors have a sense as to whether exosomes are derived from any other lung cells or indeed any other organs?

It should at least be included in the hydroxyproline graphs.</p><p>The discussion page 39 refers to &quot;the bleomycin model of IPF&quot;. While the bleomycin model is an established model of lung injury and fibrosis it is not a model of IPF.

They base their extensive work on the premise that exosomes (derived from multiple sources) in individuals with IPF are key determinants of cell-cell communication that carry aberrant cargo in the form micro-RNAs and stimulate pro-fibrotic pathways upon interaction with receptor cells/tissue. Ultimately, the authors conclude that exosomes isolated from the urine of patients with IPF are indeed capable of conferring a fibrotic phenotype in a manner similar to myofibroblast derived exosomes.</p><p>Major Strengths:</p><p>– The major strength of this manuscript is that the authors develop/utilize multiple murine and human ex vivo and in vivo models to prove that urine-derive exosomes from patients with IPF confer a pro-fibrotic phenotype. Altogether, they provide a systematic approach in which gold nanoparticles containing exosomes (and their cargo) are administered into the various models and utilize multiple molecular, histologic/microscopy, and biodistribution analyses to substantiate their hypothesis.</p><p>– The introduction and discussion are well referenced and provide robust backing for this research.</p><p>Major Weaknesses:</p><p>– It is uncertain if exosomes derived from control patients are equivalent comparators in their study given that fibroblasts from controls and not myofibroblasts from subjects with IPF are utilized as the source for exosome isolation given that fibroblasts are usually considered quiescent, and they require various stimuli to develop into myofibroblasts. Thus, it is possible that exosomes derived from fibroblasts do not carry similar cargo. In this manner, the comparison that is performed to assess content similarity of exosomes between IPF and controls and between urine and serum is limited to 4 preselected miRNAs, it is likely that high-throughput experiments of exosomal micro-RNA content would aid in determination of similarity/dissimilarity.</p><p>– Though the authors developed a systematic workflow that enabled human and murine ex vivo and in vivo validation experiments, there appear to be inconsistencies that raise questions regarding the reproducibility of the experiments that are attributable to different biologic replicate numbers and different stimuli/molecular markers being assessed after different stimuli, in other words experimental design is variable and the modifications to experimental design are not always justified.</p><p>– For instance, micro-RNAs 34 and 142 are assessed in the experiments related to Tables 4 and 5 and it is possible that they potentially have biologic relevance; however, these were not reported in the initial exosomal micro-RNA experiment (Figure 2).</p><p>– Similarly, there are occasions when myofibroblast and fibroblast derived exosomes may provide valuable information as comparators to substantiate the properties acquired upon administration of urine exosomes.</p><p>– Also, exosomes derived from diseased controls (asthma and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis) were obtained but they were utilized as controls only in the in-vivo experiment (Table 5 and Figure 8), an experiment in which markers utilized by the authors as indicative of possible fibrotic stimuli were appreciated in the non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis group (TGF-B levels and mouse weight loss).</p><p>Justifying the changes in experimental design or providing the additional data to demonstrate consistency would add strength to the findings.</p><p>– Many of the experiments are PCR based; however, only relative expression of the molecules of interest is reported and there is no data regarding cycle thresholds at which these were detected. Original RT-qPCR amplification curve and melt curve data would be more informative and it should be provided in the data supplement to substantiate findings and allow for future reproducibility. Along these lines, it is not clear how the findings would change if a more standard analytical approach for normalization of the data were utilized (i.e., ddCT) rather than the normalization against % control exosomes, % PBS control, etc.</p><p>– It would serve the manuscript well if the manuscript had standardized terminology/acronyms and figure annotation/labeling throughout.</p><p>– The flow of the manuscript methods and Results section is difficult to follow (likely because the work was so extensive), a supplementary figure (flow diagram) would help the reader follow the manuscript's study design.</p><p>– Line 123: A reference should be provided to specify the criteria used to determine IPF.</p><p>– With regard to the IPF group and the potential to use the urine-derived exosomes as future biomarkers of IPF it would be ideal if Table 1 reports % predicted PFT values (spirometry and DLCO) and it would also be ideal for extent of fibrosis to be reported to gain understanding of disease severity. Since the determination of fibrosis depended on radiologic UIP pattern, there should be more than 1 radiologist interpretation and concordance ascertained (this would allow further substantiation given the small N). What was the time interval between PFT/CT-scan and sample collection for research? Were other causes of UIP pattern in these presumed IPF patients excluded (for instance CT-ILD, often secondary to rheumatoid arthritis , presents with a radiologic UIP pattern)? The importance of this exclusion lies on systemic vs pulmonary specific disease, it is common to think of IPF as a pulmonary only disease whereas RA is a systemic inflammatory disease with joint predominance, as such if the presence of these alternate causes is not excluded it can confound the conclusion that urine exosomes reflect a pulmonary centric disease.</p><p>– What were the cell markers to ascertain fibroblasts? The cited study (Elliot 2019) only provides information on myofibroblasts. As stated in the major comments, the question of fibroblast vs myofibroblast validity as a comparison arises from the consideration that it would be unexpected for cells with different transcriptional programs to confer the same cargo to exosomes- with this being said, a high-throughput experiment assessing differences in exosomal cargo between the cell types may prove/disprove this given that the preselected micro-RNAs may not be fully representative of the full exosomal cargo.</p><p>– The methods section would likely benefit from section reordering or providing reference to future sections to allow there to be a better understanding of the workflow. For instance, line 162 as written does not make sense given that it states: &quot;exosomes were injected into the lung punch …in a volume of 100uL.&quot; It is not until line 200 that it becomes apparent that these are mixed in with the nanoparticles. Other instances require clarification throughout the methods (where do the human lung samples come from? – not mentioned until the Results section, etc.)</p><p>– The human lung samples are mentioned to be obtained from trauma patient explants, were these patients previously healthy or were the lungs &quot;primed&quot; for fibrotic processes from underlying disease/or were they diseased and only histologically normal sites utilized?</p><p>– Line 199- &quot;Experiments&quot; is misspelled.</p><p>– Line 279: clarify, does this line refer to &quot;bleomycin&quot; naïve control mice?</p><p>– Histology: Ashcroft scoring would benefit from interpretation from various pathologists and concordance assessment given the small N.</p><p>– Table 1 is missing demographic characteristics that may play a role (such as race) and clinical characteristics such as treatment or lack thereof of with antifibrotics. With regards to the asthma and non-cf bronchiectasis groups- were these obtained when patients were flaring or not flaring? In the case of the non-cf bronchiectasis group if a flare was present this could in part explain the effects observed in the mice (weight decreased even more than in the IPFexo administration group).</p><p>– Line 356: the statement is too broad knowing that more than the preselected micro-RNAs are carried in these exosomes. Equivalence can only refer to the micro-RNAs that were tested in Figure 2.</p><p>– Figure 2: where is the data pertaining to expression of micro-RNA 34 and 142 that become featured micro-RNAs in the latter experiments? What led to the variability in sample numbers/replicates? Figure 2E, what individuals were selected to show equivalent miRNA expression (with the variable replicates/samples in the prior panels) it makes it difficult to draw conclusions- were these selected as a convenience sample, randomly, etc. Moreover, it seems like some subjects are missing from the comparison (some points on the scatter are lacking- this may be from overlap and the &quot;jitter&quot; in Graphpad can be adjusted to show all data points). Also, the statistic here may not be the most appropriate this seems like it calls for a paired-sample assessment rather than and MWU test (i.e Wilcoxon signed rank test for non-normal data). This applies to other instances of paired assessments as well.</p><p>– Line 375- missing the word &quot;in&quot;: exosomes were located IN the lung.</p><p>– Supplemental Figure 1: because 3 mice were used in each condition it would be best to show all 3 data points for each condition at the various time points. A mean value between three data points is not sufficient to show differences given that the variability can be high (ie. 49,50,51) have a mean value of 50, while 0,50,100 would also have a mean value of 50. Panel B caption text refers to both 30 min and 48 hour timepoints but the figure only shows data for 30min timepoint. What does the label &quot;IPF 178&quot; refer to in Panel B?</p><p>– Line 405: please clarify, not imaged or not visualized in TEM. Seems that this is showing the absence of collagen deposition is just as relevant to controls as is showing the presence of collagen in U-IPFexo given that a potential causality (or proof of) is sought by these experiments.</p><p>– Line 426-427: is an interesting hypothesis linking exosomal cargo to deficiencies in surfactant and AECs that are thought to contribute to fibrotic mechanisms. However, no comment is made on the effect of myofibroblast/fibroblast derived exosomes that are shown in Figure 5E. Are there conclusions to be drawn from these stains as well?</p><p>– With regards to U-IPFexo on human lung punches -&gt; there is mention of collagen and integrin being assessed- however, it seems that this is not commented on, what effect did U-IPF exosomes have on collagen and integrin.</p><p>– Figure 6- also needs better labeling, for concordance- where is the ERa response to myofibroblast/fibroblast exosomes? Again, there seems to be variability in replicates (how many human lung replicates?, mouse replicates are provided but variable…why the variability?), also if only 2 replicates were assessed individual points and not bar plots with error bars should be shown. Figure 6 caption/labeling do not seem to be consistent- needs revision, axis titles need revision. For visualization purposes- data/replicate summary in caption makes interpretation difficult, some of the caption can be moved to the figure panels themselves, to show pertinent data for each experiment. MWU tests need to be clarified as pairwise comparisons given that the significance bars that are shown are confusing in the current format- significance bars would need revision.</p><p>– Line 403: Misspelled &quot;wound&quot; (sentence says delayed would healing).</p><p>– Line 487- avoid definitive statements given small N ◊ &quot;confirming that exosomes&quot;.</p><p>– Line 488 sentence needs to be clarified, is it: control in comparison to PBS control?</p><p>– Figure 7: caption states that data is shown as mean+/- SEM though error bars are not shown. Panel B, scale at the bottom right corner is difficult to visualize. Maybe extend from 100um to 1000um with tick marks every 100um.</p><p>– With regards to figure 7 (and falling back on the fact that exosomes may contain similar or dissimilar content between IPF and controls)- can a comment be made on why control exosome skin does not heal? Though the difference in % healing is significantly greater than IPF exosomes, there is still a substantial impairment in wound healing.</p><p>– Line 502: measured is misspelled.</p><p>– U-IPFexo micro-RNA expression/MMP9 activity paragraph- Was the method for micro-RNA extraction from tissue described in the methods/supplement?</p><p>– Line 507: Why would cell-specific exosomal micro-RNA content be less heterogenous than circulating/urine (excreted) exosomal micro-RNA content? Given that urine exosomes are unlikely to come from a single source would there not be more heterogeneity in urine?</p><p>– Tables 4 and 5 are difficult to interpret because significance symbols and text blend together.</p><p>– Is the corresponding experiment for Table 4 in mouse lung, human lung, both? Clarify.</p><p>– Line 511-514: Conclusion regarding miR-34 does not seem to be consistent with what is shown in Table 4. Table 4 demonstrates a relative upregulation after urine exo versus a relative and seemingly significant downregulation with myofibroblast exo (though this is labeled as &quot;NS&quot;). Similarly, conclusions relating to miR-142 seem to be discrepant and seemingly significant based on the table data. Would recommend that MWU -tests for this data be revised. Can these discordant relationships be commented on?</p><p>– Line 532: Needs a period between the closing parenthesis and Bleo to start the sentence.</p><p>– Bleomycin + Control exosomes seem to have a protective effect against fibrosis, is this because of the different cell lines (myofibroblasts vs fibroblasts- with fibroblasts providing regenerative properties to the tissue?)</p><p>– Line 529- in terms of body weight what can be said about non-cf bronchiectasis mice losing at least as much body weight as IPFexo mice (again in reference to are the non-cf bronchiectasis mice exosomes carrying &quot;inflammatory&quot; cargo).</p><p>– Can a comment be made on the discrepancy between miR-142 in the punch biopsy experiment and the in vivo experiments? In the punch experiment miR-142 remains at stable levels whereas in the in vivo experiment it is decreased.</p><p>– Table 5. If ANOVA was performed a post hoc analyses (Tukey) would likely be more suitable.</p><p>– For the in vivo experiment: are these data concordant with myofibroblast/fibroblast derived exosome administration? It seems that this would be a relevant experiment to show that there is concordance between urine and cell-specific profibrotic changes.</p><p>– Discussion will likely need revision with changes. In line 704- again there is a definitive statement which should be avoided given small N.</p><p>Drs. Glassberg and Elliot provided a novel exosome source-urine derived exosome, from IPF and non-IPF patients, as well as controls, as one of the intervention agents to verify their previous reported pro-fibrotic miRNAs by using the skin and lung tissue models in this manuscript. It's also the first time to report the comparison of the contents of exosomes from different sources.</p><p>In this manuscript, they reported that the similar lung fibrotic specific markers(miRNAs) expression pattern was observed from both the serum and urine, suggested that the dysregulated miRNAs can be detected systematically, outside of lung. Therefore, the urine derived exosome can potentially be used as biomarkers to define the disease of IPF, meaningful for the noninvasive diagnosis at the early stage, as well as for the prognosis with the molecular level phenotyping the disease of IPF.</p><p>Based on the data driven hypothesis, in brief, the &quot;disease&quot; exosomes transport dysregulated miRNAs, into circulating system, which could be responsible for the fibrotic lung tissue, and involved in the development and progression of fibrosis, they designed a systematic workflow to obtain, validate, distribute the dysregulated miRNAs from the fibrotic and control subjects, and then verify their hypothesis on both lung and skin models. The application of in vivo bio-distribution, along with the other robust molecular analyses supports the conclusion solidly. No doubt, it deserves to be published.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79543.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall the paper was nicely written and the experiments were carefully designed to support their aims.

We have included a flow diagram for ease of understanding the study design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 123: A reference should be provided to specify the criteria used to determine IPF.</p></disp-quote><p>A reference has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– With regard to the IPF group and the potential to use the urine-derived exosomes as future biomarkers of IPF it would be ideal if Table 1 reports % predicted PFT values (spirometry and DLCO) and it would also be ideal for extent of fibrosis to be reported to gain understanding of disease severity. Since the determination of fibrosis depended on radiologic UIP pattern, there should be more than 1 radiologist interpretation and concordance ascertained (this would allow further substantiation given the small N). What was the time interval between PFT/CT-scan and sample collection for research? Were other causes of UIP pattern in these presumed IPF patients excluded (for instance CT-ILD, often secondary to rheumatoid arthritis , presents with a radiologic UIP pattern)? The importance of this exclusion lies on systemic vs pulmonary specific disease, it is common to think of IPF as a pulmonary only disease whereas RA is a systemic inflammatory disease with joint predominance, as such if the presence of these alternate causes is not excluded it can confound the conclusion that urine exosomes reflect a pulmonary centric disease.</p></disp-quote><p>Scans were typically read close to the time of urine collection prior to clinic appointment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What were the cell markers to ascertain fibroblasts? The cited study (Elliot 2019) only provides information on myofibroblasts. As stated in the major comments, the question of fibroblast vs myofibroblast validity as a comparison arises from the consideration that it would be unexpected for cells with different transcriptional programs to confer the same cargo to exosomes- with this being said, a high-throughput experiment assessing differences in exosomal cargo between the cell types may prove/disprove this given that the preselected micro-RNAs may not be fully representative of the full exosomal cargo.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed immunohistochemistry on the cells using αSMC actin and vimentin antibodies. Since we only expect to see expression of αSMC in “activated” fibroblasts, we used that as our criteria. The authors agree that for this initial pilot investigation we preselected a group of miRNAs that were known to be dysregulated in the lungs, serum of patients with IPF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The methods section would likely benefit from section reordering or providing reference to future sections to allow there to be a better understanding of the workflow. For instance, line 162 as written does not make sense given that it states: &quot;exosomes were injected into the lung punch …in a volume of 100uL.&quot; It is not until line 200 that it becomes apparent that these are mixed in with the nanoparticles. Other instances require clarification throughout the methods (where do the human lung samples come from? – not mentioned until the Results section, etc.)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments and have updated the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The human lung samples are mentioned to be obtained from trauma patient explants, were these patients previously healthy or were the lungs &quot;primed&quot; for fibrotic processes from underlying disease/or were they diseased and only histologically normal sites utilized?</p></disp-quote><p>None of the lung samples were obtained from patients with underlying comorbidities in their medical records or in imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 199- &quot;Experiments&quot; is misspelled.</p><p>– Line 279: clarify, does this line refer to &quot;bleomycin&quot; naïve control mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that clarification has been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Histology: Ashcroft scoring would benefit from interpretation from various pathologists and concordance assessment given the small N.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that future studies should utilize multiple pathologists requiring samples being sent to other mouse pathologists. Samples were read by a mouse pathologist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Table 1 is missing demographic characteristics that may play a role (such as race) and clinical characteristics such as treatment or lack thereof of with antifibrotics. With regards to the asthma and non-cf bronchiectasis groups- were these obtained when patients were flaring or not flaring? In the case of the non-cf bronchiectasis group if a flare was present this could in part explain the effects observed in the mice (weight decreased even more than in the IPFexo administration group).</p></disp-quote><p>Table 1 has been updated. The samples were obtained from patients with stable non-flaring disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 356: the statement is too broad knowing that more than the preselected micro-RNAs are carried in these exosomes. Equivalence can only refer to the micro-RNAs that were tested in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the paragraph to better reflect the select miRNAs that we have chosen to investigate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2: where is the data pertaining to expression of micro-RNA 34 and 142 that become featured micro-RNAs in the latter experiments? What led to the variability in sample numbers/replicates? Figure 2E, what individuals were selected to show equivalent miRNA expression (with the variable replicates/samples in the prior panels) it makes it difficult to draw conclusions- were these selected as a convenience sample, randomly, etc. Moreover, it seems like some subjects are missing from the comparison (some points on the scatter are lacking- this may be from overlap and the &quot;jitter&quot; in Graphpad can be adjusted to show all data points). Also, the statistic here may not be the most appropriate this seems like it calls for a paired-sample assessment rather than and MWU test (i.e Wilcoxon signed rank test for non-normal data). This applies to other instances of paired assessments as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The comparison of urine vs serum was performed on the samples that we obtained initially from clinic patients. Further collection of urines did not always include serum collection. Figure 2 has been revised to show only single samples that were processed. In some cases, urine samples were aliquoted, frozen and variability assessed in several of the frozen aliquots. Those duplicates were removed from the graphs. The authors agree that paired sample testing should be used for urine vs serum data. This has been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 375- missing the word &quot;in&quot;: exosomes were located IN the lung.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Supplemental Figure 1: because 3 mice were used in each condition it would be best to show all 3 data points for each condition at the various time points. A mean value between three data points is not sufficient to show differences given that the variability can be high (ie. 49,50,51) have a mean value of 50, while 0,50,100 would also have a mean value of 50. Panel B caption text refers to both 30 min and 48 hour timepoints but the figure only shows data for 30min timepoint. What does the label &quot;IPF 178&quot; refer to in Panel B?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors have corrected the results and figure and added three time points on the graphs</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 405: please clarify, not imaged or not visualized in TEM. Seems that this is showing the absence of collagen deposition is just as relevant to controls as is showing the presence of collagen in U-IPFexo given that a potential causality (or proof of) is sought by these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that punch biopsy cannot be used for quantification of collagen deposition in the matrix therefore we have modified the sentence in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 426-427: is an interesting hypothesis linking exosomal cargo to deficiencies in surfactant and AECs that are thought to contribute to fibrotic mechanisms. However, no comment is made on the effect of myofibroblast/fibroblast derived exosomes that are shown in Figure 5E. Are there conclusions to be drawn from these stains as well?</p></disp-quote><p>The figure demonstrates comparable results in both populations of exosomes supporting their origin from the same disease background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– With regards to U-IPFexo on human lung punches -&gt; there is mention of collagen and integrin being assessed- however, it seems that this is not commented on, what effect did U-IPF exosomes have on collagen and integrin.</p></disp-quote><p>We were limited in our ability to show the effect on human lung due to the amount of lung tissue available. Therefore, we completed those experiments using mouse lung.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6- also needs better labeling, for concordance- where is the ERa response to myofibroblast/fibroblast exosomes? Again, there seems to be variability in replicates (how many human lung replicates?, mouse replicates are provided but variable…why the variability?), also if only 2 replicates were assessed individual points and not bar plots with error bars should be shown. Figure 6 caption/labeling do not seem to be consistent- needs revision, axis titles need revision. For visualization purposes- data/replicate summary in caption makes interpretation difficult, some of the caption can be moved to the figure panels themselves, to show pertinent data for each experiment. MWU tests need to be clarified as pairwise comparisons given that the significance bars that are shown are confusing in the current format- significance bars would need revision.</p></disp-quote><p>The figures and legend have been edited per the reviewer’s comments. Accompanying Supplementary files and a new graph were added for urine exosome and ERα expression response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 403: Misspelled &quot;wound&quot; (sentence says delayed would healing).</p><p>– Line 487- avoid definitive statements given small N ◊ &quot;confirming that exosomes&quot;.</p><p>– Line 488 sentence needs to be clarified, is it: control in comparison to PBS control?</p></disp-quote><p>The above corrections have been made in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7: caption states that data is shown as mean+/- SEM though error bars are not shown.

Though the difference in % healing is significantly greater than IPF exosomes, there is still a substantial impairment in wound healing.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that wounds treated with the control exosomes did not achieve complete healing.

Given that urine exosomes are unlikely to come from a single source would there not be more heterogeneity in urine?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors are not trying to suggest that the cargo of urine vs fibroblast exosomes are more or less heterogenous than each other. It is likely that there is heterogeneity in urine derived exosomes as well. However, the fibroblasts utilized in this investigation may also reflect heterogeneity in populations that have been isolated from populations of cells even within a fibroblastic foci as discussed by Tsuki et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Tables 4 and 5 are difficult to interpret because significance symbols and text blend together.</p></disp-quote><p>The tables have been edited and the authors thank the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is the corresponding experiment for Table 4 in mouse lung, human lung, both?

This has been clarified in the title of the table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 511-514: Conclusion regarding miR-34 does not seem to be consistent with what is shown in Table 4. Table 4 demonstrates a relative upregulation after urine exo versus a relative and seemingly significant downregulation with myofibroblast exo (though this is labeled as &quot;NS&quot;). Similarly, conclusions relating to miR-142 seem to be discrepant and seemingly significant based on the table data. Would recommend that MWU -tests for this data be revised. Can these discordant relationships be commented on?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors agree that we would expect the results from mouse lung punches to be similar regardless of the origin of the-exosomes. We have reanalyzed the data using MWU and found that the data for miR-142 is not significant. There was an input error for miR-34a, and the table has been edited as such, however the data is not significant. The reason for the difference between urine and fibroblast derived exosome outcomes is unclear and will require analysis with more data points. We are preparing to perform more experiments with human lung to determine differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 532: Needs a period between the closing parenthesis and Bleo to start the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Bleomycin + Control exosomes seem to have a protective effect against fibrosis, is this because of the different cell lines (myofibroblasts vs fibroblasts- with fibroblasts providing regenerative properties to the tissue?)</p></disp-quote><p>The authors acknowledge that there may be some “beneficial” effect of those exosomes, and it is tempting to suggest some regenerative properties. These and other important mechanisms are currently being explored in our laboratory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 529- in terms of body weight what can be said about non-cf bronchiectasis mice losing at least as much body weight as IPFexo mice (again in reference to are the non-cf bronchiectasis mice exosomes carrying &quot;inflammatory&quot; cargo).</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that non-cf bronchiectasis derived exosomes carry an inflammatory cargo as they are continuously infected.
