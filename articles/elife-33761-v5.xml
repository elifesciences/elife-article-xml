The preference of mammalian cells to repair Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks via error-prone end-joining pathways rather than via homology-directed repair mechanisms, however, leads to relatively low rates of precise editing from donor DNA. Here we show that spatial and temporal co-localization of the donor template and Cas9 via covalent linkage increases the correction rates up to 24-fold, and demonstrate that the effect is mainly caused by an increase of donor template concentration in the nucleus. Enhanced correction rates were observed in multiple cell types and on different genomic loci, suggesting that covalently linking the donor template to the Cas9 complex provides advantages for clinical applications where high-fidelity repair is desired.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33761.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genome editing allows scientists to change an organism’s genetic information by adding, replacing or removing sections of its DNA sequence. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a genome-editing tool that has had a large impact on biological research in recent years, and also shows promise for the treatment of patients with genetic disorders.</p><p>The tool works as follows: a small piece of RNA (a close cousin to DNA) is used to guide an enzyme called the Cas9 endonuclease to the desired region of the genome. Then, like a pair of molecular scissors, the enzyme cuts the DNA, breaking both strands of its double helix. The cell naturally starts to repair the damaged DNA, and one way to do this is to use another similar piece of intact DNA as a template. Scientists can exploit this repair mechanism (known as homology-directed repair) by giving the cell extra DNA that carries their desired sequence change, with the hope that the cell will use it as a template and edit its own genome in precisely the same way. However, it turns out that mammalian cells rarely use the template DNA to repair the damage. Instead, mammals tend to fix double-stranded breaks in DNA by simply joining the broken ends together, a method that is prone to errors.</p><p>To overcome this specific issue, Savic, Ringnalda et al. tested the effect of physically linking the template DNA to the Cas9 enzyme, so that the DNA was already nearby when the enzyme made the cut. Experiments with human cells confirmed that this new approach increased the frequency of homology-directed repair up to 24-fold compared to leaving the enzyme and the template DNA separate. Improving the CRISPR-Cas9 system in this manner makes it more likely that genome editing may one day become a routine treatment for patients with genetic disorders. But first, more preclinical studies are needed to assess the safety of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology for gene editing in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>gene editing</kwd><kwd>homology-directed repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PMPDP3_171388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savic</surname><given-names>Natasa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_160230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwank</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_149393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007204</institution-id><institution>Vallee Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Linking the DNA repair template to the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex enhances homology-directed repair of the induced DNA double strand break.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a versatile genome-editing tool that enables the introduction of site-specific genetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). In its most widespread variant a programmable chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) directs the Cas9 nuclease to the genomic region of interest, where it generates a site-specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mali et al., 2013</xref>). In mammalian cells the repair of DSBs by different end-joining (EJ) pathways, such as classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ), alternative non-homologous end-joining (a-NHEJ), or single-strand annealing (SSA) often leads to the formation of insertions or deletions (indels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ceccaldi et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, when a donor template is provided, mammalian cells can also resolve DSBs via homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms, such as the classical homologous recombination (HR) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mao et al., 2008</xref>) and the Fanconi Anemia (FA) repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Richardson, 2017</xref>). While the formation of indels allows the elimination of gene function, repair from an ectopic donor oliogonucleotide (oligo) via HDR mechanisms enables the introduction of DNA modifications with single base pair precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van den Bosch et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Therapeutic applications of CRISPR-Cas9 generally require the precise correction of pathogenic mutations using donor templates. However, DSBs introduced in mammalian cells are predominantly repaired by error-prone EJ pathways. As the resulting indels inhibit the CRISPR-Cas9 complex from retargeting the locus, error-prone repair indirectly competes with HDR, and therefore reduces the rates of precise correction from donor templates. Furthermore, if the targeted allele is a hypomorph with residual gene function, the generated indels can further worsen the clinical phenotype of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu et al., 2015</xref>). In recent years, several attempts have therefore been made to enhance HDR-mediated correction of CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs from donor oligos. Based on the knowledge that HDR pathways are primarily active during the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, cells have been synchronized prior to CRISPR-Cas9 delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lin et al., 2014a</xref>), and Cas9 expression has been limited to the S/G2/M phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gutschner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Howden et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies have increased HDR by chemically modulating the EJ and HDR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maruyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Song et al., 2016</xref>), and by rationally designing DNA repair templates with optimal homology arm lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, it has been proposed that the availability of the DNA repair template might present a rate-limiting factor for HDR, and that enhancing the local concentration of donor oligos could increase the correction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ruff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carlson-Stevermer et al., 2017</xref>). Based on this hypothesis, we here generated and tested novel CRISPR-Cas9 variants, in which the DNA repair template is covalently conjugated to Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33761.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the workflow for linking the DNA repair template to the Cas9 RNP complex.</title><p><italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine (BG)-labeled DNA oligos are covalently linked to Cas9-SNAP fusion proteins.

In brief, the reporter cassette was stably integrated in HEK293T cells, and expresses a green fluorescent protein (GFP) that is preceded by an inactive mutant version of a red fluorescent protein (mutRFP). While precise correction of the mutation via HDR from donor templates leads to re-activation of RFP activity, the generation of frame shifts via error-prone EJ pathways leads to loss of GFP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>). The correction and indel formation events can be visualized by fluorescence imaging and quantified by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>). To test the functionality of the reporter system, and to determine the optimal length of DNA repair templates, we first transfected Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and single stranded (ss) oligo repair templates of different lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>), we found that maximal DSB correction rates are reached with ss-donor oligos of approximately 80 bases. We therefore continued our study with 81-nucleotide (81-mers) ss-donor oligos but also included 65-nucleotide (65-mers) oligos, as we reasoned that if repair templates are brought in proximity to DSBs also shorter homology arms could be sufficient for HDR.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33761.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fluorescent reporter system for high-throughput analysis of DSB repair rates.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic overview of the HEK293T fluorescent reporter system. The RFP fluorophore carries a c.190_191delinsCT mutation that substitutes two nucleotides TA at the positions 190 and 191 in the RFP sequence to CT. This leads to the inactivation the RFP fluorophore by the substitution of tyrosine at the position 63 with leucine (p.Y63L). Repair of the mutation via donor oligos generates RFP/GFP double positive cells; indel mutations generate RFP/GFP double negative cells if they induce a frame shift. Of note, analysis of the reporter locus by next generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrated that 20 percent of indels did not lead to a frame shift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Nevertheless, although FACS analysis thereby underestimates the absolute number of edited cells, it allows to accurately compare the correction efficiencies of different Cas9 systems. ‘X’ labels the mutation in RFP. 2A stands for 2A ‘self-cleaving’ peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).

To avoid the interchange of sgRNAs between both complexes, we designed a two-component system in which the DSB is induced by <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, and the repair template is linked to a catalytically inactive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>Sa</italic>)dCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). We co-transfected both complexes into the reporter cell line, and quantified correction and indel formation rates. Notably, the correction efficiency increased from 4.1% to 29.9% with 65-mers, and from 11.6% to 32.3% with 81-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>), confirming our previous results with the RNPD system.</p><p>In vivo, the delivery efficiency of RNPs and oligos is generally lower than in vitro. Thus, if the repair template is not bound to Cas9, there is a substantial probability that only one of the two components would be delivered into the cell. In addition, at lower transfection efficiencies fewer repair templates are present in the nucleus, potentially decreasing HDR rates. As we presumed that linking the donor oligo to Cas9 should largely alleviate these limitations, we investigated whether the repair efficiency with template-conjugated Cas9 is affected when complexes are transfected at 5-fold lower concentrations. Importantly, although under these conditions the correction efficiencies were generally lower with both coupled and uncoupled Cas9 complexes, the difference between the two systems was however even more pronounced. Compared to the uncoupled RNP complex, the RNPD system yielded 20-fold and a 4-fold increases in repair efficiency with 65-mer and 81-mer repair template oligos, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>). Similarly, the two-component RNP-RNPD system led to a 21-fold increase with 65-mers and a 6-fold increase with 81-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that linking the repair template to the Cas9 complex leads to improved correction efficiency compared to the unlinked control CRISPR-Cas9 system, and that this effect is even more pronounced when CRISPR-Cas9 components are delivered at lower concentrations.</p><p>Next, we aimed to gain mechanistic insight into the processes that lead to enhanced correction rates when the donor oligo is linked to the Cas9 complex. We first assessed if the BG-labelling of the donor oligo itself already influences the correction efficiencies, and compared the correction rates of wild-type <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 lacking the SNAP-tag together with either unlabelled oligo or BG-labelled oligo. While the correction rates were enhanced when the donor oligo was labelled with BG, the increase was several fold lower compared to the system where the oligo was conjugated to the Cas9 RNP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>). We then investigated if the observed improvement in correction efficiency is due to the donor oligo being brought in close proximity to the DSB, or if it is sufficient to direct the donor oligo to the nucleoplasm. We therefore again employed the two-component system with DSB inducing <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 and catalytically inactive <italic>Sa</italic>dCas9 conjugated to the donor oligo. While in one group <italic>Sa</italic>dCas9 was complexed with a sgRNA that directs it in close proximity to the DSB, in the other group the sgRNA was omitted and <italic>Sa</italic>dCas9 was therefore only directed into the nucleus. Importantly, our results demonstrated that adding the sgRNA did not further enhance correction rates, suggesting that the increase of donor oligo concentration in the nucleoplasm was sufficient to fully account for the positive effect of the Cas9-donor oligo conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2d,e</xref>). In line with these observations, a number of previous studies demonstrated that exogenous DNA transport into the nucleus is one of the major barriers to effective gene delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Subramanian et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zanta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aronsohn and Hughes, 1998</xref>).</p><p>To validate our results from the HEK293T reporter cells, we next tested our approach at different endogenous genomic loci and in different cell types. We first targeted the human beta globin (HBB) locus in the K562 cell line, and analyzed correction and editing frequencies using next generation sequencing (NGS). The mean correction efficiency with the RNPD system was 19.6%, which represented a 17-fold increase compared to the control RNP system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Next we targeted the Rosa26 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) locus in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).

To also directly compare the engineered RNPD system to the classical CRISPR-Cas9 system, we performed experiments where we used wild-type Cas9 with the uncoupled donor oligos as a control. We first targeted the fluorescent reporter locus and analyzed it by NGS. We found that while the mean percentage of corrected loci increased from 0.8% with the classical Cas9 system to 4.9% with the RNPD system, the number of incorrectly edited loci slightly decreased from 12.6% to 9.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>).

Compared to genetically encoded systems, RNPs avoid the danger of genomic integration, and due to their limited lifetime, the risk of off-target activities is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, procedures for large-scale production of recombinant proteins for clinical use are well established, and several recently developed protocols enable in vivo delivery of Cas9 RNP complexes in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zuris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Staahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we present a method where we enhance correction efficiency of Cas9-induced DSBs by conjugating the donor oligo to the Cas9 complex. Our data suggests that the increase in HDR efficiency is caused by enhanced nuclear concentration of the repair template. Unlike previous approaches that increase HDR rates by chemically modulating DNA repair pathways, our approach does not alter endogenous cellular processes, thus reducing risk of potential negative side effects. In addition, covalent linkage of the repair template to the Cas9 RNP complex also addresses another central challenge of in vivo gene editing therapies – namely that simultaneous delivery of the RNP complex and the repair template needs to be ensured. Taken together, we suggest that covalently linking the DNA repair template to the Cas9 RNP complex is poised to further drive the CRISPR/Cas technology towards clinical translation.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Generation of CRISPR-Cas9 complexes with covalently bound repair templates is described in more detail at Bio-protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Savić et al., 2019</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant protein <break/>(<italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>)</td><td><italic>Sp</italic>Cas9-SNAP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Schwank and Jinek lab</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant protein <break/>(<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Sa</italic>dCas9-SNAP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Schwank and Jinek lab</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent</td><td>NH2-modified oligo</td><td>Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td>-</td><td>Custom DNA oligos/ '5 C6 <break/>NH2 modif.</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>BG-GLA-NHS</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>ID_NEB:S9151S</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-Supplementary Tables 1–6 for a list of the DNA sequences used in this manuscript.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>All plasmids used in this study (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-Supplementary Table 6) have been deposited for the TULIPs system, along with maps and sequences, in Addgene.</p><p>Cloning of pNS19-LV-mutRFP-2A-GFP: pEGIP (addgene plasmid #26777) was mutagenized using QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) to destroy the start codon of eGFP.

The strategy relies on the assumption that enhancing the spatial proximity or local concentration of DNA used as template for HR would increase the use of this pathway. This is achieved by generating covalently coupled Cas9-oligonucleotide. The increased efficiency of HR observed could be interesting for some applications.</p><p>The experiments are well designed and presented. However several aspects require clarifications as indicated below. Although the increased efficiency of HR is convincing the interpretation is open to several alternatives (i.e. proximity of oligo or stability of oligo). Two additional experiments could clarify this important point.</p><p>1) Figure 2A. The figure should be understandable with help of the legend and several pieces of information are missing:</p><p>What is 2A ? What is c.190_191delinsCT? (Use a more generic term; specific construct name can be provided in Materials and methods).</p><p>I assume the “X” labels the mutation and/or the Cas9 DSB?</p><p>I assume the mutant RFP is a substitution?</p><p>One needs to see exactly where the substitution is, where the guide maps and where the DSB is introduced and whether the guide would still be able to induce Cas9 cleavage after HR (is the PAM mutated?). One reason is that depending on where the DSB is, more or less end processing will be needed for HR.</p><p>2) Figure 2B lower panel (IF): indicate the channels used. Most of the cells seem to be GFP negative in the central panel. How could this be as the FACS indicate 16%? Single channels and overlays should be provided.</p><p>What is the percentage of GFP positive among the RFP positive cells? (Close to 100% expected).</p><p>It should be noted that the% of edited cells is underestimated since in frame indels (one third ?) can generate a GFP positive cell.</p><p>3) Figure 3A. Explain the lane no BG coupling?</p><p>4) Figure 4. The same data should not be plotted twice in panel B and C: Panel C should be removed (same comment for Figure 4F and G).</p><p>The main question about the use of <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 is to determine whether the difference with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 is statistically significant. The tests should be performed (Figure 4E, between RNPD coup and RNP-RNPD coup) and if not significant the conclusions should be revised.</p><p>A map showing the positions of the different <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 guides used (1 to 4) should be shown.</p><p>5) Two experiments are required to describe the effect observed: In order to know if the effect observed is due to coupling the oligo to Cas9, a control should be performed with the oligo coupled to BG but not to Cas9. Clearly at least part of the effect observed could be due to stabilization of the oligo rather than proximity to DSB per say. To distinguish these possibilities the authors should test an oligo coupled to <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 but without the corresponding guide.</p><p>I assume <italic>S. aureus</italic> was used such as to design a distinct guide specific for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and not bound by <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, if so, this should be explained in the text.</p><p>6) Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>What is the interpretation for the decrease of percentage of edited cells with oligo coupled to <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 ? (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>Legend of Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D: RNP-RNP unco is grey but should be hatched grey box.</p><p>7) Two-tailed tests should be used not one-tailed since there is no reason to assume a priori that the coupled protein would be more efficient.</p><p>8) Subsection “Expression and purification of Cas9-SNAP”, missing word: &quot;The was further purified…&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors show that covalent linkage of the DNA repair template to the CRISPR/Cas9 complex enhances HDR efficiency. They conclude this based on the use of a traffic light HDR reporter system, transiently transfected into HEK293 cells.</p><p>Although this is interesting and aspects of the study are really clever (e.g. the use of the sa-dCAS9 linked template to prove that physical proximity is the key), the work strikes me as quite preliminary as the increases are only shown in this transient reporter system using only one target site.</p><p>Without more thorough testing of the improvement in a real experimental system, I can't recommend acceptance of this study in its current form at <italic>eLife</italic>. My recommendations to improve the impact of this publication would be to demonstrate real efficiency improvements using a targeted edit within a genomic target site. In this respect, the existing work using transient reporter system would be excellent preliminary data for a real proof-of-concept – namely the increased efficiency in a real experimental genome engineering project e.g. to create a point mutation.</p><p>In addition, the CRISPR field has been populated by numerous claims showing positive perturbations to shift the balance of repair pathway from NHEJ to HDR (alterations in experimental design, NHEJ inhibitors, etc.). Frequently these claims have been made on the basis of data from manipulation of a single target site. Reproducibility of these studies has proven to be low, as when applied by other labs at different target sites, the reported improvements are frequently not replicated. To avoid this occurring, I would recommend that the authors address several different genomic target sites and report the level of improvement in HDR seen in these various experimental settings.</p><p>Figure 4E presents data which suggests that the positioning of the sgRNA (and hence the DSB) away from the target nucleotide to be mutated (0 bp, 52 bp, 61 bp, 83 bp and 128bp) has little influence on the correction efficiency. This is significantly at odds with experimental data from genomic target sites, and should be discussed. In addition, I wonder whether this is a curious artefact of using transient plasmids and thus provides support for my recommendation of addressing a single copy genomic target site or sites to validate their approach in a real experimental setting.</p><p>The work is very similar to a recent bioRxiv report by Janet Rossant's group (https://doi.org/10.1101/204339) who demonstrated that covalent attachment of the repair template to the CRISPR/Cas9 complex enhanced HDR rates, reporting data from fluorescent cassette insertions at 5 genomic target sites. Although this paper hasn't been peer reviewed, it's tempting to speculate that the authors of this manuscript have submitted what is essentially a preliminary study to <italic>eLife</italic> to compete with this more thorough study, which is presumably in review at another journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Gene targeting constitutes a promising approach for the generation of novel biological models and for future gene therapy strategies. The capacity to generate targeted cleavage by the CRISPR-CAS9 system raised many hopes. However, targeted gene replacement still remains to too low levels. In the present work the authors design a strategy aiming at delivering the correcting DNA in the vicinity of the cleaved site. They covalently bound the correction oligonucleotide to the CAS9 itself via &quot;click chemistry&quot;, using the SNAP-tag technology. Then they assemble in vitro the complex with the RNA-guide and transfected cells (HEK293). This strategy is elegant and promising. However, many concerns should be addressed.</p><p>The main problem is the fact that the authors used only on system to monitor HR; and that the designing of this substrate is based on wrong considerations on HR and NHEJ.</p><p>It is claimed that NHEJ is error-prone. This is wrong. There are two kinds of end-joining processes, the canonical NHEJ (which is not error-prone, but conservative) and the Alternative end-joining (alt-NHEJ, MMEJ, B-NHEJ), which is mutagenic and error-prone. Therefore mutagenic repair does not automatically imply NHEJ. Second it is said in the Introduction that HR and NHEJ directly compete. This is also wrong; in fact things happen in two phases: first competition between cNHEJ and single-strand DNA resection, second on resected DNA extremities, competition between HR and alternative end-joining. Finally, HR can also generate mutagenesis. Therefore many concerns exist on the strategy used here (which is the sole assay used) because mutagenic repair can arise by many other processes than NHEJ.</p><p>Moreover, is correction with oligonucleotides (65, 81 b) an actual HR mechanism? This is not consistent with concept of MEPS.</p><p>The authors should first genetically validate their reporter system, in cells mutated for HR or NHEJ.</p><p>The authors should also verify their strategy with natural endogenous target sequences, instead of the reporter.</p><p>There are no data on the transfection efficiency. Especially, comparing the CAS9 with the engineered one.</p><p>Similarly, does the two CAS9 cleave with similar efficiency?</p><p>Does the modification of the CAS9 affect its cleavage specificity?</p><p>Are there any off-target effects? (off-target cleavage, off-target integration of the oligo).</p><p>The authors should test different RNA guides for a common target.</p><p>The author should test different cell lines.</p><p>It is not clear what is actually measured. Where are the mutagenic repair (pseudo-NHEJ) measurements? Is it the frequency of HDR or the ratio HDR/pseudo-NHEJ?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Covalent linkage of the DNA repair template to the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease enhances homology-directed repair&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors provide convincing answers to all reviewers' comments. Importantly, the authors show that the main improvement achieved by their experimental approach is due to enhanced targeting of the oligonucleotides to the nucleus rather that its targeting to the specific target genomic site. This could also be highlighted in the Abstract.</p><p>A few points need to be clarified:</p><p>1) Source data 6 refers to Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (not 3?) should be registered as Figure 4—source data 3.</p><p>2) Source data 5 refers to Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (not 2?) should be registered as Figure 4—source data 2.</p><p>3) Figure 2B requires clarification (and in the legend as well). Legend says &quot;the mutation substitutes… CT.. to TA&quot;. This is ambiguous because TA is wild type. It would clarify to draw in Figure 2, the wild type and mutated genomic sequences (with the codon substitution) and the sequence of the guide (also can be confusing as drawn because the guide has CT not TA).</p><p>4) Figure 5: In Figure 5, only the reference is shown. Mutated variant should be indicated. For instance, on 5A, at HBB, the DNA sequence shown should be the one after correction (to be consistent with Figure.2B) ? However it is identical to guide sequence?</p><p>Please explain the correction efficiency values, obtained after correction for transfection efficiency? If so, provide transfection efficiencies, otherwise read data from Supplementary file 2 cannot be understood: i.e. 27% at Rosa 26, how was this obtained? In addition, since no HR reads is detected at Rosa26 (why is this?), the authors should comment in the main text on the difference uncoupled/coupled from Figure 5B for this locus.</p><p>5) Figure 6A requires clarifications both in the main text and in the presentation of the figure. The authors summarize in one sentence all the NGS data (Results and Discussion, eighth paragraph). There is a lot of data in this analysis and it would be better to present the analysis step by step and not to refer to all panels 6A, B, D, E, F at once. Reporter locus could be presented first, with comments about percentage of corrected reads and other events (legend should explain the nomenclature, for instance -7:7D, and also what are I, II and III: triplicates I assume). Then results at other loci should be briefly discussed (and referred to Supplementary file 2). Also indicate in Supplementary file 2 that the variants called &quot;SNV&quot; are the ones predicted after repair by HR. An interesting information is also the relative proportion of HR versus non HR events. In Figure 6, it seems that this proportion is about 30% in experiment I (5.63/(100-85.19)). Is this correct? It could be discussed in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33761.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major issues raised by the reviewers are:</p><p>- The effect observed with the coupled substrate does not demonstrate that it is due to bringing the oligonucleotide in proximity to the DSB.</p></disp-quote><p>To gain mechanistic insight into the process that leads to an increased correction rate when the donor oligo is coupled to the Cas9 complex, we performed the experiments reviewer 1 suggested. First, we tested if the increased repair rate is caused by BG-labelling of the donor oligo, and compared the editing rates of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 WT together with either unlabelled oligo or BG-labelled oligo (note that <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 WT cannot bind BG-oligos). Although we observed a higher repair rate with the BG-labelled donor oligo, the increase was several fold lower compared to the experiment where the oligo was linked to the Cas9 complex (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-C). Next, we tested if the observed improvement in correction efficiency is due to the donor oligo being brought in close proximity to the DSB, or if it is sufficient to direct the donor oligo to the nucleus. We therefore used our 2-component system (<italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 binds the oligo and <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 generates the DSB) with and without the <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 guide RNA. Our results demonstrate that targeting the donor oligo to the nucleus via <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 fully explains the observed increase in HDR rates (Figure 4G, Figure 4—figure supplement 2D, E). In line with this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated that promoting active transport of plasmid DNA to the nucleus (e.g. by binding plasmids to proteins with a nuclear localisation signal (NLS)) enhances expression of genes located on these plasmids (doi: 10.1517/17425247.1.1.127).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The effect observed should be validated on several genomic target sites, first to extend the observation to a genomic site and second to show the reproducibility of the effect on different targets.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that confirming the results from the initial manuscript by targeting endogenous genomic loci in different cell lines/types is required to proof reproducibility and robustness of the system. For the revised manuscript we therefore targeted five endogenous loci in three different cell types (HEK cells, K562 cells, mESCs). Importantly, next generation sequencing revealed that linking the donor oligo to Cas9 robustly enhanced correction rates in all tested loci and cell types (Figure 5A-C, Figure 6D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The assay used does not allow distinguishing the NHEJ and HR pathways as claimed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>For the revised manuscript we analysed the sequence of the targeted HEK reporter locus as well as other endogenous loci by next generation sequencing (Figure 5A-C, Figure 6A-F). These data allowed us to directly measure the events in which the DNA break was precisely repaired from the donor oligo (e.g. in the reporter locus exchange of two base pairs at the DSB in the RFP fluorophore region), and events in which the DSBs led to indel mutations.</p><p>Nevertheless, as reviewer 3 correctly stated, we always measure DNA repair outcomes (corrections and indels) and not the activities of repair pathways. Since different pathways can trigger indel formation (e.g. c-NHEJ, A-NHEJ, or SSA) or correction from repair templates (e.g. HR or FA repair), it is indeed important to precisely define our wording. In the revised version of the manuscript we discuss this issue in the Introduction, and define homology-directed repair (HDR) as all mechanisms that can repair the locus from the donor oligo sequence, and end-joining (EJ) as all mechanisms that do not use the oligo template for DSB repair.</p><p>Of note, the main goal of our study was to develop a novel method for therapeutic gene editing, in which precise repair of DNA breaks from donor oligos is enhanced. Even though it would be very interesting to decipher which molecular pathways are involved in that process, we believe that this question would go beyond the scope of this study, and rather plan to address these topics in future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The experiments are well designed and presented. However several aspects require clarifications as indicated below.</p><p>Although the increased efficiency of HR is convincing the interpretation is open to several alternatives (i.e. proximity of oligo or stability of oligo). Two additional experiments could clarify this important point. In order to know if the effect observed is due to coupling the oligo to Cas9, a control should be performed with the oligo coupled to BG but not to Cas9. Clearly at least part of the effect observed could be due to stabilization of the oligo rather than proximity to DSB per say. To distinguish these possibilities the authors should test an oligo coupled to SadCas9 but without the corresponding guide.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting these elegant experiments. As explained above (major issue (i)) we performed both experiments, and found that targeting the donor oligo to the nucleus via <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 fully explains the observed increase in HDR rates (Figure 4G, Figure 4—figure supplement 2D, E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure 2A.

The peptide employs ribosome skipping to mediate “cleavage” of polypeptides during translation in eukaryotic cells. In the revised manuscript we included this explanation in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is c.190_191delinsCT?

In the revised version we clarified the term in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I assume the “X” labels the mutation and/or the Cas9 DSB?</p></disp-quote><p>“X” labels the mutation in RFP.

One reason is that depending on where the DSB is, more or less end processing will be needed for HR.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this useful comment. In the revised version we included a map of the locus, which indicates the mutated turboRFP fluorophore sequence as well as the protospacer and PAM motif of the guide RNA (Figure 2B). In short, the mutated region is in the fluorophore domain of turboRFP, and upon correction the protospacer sequence is modified (2 bases at position 1 and 2). Thus, if repaired from the donor oligo, the locus cannot be retargeted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2B lower panel (IF): indicate the channels used. Most of the cells seem to be GFP negative in the central panel. How could this be as the FACS indicate 16%? Single channels and overlays should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version we indicated the channels used for the IF (Figure 2D), and included the single channels next to the overlay images. The IF image is just a representation of how well one can distinguish the cells that have lost GFP and gained RFP in our reporter system. The percentage of the cells that lost GFP cannot be determined from one fluorescent image, since it contains only approximately 100 cells that are grown from a few clones. In FACS analysis we always quantify at least 200.000 cells, thus the data is more accurate, and as seen in our biological replicates very robust. In the revised version we show an IF image that is more representative to the FACS quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the percentage of GFP positive among the RFP positive cells?

In the revised manuscript we illustrated in Figure 2A and described in the figure legend that the percentage of edited cells is underestimated when using FACS analysis as a readout. Importantly, the NGS experiments (Figure 6) allowed us to accurately quantify in-frame and out-of-frame indels. For the mutRFP reporter locus we found that on average 34% of indels are in-frame mutations. Although this leads to an underestimation of the absolute number of edited cells in our FACS reporter assay, it still allows to accurately compare the editing- and repair efficiencies of different Cas systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3A.

The fluorescent reporter system was not transiently transfected, but generated by a single stable integration of the reporter cassette into the genome of HEK293T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without more thorough testing of the improvement in a real experimental system, I can't recommend acceptance of this study in its current form at eLife. My recommendations to improve the impact of this publication would be to demonstrate real efficiency improvements using a targeted edit within a genomic target site. In this respect, the existing work using transient reporter system would be excellent preliminary data for a real proof-of-concept – namely the increased efficiency in a real experimental genome engineering project e.g. to create a point mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, the reporter system was generated by a single stable integration into the genome of HEK293T cells. We nevertheless fully agree with reviewer 2 that analysis of different endogenous loci is necessary to validate our findings (see also our second response to major issues). In the revised manuscript we therefore tested our system in three different cell types on five different genomic loci (Figure 5A-C, Figure 6D-F). Importantly these data fully support our hypothesis that coupling the donor oligo to the Cas9 complex increases repair rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the CRISPR field has been populated by numerous claims showing positive perturbations to shift the balance of repair pathway from NHEJ to HDR (alterations in experimental design, NHEJ inhibitors, etc.). Frequently these claims have been made on the basis of data from manipulation of a single target site. Reproducibility of these studies has proven to be low, as when applied by other labs at different target sites, the reported improvements are frequently not replicated. To avoid this occurring, I would recommend that the authors address several different genomic target sites and report the level of improvement in HDR seen in these various experimental settings.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, in the revised manuscript we reproduced our findings in different cell types and endogenous loci by NGS (Figure 5A-C, Figure 6D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4E presents data which suggests that the positioning of the sgRNA (and hence the DSB) away from the target nucleotide to be mutated (0 bp, 52 bp, 61 bp, 83 bp and 128bp) has little influence on the correction efficiency. This is significantly at odds with experimental data from genomic target sites, and should be discussed. In addition, I wonder whether this is a curious artefact of using transient plasmids and thus provides support for my recommendation of addressing a single copy genomic target site or sites to validate their approach in a real experimental setting.</p></disp-quote><p>Here has been a misunderstanding, and we therefore described the experiment in more detail in the revised version (Figure 4C). The DSB is always generated by the same <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 sgRNA at position 0 from the mutation. 0 bp, 55 bp, 78 bp, 86 bp and 145bp indicates the distances of the different <italic>Sad</italic>Cas9 sgRNAs binding sites from the mutation in the RFP fluorophore (position 0).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work is very similar to a recent bioRxiv report by Janet Rossant's group (https://doi.org/10.1101/204339) who demonstrated that covalent attachment of the repair template to the CRISPR/Cas9 complex enhanced HDR rates, reporting data from fluorescent cassette insertions at 5 genomic target sites. Although this paper hasn't been peer reviewed, it's tempting to speculate that the authors of this manuscript have submitted what is essentially a preliminary study to eLife to compete with this more thorough study, which is presumably in review at another journal.</p></disp-quote><p>In the mentioned report the authors use a Cas9-streptavidin fusion in combination with a biotinylated repair template to recruit the repair template to the editing site. This improves their targeting efficiencies. Since this is a non-covalent attachment system, it has certain disadvantages to the SNAP-tag system, and thus we consider our work complementary to their work. Of note, in our revised manuscript we also analysed several genomic loci in different cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The main problem is the fact that the authors used only on system to monitor HR; and that the designing of this substrate is based on wrong considerations on HR and NHEJ.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, using our reporter system we were able to detect Cas9-induced frame-shift indels (loss of eGFP fluorescence) and corrections from donor templates (activation of RFP). As explained in our third response to major issues, we fully agree with reviewer 3 that different repair pathways could be responsible for indel formation and correction from oligo templates, and we therefore rephrased the text in the revised manuscript accordingly. In the revised manuscript we also used NGS to analyse the repair outcomes in a more direct and precise manner. Of note, our main goal in this study is the enhance precise repair from donor oligos (potentially for future clinical application of CRISPR/Cas), and we are aware that we cannot draw conclusions about the activity of specific molecular repair pathways. Since ss-oligos are more efficient for HDR correction of DSBs than ds-DNA, we also solely focused on ss donor oligos in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is claimed that NHEJ is error-prone. This is wrong. There are two kinds of end-joining processes, the canonical NHEJ (which is not error-prone, but conservative) and the Alternative end-joining (alt-NHEJ, MMEJ, B-NHEJ), which is mutagenic and error-prone. Therefore mutagenic repair does not automatically imply NHEJ.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree, and want to thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. In the revised manuscript we rephrased the text accordingly (see Introduction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second it is said in the Introduction that HR and NHEJ directly compete. This is also wrong; in fact things happen in two phases: first competition between cNHEJ and single-strand DNA resection, second on resected DNA extremities, competition between HR and alternative end-joining. Finally, HR can also generate mutagenesis. Therefore many concerns exist on the strategy used here (which is the sole assay used) because mutagenic repair can arise by many other processes than NHEJ.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with reviewer 3; it is not a direct competition between HDR and NHEJ pathways. We were referring to an indirect effect: Indel mutations disable the CRISPR-Cas9 complex from re-targeting the same locus, and thus precise repair from the donor oligo is no longer possible. We rephrased the text in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, is correction with oligonucleotides (65, 81 b) an actual HR mechanism? This is not consistent with concept of MEPS.</p></disp-quote><p>Again we agree with reviewer 3. In the revised manuscript we define homology-directed repair (HDR) as any repair pathway that uses a donor oligo as a template for the repair. Interestingly a recent study suggests that ss-donor oligos are predominantly used by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) repair pathway (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/136028) rather than the classical homologous recombination (HR) pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should first genetically validate their reporter system, in cells mutated for HR or NHEJ.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially validated the reporter system by quantifying the increase in correction efficiencies between the classical Cas9 system and the Cas9-Geminin system.
