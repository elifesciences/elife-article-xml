As with sex chromosomes such as the mammalian Y, the rearranged version of chromosome two (ZAL2<sup>m</sup>) is in a near-constant state of heterozygosity, offering opportunities to investigate both degenerative and selective processes during the early evolutionary stages of ‘supergenes.’ Here, we generated, synthesized, and analyzed extensive genome-scale data to better understand the forces shaping the evolution of the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes in this species. We found that features of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> are consistent with substantially reduced recombination and low levels of degeneration. We also found evidence that selective sweeps took place both on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and its standard counterpart, ZAL2, after the rearrangement event. Signatures of positive selection were associated with allelic bias in gene expression, suggesting that antagonistic selection has operated on gene regulation. Finally, we discovered a region exhibiting long-range haplotypes inside the rearrangement on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. These haplotypes appear to have been maintained by balancing selection, retaining genetic diversity within the supergene. Together, our analyses illuminate mechanisms contributing to the evolution of a young chromosomal polymorphism, revealing complex selective processes acting concurrently with genetic degeneration to drive the evolution of supergenes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>supergene</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd><kwd>population genomics</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>White-throated sparrow</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-0723805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maney</surname><given-names>Donna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01MH082833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maney</surname><given-names>Donna L</given-names></name><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Soojin V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH102677</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maney</surname><given-names>Donna L</given-names></name><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Soojin V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1656247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maney</surname><given-names>Donna L</given-names></name><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Soojin V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive genomic and population genetic analyses of a non-recombining chromosome in white-throated sparrows reveal the actions of purifying selection, positive selection, and balancing selection, expanding our understanding of supergene evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Supergenes comprise closely linked genetic variants that are maintained due to suppressed recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charlesworth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thompson and Jiggins, 2014</xref>). Their evolution presents an interesting paradox, in that the suppression of recombination that occurs inside supergenes reduces the efficacy of natural selection, leading to genetic degeneration. At the same time, supergenes are associated with dramatically divergent, adaptive phenotypes. These divergent phenotypes, which include classic examples of Batesian mimicry and self-incompatibility in flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charlesworth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thompson and Jiggins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</xref>) and striking polymorphisms in social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martinez-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farrell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Küpper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lamichhaney et al., 2016</xref>), have long inspired both theoretical and empirical studies of their evolution. Recent genome-scale studies have illuminated wide-ranging impacts of supergene evolution on complex phenotypes across diverse taxa (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pearse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hager et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kunte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kess et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lundberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sanchez-Donoso et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Funk et al., 2021</xref>). Currently, the mechanisms by which functionally divergent supergene haplotypes evolve in the face of multiple evolutionary forces remain poorly understood, presenting a critical gap in knowledge.</p><p>One notable example of a supergene associated with social behavior is found in white-throated sparrows (<italic>Zonotrichia albicollis</italic>), in which a large supergene co-segregates with parental behavior and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tuttle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>). White-throated sparrows occur in two alternative plumage morphs, white- and tan-striped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lowther, 1961</xref>). These morphs differ not only in their plumage coloration, but also in their social behavior, with white-striped birds exhibiting increased aggression and more frequent extra-pair copulations, and tan-striped birds engaging in more parental care compared with birds of the white-striped morph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tuttle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horton et al., 2012</xref>). These alternative morphs are linked to a large (~100 Mbp, &gt;1 k genes) rearrangement on the second largest chromosome, called ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, so named because the rearranged chromosome is metacentric. White-striped birds are heterozygous for ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and the sub-metacentric chromosomal arrangement, ZAL2, whereas tan-striped birds are homozygous for ZAL2 (30, 31).</p><p>In addition to highly divergent social behavior, this relatively young supergene (estimated to have arisen 2–3 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huynh et al., 2010</xref>), is also associated with a remarkable disassortative mating system that maintains the ‘balanced’ morph frequencies in the population. Almost all breeding pairs consist of one bird of each morph, earning the species the moniker ‘the bird with four sexes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campagna, 2016</xref>). Breeding pairs consisting of two individuals of the same morph are estimated to occur less than 1% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thorneycroft, 1966</xref>) and only six ZAL2<sup>m</sup> homozygotes (i.e. ‘super-white’ birds) have ever been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thorneycroft, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falls and Kopachena, 2020</xref>) out of thousands of birds karyotyped or genotyped. Given that ZAL2<sup>m</sup> exists in a near-constant state of heterozygosity, it is in a state of suppressed recombination, similar to the Y and W sex chromosomes in mammals and birds, respectively. The suppression of recombination on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> is expected to reduce the efficacy of natural selection, leading to reduced genetic diversity and the degeneration of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton and Charlesworth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlesworth, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, the tight linkage of alleles within the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene may contribute to adaptive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maney et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, this system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of a supergene underlying social and mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sun et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here we aim to better understand the evolutionary forces shaping the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes. Our goal was to address two unanswered questions. First, to what extent has ZAL2<sup>m</sup> degenerated? Early analyses of the rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 2011</xref>) did not show signals of degeneration, such as pseudogenization or the accumulation of repetitive sequences. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref> found a weak signal of excess non-synonymous polymorphism for genes inside the rearranged region on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and reduced allelic expression for ZAL2<sup>m</sup> genes, which could be consistent with functional degradation of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>) similarly found a slightly higher number of non-synonymous substitutions and an increased ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> compared with ZAL2. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>) also found reduced expression of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> alleles in brain tissue, perhaps suggesting that the accumulation of deleterious mutations has led to reduced expression of genes from ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. Their additional finding of reduced accumulation of mutations in functional regions suggested that ZAL2<sup>m</sup> has, in fact, experienced purifying selection to remove deleterious alleles. Thus, while there is some evidence that ZAL2<sup>m</sup> has degenerated, these results have been inconsistent and somewhat inconclusive.</p><p>Second, what are the selective forces shaping the genomic landscapes of both ZAL2 and the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene? The signals of both purifying and positive selection have been relatively weak in previous genomic analyses of ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, by definition, ZAL2<sup>m</sup> must contain variation that underlies the differences between the white- and tan-striped morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fisher, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bull, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rice, 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rice, 1987a</xref>). There is already some evidence that this variation affects behavior; allelic differences in the promoter region of the gene encoding estrogen-receptor alpha (ESR1) are likely to alter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>), and the expression of this gene was shown to be necessary for aggressive behavior typical of the white-striped morph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>). ZAL2<sup>m</sup> is also associated with differential expression of a key neuromodulator, vasoactive intestinal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horton et al., 2020</xref>), known to be causal for aggression in songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Investigations of young heteromorphic sex chromosomes suggest that the accumulation of sexually antagonistic genes (i.e. genes that are beneficial to one sex and harmful to the other) may in fact drive the evolution of sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachtrog, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachtrog, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou and Bachtrog, 2012</xref>). For example, positive selection at a small number of antagonistic alleles was shown to be a potent force shaping evolution of the young Y chromosomes in <italic>Drosophila miranda</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachtrog, 2004</xref>) even in the face of degeneration of other genes elsewhere on the chromosome. In white-throated sparrows, evidence of positive selection on both ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> has been quite limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, the discovery of ZAL2- and ZAL2<sup>m</sup>-specific alleles that benefit the tan- and white-striped morphs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horton et al., 2020</xref>), suggests that antagonistic selection likewise contributes to the evolution of both ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup>.</p><p>In addition to antagonistic selection, balancing selection may be implicated in the evolution of ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. The negative assortative mating system in white-throated sparrows, which maintains the chromosomal polymorphism, is a canonical example of balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huynh et al., 2010</xref>). However, balancing selection is also a way of maintaining advantageous genetic diversity in populations, which may be especially critical in the context of a non-recombining chromosome. Indeed, balancing selection appears to be more common in self-fertilizing (selfing) vs non-selfing species, which are likewise characterized by reduced genetic diversity, increased linkage disequilibrium, and reduced efficacy of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glémin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glémin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delph and Kelly, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaut et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, balancing selection may maintain multiple alleles inside non-recombining regions of chromosomes like ZAL2<sup>m</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have been limited in the extent to which they could test directly for degeneration, adaptive changes on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, and selection at the genome level. These limitations stemmed from low sample sizes of sequencing data, the reduced intraspecies variability, and a low-quality ZAL2<sup>m</sup> assembly that prevented detection of long-range haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>).

We performed whole-genome sequencing of an additional 62 birds (49 white-striped birds and 13 tan-striped birds sampled from a variety of locations around the U.S.) (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). White-striped birds, which are heterozygous for the rearrangement (ZAL2/2<sup>m</sup>), were sequenced at higher coverage than tan-striped birds (ZAL2 homozygotes) so that we could obtain sufficient reads to separate ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> alleles in white-striped individuals (average mean depth coverages were 41.5 × vs 28.4 × for white- and tan-striped birds, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Genomic variants were called according to the guidelines of Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (ver. 4.1) (Materials and methods), leading to the discovery of a total of 11,382,994 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). None of the samples showed evidence of family relationships when we computed relatedness estimates between individuals. Consequently, we used all samples in the subsequent analyses. We found a significantly higher number of polymorphic sites within white-striped birds than tan-striped birds exclusively for ZAL2/2<sup>m</sup> chromosomal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We first performed a <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly of the super-white bird, employing newly generated sequence data, to study the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome with an assembly derived entirely from a bird homozygous for the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome. The total assembly size was 1058 Mbp (N50 length of 3.1 Mbp, longest scaffold 27 Mbps), comparable to that of the ZAL2/2 reference assembly (1052 Mbp, N50 scaffold length of 4.86 Mbp, longest scaffold 45 Mbp) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for more details). There were 160 putatively ZAL2<sup>m</sup>-linked scaffolds (Materials and methods), with a total length (110.99 Mbp) comparable with that of ZAL2-linked scaffolds from the reference assembly (108.5 Mbp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this similarity in total length, however, the average length of the individual ZAL2<sup>m</sup>-linked scaffolds was significantly shorter than scaffolds on other chromosomes in the super-white assembly (p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). It was also shorter than the average scaffold length on the ZAL2 chromosome in the ZAL2/2 reference assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We did not observe such a pattern in the other chromosomes of similar size when comparing between the two assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This result was consistent with the presence of repetitive DNA sequences on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> causing more assembly breaks compared with the ZAL2/2 reference genome. We found evidence that the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome contained more repeat elements and was especially enriched for long terminal repeat elements (2.4 Mbp vs 2.1 Mbp) and interspersed repeats (5.8 Mbp vs 5.5 Mbp), compared with the ZAL2 chromosome. The number of these repeat elements is likely to be underestimated, given that the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> assembly is highly fragmented.

We found that the total number of genetic variants was approximately 12-fold reduced on the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> alleles compared with ZAL2 alleles (29,420 vs 367,466 SNPs and 3,921 vs 32,479 indels on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and ZAL2, respectively, after excluding singleton variants). The mean nucleotide diversity was similarly reduced on the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome compared with the ZAL2 chromosome (0.0104% vs 0.1141% for ZAL2<sup>m</sup> vs ZAL2, respectively).</p><p>Analyses of the genetic variants on the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> alleles showed evidence of only weak genetic degeneration. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous fixed differences inside the rearranged region was slightly, but significantly, elevated for ZAL2<sup>m</sup>-derived compared with ZAL2-derived fixed differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which is consistent with either positive selection or inefficient purifying selection on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. We found that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide diversity (π<sub>N</sub>/π<sub>S</sub>) was significantly increased on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> compared with ZAL2 (p=1.3 × 10<sup>–13</sup>, Mann-Whitney U-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The minor allele site frequency spectrum (SFS) for the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> synonymous and non-synonymous sites showed a large proportion of singleton variants and an irregular decay of allele frequency as the minor allele count increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), also suggesting reduced efficacy of purifying selection on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>.</p><p>Assuming the mutation rates of the two chromosomes are similar, the ratio of effective population size (<italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub>) between the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and ZAL2 can be approximated by the ratio of nucleotide diversity of synonymous sites between the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. The proportion of <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> between ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and ZAL2 is 0.12 (±0.01), which is threefold lower than the expected ratio of 0.33 (because the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome is 1/3 as frequent as the ZAL2, given ‘balanced’ morph frequencies observed in the wild). This lower proportion suggests that <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> has undergone further reduction than expected from the census size in the population, consistent with the effects of reduced recombination. We noted that the linkage disequilibrium between variants on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> exhibited the classic decay with distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), indicating at least some level of recombination. Taken together, these results are consistent with reduced, but not entirely eliminated, recombination on the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome.</p><p>We next examined whether degeneration inside the rearranged region on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> has resulted in globally reduced expression of the alleles carried by the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene variant. To do so, we used multiple large RNAseq datasets from a variety of tissues in birds sampled from different geographic locations and times of year (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As predicted and consistent with what was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), we found evidence of consistently reduced expression of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> alleles in 8/10 types of tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). We next tested for an association between the number of accumulated mutations (non-synonymous, synonymous, and in the promoter region) on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and allelic bias (AB) in expression of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> alleles within each tissue, which would link genetic degeneration within or near genes to reduced expression of ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. We found evidence that allelic bias in gene expression was associated with the rate of non-synonymous fixed differences (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=9.97, p=0.00159), although the effect size was exceedingly small (marginal <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.0020) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Neither the rate of synonymous fixed differences (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=1.0098, p=0.315, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>) nor the number of fixed differences within 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=0.8992, p=0.343, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>) were associated with allelic bias. Thus, the overall reduction in expression of the alleles carried by the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene is weakly associated with an increased number of non-synonymous fixed nucleotide changes within genes. The limited and weak nature of the effect suggests, however, that the pattern of gene expression may have been affected also by other factors, for example ongoing selection (thus manifested as nucleotide polymorphism), selection at more distal sites, and/or epigenomic mechanisms, such as differences between ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> in DNA methylation or histone modification (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sun et al., 2021</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>List of RNA sequencing data sets.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">Tissue</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sample size (WS/total)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Collection details</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Adult males</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Brain (Hyp, AMV)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">9/20</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Collected early in the breeding season</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zinzow-Kramer et al., 2015</xref>; <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Accession: GSE77186</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adult females</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Brain (Hyp, AMV)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6/11</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Collected early in the breeding season</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Accession: PRJNA657006</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nestlings (both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Brain (Hyp, AMV)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">16/32</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Collected from nests during the breeding season</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Accession: PRJNA657006</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Adult males (all white-striped)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Heart and Liver</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">20/20</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Collected during fall migration, then housed in captivity on either long or short days to simulate breeding vs non-breeding; collected at two time points during the day</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horton et al., 2019</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Accession: GSE116989</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evidence of regional balancing selection on the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome</title><p>Although the level of genetic diversity was overall reduced on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, it was exceptionally elevated in one region corresponding to ~3 Mbps spanning 5 scaffolds.

the observed patterns, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of this region. The resulting tree exhibited the same topology as those from other regions of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, thus providing no support for introgression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We have not yet resolved the distribution of repetitive elements in the two chromosomes. Thus, to avoid errors in the phylogenetic analysis resulting from the rapid turnover of repetitive elements, we also performed the analysis using only the exons of single-copy orthologous genes, similar to analyses done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stolle et al., 2022</xref>. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) did not provide support for an introgression event and therefore did not change our conclusions. In addition, we calculated the D-statistic (ABBA-BABA test, which tests for genomic regions that are discordant with the species tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martin et al., 2015</xref>) to test for evidence of gene flow from another species from the same genus, Harris’ sparrow (<italic>Zonotrichia querula</italic>). Sliding window estimates of the D-statistic did not show any differences in patterns between haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the multiple haplotype structures in ZAL2<sup>m</sup> were not introduced by gene flow from this closely related species or from the ZAL2 chromosome. Nonetheless, the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region showed longer branch lengths than did both the corresponding region on the ZAL2 chromosome and a randomly selected region of ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, reflecting the high genetic diversity within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Tajima’s D was significantly higher throughout the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region compared with the genomic background (p&lt;0.001, permutation test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p>The increase of nucleotide diversity, high Tajima’s D, and long branch length all suggest that balancing selection has impacted the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region. Concordantly, we identified a signature of balancing selection in the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region on the basis of allele frequency spectrum (<italic>β</italic> statistics) computed using BetaScan, which detects signatures of balancing selection by looking for an excess of genomically proximate SNPs with a similar allele frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Siewert and Voight, 2020</xref>). Visual examinations of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region also revealed the presence of potential long-range haplotypes that likely reflect long-term balancing selection and several recombination events within the haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Notably, we identified two major putative haplotypes, which we refer to here as 1 and 2, consisting of 17 and 30 ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes, respectively. A possible third haplogroup was also identified, although the sample size (n=2) was too small to warrant further analyses. The genetic differentiation between the two ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier haplogroups was lower than the differentiation between either haplogroup and ZAL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), indicating that the haplogroups have evolved since the split between ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. This interpretation is also consistent with the inferred phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Note that the sequencing depth for the two haplogroups did not differ significantly (p=0.78, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier regions exhibited an excess of non-synonymous SNPs compared with synonymous SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), as well as an excess of intermediate frequency minor alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Neither geographic location of collection nor sex was associated with any distinct patterns by haplogroups in a PCA analysis using genetic variants in the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>; although note the breeding location of the birds from two of the locations was unknown). Together, these results solidly implicate balancing selection in the evolution of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region. In other words, multiple haplotypes of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome are maintained within the population of white-striped birds via balancing selection.</p><p>We looked for phenotypic consequences of the putative ZAL2<sup>m</sup> haplogroups using the subset of white-striped birds from the sequencing samples for which we had phenotypic data (n=6 for haplogroup 1, n=12 for haplogroup 2, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zinzow-Kramer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horton et al., 2014</xref> for details). White-striped birds with the H1 vs the H2 versions did not differ significantly in aggressive behavior (measured during simulated territorial intrusions), gonad size, tarsus length, cloacal protuberance volume, or any other measure when using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing to avoid false positives (more than 50 tests were performed).</p><p>We next tested for effects of haplogroup on the expression of genes inside the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region. In the subset of white-striped birds for which we had haplogroup information, we examined RNAseq data from two brain regions, the hypothalamus (Hyp) and the ventromedial arcopallium (AMV, the functional homolog of the medial amygdala, formally named the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala) (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for details). We found that the gene <italic>GREB1</italic> (growth regulating estrogen receptor binding 1) was more highly expressed in haplogroup 2 (unadjusted p=0.0195) in AMV. Additionally, there was a trend for the gene <italic>KCNS3</italic> to be more highly expressed in both Hyp (unadjusted p=0.0511) and AMV (unadjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.1567). This gene encodes a voltage-gated channel subunit that in humans and mice is specific to fast-spiking parvalbumin (inhibitory) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Georgiev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Miyamae et al., 2021</xref>). Although no genes were significantly differentially expressed at the genome-wide level, our current findings provide potentially interesting candidates to explore further in the context of behavioral differences between the morphs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Candidates for positive selection in ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup></title><p>Our work has provided a refined map of genetic differentiation between the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, three scaffolds near the chromosomal end (i.e. at the beginning of the p-arm, as well as at the end of the q-arm in the genomic coordinate of the ZAL2 chromosome), exhibited both decreased <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> values and a reduced rate of fixed genetic differences (D<sub>f</sub>). One possible explanation for these findings is that these regions represent a younger evolutionary stratum, which is possible because ZAL2<sup>m</sup> contains a series of nested inversions that occurred at different times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lahn and Page, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergero et al., 2007</xref>). Another possibility is that the inflated within-ZAL2 nucleotide diversity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) within the sampled population reduced the <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> estimate.</p><p>By leveraging our resource of a haplotype map of both the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes, we investigated signatures of positive selection in each chromosome. We identified 216 20 kB regions on ZAL2 exhibiting a significantly elevated H-statistic (empirical p-values &lt;0.05), which is a measure of the average length of the stretches of linkage disequilibrium between the haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schlamp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Messer Lab — Resources, 2014</xref>, Materials and methods). One notable stretch, which included four top candidate 20 kB regions (Scaffold NW_005081582.1, 480–520 kb and 920–960 kb) showed evidence of positive selection on both the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes (blue shaded area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the basis of previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>), this region on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> may be placed on the end of that chromosome. The elevated H-statistic in this region cannot be explained by the recombination rate, as recombination is low across the entire length of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). On the ZAL2 chromosome, in contrast, recombination on the chromosome ends is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), as has been reported in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nachman and Churchill, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barton et al., 2008</xref>). We did not, however, observe an elevated H-statistic in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Note that a structurally resolved chromosome-level assembly does not yet exist for the white-throated sparrow. Thus, the precise location of these regions on the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome still need confirmation.</p><p>We also identified a long stretch (~6 Mbp) showing an overall elevated H-statistic in another region of ZAL2 (red shaded area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This region exhibited the lowest estimates of nucleotide diversity within ZAL2 and the highest estimates of <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> between the two chromosome types. Overall, there were 68 genes located in regions with a significant (p&lt;0.05) H-statistic for ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and 109 genes in regions with a significant H-statistic for ZAL2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), meaning that these genes are inside regions showing evidence of a selective sweep. These observations suggest that selective sweeps took place on both ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes after the rearrangement events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Antagonistic selection influences ZAL2<sup>m</sup> gene expression</title><p>Some of the behaviors that differ between morphs, namely aggression, are predicted by the expression of several genes located inside the ZAL2/2<sup>m</sup> rearrangement, such as <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>VIP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zinzow-Kramer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horton et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesize that the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene region is enriched for alleles that have been shaped by antagonistic selection. Specifically, we predict alleles within the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene region that are beneficial for birds of the white-striped morph, but disadvantageous for birds of the tan-striped morph. Similarly, we predict that the ZAL2 chromosome is enriched for genes with alleles that benefit birds of the tan-striped morph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maney et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined whether allelic bias in the expression of genes inside the rearrangement was associated with differential expression of the same genes between the tan- and white-striped morphs (lists of genes showing differential expression or allelic bias can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Here, allelic bias is defined as the differential expression of the ZAL2 <italic>versus</italic> ZAL2<sup>m</sup> alleles in white-striped birds. Allelic bias in expression would indicate a role of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants—i.e., variants in non-coding promotor, enhancer, or silencer regions regulating a gene—in functionally altering the expression of that gene. For these tests, we used data on gene expression in the brain only, as heart and liver tissue samples were limited to white-striped birds.</p><p>First, we found that among the genes that were differentially expressed between morphs, more of these genes are located inside the rearranged region on ZAL2/2<sup>m</sup> than expected by chance, pointing toward <italic>cis</italic>- (as opposed to <italic>trans</italic>-) regulatory differences underlying morph differences in expression (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> tests showed highly significant effects for both brain regions in adults and nestlings of both sexes, with false discovery rate, FDR, correction to account for the multiple statistical comparisons performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To explore this further, we next tested whether the differentially expressed genes showed greater allelic bias than genes without differential expression. Consistent with what we previously reported using only males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), we found that differential expression significantly predicted the degree of allelic bias in expression of that gene (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>(2)=664.16, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, controlling for sequencing batch and brain region, see Materials and methods). In addition, tan-biased genes showed greater ZAL2 allelic bias and white-biased genes showed greater ZAL2<sup>m</sup> allelic bias than did genes that were not differentially expressed between morphs (post-hoc T&gt;W vs T=W: <italic>z</italic>=–16.87; post-hoc W&gt;T vs T=W: <italic>z</italic>=19.63, p&lt;<italic>2.2</italic> × 10<sup>–16</sup>; post-hoc W&gt;T vs T&gt;W: <italic>z</italic>=26.35, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These findings suggest that gene expression differences between the morphs are driven, in part, by evolutionary changes in the regulatory regions of genes captured by the rearrangement.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Evidence for antagonistic selection driving ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> gene expression in the brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) shows the percentage of differentially expressed genes that reside inside the rearranged region on ZAL2, vs elsewhere in the genome.

We therefore asked whether genes located in regions with evidence for a selective sweep on either ZAL2 or ZAL2<sup>m</sup> (as indicated by the H-statistics for 50 kb windows) were also likely to exhibit bias in gene expression in the brain.

To identify candidates, we performed gene ontology analysis on the set of genes that were either (1) within a region that exhibited evidence of positive selection on either ZAL2 (n=109 genes) or ZAL2<sup>m</sup> (n=68 genes) (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), (2) exhibited allelic bias in six or more tissues (of the eight total brain tissue analyses) (n=249 genes), or (3) exhibited consistent allelic bias across all samples from either one brain region, sex, or age group (i.e. tissue-, sex-, or age-specific expression) (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>, n=117 genes). The rationale for the inclusion of this final group is that genes that show a tissue-specific pattern of allelic bias are strong candidates for genes with adaptive significance, as changes in gene regulation have long been shown to play a role in adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wray, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Using this set of 409 unique genes, we found the strongest enrichment for genes in the categories ‘behavior’ (<italic>p<sub>FDR</sub></italic> = 0.0252) and ‘metabolic process’ (<italic>p<sub>FDR</sub></italic> = 0.0252). The behavior category included genes such as <italic>GRIK2</italic> (glutamate receptor ionotropic, kainate 2), <italic>GRM1</italic> (metabotropic glutamate receptor 1), <italic>NRXN1</italic> (Neurexin-1), <italic>OPRM1</italic> (µ-opioid receptor), <italic>HTR1B</italic> (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B, i.e. serotonin receptor), <italic>MEIS1</italic> (Meis homeobox 1), and <italic>PAK5</italic> (serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK 5). Additionally, there was enrichment for several gene ontology categories related to metabolism, with 205/409 (50.1%) of these candidate genes involved in the broad category ‘metabolic processes’ (<italic>p<sub>FDR</sub></italic> = 0.0210). We also found significant enrichment in the category ‘regulation of multicellular organismal process’ (<italic>p<sub>FDR</sub></italic> = 0.0342). This category included several additional interesting candidate genes, including <italic>ESR1</italic> (estrogen receptor alpha), <italic>NR2E1</italic> (nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 1), <italic>HCRTR2</italic> (orexin receptor type 2), <italic>SYNDIG1</italic> (synapse differentiation-inducing gene 1), <italic>DISC1</italic> (disrupted in schizophrenia 1), and <italic>ESRRG</italic> (estrogen-related receptor gamma).</p><p>Allelic bias toward the ZAL2 allele could result from decreased expression of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> allele due to degeneration. Allelic bias in the other direction, toward ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, is more consistent with adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martinez-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore examined relationships between allelic bias and positive selection. We found that 97/359 (27.8%) genes exhibiting a signal of allelic bias showed a bias toward the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> allele. Four of those 97 genes also overlapped regions exhibiting a significant H-statistic on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>: <italic>PDSS2</italic> (all trans-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase), <italic>XRN2</italic> (5'–3' exoribonuclease 2), <italic>RPS27A</italic> (Ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S27a), and <italic>TCTE1</italic> (T-complex-associated-testis-expressed 1).This result implicates these four genes in adaptive ZAL2<sup>m</sup> phenotypes, providing novel candidate genes for further exploration.</p><p>Looking at our results from a different perspective, of the 409 genes that exhibited evidence either of allelic bias or positive selection (by the H-statistic), 55 exhibited evidences of both. These genes are especially interesting candidates for mediating phenotypic differences between the morphs. Three of these genes were located in areas of elevated H-statistic on both the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes: <italic>PDSS2</italic>, <italic>ATP6V1C2</italic> (ATPase H+Transporting V1 Subunit C2), and <italic>GHRL1</italic> (Grainyhead Like Transcription Factor 1). Both <italic>ATP6V1C2</italic> and <italic>GHRL1</italic> were in the shared region highlighted in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, suggesting that this region may be an especially important evolutionary hotspot in the divergence between the morphs.

One of the most critical processes in the evolution of supergenes is the suppression of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charlesworth, 2016</xref>), a consequence of which is genetic degeneration. Such processes have been extensively studied in the case of non-recombining sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton and Charlesworth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlesworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 2000</xref>), but their role in the early evolution of non-recombining autosomes is not well understood. The ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene captures a snapshot of an early stage of supergene evolution. We and others have previously observed weak signatures of degeneration on the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, using a large, newly generated genomic sequencing and population genomic data set, we demonstrate pervasive signatures of genetic degeneration at multiple levels, from genomic contigs to SNP density. Regardless, the degeneration is weak at most, and it appears that recombination has not entirely ceased on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. It is likely that this low level of recombination occurs in rare ZAL2<sup>m</sup> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horton et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the case of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene illustrates that complex phenotypes including alternative plumage morphs and life history strategies, can evolve prior to the cessation of recombination and despite substantial genetic degeneration.</p><p>As is evident from research on non-recombining sex chromosomes, both positive and antagonistic selection can further the differentiation between those chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachtrog, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachtrog and Charlesworth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rice, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vicoso and Charlesworth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mank, 2012</xref>). Previous studies of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene revealed no or only weak evidence of positive selection at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), despite evidence that allelic biases in expression may contribute causally to phenotypic differences between white- and tan-striped morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>). Here, using extensive molecular data, we detected a strong signature of antagonistic selection based on gene expression profiles and identified several regions of positive selection on both ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. We also found that allele-specific gene expression in the brain was associated with these signatures of positive selection on both the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes, suggesting that this selection has acted on regulatory regions of genes. The finding that genes within non-recombining chromosomes experience either positive or antagonistic selection has been reported for <italic>Drosophila</italic> sex chromosomes, as well as for the social supergene of fire ants (<italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martinez-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pracana et al., 2017</xref>). This phenomenon is not universal, however, signatures of antagonistic selection were not found in the mating-type chromosomes of the anther-smut fungus (<italic>Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazzicalupo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses identified several candidate genes that merit further exploration. For example, several genes that in other species interact with the actions of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), an important player in the behavioral differences between white-throated sparrow morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>), also emerged as candidate genes in our analyses. These genes included <italic>NCOA7</italic> (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 7), a transcriptional coactivator of <italic>ESR1</italic>, and <italic>ESRRG</italic>, a nuclear receptor that interacts with estrogen-responsive elements in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Festuccia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lazennec et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>NR2E1</italic>, a recently de-orphanized nuclear receptor that binds oleic acid to regulate neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kandel et al., 2022</xref>), is another exciting candidate gene. Additionally, we identified several genes–<italic>PDSS2</italic>, <italic>XRN2</italic>, <italic>RPS27A</italic>, <italic>TCTE1</italic>, <italic>ATP6V1C2</italic>, and <italic>GRHL1–</italic>that have not previously been linked to the morph differences, but convergent lines of evidence suggest that they may play a role in the evolution of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene. <italic>GHRL1</italic>, for example, is a transcription factor necessary for the development of epithelial tissues and is enriched in the neonatal ventromedial hypothalamus of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kurrasch et al., 2007</xref>). Its function in the brain, however, remains unknown. Interestingly, the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> breakpoint has been mapped to ~12 kB downstream of <italic>GRHL1</italic> (<italic>40</italic>), perhaps accounting for the observed patterns of divergence.</p><p>Indeed, we found evidence of selective sweeps in several regions near the predicted breakpoint on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. Positive selection near inversion breakpoints has been found in other species including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, we observed signatures of positive selection on large regions of ZAL2, which was reminiscent of the finding that the X chromosome of primates has been targeted by strong positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nam et al., 2015</xref>). This positive selection on ZAL2 could indicate that recessive alleles on that chromosome experience increased selection in birds of the white-striped morph, and are thus in direct conflict with genes on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. It is worth noting, however, that allelic bias is not necessarily indicative of selection; bias in expression toward the tan-allele could be caused by degeneration on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, for example. Bias toward the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> allele could be caused by a transposable element in the promoter region, driving aberrant expression. Convergent lines of evidence point toward a role for positive selection throughout the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene variant, but the mechanisms underlying allelic bias may vary for each individual gene.</p><p>Remarkably, we also discovered clear signatures of balancing selection maintaining two long-range haplotypes within the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene. We were surprised by this finding, as similar long-range haplotypes have not, to our knowledge, been previously reported for non-recombining chromosomal polymorphisms. It has been speculated that balancing selection is less common in sexually reproducing species than in self-fertilizing species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glémin, 2021</xref>), in which the effective recombination rate is lowered due to the extreme degree of inbreeding. Our results suggest that balancing selection may function to maintain genetic variability in the face of reduced recombination, and we might expect to see other instances of balancing selection within supergenes.</p><p>The phenotypic effects of these balanced haplotypes remain unknown. Two out of the fifteen genes inside the balanced ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region showed signatures of differential gene expression between the haplogroups. One of these genes is <italic>GREB1</italic>, which in mammals is a downstream target of ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gegenhuber et al., 2022</xref>). This finding is notable because, in white-throated sparrows, ERα is causally related to the behavioral differences between morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horton et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> haplogroup may interact in important ways with ERα-mediated phenotypes in white-striped birds, although further research is needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate that the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> supergene is far from a degenerating counterpart of a ‘normal’ autosome. Rather, it is an active arena of multiple evolutionary forces. Although most studies of the consequences of suppressed recombination have focused on genetic degeneration, the resulting supergenes also give rise to opportunities for evolutionary innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charlesworth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thompson and Jiggins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwander et al., 2014</xref>). Our results show that although degeneration is operating on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, dynamic selective forces are occurring simultaneously, producing divergent complex phenotypes.

Note that the probability of this allelic pattern occurring by random chance is 2.6x10<sup>–23</sup> given the sample size, according to a binomial test. Following this procedure, we obtained a total of 931,424 SNPs and 97,375 insertions and deletions (InDels) between ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes, increasing the number of putatively fixed SNPs between the two chromosomes beyond previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>).

In statistical analyses, the females and nestlings of each sex were treated as separate ‘batches’ of RNAseq such that there were five total batches: brain samples from adult males, adult females, nestling males, nestling females, and liver/heart samples from adult males. Each tissue was nested within batch to account for repeated sampling from the same individuals.</p><p>RNAseq reads were aligned to a reference genome <italic>N</italic>-masked for putative fixed differences for both chromosomal polymorphisms present in this species (i.e. ZAL2/2, ZAL3<sup>a</sup>/3<sup>a</sup>,) using <italic>HiSat2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). To examine allele-specific expression, we used <italic>SNPsplit</italic> v.0.3.2 to assign mapped reads to ZAL2 or ZAL2<sup>m</sup> for the white-striped samples. Transcripts were quantified using <italic>StringTie</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>) and differential expression and allelic-specific expression analyses were performed using <italic>DESeq2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Love et al., 2014</xref>). To test for differential expression between the morphs, we used the following model in <italic>DESeq2</italic>: ‘design = ~morph’. To test for allelic bias (AB), we used the size factors generated for each sample in the previous step, and then used the following model: ‘design = ~individual + allele’. To perform hypothesis testing, we used linear mixed models with tissue nested in sequencing batch as random effects using the R package <italic>lme4</italic>. To test for the effect of interest, we then performed a likelihood ratio test to compare a full model to a reduced model with the factor of interest removed using the anova function. Where applicable, we used the summary function to perform post-hoc comparisons between multiple groups.</p><p>To test for significant allelic bias in expression within each sample type, we used a Wilcoxon rank sum test to test whether the ratio of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> to ZAL2 expression differed significantly from 0.5, applying an FDR correction for multiple testing. To test for an association between allelic bias and the number of mutations within a gene, we computed the per-base number of mutations by dividing the number of mutations by the gene length and then sorted the genes into deciles. We also computed the number of fixed mutations within 1 kB upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). We then tested whether there was an association between allelic bias and the decile rank or number of mutations within 1 kB upstream of the TSS using the following linear model: Log2 AB ~Variable + (1|Batch:Tissue). To test for overrepresentation of morph-biased genes located inside the rearrangement, we performed a two-sample test for equality of proportions for each brain sample type only. For this test, we compared the proportion of differentially expressed genes, out of the 1007 genes inside the rearranged region on ZAL2, to the proportion out of the 13,369 genes located elsewhere in the genome. For this comparison, we used the <italic>prop.test</italic> function in R to perform a two-proportions Z-test, applying an FDR correction for multiple testing. To test whether the morph bias in expression of a gene significantly predicted allelic bias for that gene, we grouped genes into three categories: those that were more highly expressed in the white-striped morph (W&gt;T), those more highly expressed in the tan-striped morph (T&gt;W) and those that that did not differ significantly between morphs (T=W). Using the allelic bias for each gene, we then tested whether allelic bias differed among these categories using the following linear mixed model: Log<sub>2</sub> AB ~MorphBias_Category + (1|Batch:Tissue), followed by Bonferroni-corrected pairwise post-hoc tests using the ‘ghlt’ function in <italic>multcomp</italic> package. Note that heart and liver tissue samples were obtained from white-striped birds; because we did not have data on differential expression by morph for these tissues, they were excluded from this analysis, as well as the tests for overrepresentation described above.</p><p>To test whether haplogroup affects gene expression, we merged the gene count matrices for the male (H1: n=7, H2: n=3) and female (H1: n=3, H2: n=3) white-striped birds that were also included in the whole genome sequencing dataset and tested for an effect of haplogroup using the following model: design ~sex + haplogroup. Only one gene in Hyp (Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase 1, <italic>GGPS1</italic>) and one gene in AMV (RUN And FYVE Domain Containing 4, <italic>RUFY4</italic>) were differentially expressed at the genome-wide level. Neither of these genes are located in the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region and only <italic>GGPS1</italic> is located on ZAL2. Thus, we report only unadjusted p-values for genes inside the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region that were differentially expressed (both unadjusted and adjusted p-values for all genes in the ZAL2m outlier region are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>To examine the relationship between the H-statistic and allelic bias in expression, we computed the average H-statistic for each gene. Each gene was assigned the H-statistic value of the 20 kb bin overlapping the gene (or the average of multiple 20 kb bins, if a gene overlapped two bins). We then used a multiple linear regression model to examine the relationship between the Log<sub>2</sub>ASE and the log<sub>2</sub>H-statistic of a gene for both ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> separately, using the following model: Log2 AB ~ Log<sub>2</sub>H-statistic + (1|Batch:Tissue). Additionally, we performed functional enrichment analyses for the genes in regions with a significant H-statistic using ToppFun with human homolog HGNC gene names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Sample collection, generating sequencing libraries, and performing sequencing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Sample collection, generating sequencing libraries, and performing sequencing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Sample acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures involving live animals were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocols PROTO201800016) and with appropriate state and federal (Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Federal U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) permits.

The study convincingly illustrates how the cessation of recombination that results from a chromosomal inversion can become a source of evolutionary novelty. The lack of recombination can result in the accumulation of deleterious variation leading to degeneration, but it can also (as here) facilitate genomic diversification and adaptation.

If it is part of the same inversion, how would a younger date be possible?</p><p>b) How would genetic diversity be increased in this area?</p><p>Could it just be the result of an event of recombination in the past, introducing diversity from one lineage into the other? Or the result of the selective sweep (Supp Figure 9)?</p><p>– Regions with evidence of positive selection: The text reads (l.352), &quot;four top candidate regions (NW_005081582.1, 480-520kb and 920-960kb)&quot;. The legend of the Supplemental Figure 9 reads &quot;A candidate region showing a positive selection on both ZAL2 and ZAL2m (NW_005081582.1, 480-520kb, and 920-960kb)&quot;. Is it one region or four regions? What are the terms in parenthesis?</p><p>– The text mentions different regions with evidence of selective sweeps, but it is difficult to relate those regions to results: l. 354, peaks in chromosome end in ZAL2; which ones are those?; l. 357 the long stretch of elevated H-statistics in ZAL2, could this be associated with low nucleotide diversity and high Fst? In general, this paragraph is quite confusing.</p><p>– I miss some info about the content of the regions with evidence for a selective sweep. It would be nice to know what genes are inside the region where selective sweeps have taken place for both chromosomes. The authors search for ontological or functional enrichment, but it is not clear if differences should be expected at this level and I would like to see info about specific candidate genes that could have been proposed considering previous studies and phenotypic analyses</p><p>– Antagonistic selection implies that changes in one chromosome counteract changes in the other one. Not clear how the approach used allows the investigation of the existence of counteracting changes. The text in this section is hard to follow. For example, in line 379 it is difficult to understand what allelic bias means. Or, in line 383, it seems that tan-biased genes can only show greater ZAL2 allelic bias because ZAL2m is not present in those individuals. Please, revise this entire section (starting in l. 364).</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>– l. 243 Sentence hard to follow &quot;We found evidence that allelic bias in gene expression was associated with the decile rank of the per-base number of non-synonymous fixed differences&quot;. Could this be assessed without using deciles: bias in gene expression vs. per-base number of non-synonymous fixed differences.</p><p>– l. 288. Please, provide an intuitive explanation of the D-statistic and what it means here. Difficult to see anything in Figure 3a.</p><p>– l. 425 Reference 63 corresponds to a web page with software. It is not clear what this reference means here. Please, check references to make sure that there are no errors (for example, see author list in reference 64).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 235: &quot;whether degeneration … resulted in … reduced expression of the ZAL2m allele. &quot; – ZAL2m is a whole supergene (or chromosome) variant. It is not an allele. Probably the following is better: &quot;reduced expression of ZAL2m alleles&quot;. Throughout the manuscript, I don't think the authors should say &quot;ZAL2m allele&quot; when referring to the supergene variant. &quot;Alleles carried by the Zal2m supergene variant&quot; could be appropriate.</p><p>Figure 4b: How many genes were there with the different types of bias? For genes with a higher expression in Tan than white, the authors suggest that the allelic bias towards the tan allele is a sign of adaptation. But it could simply be that the bias is the result of the ZAL2m allele having degenerated (similar to https://elifesciences.org/articles/55862 ). Conversely, while some higher expression of Zal2m alleles in white birds could be adaptive, some of it can also be that a transposon jumped in front of the promoter and leads to maladaptive high gene expression. We need to be careful with adaptationist interpretations.</p><p>Line 354 – finding extended homozygosity runs near the end of the chromosome arm could be expected from lower recombination in this region?</p><p>Line 295-298: the authors check for introgression by building a tree from the region of Zal2m that is putatively balancing selection. A large amount of collapsed repetitive DNA in Zal2 can create misleading patterns in phylogenetic reconstruction attempts. This is due to the rapid turnover and jumping of repetitive elements (e.g., what looks like it is here in the reference genome may actually be from somewhere else, or could represent a hybrid genotype of several divergent repeat copies). Focusing on single-copy loci, such as exons of intact single-copy genes, should be preferred (see Stolle Nat Com2022 for one approach).</p><p>Examination of allelic expression bias involves mapping to a genome where fixed differences between supergene variants have been masked. This is ok, but because the 2 supergene variants differ in the amount of genetic diversity they carry, and read mapping algorithms are sensitive to the number of differences between the reference sequence and the read, this would lead to a slight mapping bias. That creates a risk here. A more balanced control could have involved masking any genetic variation. However, I think that it is unlikely that doing so would fundamentally change the picture.</p><p>Figure 1A shows that ZAL2m has higher overall genetic diversity than ZAL2, yet the text describing genetic diversity also consistently suggests the alternate pattern. For example, Ne derived from synonymous genic diversity is 10x lower in ZAL2m than ZAL2 (from line 222).</p><p>Alternatively, the apparent conundrum could come from the use of different filtering criteria and the use of a linear reference sequence where repetitive regions are collapsed. The ZAL2m's genome sequence contains more difficult-to-assemble repetitive DNA, as evidenced by finding smaller scaffolds in Zal2m. This is in line with what is seen in the young fire ant Sb chromosomes (Pracana 2017 Mol Eco finding lower genetic diversity, Stolle 2018 finding more repetitive elements, and more variation in repetitive element content), as well as in some labile young Y chromosomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79387.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are largely positive about your paper, as am I.

We have added an expanded consideration of candidate genes and their functional implications on lines 450-489 and lines 519-531. Additionally, we have done our best to address concerns related to the role of repetitive element variation, at least where we can address whether our findings are a result of increased structural variation, as opposed to other phenomena. One of the limitations of the current system include the lack of high quality long-range sequence data from the species, thus making it difficult to resolve structural variation and repetitive sequences, so this is not something that we can address in depth in this manuscript. We also have carefully considered our determination of statistical ‘significance’. In one case, a result was removed, but we opted in another instance to keep some borderline findings in the manuscript (see below). We have also made sure to explain false discovery rate estimation, as well as provided other operational definitions for statistics used, in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Add a few words describing tests and the meaning of the statistics for people less habituated to their use (H-statistics, D-statistic, …).

Additionally, in this process and in response to comments from Reviewer #2, we identified and corrected a labeling error that had been made in the supplementary figure (now Figure 3 – supp. 2), as well as several errors in the text. We updated the figure, and made changes to the figure legend, and to the text on lines 301-306 and in the Materials &amp; Methods on line 667-671.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the study of balancing selection:</p><p>– lines 311-312.

However, the sample size of the potential third haplogroup is too small (n=2) to enable in-depth analysis. We thus focused on the two major haplogroups that have moderate numbers of chromosomes. Further sampling would be necessary to pursue deeper investigation. We modified the text on lines 320-323 to clarify this point. We also note that different subregions of the outlier region had different topology when drawing phylogenetic trees, although the presence of two major haplogroups was generally consistent. Once again, we feel this issue can be resolved with larger sample sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is this outlier region heterozygous for all individuals?

White-striped birds are heterozygous for ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, so they have only one copy of ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. Our results suggest that within ZAL2<sup>m</sup>, there is a region for which balancing selection has maintained multiple (2, or possibly 3) haplotypes. Each white-striped (heterozygous) bird has only one of the two haplotypes of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome and tan-striped birds are unaffected altogether. This is an example of balanced haplogroups within one of the chromosomes maintained by another instance of balancing selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– l. 322-327.

These multiple inversion events could have taken place at different times, which could lead to a younger evolutionary stratum. We cited this possibility due to the strong precedence in other systems. However, we do not have direct evidence that clearly supports this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) How would genetic diversity be increased in this area?</p><p>Could it just be the result of an event of recombination in the past, introducing diversity from one lineage into the other? Or the result of the selective sweep (Supp Figure 9)?</p></disp-quote><p>We present evidence that ZAL2 genetic diversity is elevated at the chromosome ends in Figure 3a. This could be as a result of increased recombination taking place at the chromosome ends, consistent with what has been reported in the literature (e.g. Nachman &amp; Churchill, 1996, <italic>Genetics</italic>; Barton et al., 2008, <italic>Genetics</italic>). We tested this explicitly and now include Figure 4 – supp. 3, which provides evidence that supports the idea that increased diversity on the ends of the ZAL2 chromosome is a result of increased recombination there (lines 370-376). We do not, however, find evidence of increased selective sweeps taking place on the chromosome ends of the ZAL2 chromosome (see revised Figure 4 – supp. 2a and our expanded description of this result, lines 370-373). ZAL2<sup>m</sup> shows several broad regions of selective sweeps (for example scaffold NW_005081553.1, the large red colored scaffold on the righthand side of Figure 4 – supp. 2b), but it is worth noting that this area is not in fact the end of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome. Figure 4 – supp. 2 (and all the graphs) shows the genomic coordinates with respect to the *ZAL2* assembly, where the scaffolds have been ordered using BAC sequencing and FISH studies (Thomas et al. 2008). A structurally resolved chromosome-level assembly does not yet exist for the white throated sparrow. Thus, the precise location of these regions on the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome are currently unknown, in absence of long-read sequencing and a high quality ZAL2<sup>m</sup> assembly (now pointed out on lines 373-375). We therefore cannot make strong claims about the exact locations of these regions along the chromosome, unfortunately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regions with evidence of positive selection: The text reads (l.352), &quot;four top candidate regions (NW_005081582.1, 480-520kb and 920-960kb)&quot;. The legend of the Supplemental Figure 9 reads &quot;A candidate region showing a positive selection on both ZAL2 and ZAL2m (NW_005081582.1, 480-520kb, and 920-960kb)&quot;. Is it one region or four regions? What are the terms in parenthesis?</p></disp-quote><p>There are four 20kB regions that are close to each other with significant evidence of positive selection on both the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes, so part of a single larger region. We have now highlighted this region in blue in Figure 4 – supp. 2. This has also been clarified in the text on lines 367-368 and in the Supplementary figure legend. The terms in parentheses are the scaffold names and genomic coordinates for the reference genome. We have edited the manuscript to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The text mentions different regions with evidence of selective sweeps, but it is difficult to relate those regions to results: l. 354, peaks in chromosome end in ZAL2; which ones are those?; l. 357 the long stretch of elevated H-statistics in ZAL2, could this be associated with low nucleotide diversity and high Fst? In general, this paragraph is quite confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially modified this paragraph (lines 463-483) to avoid confusion. We also added shaded blocks to Figure 4 – supp. 2 to aid our presentation. Indeed, regions with elevated H-statistics also exhibit low nucleotide diversity and high Fst, which could have been due to selective sweeps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I miss some info about the content of the regions with evidence for a selective sweep. It would be nice to know what genes are inside the region where selective sweeps have taken place for both chromosomes. The authors search for ontological or functional enrichment, but it is not clear if differences should be expected at this level and I would like to see info about specific candidate genes that could have been proposed considering previous studies and phenotypic analyses</p></disp-quote><p>The genes in regions that show significantly elevated H-statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Functional genomic resources and tools from this species are still lacking. Thus, we initially hesitated to over-interpret the results, though we believe our results provide an interesting list of candidate genes for future studies to follow up on. In the revised manuscript, we included additional analyses &amp; discussion connecting the positive selection analyses with differential gene expression (in lines 450-489) and provided a list of candidate genes in the new Supp. Table 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Antagonistic selection implies that changes in one chromosome counteract changes in the other one. Not clear how the approach used allows the investigation of the existence of counteracting changes. The text in this section is hard to follow. For example, in line 379 it is difficult to understand what allelic bias means. Or, in line 383, it seems that tan-biased genes can only show greater ZAL2 allelic bias because ZAL2m is not present in those individuals. Please, revise this entire section (starting in l. 364).</p></disp-quote><p>We use antagonistic selection to infer selection for divergent alleles on ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> that benefit individuals of the tan-striped and white-striped morph, respectively. Although allelic bias is an imperfect test of adaptation, we make the assumption that positive selection on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory alleles on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> would, on average, increase the expression of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> allele and <italic>visa versa</italic>. This framework is similar to what is often used to test for sexually antagonistic selection on the X and Y chromosomes. To test this prediction, for each gene within the rearrangement, we relate differential expression between birds of each morph to allelic bias *within white-striped birds only*. So, to be clear, we are not measuring allelic bias in tan-striped birds (this is, as noted, not possible). Furthermore, it is not a given that genes that are more highly expressed in tan individuals would show ZAL2 bias, <italic>per se</italic>. Genes that show differential expression, but not allelic bias, are likely showing differences in <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of the gene. Allelic bias, however, points specifically to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory differences driving differential expression of the gene. Figure 4b is confirming with a larger sample size a finding that was presented in Sun et al., 2016. We have attempted to clarify these points in the text (see lines 389-392, 396-399, 402-403, and 437-439).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>– l. 243 Sentence hard to follow &quot;We found evidence that allelic bias in gene expression was associated with the decile rank of the per-base number of non-synonymous fixed differences&quot;. Could this be assessed without using deciles: bias in gene expression vs. per-base number of non-synonymous fixed differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We instead now present the rate of fixed differences versus the decile rank in Figure 2 – supp. 1 and in the Results in the text on lines 245-250. This does not change the conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– l. 288. Please, provide an intuitive explanation of the D-statistic and what it means here.

It is not an allele. Probably the following is better: &quot;reduced expression of ZAL2m alleles&quot;. Throughout the manuscript, I don't think the authors should say &quot;ZAL2m allele&quot; when referring to the supergene variant. &quot;Alleles carried by the Zal2m supergene variant&quot; could be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have made changes throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4b: How many genes were there with the different types of bias? For genes with a higher expression in Tan than white, the authors suggest that the allelic bias towards the tan allele is a sign of adaptation. But it could simply be that the bias is the result of the ZAL2m allele having degenerated (similar to https://elifesciences.org/articles/55862 ). Conversely, while some higher expression of Zal2m alleles in white birds could be adaptive, some of it can also be that a transposon jumped in front of the promoter and leads to maladaptive high gene expression. We need to be careful with adaptationist interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points. Genes showing ZAL2 versus ZAL2<sup>m</sup> allelic bias are listed in Supp. Table 6. We have added additional caveats and alternative interpretations in the discussion on lines 538541.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 354 – finding extended homozygosity runs near the end of the chromosome arm could be expected from lower recombination in this region?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we used <italic>Fasteprr</italic> to infer the population recombination parameter, rho, for each genome assembly contig (Now Figure 4 – supp. 3). This analysis indicates that recombination rates are higher on the chromosome ends of ZAL2, but not on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. Instead, recombination is very low throughout ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. Therefore, this pattern of elevated H-statistic is not caused by especially reduced recombination on the ends of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosome. This has been clarified in the manuscript on lines 370-374.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 295-298: the authors check for introgression by building a tree from the region of Zal2m that is putatively balancing selection. A large amount of collapsed repetitive DNA in Zal2 can create misleading patterns in phylogenetic reconstruction attempts. This is due to the rapid turnover and jumping of repetitive elements (e.g., what looks like it is here in the reference genome may actually be from somewhere else, or could represent a hybrid genotype of several divergent repeat copies). Focusing on single-copy loci, such as exons of intact single-copy genes, should be preferred (see Stolle Nat Com2022 for one approach).</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, our current data (mostly short read sequencing data) are insufficient to investigate structural variation at fine scale. We hope to follow up on this work using long-read sequencing in the future. To address this concern, we re-ran the phylogenetic analysis, this time reconstructing the phylogenetic tree of the ZAL2<sup>m</sup> outlier region using only exons of the single copy orthologous genes. The results of this analysis, shown below and in Figure 3 – supp. 1, do not indicate an introgression event within ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. We have updated our Results to include mention of this analysis on lines 297-301.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Examination of allelic expression bias involves mapping to a genome where fixed differences between supergene variants have been masked. This is ok, but because the 2 supergene variants differ in the amount of genetic diversity they carry, and read mapping algorithms are sensitive to the number of differences between the reference sequence and the read, this would lead to a slight mapping bias. That creates a risk here. A more balanced control could have involved masking any genetic variation. However, I think that it is unlikely that doing so would fundamentally change the picture.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this caveat to the Methods section where we describe the N-masking (lines 636-640).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A shows that ZAL2m has higher overall genetic diversity than ZAL2, yet the text describing genetic diversity also consistently suggests the alternate pattern. For example, Ne derived from synonymous genic diversity is 10x lower in ZAL2m than ZAL2 (from line 222).</p><p>Alternatively, the apparent conundrum could come from the use of different filtering criteria and the use of a linear reference sequence where repetitive regions are collapsed. The ZAL2m's genome sequence contains more difficult-to-assemble repetitive DNA, as evidenced by finding smaller scaffolds in Zal2m. This is in line with what is seen in the young fire ant Sb chromosomes (Pracana 2017 Mol Eco finding lower genetic diversity, Stolle 2018 finding more repetitive elements, and more variation in repetitive element content), as well as in some labile young Y chromosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1a shows genetic diversity between tan-striped and white-striped birds, not between ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> (this is actually shown in Figure 3A). Because all white-striped birds are heterozygous and all tan-striped birds are homozygous, there is higher genetic diversity in white-striped birds overall. Only in the haplotype-phased data, where reads are assigned to chromosomes, do we detect the pattern of overall reduced genetic diversity on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. We have added a note to the caption of Figure 1 to make clear what is plotted in panel A.</p></body></sub-article></article>
