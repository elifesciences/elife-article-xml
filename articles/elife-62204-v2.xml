During vegetative growth, the division septum is formed at the midcell to produce two equal daughter cells. However, during sporulation, the division septum is formed closer to one pole to yield a smaller forespore and a larger mother cell. Using cryo-electron tomography, genetics and fluorescence microscopy, we found that the organization of the division machinery is different in the two septa. While FtsAZ filaments, the major orchestrators of bacterial cell division, are present uniformly around the leading edge of the invaginating vegetative septa, they are only present on the mother cell side of the invaginating sporulation septa. We provide evidence suggesting that the different distribution and number of FtsAZ filaments impact septal thickness, causing vegetative septa to be thicker than sporulation septa already during constriction. Finally, we show that a sporulation-specific protein, SpoIIE, regulates asymmetric divisome localization and septal thickness during sporulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>FtsZ</kwd><kwd>FtsA</kwd><kwd>SpoIIE</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron tomography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM057045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pogliano</surname><given-names>Kit</given-names></name><name><surname>Villa</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI 1920374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villa</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement> </funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During sporulation, FtsAZ filaments mediating cell division in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> are positioned asymmetrically around the septum only on the mother cell side, making the septum thinner than during vegetative growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial cell division involves the invagination of the cellular membrane(s) and peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall to split the cell into two progeny cells. In most bacteria, cell division is initiated when the tubulin homologue and GTPase, FtsZ, polymerizes to form a ring-like structure, called the Z-ring, at the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Boer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1994</xref>). The Z-ring serves as a scaffold onto which about a dozen other proteins assemble to form a mature cell division machinery called ‘divisome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haeusser and Margolin, 2016</xref>). In the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, divisome assembly proceeds in two steps. First, proteins that interact directly with FtsZ and promote its association with the membrane are recruited to the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamba et al., 2009</xref>). One essential protein recruited at this stage is FtsA, an actin homologue which tethers FtsZ to the membrane via its conserved C-terminal amphipathic helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>). FtsA can also form protofilaments via polymerization in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>). Second, proteins involved in septal PG synthesis and remodeling are recruited to the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamba et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies suggest that treadmilling by FtsZ filaments serves as a platform to drive the circumferential motion of septal PG synthases in both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, suggesting that this dynamic property of FtsZ filaments can regulate cell wall remodeling in the septal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bisson-Filho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> is a unique model system to study cell division as it can divide via two modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During vegetative growth, the septum is formed at the midcell, producing two daughter cells of equal sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and Lutkenhaus, 1993</xref>). However, during sporulation, the division septum is formed closer to one pole to produce a smaller forespore and a larger mother cell. Subsequently, the forespore is engulfed by the mother cell, producing an internal endospore, that upon maturation, is released by mother cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khanna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riley et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tan and Ramamurthi, 2014</xref>). Vegetative and sporulating cells differ not only in the positioning of the division site but also in the thickness of their septa, with the medial vegetative septum being almost four times thicker than the polar sporulating septum (~80 nm vs. ~25 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Illing and Errington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tocheva et al., 2013</xref>). Another distinction is the presence of a membrane protein SpoIIE, which colocalizes with and directly interacts with FtsZ in sporulating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arigoni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucet et al., 2000</xref>), but is absent in vegetative cells. Recent evidence suggests that SpoIIE localizes only on the forespore side of the sporulation septum at the onset of membrane constriction before being released into the forespore membrane upon septum formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carniol et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Errington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guberman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). Certain <italic>spoIIE</italic> mutants also form thicker polar septa compared to wild-type sporangia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barák and Youngman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Illing and Errington, 1991</xref>). These findings posit that there may be differences in the divisome organization between the vegetative and the sporulation septum that play a role in regulating septal thickness. However, a mechanistic understanding of how cell division is regulated during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation remains elusive.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell division in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.</title><p>Schematic of cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> during (<bold>A</bold>) vegetative growth and (<bold>B</bold>) sporulation.

Our results demonstrate that FtsAZ filaments have distinct spatial organization during the two modes of division and that SpoIIE regulates the positioning of FtsAZ filaments during sporulation. We further provide evidence that this distinct organization leads to a thinner polar septum during sporulation. Our results pave the way for future studies in the field of bacterial cell division, giving rise to testable hypothesis on how bacteria regulate protein localization in space and time to carry out the critical process of cytokinesis under different gene expression programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FtsAZ filaments in vegetative <italic>B. subtilis</italic></title><p>Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a method to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of biological specimens.

Rotation of the 3D volume of the tomogram around the short axis of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrated that each series of dots corresponded to filamentous structures of ~3.5 nm diameter arranged next to each other, forming a bundle that spans the circumference of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, E–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>).

We speculate that such filaments correspond to FtsZ but without a corresponding FtsA filament to tether it to the membrane as the incorporation of the long linker in the C-terminal of FtsZ likely affects the interaction between the two proteins, as also evidenced by longer filamented cells in the presence of the linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). This is substantiated by previous studies showing that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> can grow without FtsA, albeit slowly and in a filamentous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beall and Lutkenhaus, 1992</xref>). Instead, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, FtsZ may use an alternate anchor like SepF or EzrA to bind to the membrane in the absence of FtsA as these divisome proteins also have an N-terminal domain that binds to the membrane and a C-terminal domain that interacts with FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2007</xref>). In a few tomograms, we also observed doublets/triplets of individual filaments only in the membrane-distal band, an arrangement that was previously reported for FtsZ filaments in tomograms of dividing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>) (blue/orange arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–L</xref>), further demonstrating that only the membrane-distal ring corresponded to the Z-ring. In one tomogram, we also observed an additional faint ring between the membrane-proximal and the membrane-distal rings (~14 nm from the membrane) that might correspond to few FtsZ filaments that localize closer to the membrane likely due to flexibility of the linker domain (in green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We assigned the identity of the membrane-proximal ring to be FtsA filaments as no other cell division proteins form filaments in vivo or in vitro and its distance to the membrane is comparable to that of FtsA filaments in <italic>E. coli</italic> upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>). To further establish the identity of the filaments, we verified that the filament thickness, continuity along the septal plane and distribution of intensity values of the rings in FtsZ- linker<sub>Q-rich</sub> compared to the wild type were all similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the more continuous membrane-distal ring of FtsZ filaments is tethered to the membrane via a patchy membrane-proximal ring of FtsA filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>).</p><p>Our cryo-FIB-ET data indicated that the Z-ring was mostly continuous in the cellular sections we imaged. We observed fairly continuous Z-rings in 9 out of 16 tomograms of dividing vegetative cells that we captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). We could not reliably assess the continuity of the Z-ring in the remaining seven tomograms because they were either too thick or did not yield high-resolution data due to their orientation with respect to the tilt axis. It is also difficult to ascertain with confidence whether the Z-ring is continuous throughout the cellular volume since we are only sampling a section of the cell (~200 nm of ~1.2 μm) due to ablation by cryo-FIB milling and due to missing wedge issue associated with cryo-ET data collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, the data from our highest quality tomograms, each of which capture different parts of the septal disc, consistently show that the Z-ring is continuous at least in the entire 3D volume captured.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FtsAZ filaments localize only on the mother cell side during sporulation</title><p>Next, we analyzed divisome architecture in sporulating <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. During sporulation, the division site shifts closer to a pole as opposed to medial division during vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We again observed two series of dots in dividing sporulating cells, but remarkably, they were visible only on the mother cell side of the leading edge of the invaginating sporulation septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">5</xref>). Of note, the membranes at the leading edge of the nascent septum in sporulating cells were not as defined as in vegetative cells, suggesting that they have a higher ratio of protein to membrane, as might be expected due to the presence of both transmembrane cell division proteins and sporulation-specific multipass transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). Due to molecular crowding, it is difficult to ascertain the continuity of Z-rings during sporulation as compared to vegetative growth. In conclusion, our data suggest that FtsAZ filaments mediating cell division localize differently during vegetative growth and sporulation. During vegetative growth, they span the leading edge of the invaginating septum uniformly, whereas during sporulation they localize only on the mother cell side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>FtsAZ filaments during sporulation and septal thickness measurements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Slice through a tomogram of a dividing sporulating cell.

The observation that the sporulation septum is thinner than the vegetative septum and that FtsZ filaments localize differently during the two conditions led us to hypothesize that there may be a direct correlation between the number of FtsZ filaments at the division site and the septal thickness during septal biogenesis.</p><p>To investigate this, we first measured the septal thickness in dividing sporulating and vegetative cells using cryo-FIB-ET images to determine if the sporulating septum is thinner than the vegetative septum as it is being formed or only upon closure as was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Illing and Errington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tocheva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Our data showed that the thickness of the invaginating septa in vegetative cells was ~50 ± 3 nm compared to ~80 nm when the septum formation is completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). This suggests that during vegetative growth either additional PG is incorporated into the septum upon its closure or the already present PG is remodeled and expands in volume after synthesis. We favor the latter possibility as during vegetative growth the septum splits to generate two equal daughter cells upon closure. This process requires the activity of several cell wall hydrolases that cleave crosslinks in septal PG, leading to the expansion of the cell wall by distributing forces across the cell surface, which would result in an increase in septal thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Huang, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, the thickness of the invaginating septa in sporulating cells was almost half of that of vegetative cells (~25 ± 2.5 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) during constriction. Our previous results demonstrate that the thickness of the sporulation septum upon closure is ~23 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanna et al., 2019</xref>), close to the observed thickness of the invaginating sporulation septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Hence, contrary to the vegetative septum, the sporulation septum does not thicken upon closure. This further supports the idea that the thickening of vegetative septa upon closure might be related to the expansion of the cell wall due to PG hydrolysis during cell separation. The mother cell and the forespore do not separate after septation, and therefore the cell wall hydrolases that participate in splitting of the two daughter cells during vegetative growth would not participate in the same capacity during sporulation. Our results, therefore, suggest that even at the onset of cell division the sporulating septum is thinner than the vegetative septum.</p><p>Next, we investigated if the number of FtsZ filaments tracking the division plane during vegetative growth and sporulation differs. It was often not possible to count the exact number of FtsZ filaments (or the number of electron-dense puncta around the leading edge) in cryo-FIB-ET data due to low signal-to-noise ratio at the division site, especially during sporulation given the molecular crowding at the leading edge of the constricting septum. However, our data indicate that the distance between individual electron-dense puncta representing FtsZ is similar in both vegetative and sporulating septa. Hence, we measured the distance spanned by the membrane-distal band of FtsZ bundle (end-to-end distance) as a proxy for the abundance of the cytoskeletal machinery during cell division. On average, FtsZ bundles spanned twice the length in vegetative cells compared to sporulating cells (~51 ± 2.9 nm vs. ~27 ± 3.6 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>), indicating that there are twice as many FtsZ filaments participating in cell division during vegetative growth as compared to sporulation. Based on these data, and the fact that the dynamic property of FtsZ filaments regulates the insertion of the cell wall material during septal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bisson-Filho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Squyres et al., 2020</xref>), we propose that the sporulation septum being thinner than the vegetative septum is likely a consequence of fewer FtsZ filaments tracking the division plane during sporulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SpoIIE affects the localization of FtsAZ filaments during sporulation</title><p>We next probed factors leading to the distinct pattern of FtsAZ localization during vegetative growth and sporulation. We focused on dissecting the role of SpoIIE, a sporulation-specific integral membrane protein proposed to regulate the formation of the sporulation septum for several reasons. First, SpoIIE localizes to the invaginating sporulation septum in an FtsZ-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arigoni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucet et al., 2000</xref>). Biochemical evidence suggests that the central FtsZ-binding domain and possibly the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SpoIIE play a role in its interaction with FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carniol et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucet et al., 2000</xref>). Second, previous electron micrographs demonstrated that certain <italic>spoIIE</italic> mutants form thicker polar septa compared to wild-type sporangia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barák and Youngman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Illing and Errington, 1991</xref>). These mutations correspond to either transposon insertions or point mutations in <italic>spoIIE</italic> locus that do not produce any active gene product and hence represent the null phenotype. Third, recent evidence suggests that SpoIIE preferentially localizes to the forespore side of the dividing septum, creating an asymmetry during polar division that might contribute to the asymmetry of FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guberman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). Hence, we set out to determine if SpoIIE regulates the divisome architecture during sporulation.</p><p>We first examined divisome architecture in <italic>spoIIE</italic> null mutant sporangia. Surprisingly, we noted that divisome architecture in <italic>spoIIE</italic> is similar to that in vegetative cells, with two series of dots corresponding to FtsAZ filaments present uniformly along the leading edge of the invaginating septum, in contrast to wild-type sporangia where they were present only on the mother cell side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C, N</xref>). We also observed several <italic>spoIIE</italic> sporangia with abortive septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, at ~42 ± 4 nm, the invaginating sporulation septum in <italic>spoIIE</italic> sporangia was comparable in thickness to the invaginating vegetative septum, implicating SpoIIE in regulating both the localization of FtsAZ filaments and the septal thickness during sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>). Of note, even though the length spanned by the bundle of FtsZ filaments in <italic>spoIIE</italic> sporulation septa was similar to that in the wild-type vegetative septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the invaginating <italic>spoIIE</italic> sporulation septa were still slightly thinner (by ~10 nm) than the invaginating vegetative septa. This suggests that there may be other unidentified factors in addition to SpoIIE that regulate the thickness of the sporulation septum.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Localization of FtsAZ filaments in SpoIIE mutant sporangia.</title><p>(<bold>A, D, G, J</bold>) Slice through a tomogram of a dividing (<bold>A</bold>) <italic>spoIIE</italic>, (<bold>D</bold>) <italic>spoIIE-ΔregI</italic>, (<bold>G</bold>) <italic>spoIIE-ΔregII</italic> and (<bold>J</bold>) <italic>malF-spoIIE</italic> sporangia.

Since SpoIIE directly binds FtsZ, one possible way SpoIIE could affect the localization of FtsZ filaments on the forespore side would be by competing directly with other cell division proteins that bind to FtsZ, including FtsA. Hence, we hypothesized that the interaction of SpoIIE with FtsZ may disrupt the interaction of FtsA with FtsZ on the forespore side. This could either be a result of direct competition faced by FtsA from SpoIIE for the binding site on FtsZ or due to possible membrane curving on the forespore side mediated by SpoIIE oligomers upon insertion of their large membrane-spanning segment, as has been previously reported in protein-packed environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stachowiak et al., 2012</xref>). In support of this, using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, in a few cells, we observed two foci on each side of the cell at the division septum corresponding to fluorescently tagged FtsA, a bright signal (orange arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) that constricts with the invaginating membrane and a faint signal (yellow arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) that remains at the intersection of the lateral and the septal cell wall above the brighter signal (likely on the forespore side). We also used structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to observe FtsA-mNeonGreen in dividing sporulating cells at a higher resolution. Again, in a few cells, we observed bright FtsA puncta (orange arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B, C</xref>) that colocalize with the invaginating septum and a faint FtsA punctum (yellow arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B, C</xref>) that is slightly above the brighter signal, presumably on the forespore side. Due to the resolution of the optical microscopy techniques, we cannot state with confidence that the fainter FtsA signal is in the forespore, but our data suggest that there are some FtsA filaments that remain at the intersection of the lateral and the septal cell wall above the FtsA filaments that constrict with the invaginating membrane. It is possible that SpoIIE causes the disassociation of these residual FtsA filaments from the divisome in the forespore as SpoIIE is only present on the forespore side of the invaginating septum so that cytokinesis exclusively proceeds from the mother cell side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).

First, we show that during vegetative growth, two cytoskeletal rings localize uniformly around the leading edge of the invaginating medial septum to orchestrate cell division, a membrane-proximal ring of FtsA filaments that tethers the membrane-distal ring of FtsZ filaments to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).

Third, our data suggest that during septal biogenesis the number of FtsAZ filaments tracking the sporulation septum is approximately half of that in the vegetative septum, which likely gives rise to a thinner sporulation septum by mediating the circumferential motion of fewer PG synthases around the division plane during sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F</xref>).

Although the overall mechanism of cytokinesis is conserved in that a Z-ring that recruits other components of the divisome is formed at the division site, there are subtle differences with regards to the spatial and the temporal regulation of the process and the composition of the divisome for the two types of bacteria.

One possible explanation for this difference between species is that cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> involves the constriction of a septal disc composed of thicker septal PG (~25 nm during sporulation and ~50 nm during vegetative growth) than in <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, where the septal disc consists of only ~4-nm-thick PG. Hence, cytokinesis in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> may require more FtsA filaments in order to tether the increased number of PG synthetases that are required to build a thicker septum during constriction. Other differences between our data and that from Gram-negative bacteria are the decreased lateral spacing between FtsZ filaments (~5.5 nm in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> vs. 6.5–8 nm in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. crescentus</italic>), and the shorter distances of the Z-ring and the A-ring from the membrane (~14 nm and ~6.5 nm, respectively, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> vs. ~16 nm and ~8 nm, respectively, in <italic>E. coli</italic>). It is possible that a tighter bundling of FtsAZ filaments with each other and with the membrane in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> may be necessary for the synthesis of the thick septal PG. Further studies will determine if these mechanisms of Z-ring and A-ring formation are also conserved in other sporulating and non-sporulating Gram-positive bacteria.</p><p>Our result that the Z-ring is mostly continuous during vegetative growth is similar to a previous cryo-ET study that also revealed the continuity of Z-rings in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>). However, this contrasts with super-resolution microscopy in which the Z-ring in both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> appeared patchy with regions of low fluorescence intensity that may indicate gaps in the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strauss et al., 2012</xref>). We note that cryo-ET has better spatial resolution than super-resolution microscopy and enables visualization of cellular structures in a near-native state. It is possible that we are unable to detect gaps in our cryo-FIB-ET data because they are either present in the cellular region that was ablated by cryo-FIB milling or not sampled due to missing wedge associated with cryo-ET data collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, these scenarios seem less likely because different tomograms capture different parts of the septal disc during constriction, and the ring appeared continuous in each of them. Thus, it seems likely that at least under the conditions used here the Z-ring is largely contiguous during constriction, although further studies are required to determine if this varies under other experimental conditions or at specific stages of FtsZ ring assembly, constriction or disassembly. During sporulation, we notice that the septal membranes are not as sharply defined as during vegetative growth, probably due to molecular crowding by membrane proteins that participate in cell division as well as those that are produced specifically during sporulation. Also, since FtsAZ are only present on the mother cell side and the distance spanned by the bundle around the invaginating septum is much shorter during sporulation, the filaments are detected in only a few slices in cross-sectional views as opposed to vegetative growth. These limitations make it difficult to conclude with confidence whether the Z-ring is also continuous during sporulation. However, the Z-ring is continuous during sporulation in SpoIIE sporangia in the tomograms we acquired, suggesting their continuous nature in at least under this condition during sporulation.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that during sporulation not only is there asymmetry associated with the positioning of the division septum within the cell, but also with the positioning of the division machinery at the septum, since FtsAZ filaments are only present on the mother cell side of the invaginating septum. This is an unanticipated observation. Further, we noted that only half the number of filaments assemble at the septum and track the division plane during sporulation than during vegetative growth, and that the septum is also half as thick in sporulating cells. These results suggest that the number of FtsAZ filaments could directly dictate the number of complexes involved in PG synthesis.</p><p>A thinner septum could be beneficial during sporulation in two ways. First, several protein complexes are proposed to form channels across both septal membranes during sporulation, including SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH and SpoIIIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaylock et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleming et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meisner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riley et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yen Shin et al., 2015</xref>). A thinner septum could facilitate interaction between the subunits located in the forespore and those in the mother cell. Second, a thinner septum may facilitate the phagocytosis-like process of engulfment, during which migration of the mother cell membrane is driven by the remodeling of the junction between the septal PG and the lateral PG via the coordinated synthesis and degradation of the septal PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). This remodeling event may be more straightforward if the sporulation septum contained relatively few or potentially only one layer of PG.</p><p>In addition to facilitating the formation of a thinner septum, asymmetric distribution of FtsAZ to the mother cell side of the septum may also be beneficial for other downstream events during sporulation. First, it is possible that such a strategy allows enough FtsAZ complexes to remain in the mother cell to support a second division site at the opposite cell pole as a backup should the first septum be misassembled or fail to support the onset of cell-specific gene expression. This second polar division site is dissolved after the onset of cell-specific gene expression by either the PG degradation complex SpoIIDMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eichenberger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pogliano et al., 1999</xref>) or MciZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisson-Filho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handler et al., 2008</xref>) in the mother cell. Retaining FtsAZ complexes in the mother cell would ensure their availability for the second division event at the distal pole.</p><p>Second, if FtsAZ complexes were present on the forespore side of the septum after septation, they may induce aberrant cell division events in the small forespore if their activity was not efficiently inhibited by the Min and the nucleoid occlusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Errington, 2004</xref>). Thus, ensuring that the forespore does not harbor active cytoskeletal filaments upon septation could provide an additional safety mechanism. Time-lapse microscopy of FtsA-mNeonGreen and FtsZ-mNeonGreen indicated that just after polar septation there was some FtsAZ signal in the forespore that gradually diminished as engulfment proceeded in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that there are protein(s) in the forespore that mediate degradation of FtsAZ polymers that do not participate in cell division yet remain in the forespore, ensuring an extra layer of safety mechanism to prevent any aberrant cell division events in the forespore. A recent study from the lab showed that certain proteins involved in central carbon metabolism and metabolic precursor synthesis were depleted specifically in the forespore after polar septation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riley et al., 2021b</xref>). Further studies will address if FtsAZ are depleted from the forespore via a similar mechanism.</p><p>Finally, we have previously shown that PG synthases, including Pbp2B, a component of the divisome, preferentially localize to the forespore side of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khanna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>), where they act together with the mother cell PG degradation complex SpoIIDMP to mediate the coordinated synthesis and degradation of the cell wall to drive engulfment membrane migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanism by which these proteins localize to the region of the forespore membrane that is adjacent to the migrating mother cell membrane remains unclear, but our fluorescence microscopy data indicate that at the onset of membrane constriction, a punctum of FtsA-mNeonGreen remains at the corner formed by the septum and the outer envelope likely in the forespore. It is possible that other cell division proteins such as those involved in cell wall synthesis also remain at this site, where they would be poised to participate in engulfment after the completion of cell division. Development of cryo-ET compatible electron-dense tags to track the localization of individual divisome proteins in conjunction with single-molecule studies will aid in testing these hypotheses in the future.</p><p>Asymmetric cell division is a common developmental theme in eukaryotes to generate progeny with diverse cellular fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li, 2013</xref>). In these cases of asymmetric cell division, the general theme is the establishment of cell division machinery along an axis of polarity and distribution of cell fate determinants in a polarized manner along this axis. In case of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation, an axis of polarity is likely established when the division plane shifts from medial to polar position and cell fate determinants are differentially distributed between the future forespore and the mother cell compartments at the onset of membrane constriction. In this study, we have identified SpoIIE as a cell fate determinant that also restricts FtsAZ filaments to the mother cell side of the asymmetrically positioned septum, likely by its preferential localization to the forespore side of the invaginating septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guberman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). We show that regions I and II of SpoIIE corresponding to the transmembrane domain and the FtsZ-binding domain, respectively, regulate the septal thickness and the distribution of FtsAZ at the sporulation septum. Region III, C-terminal part of SpoIIE, consists of a phosphatase domain that is essential to activate σ<sup>F</sup> in the forespore by dephosphorylating SpoIIAA after septum closure. It was previously shown that a SpoIIE mutant that is enzymatically inactive in dephosphorylating SpoIIA (D746A substitution) behaved similar to wild type with respect to polar septation during sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carniol et al., 2005</xref>). In another study, missense mutations <italic>spoIIE64</italic> and <italic>spoIIE71</italic> that map to region III of SpoIIE and affect its phosphatase activity were shown to have thin polar septa in thin-section electron microscopy images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barák and Youngman, 1996</xref>), suggesting that the phosphatase activity of SpoIIE likely does not affect the septal thickness. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the deletion of the entire region III or some other mutations in region III may play a role in regulating the septal thickness and/or FtsAZ localization at the septum. Also, investigating the physiological relevance of septal thickness during sporulation is complicated by the pleiotropic nature of SpoIIE mutations. SpoIIE directly participates in polar septation, but it is also required for the activation of σ<sup>F</sup> in the forespore, and consequently, the rest of the sporulation-specific σ factors. Although the two roles seem to depend on different parts of the protein, separating them is not straightforward, as making mutations that affect polar septation may also affect the localization of SpoIIE and, therefore, the protein might not be released to the forespore to activate σ<sup>F</sup>. Future studies to examine more mutations in different regions of SpoIIE and their overexpression will provide better insights into the mechanism of regulation of septal thickness by SpoIIE. Further biochemical and genetic studies are required to elucidate the cellular mechanism by which the nascent sporulation septum is assembled asymmetrically, so that SpoIIE, which is required for forespore-specific gene expression, assembles on the forespore side of the nascent septum, while FtsAZ rings assembles on the mother cell face of the nascent septum.</p><p>Our data provide a significant advancement in the understanding of the organization of the divisome, its regulators and its role in septal PG synthesis in <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> providing, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence for the asymmetric assembly of the divisome in bacteria and showing that this depends on the SpoIIE protein that is required for the onset of cell-specific gene expression. Future efforts to identify the molecular arrangement of FtsZ and its regulators inside the cell such as SpoIIE will aid in the development of new antimicrobials targeting the cell division machinery in important pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PY79)</td><td valign="top">PY79</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Youngman et al., 1984</xref></td><td valign="top">Tax.

Villa, Pogliano, and colleagues primarily uses cryo-electron tomography to image the division septa of vegetative and sporulating <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells, finding that the former involve larger, symmetric FtsAZ filaments whereas the latter involve asymmetric filaments. The sporulating septa feature FtsAZ filaments forming on the mother cell side, but not on the forespore side. Prior work had implicated SpoIIE in binding and regulating FtsZ, which this manuscript presents data to further support. The images presented are beautiful and the data convincingly support the cautious claims made, though it remains unclear how the SpoIIE-dependent regulation of FtsAZ filaments in the spore impacts sporulation. The paper also provides important evidence for the field that FtsZ may form continuous rings rather than the discontinuous rings suggested by fluorescence microscopy studies.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Asymmetric localization of the cell division machinery during <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> sporulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ethan C Garner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional work is required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that this paper presents some fascinating tomograms of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells that reveal (i) a potential asymmetry in the FtsZ/A rings formed during sporulation compared to the symmetric rings formed during vegetative growth and (ii) continuity of the FtsZ rings, in contrast to much of the light microscopy-based studies that have concluded Z rings are discontinuous. The work was deemed to be of significant interest to the broad bacterial cell biology field. However, a number of concerns and questions were raised that the reviewers felt should be addressed in a revision.</p><p>Although the <italic>eLife</italic> process typically involves the condensing of multiple reviews into a single list of requested changes, in this case, as you'll see, the reviewers each had quite different questions and concerns. So we collectively agreed that it would be best this time to provide the three reviews in their entirety. Most of the issues raised can be dealt with through changes in the text or presentation of data in figures. There are a couple of points raised by Reviewer 3 that suggest experiments – if these have been done and could be included, please do so, but they could alternatively be dealt with by adding appropriate discussion to the text. Reviewer 3 has also raised important concerns about the tomograms presented – to address these concerns, additional tomograms will need to be incorporated and presented in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper from Villa, Pogliano, and colleagues primarily uses cryo-electron tomography to image the division septa of vegetative and sporulating <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells, finding that the former involve larger, symmetric FtsAZ filaments whereas the latter involve asymmetric filaments. The sporulating septa feature FtsAZ filaments forming on the mother cell side, but not on the forespore side. Prior work had implicated SpoIIE in binding and regulating FtsZ, which this manuscript presents data to further support. The images presented are beautiful and the data generally support the cautious claims made. The paper is also very well written and easy to follow. I am, however, left wondering how the SpoIIE-dependent regulation of FtsAZ filaments in the spore impacts sporulation – in other words, the physiological significance of the findings reported were lacking and I wondered whether this could be better addressed.</p><p>Why does FtsA form a visible filament in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> but not in <italic>E. coli</italic> or C. crescentus (unless, apparently, FtsA is overexpressed)? The authors briefly mention that the stoichiometry is different, but I guess I'm asking more about what the functional consequences are for such different architectures of FtsA.</p><p>If the idea is that only half as much FtsAZ is present at sporulating septa given that it's only present on one side and not the other, why is the septal thickness decreased by 4X? Does this imply something else is contributing to/affecting septal thickness? Lines 185-195 may be explaining this, suggesting that there's also some remodeling of the vegetative septum after closure completes, but I think the authors could clarify things a bit better. And maybe a related point: do the authors think that the post-closure modification is a consequence of the thicker septum or just driven by some remodeling factor only produced during vegetative growth?</p><p>Related to the point above, the authors note later, on lines 236-240 that even in the spoIIE mutant the thickness is reduced relative to vegetative septa – is this now just a difference in post-closure remodeling?</p><p>Lines 222-23: Here and in the Intro the authors mention 'certain spoIIE mutants' that cause thicker septa. Can you be more specific? What's the nature of these mutants, i.e. internal deletions, point mutants, etc?</p><p>It seemed odd not to also examine a variant of SpoIIE lacking only region III to bolster the conclusion that &quot;both the TM and the FtsZ-binding domain are essential to regulate the localization of FtsAZ filaments…&quot; Also, related to the prior point, are there other known spoIIE mutants that localize properly by yield thicker septa that could be examined? And what about overexpressing regions I and II or just region II? Is this sufficient to make septa even thinner? What if such a construct were expressed in mother cells?</p><p>Are there mutants of FtsZ that don't interact with SpoIIE?</p><p>What's still missing for me at the end of the manuscript is an understanding of why this matters to spores? In other words, what's the physiological importance of blocking FtsAZ assembly in the forespore? Does the spore not mature properly? There are several models noted in the Discussion which I felt should've been experimentally probed to give this manuscript greater impact in terms of the physiological relevance and insight.</p><p>The finding noted in the Discussion that Z-rings are continuous in the tomograms, but not in super-resolution microscopy seems important to me and I was surprised this wasn't more fully fleshed out in the Results section. I think it should be, with some detailed description of whether the continuity is entirely 1D or whether lateral interactions/bundling interactions are needed for the continuity observed. And is this seen for vegetative and sporulation septa or do they differ in this regard?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper Khanna et al. is a novel, insightful, and exciting work, giving several important observations that help unravel the spatial organization and underlying mechanism of sporulation-specific septation. I think the paper is of sufficient quality to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are a few small issues that should be addressed first</p><p>1. Regarding the FtsA SIM imaging and the subsequent conclusion – &quot;These data suggest that FtsA is present but likely not incorporated into the cell division machinery on the forespore side of the septum&quot;.</p><p>Given that the septation septum is only 50nm thick and the resolution of SIM is (at best) 120nm, it's hard to believe the FtsA ring they observe in the forespore is associated with the septum at all, as FtsA associated with each side of the septum should not be resolvable from each other with this technique. This comment may have arisen a misinterpretation of the above statement, but currently the &quot;present but not associated&quot; leaves some ambiguity as to whether the FtsA is septum associated, or just present in the forespore. Perhaps more explicit phrasing could correct any confusion.</p><p>2. I was a bit surprised the authors consider the FtsZ filament arrangement in the spoIIE-ΔregII strain (Figure 3G-i) to be the same as in the spoIIE deletion strain, as there are some obvious (and perhaps meaningful) differences. In the spoIIE-ΔregII strain, the FtsZ filaments still appear to be off-shifted, but less as dramatically as in wild type. More dramatically, the filaments (per their color annotation) appear to be reduced by about half. Unless other images of this mutant are indeed more similar to wild-type cells, it might be worth noting the differences in this mutant, as to the reader, the spoIIE-ΔregII images kind of jump out as different compared to the other panels. Furthermore, if the reduction in filaments is reproducible, noting this might assist further studies into the role of the FtsZ binding domain of spoIIE in cell division.</p><p>3. Likewise, regarding the statement – &quot;Third, our data suggest that during septal biogenesis, the number of FtsAZ filaments tracking the sporulation septum is approximately half of that in the vegetative septum, which likely gives rise to a thinner sporulation septum by mediating the circumferential motion of fewer PG synthases around the division plane during sporulation (Figure 2G, H)&quot; – it should be noted that the spoIIE-ΔregII strain appears to have a reduced number of filaments (per their annotation), yet a similar septal thickness as the spoIIE null. Thus, explaining this discrepancy would help bolster their proposed link between septal thickness and number of FtsZ filaments.</p><p>4. The non-FtsA associated filaments along the length of the septa shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 panel are very intriguing, but the explanation of how they could remain membrane-associated is a bit vague, and should be further elucidated. Given FtsZ itself cannot associate with the membrane, are the authors proposing the extended linker allow FtsZ filaments to associate with the membrane by associating with each other at a distance, or do the authors think these stray filaments are binding to the membrane through another protein like EzrA or SepF?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study uses electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) to image and investigate filament systems in cell division during both vegetative growth and sporulation in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. This is made possible by the inclusion of cryo FIB milling in the workflow to thin Bacillus cells that would otherwise be too thick for cryo-ET. The authors start by showing that FtsZ and FtsA form membrane distal- and proximal filaments and also that the filaments form small sheets and most likely form a continuous division ring, as previously reported by cryo-ET for <italic>E. coli</italic> and C. crescentus, but in disagreement with super-resolution light microscopy data. The authors then compare the distribution of filaments between vegetative and sporulation septa, and demonstrate that in sporulation septa, the filaments are only found on the mother cell side of the septum and this asymmetry is potentially mediated by SpoIIE. Sporulation septa are significantly thinner than vegetative septa and they propose that this thickness difference is caused by fewer FtsAZ filaments resulting in less peptidoglycan inclusion, possibly mediated by SpoIIE competing with FtsA for FtsZ binding sites. Generally, the work is well presented and clearly a lot of thought has gone into the presentation of figures to make the data understandable to readers who are less familiar with looking at tomography data.</p><p>The one-sided asymmetric nature of the filaments in the sporulation septum as depicted in Figure 2C-F is unfortunately not fully convincing as evidenced by the figures presented. The quality of this tomogram is not as good as some of the others and this reviewer finds that the one-sided nature of the filaments is not fully supported by the data as presented. Can more examples of this be shown/be provided? How many times was this observed and was it the case for all tomograms of sporulation septa? The reviewer is aware of the technically demanding nature of the work but the data need to be convincing especially when low-contrast cryo-ET data is being interpreted. As the conclusions from the SpoIIE mutant experiments later in the paper plus the overall conclusions rely heavily on the filaments only being present on the mother cell side I think it is important that the evidence for this is fully convincing.</p><p>When tomogram slices are displayed side by side with and without filaments annotated, the annotation of the filaments is sometimes a bit misleading. In the xy views the dots are generally shown as regularly spaced when often this is not the case when examining the densities in the unannotated view, particularly for the membrane proximal filaments. They are also often shown spanning a greater distance than they are convincingly present in the tomogram slice. When viewed in the xz plane the filaments are often depicted as continuous when they are not convincingly, plus extending further in distance than they are present/imaged given the missing wedge issues. In the text it mentions that the filaments are not necessarily continuous, particularly for FtsA and it would be better if the annotation in the figures reflected that in the real data since they are not always perfectly arranged and continuous, nor would this necessarily expected to be the case (as the authors state correctly).</p><p>Overall, the work is interesting and provides more evidence for important disagreements in the bacterial cell division field. If more or more convincing evidence can be provided for some of the major conclusions, this work would make a really nice contribution and should be published.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62204.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper from Villa, Pogliano, and colleagues primarily uses cryo-electron tomography to image the division septa of vegetative and sporulating <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells, finding that the former involve larger, symmetric FtsAZ filaments whereas the latter involve asymmetric filaments. The sporulating septa feature FtsAZ filaments forming on the mother cell side, but not on the forespore side. Prior work had implicated SpoIIE in binding and regulating FtsZ, which this manuscript presents data to further support. The images presented are beautiful and the data generally support the cautious claims made. The paper is also very well written and easy to follow. I am, however, left wondering how the SpoIIE-dependent regulation of FtsAZ filaments in the spore impacts sporulation – in other words, the physiological significance of the findings reported were lacking and I wondered whether this could be better addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and questions, which have improved our manuscript. We hope that our answers below address their concerns, and that our revised text clarifies these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why does FtsA form a visible filament in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> but not in <italic>E. coli</italic> or C. crescentus (unless, apparently, FtsA is overexpressed)? The authors briefly mention that the stoichiometry is different, but I guess I'm asking more about what the functional consequences are for such different architectures of FtsA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. The functional consequences of different architecture of FtsA are not known, but we speculate that it might be related to the different thickness of the septal PG in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We have included a paragraph in the discussion addressing this point (lines 361-366): “One possible explanation for this difference between species is that cell division in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> involves the constriction of a septal disc composed of thicker septal PG (~25 nm during sporulation and ~50 nm during vegetative growth) than in <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, where the septal disc consists of only ~4 nm thick PG. Hence, cytokinesis in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> may require more FtsA filaments in order to tether the increased number of PG synthetases that are required to build a thicker septum during constriction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the idea is that only half as much FtsAZ is present at sporulating septa given that it's only present on one side and not the other, why is the septal thickness decreased by 4X? Does this imply something else is contributing to/affecting septal thickness? Lines 185-195 may be explaining this, suggesting that there's also some remodeling of the vegetative septum after closure completes, but I think the authors could clarify things a bit better. And maybe a related point: do the authors think that the post-closure modification is a consequence of the thicker septum or just driven by some remodeling factor only produced during vegetative growth?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to clarify this point. We have expanded the discussion in lines 212-228 to better address it. One likely explanation for the increase in the thickness of the vegetative septum after it is formed is that, during vegetative growth, the septum splits to generate two equal daughter cells upon closure. This process requires the activity of several cell wall hydrolases that cleave PG crosslinks leading to the expansion of the cell wall by distributing forces across the cell surface, which would result in an increase in septal thickness (Huang et al., 2008; Lee and Huang, 2013). Hence, we speculate that during vegetative growth, the increase in the thickness of the septum upon closure is a consequence of septal remodeling due to activity of PG hydrolases. However, during sporulation, the two cells formed (forespore and mother cell) do not split. Rather, one cell (mother cell) engulfs the other (forespore). Hence, remodeling of septal PG by cell wall hydrolases that participate in splitting of the two daughter cells during vegetative growth likely does not happen during sporulation. As a result, the thickness of the sporulation septum after it is formed remains almost the same as during constriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the point above, the authors note later, on lines 236-240 that even in the spoIIE mutant the thickness is reduced relative to vegetative septa – is this now just a difference in post-closure remodeling?</p></disp-quote><p>The septal thickness of ~42 nm in SpoIIE mutant in the modified lines 275-278 (previously 236-240) corresponds to that of the invaginating septa (not post-closure). We apologize for the confusion and we have included the words “invaginating” wherever appropriate in the text for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 222-23: Here and in the Intro the authors mention 'certain spoIIE mutants' that cause thicker septa. Can you be more specific? What's the nature of these mutants, i.e. internal deletions, point mutants, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have added a short description of these mutations in lines 257-259: “These mutations correspond to either transposon insertions or point mutations in <italic>spoIIE</italic> locus that do not produce any active gene product and hence represent the null phenotype.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seemed odd not to also examine a variant of SpoIIE lacking only region III to bolster the conclusion that &quot;both the TM and the FtsZ-binding domain are essential to regulate the localization of FtsAZ filaments…&quot; Also, related to the prior point, are there other known spoIIE mutants that localize properly by yield thicker septa that could be examined? And what about overexpressing regions I and II or just region II? Is this sufficient to make septa even thinner? What if such a construct were expressed in mother cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that examining other SpoIIE mutant strains that lack region III or strains that overexpress regions I and II would be informative. However, due to the demanding resources and time required to perform each of the cryo-ET experiments and the current circumstances, we respectfully find them beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we have expanded the discussion to better explain the phenotypes associated with mutations in the different SpoIIE regions, specifically region III in lines 474-496 of the Discussion section to better support our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there mutants of FtsZ that don't interact with SpoIIE?</p></disp-quote><p>Currently, we are unaware of any mutants of FtsZ previously reported in the literature that do not interact with SpoIIE. However, strains with mutations in the C-terminus of FtsZ have been previously reported to exhibit several abnormal morphologies and altered interactions with other FtsZ-binding proteins (Feucht and Errington, 2005; Król et al., 2012; Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009). Testing these strains for their interaction with SpoIIE should further the biochemical basis of interaction of FtsZ and SpoIIE in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What's still missing for me at the end of the manuscript is an understanding of why this matters to spores? In other words, what's the physiological importance of blocking FtsAZ assembly in the forespore? Does the spore not mature properly? There are several models noted in the Discussion which I felt should've been experimentally probed to give this manuscript greater impact in terms of the physiological relevance and insight.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, we have speculated on some of the downstream consequences of restricting FtsAZ assembly to the mother cell and the role of a thinner sporulation septa for the completion of engulfment in the Discussion section. Exhaustively testing all possible models in the manuscript is beyond the scope of the manuscript and complicated by several factors. Investigating the physiological relevance of septal thickness during sporulation is confounded by the pleiotropic nature of SpoIIE mutations. SpoIIE directly participates in polar septation, but it is also required for the activation of σ<sup>F</sup> in the forespore, and consequently, the rest of the sporulation-specific σ factors. Although the two roles seem to depend on different parts of the protein, separating them is not straightforward, as mutations that affect polar septation may also affect the localization of SpoIIE and therefore, the protein might not be released to the forespore to activate σ<sup>F</sup>. In addition, after the polar septum has been formed, several sporulation-specific proteins are produced, some of which form channels across both the septal membranes and some that are involved in PG remodeling (like SpoIIDMP) (as discussed in lines 410-420). These proteins may play additional roles in regulating the septal thickness and physiology. Hence, separating the role of sporulation-specific proteins produced after polar septation from that of IIE in regulating septal thickness is not straightforward, and will likely require thorough genetic analysis. In addition, cryo-FIB-ET experiments are time intensive, challenging and costly, so it is simply not feasible to perform a more comprehensive analysis in this paper.</p><p>We made another observation regarding the fate of FtsAZ in the forespore. Time lapse microscopy of FtsA-mNeonGreen and FtsZ-mNeonGreen indicated that just after polar septation, FtsAZ signal in the forespore gradually diminished as engulfment proceeded in these cells (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). It is possible that there are protein(s) in the forespore that mediate degradation of any FtsAZ polymers that don’t participate in cell division but remain behind in the forespore, ensuring an extra layer of safety mechanism to prevent any aberrant cell division events in the forespore. Another recent study from the lab showed that certain proteins involved in central carbon metabolism and metabolic precursor synthesis were depleted specifically in the forespore after polar septation (Riley et al., 2021), although we do not know at this point if the mechanism of depletion of these proteins is similar to that of FtsAZ. Future studies will be required to address this point. We have expanded the Discussion section (lines 438-447) to include these additional insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The finding noted in the Discussion that Z-rings are continuous in the tomograms, but not in super-resolution microscopy seems important to me and I was surprised this wasn't more fully fleshed out in the Results section. I think it should be, with some detailed description of whether the continuity is entirely 1D or whether lateral interactions/bundling interactions are needed for the continuity observed. And is this seen for vegetative and sporulation septa or do they differ in this regard?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have now modified the Results section in lines 165-176 to discuss the continuity of Z-rings in vegetative cells. We have also shown the distribution of intensity values for the region traced by the Z-and A-rings in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 that suggest the more continuous nature of Z-ring compared to the A-ring during vegetative growth. During sporulation, we notice that the septum is not as sharp as during vegetative growth, probably due to molecular crowding by membrane proteins that participate in cell division as well as those that are produced specifically during sporulation (Figure 7). Also, since FtsAZ are only present on the mother cell side and the distance spanned by the filament bundle is much shorter, the filaments are detected in only a few slices in cross-sectional views as opposed to vegetative growth. These limitations make it difficult to conclude with confidence whether the Z-ring is continuous or not during sporulation (included in lines 184-189 in the Results section). However, the Z-rings appear continuous during sporulation in SpoIIE sporangia in the tomograms we acquired (Figure 8), suggesting their continuous nature in at least under this condition during sporulation. We have expanded the Discussion section (lines 391400) to include these insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper Khanna et al. is a novel, insightful, and exciting work, giving several important observations that help unravel the spatial organization and underlying mechanism of sporulation-specific septation. I think the paper is of sufficient quality to be published in eLife. However, there are a few small issues that should be addressed first</p><p>1. Regarding the FtsA SIM imaging and the subsequent conclusion – &quot;These data suggest that FtsA is present but likely not incorporated into the cell division machinery on the forespore side of the septum&quot;.</p><p>Given that the septation septum is only 50nm thick and the resolution of SIM is (at best) 120nm, it's hard to believe the FtsA ring they observe in the forespore is associated with the septum at all, as FtsA associated with each side of the septum should not be resolvable from each other with this technique. This comment may have arisen a misinterpretation of the above statement, but currently the &quot;present but not associated&quot; leaves some ambiguity as to whether the FtsA is septum associated, or just present in the forespore. Perhaps more explicit phrasing could correct any confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the description in the lines 309 – 325 to avoid any confusion regarding the interpretation of SIM and time-lapse imaging data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I was a bit surprised the authors consider the FtsZ filament arrangement in the spoIIE-ΔregII strain (Figure 3G-i) to be the same as in the spoIIE deletion strain, as there are some obvious (and perhaps meaningful) differences. In the spoIIE-ΔregII strain, the FtsZ filaments still appear to be off-shifted, but less as dramatically as in wild type. More dramatically, the filaments (per their color annotation) appear to be reduced by about half. Unless other images of this mutant are indeed more similar to wild-type cells, it might be worth noting the differences in this mutant, as to the reader, the spoIIE-ΔregII images kind of jump out as different compared to the other panels. Furthermore, if the reduction in filaments is reproducible, noting this might assist further studies into the role of the FtsZ binding domain of spoIIE in cell division.</p></disp-quote><p>For the previous Figure 3G-I (now modified Figure 8D-F), we showed a slice from the middle of the tomogram. This particular tomogram was from a very thin lamella (~70 nm thickness) and hence some of the densities corresponding to FtsZ filaments were not visible in the representative slice in the figure panel. We have now added a supplemental figure, Figure 8—figure supplement 3 wherein some of the FtsZ densities are also visible on the mother cell side in another slice for the same tomogram shown in the now modified Figure 8D-F. We have also added a movie showing the different slices of the tomogram (Video 4). In addition, we have added another tomogram in Figure 8—figure supplement 4 for the <italic>spoIIE-ΔregII</italic> strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Likewise, regarding the statement – &quot;Third, our data suggest that during septal biogenesis, the number of FtsAZ filaments tracking the sporulation septum is approximately half of that in the vegetative septum, which likely gives rise to a thinner sporulation septum by mediating the circumferential motion of fewer PG synthases around the division plane during sporulation (Figure 2G, H)&quot; – it should be noted that the spoIIE-ΔregII strain appears to have a reduced number of filaments (per their annotation), yet a similar septal thickness as the spoIIE null. Thus, explaining this discrepancy would help bolster their proposed link between septal thickness and number of FtsZ filaments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern in comment 2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The non-FtsA associated filaments along the length of the septa shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 panel are very intriguing, but the explanation of how they could remain membrane-associated is a bit vague, and should be further elucidated. Given FtsZ itself cannot associate with the membrane, are the authors proposing the extended linker allow FtsZ filaments to associate with the membrane by associating with each other at a distance, or do the authors think these stray filaments are binding to the membrane through another protein like EzrA or SepF?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have elaborated the description for these stray filaments and how they may anchor to the membrane in the lines 142-147 of the revised manuscript as follows: “This is substantiated by previous studies showing that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> can grow without FtsA, although albeit slowly and in a filamentous manner (Beall and Lutkenhaus, 1992). Instead, FtsZ may use an alternate anchor like SepF or EzrA to bind to the membrane in the absence of FtsA as these divisome proteins also have an N-terminal domain that binds to the membrane and a C-terminal domain that interacts with FtsZ (Duman et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The one-sided asymmetric nature of the filaments in the sporulation septum as depicted in Figure 2C-F is unfortunately not fully convincing as evidenced by the figures presented. The quality of this tomogram is not as good as some of the others and this reviewer finds that the one-sided nature of the filaments is not fully supported by the data as presented. Can more examples of this be shown/be provided? How many times was this observed and was it the case for all tomograms of sporulation septa? The reviewer is aware of the technically demanding nature of the work but the data need to be convincing especially when low-contrast cryo-ET data is being interpreted. As the conclusions from the SpoIIE mutant experiments later in the paper plus the overall conclusions rely heavily on the filaments only being present on the mother cell side I think it is important that the evidence for this is fully convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. For the particular tomogram shown in the previous Figure 2C-F (now modified Figure 7A-C), the tomogram by itself is of good quality compared to others we have shown in the manuscript, but we found that the membranes at the leading edge of the nascent septum in sporulating cells are not as defined as in vegetative cells or in SpoIIE mutants. We have discussed this in the lines 184-189 in the Results section. In summary, in addition to the presence of transmembrane cell division proteins, several sporulation-specific multipass transmembrane proteins like SpoIIE, SpoIIGA, and SpoIIIE are present at the invaginating septal membrane during sporulation that increase the ratio of protein to membrane at the septal membrane. This makes the bilayer less sharp compared to its in other conditions (like vegetative growth) that we imaged.</p><p>We acquired a total of 11 tomograms of dividing sporulating cells. Of these, we detected the filaments and their localization in mother cell in both the top view and the rotated view clearly in 4 tomograms. We have shown two of them in Figure 7—figure supplement 2,3. Of the remaining tomograms, 1 was too thick and 2 had just started constricting, and we couldn’t detect any clear FtsAZ filaments/dots in these 3. The remaining 4 tomograms were on the verge of completing septum formation. At these later stages of polar septum formation, we clearly detected FtsAZ filaments in top views in 2 of the tomograms (one instance shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 4). Likely, the filamentous rings were closing in at this point and some FtsAZ subunits may have already started to localize to the opposite pole to form the second septum or may have been disassembled. The other 2 of the 4 tomograms were at a very late stage of septum constriction with a gap of ~60-70 nm between the left and the right septa in the middle slice and we could not detect any filaments/dots corresponding to FtsAZ at this stage. We also observed FtsAZ dots/filaments localized only in the mother cell side of the dividing septa in two mutant sporangia – SpoIIB and SpoIIIE<sup>ATP-</sup> (tomogram corresponding to SpoIIIE<sup>ATP-</sup> shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 5). Although both SpoIIB and SpoIIIE localize to the leading edges of the invaginating septa during sporulation, there is no evidence of direction interaction between FtsZ and either of these two proteins, suggesting that the localization of FtsAZ filaments in SpoIIB and SpoIII<sup>ATP-</sup> mutant sporangia should mimic that of wild type. Hence, every time we detected FtsAZ filaments in SpoIIE+ sporulating septa, they were associated with the mother-cell side of the septum. Taking all the above data into account, we believe that our observation that during sporulation, FtsAZ filaments are present on the mother cell side of the invaginating septum stands firm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When tomogram slices are displayed side by side with and without filaments annotated, the annotation of the filaments is sometimes a bit misleading. In the xy views the dots are generally shown as regularly spaced when often this is not the case when examining the densities in the unannotated view, particularly for the membrane proximal filaments. They are also often shown spanning a greater distance than they are convincingly present in the tomogram slice. When viewed in the xz plane the filaments are often depicted as continuous when they are not convincingly, plus extending further in distance than they are present/imaged given the missing wedge issues. In the text it mentions that the filaments are not necessarily continuous, particularly for FtsA and it would be better if the annotation in the figures reflected that in the real data since they are not always perfectly arranged and continuous, nor would this necessarily expected to be the case (as the authors state correctly).</p></disp-quote><p>Our rationale behind showing two slices, one annotated and another unannotated, was to guide readers who are not familiar with studying cryo-ET data, while letting them compare the two slices to look at the cytoskeletal filaments in a given location of the tomogram. In the process, we inadvertently annotated slices/locations that did not point directly to each filament in the xy slices (as dots) or xz/yz rotated views (as filaments – continuous/non-continuous). We have now made sure to highlight FtsZ dots (membrane-distal) correctly in all the xy views. Further, where we could not resolve distinctive dots or filaments, we have depicted them as dashed lines. As a consequence, to ensure that data is not overinterpreted, FtsA filaments (membrane-proximal) in xy slices are often showed as dashed lines instead of dots where it wasn’t possible to resolve individual cross sections of filaments (dots) with confidence. To represent the cytoskeletal filaments in rotated views (xz/yz slices), we now use dashed lines (instead of continuous lines) for both FtsA and FtsZ filaments as assigning precise continuity at the pixel levels for all images is limited by the nature of the data (i.e., missing wedge and signal to noise ratio). We have also taken care to not overextend the annotation of the filaments. We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We have made a note for these annotations in Figure legend 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
