causative agent of human sleeping sickness. The parasites’ variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) enables them to evade adaptive immunity via antigenic variation. VSG comprises 10% of total cell protein and the high stability of VSG mRNA is essential for trypanosome survival. To determine how VSG mRNA stability is maintained, we used mRNA affinity purification to identify all its associated proteins. CFB2 (cyclin F-box protein 2), an unconventional RNA-binding protein with an F-box domain, was specifically enriched with VSG mRNA. We demonstrate that CFB2 is essential for VSG mRNA stability, describe cis acting elements within the VSG 3'-untranslated region that regulate the interaction, identify trans-acting factors that are present in the VSG messenger ribonucleoprotein particle, and mechanistically explain how CFB2 stabilizes the mRNA of this key pathogenicity factor. Beyond <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the mRNP purification approach has the potential to supply detailed biological insight into metabolism of relatively abundant mRNAs in any eukaryote.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>VSG</kwd><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic></kwd><kwd>CFB2</kwd><kwd>antigenic variation</kwd><kwd>F-box</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>649019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papavasiliou</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001661</institution-id><institution>University of Heidelberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ND</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clayton</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A robust procedure to purify mRNAs and their associated proteins identify CFB2 as the critical protein that binds and influences the fate of the main virulence factor in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the cytosol, eukaryotic mRNAs interact with numerous proteins that influence mRNA folding, localization, translation efficiency, and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khong and Parker, 2020</xref>). The resulting messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) contains, on average, about 15 proteins (and sometimes also regulatory RNAs) which may have competing activities and change during the lifetime of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khong and Parker, 2020</xref>). The behaviour of individual transcripts in vivo is therefore the result of dynamic interactions between the various mRNP components and can only be understood if the identities of those components are known. However, although there are now numerous papers that take a protein-centric approach – cataloguing the mRNAs that are bound to specific proteins – cataloguing the components of individual mRNPs has proven to be extremely challenging, mainly because of the very low molar ratio of mRNAs to proteins in cells. Consequently, so far there has been only one report of successful purification of native eukaryotic mRNPs, which characterized the proteins bound to two abundant GFP reporter mRNAs in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Theil et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<italic>T. brucei</italic>) is a unicellular eukaryotic parasite that causes lethal diseases, including human sleeping sickness, in sub-Saharan Africa. <italic>T. brucei</italic> and related ‘salivarian’ trypanosomes are transmitted between mammals by tsetse flies, proliferating in the midgut as the ‘procyclic’ form. Within mammals, ‘bloodstream-form’ <italic>T. brucei</italic> multiply in the blood and tissue fluids. If untreated, human sleeping sickness is almost always lethal, while infections of domestic animals with salivarian trypanosomes cause immense economic damage. The infections can last months or years, because <italic>T. brucei</italic> escapes the host immune system by periodically changing its highly antigenic surface coat.</p><p>The genome organization of trypanosomes and related organisms is unusual, since protein-coding genes lack individual promoters. Instead, they are arranged in long polycistronic transcription units that are constitutively transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Individual mRNAs are co-transcriptionally excised: a capped 5'-end is created by <italic>trans</italic> splicing of a 39 nt capped ‘spliced leader’ RNA, and the 3'-end is generated by cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton, 2019</xref>). As a consequence, trypanosomes rely heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms for control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton, 2019</xref>). Abundant mRNAs are usually very stable and are often transcribed from multiple gene copies. Differential regulation is effected by numerous sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that influence mRNA processing, translation, and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lueong et al., 2016</xref>). The parasites also have six different isoforms of the cap-binding translation initiation factor eIF4E (EIF4E1-6), five different versions of its partner eIF4G (EIF4G1-5), and two versions of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP1 and PABP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zoltner et al., 2018</xref>). In various combinations, these are implicated in either enhancing or suppressing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Freire et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Terrao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>This surface of salivarian trypanosomes is composed of ~11 million variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) molecules that are mono-allelically expressed from specialized telomeric expression sites. In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, each expression site consists of an RNA polymerase I promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Günzl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kooter and Borst, 1984</xref>) followed by several different ‘expression site-associated genes’ (<italic>ESAG</italic>s), some repetitive sequences, the <italic>VSG</italic> gene, and finally, telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hutchinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Müller et al., 2018</xref>). Although there are at least 10 alternative expression sites, all but one are suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms. Antigenic variation is effected through a combination of expression site transcription switching, and genetic rearrangements that replace the currently expressed <italic>VSG</italic> gene with a different one from a repertoire of alternative <italic>VSG</italic> genes located at telomeres or in sub-telomeric arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jackson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faria et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Production of functional mRNAs by RNA polymerase I is possible in trypanosomes because the cap, which is necessary for translation, is added by <italic>trans</italic> splicing. For <italic>VSG</italic>, polymerase I transcription is also necessary in order to produce large amounts of mRNA from a single gene: <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA comprises at least 5% of total mRNA, and RNA polymerase I transcription from <italic>VSG</italic> promoters is at least 10 times more efficient than transcription of chromosome-internal regions RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton, 2019</xref>). Moreover, association of the active <italic>VSG</italic> expression site with the site of spliced leader RNA production results in extremely efficient processing of the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Faria et al., 2020</xref>). However, these measures alone do not suffice: the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA is also extremely stable, having a half-life of 1–2 hr compared with less than 20 min for most other mRNAs, including <italic>ESAG</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ehlers et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vanhamme et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ridewood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fadda et al., 2014</xref>). This stability has been shown to require a 16-mer sequence within the VSG 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), which is common to these otherwise highly variant genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ridewood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berberof et al., 1995</xref>). After uptake into the tsetse fly vector, as the trypanosomes convert to the procyclic form, <italic>VSG</italic> transcription is shut off, the mRNA becomes unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ehlers et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berberof et al., 1995</xref>), and the VSG coat is lost.</p><p>In this work, we aimed to determine the mechanism by which <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA stability is maintained, by identifying proteins that are specifically associated with the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNP. As a control, we studied the mRNA encoding alpha tubulin (<italic>TUB</italic>), which is transcribed by RNA polymerase II from at least 19 tandemly repeated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ersfeld et al., 1998</xref>), is also relatively stable, and comprises about 1.5% of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fadda et al., 2014</xref>). Through sequential purification of the two mRNPs, we were able to identify not only proteins that were in both mRNPs, and some that were specific to either <italic>VSG</italic> or <italic>TUB</italic>. This enabled us to identify CFB2 (cyclin F-box protein 2), a protein that specifically stabilizes <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA through recruitment of a stabilizing, translation-promoting complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>VSG</italic> mRNP proteome</title><p>To investigate the mechanism by which <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA is stabilized in bloodstream forms, we purified the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNP from cells expressing one particular VSG: VSG2. We, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Theil et al., 2019</xref>, adapted methods previously applied to capture proteins associated with the <italic>Xist</italic> noncoding RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Minajigi et al., 2015</xref>). After UV cross-linking of proteins to RNA, we used biotinylated 90-mers complementary to the entire <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) to purify the <italic>VSG</italic> and <italic>TUB</italic> mRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The two mRNAs were purified sequentially, in alternating order, from the same cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to make the background for each as similar as possible; in principle it should be possible to add a third or even a fourth purification to the cascade. At least 1000-fold purification relative to rRNA was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting final mRNA:rRNA ratios of ~1:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haanstra et al., 2008</xref>). Quantitative mass spectrometry detected 664 different proteins with at least two peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, sheet 5). 97 proteins were found in all three <italic>VSG</italic> replicates, and 18 in all three <italic>TUB</italic> replicates; this discrepancy probably reflects the relative abundances of the mRNAs in the original lysates. RNA-binding-domain proteins associated with both mRNAs included DRBD18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lott et al., 2015</xref>), RBP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wurst et al., 2009</xref>), UBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartmann et al., 2007</xref>), DRBD3/PTB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Estévez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stern et al., 2009</xref>), and RBP42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, RBP3 was significantly more enriched with <italic>TUB</italic> than with <italic>VSG</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, sheets 3 and 5). RBP3 is essential for normal bloodstream-form trypanosome growth but a previous microarray analysis did not detect the RBP3-<italic>TUB</italic> mRNA association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wurst et al., 2009</xref>).

To decrease background, samples were treated with DNase I. The supernatant was collected, and the second set of ribonucleoprotein complexes (VSG2 or TUB) was captured in a similar way.

Of these, all but three were detected in the total poly(A)+ mRNP proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lueong et al., 2016</xref>), supporting direct binding to mRNA in vivo. The proteins with general mRNA-related functions – PABP2, helicases, translation factors, and ribosomal proteins – were probably enriched because <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA is more abundant than <italic>TUB. VSG</italic> mRNA-associated proteins with known RNA-binding domains were ALBA3, ZC3H28, ZC3H32, ZC3H41.

The abundance of this protein was increased by prior incubation of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that it is unstable.

To examine the functions of both the SKP1 and MKT1 interaction motifs, we expressed various mutants as fusion proteins, with the lambdaN peptide at the N-terminus and a myc tag at the C-terminus, testing their expression and ability to enhance expression of a boxB reporter. Both deletion and mutation of the F-box motif increased fusion protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>), implicating the F-box in auto-regulation of the stability ectopically expressed CFB2 protein.

The 100-fold dilution of 6×His-GB-CFB2 expressing cells (lane 3) gives roughly the same CFB2 band intensity as the markers (probably 1–5 µg each, data not available).

Lanes 8–11 are equivalent <italic>E.coli</italic> extracts, but the cells express 6×His-Trx-CPSF73; larger amounts of input protein were used because the recombinant protein was poorly expressed (see panel A). Lane 12 is an extract of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> expressing AD-CFB2-myc; insufficient is present for detection. The top panel shows that the antibody interacts with 6×His-GB-CFB2, and not with 6×His-Trx-CPSF73, although there is a faint cross-reaction with a constitutively expressed <italic>E. coli</italic> protein of around 60 kDa. The purified antibody, which was raised against CFB2-NusA, is therefore interacting predominantly with CFB2 (trypanosomes do not contain NusA).

Expression of CFB2-myc had no effect on GFP expression if the actin 3'-UTR was used (<italic>GFP-ACT)</italic>, but caused marked increases in expression with the <italic>VSG</italic> 3'-UTR was used (<italic>GFP-VSG</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). Expression of the reporter with the 8-mer mutation (<italic>GFP-VSGm8</italic>) was also enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, preliminary results derived from a single clone indicated that expression from a reporter with a scrambled upstream region (GFP-VSGups) was also enhanced upon CFB2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the reporter with mutant 16-mer was unaffected by CFB2-myc expression (<italic>GFP-VSGm16</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). As expected, the HDPY mutant of CFB2, which cannot interact with MKT1, had no effect on reporter expression. In some clones, the HDPY mutant was also equally expressed in the presence and absence of tetracycline, indicating a lack of selection for strong regulation, whereas the wild-type protein was undetectable without induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the effect of CFB2 on the reporters was indeed caused by specific binding, we immunoprecipitated CFB2-myc and detected the reporter mRNAs by reverse transcription and RT-qPCR. We then compared the amounts of precipitated <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA to the background precipitation of <italic>TUB</italic> mRNA. Expression of <italic>GFP-VSGm16</italic> was unfortunately too low for quantitative detection. However, compared with <italic>GFP-ACT</italic>, <italic>GFP-VSG</italic> mRNA was sixfold more abundant in the CFB2 pull-downs, and similar enrichment was seen for <italic>GFP-VSGm8</italic>.</p><p>The results confirmed that CFB2 binds specifically to the <italic>VSG</italic> 3'-UTR and that binding is unaffected by mutation of the conserved 8-mer.

Success of such procedures depends on their use to target mRNAs that have relatively high abundance; since we could identify proteins that were specifically associated with the alpha-TUB mRNA, the threshold probably lies somewhere below 1% of total mRNA. The major limitation is the fact that mRNAs are about a thousand times less abundant than protein in cell lysates, so that a one-step purification is bound to be dominated by abundant protein contaminants. Because of this, most previous successful attempts at mRNA-centric purification of interacting proteins have employed in vitro affinity purification using relatively short RNAs as baits (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gerber, 2021</xref>). Purification of proteins bound in vivo to abundant structural RNAs is, in contrast, less challenging (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>). To our knowledge, there has so far been only one other report of successful characterization of specific native mRNPs. The approach used was conceptually very similar to ours, although the reported results relied on GFP reporters, which potentially loses coding region-specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Theil et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we show here that when native sequences are purified, our procedure can be used to purify at least two – and probably, several more – different mRNPs from the same extracts. This is useful not only in saving biological material, but also because, if the order of RNA selection is varied, the different purifications act as internal specificity controls.</p><p>The role of the 3'-UTR in <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA abundance was demonstrated a quarter of a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berberof et al., 1995</xref>), and conservation of 3'-UTR sequences was reported even earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Majumder et al., 1981</xref>). It was also known that the action of the 3'-UTR is stage specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berberof et al., 1995</xref>), and that <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA is degraded during differentiation to the procyclic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Overath et al., 1983</xref>). By purifying the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA together with its associated proteins, we have now identified CFB2 as the protein responsible for <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA retention in bloodstream forms. Moreover, we could demonstrate the mechanism by which CFB2 acts: recruitment of a stabilizing complex that includes MKT1, PBP1, PABP2, and the cap-binding translation initiation complex EIF4E6/G5. CFB2 action depends on the presence of a conserved 16-mer in the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA 3'-UTR. This sequence is also required for m6A modification of the <italic>VSG</italic> poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Viegas et al., 2020</xref>). In principle, CFB2 might recognize either the 16-mer or m6A. However, m6A is present on many mRNAs in addition to <italic>VSG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Viegas et al., 2020</xref>), whereas CFB2 depletion resulted in highly specific <italic>VSG</italic> loss. We therefore suggest that CFB2 recognizes the 16-mer.</p><p>Although <italic>VSG</italic> transcription is shut off in procyclic forms, the parasites appear to have a fail-safe mechanism that ensures that any accidentally produced <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA is rapidly degraded. We find here that a conserved 8-mer sequence in the <italic>VSG</italic> 3'-UTR is implicated in this. Loss of <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA stability during differentiation is therefore the result of a combination of two processes: the disappearance of CFB2, and the expression of another, as yet unknown, protein that binds to the 8-mer, represses translation and causes mRNA destruction.</p><p>Humans have at least 15 proteins that contain both RNA-binding and E3 ligase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cano et al., 2010</xref>); they are implicated in auto-ubiquitination, and in either mono-ubiquitination or polyubiquitination of other targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Athanasopoulos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Td and Wilkinson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that the interaction of CFB2 with SKP1 promotes CFB2 degradation, presumably through auto-ubiquitination. This may fine-tune CFB2 abundance to limit VSG synthesis to an ideal level, preventing secretory pathway overload. SKP1 was detectable in purified MKT1-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melo do Nascimento et al., 2020</xref>), so CFB2 may be able to interact with SKP1 and MKT1 simultaneously. We do not know whether CFB2 has additional ubiquitination targets. These interactions, as well as the mode of CFB2 mRNA binding, require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>T. brucei</italic> growth and manipulation</title><p>Bloodstream-form Lister427 or EATRO1125 <italic>T. brucei</italic> expressing the <italic>tet</italic> repressor (pHD1313 or 2T1 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alibu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alsford and Horn, 2008</xref>) were grown in HMI-11 medium (PAN Biotech).

For this, we chose induced and uninduced samples with similar total aligned read counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>CFB2 expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></title><p>For expression of CFB2 in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the coding sequence of CFB2 was cloned into pET-NusA for N-terminal tagging with a 6×His-tag and the transcription termination/antitermination protein NusA, which was then transformed into BL21 competent <italic>E.coli</italic>. Individual transformants were inoculated in 5 ml of LB<sup>Kan</sup> each and grown for 16 hr at 27°C. After that, OD<sub>600</sub> measurements were performed every hour, until the cultures reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8. For each inoculum, 1 ml was collected by centrifugation (2 min, 16,000 × <italic>g</italic>), and the supernatant was subsequently removed. The pellet was then lysed in Laemmli buffer (‘uninduced’ sample) and stored at −20°C until further use. Recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 1 mM to the remaining 4 ml of the culture. Furthermore, another 1 ml of LB<sup>Kan</sup> supplemented with IPTG (1 mM) was added, after which the samples were incubated at 27°C for 14 hr. Upon reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.5–3, 300 µl were collected per sample by centrifugation at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 2 min. These ‘induced’ samples were processed and lysed similar to the ‘uninduced’ samples. For analysing protein expression, the samples were boiled at 95°C for 10 min and subsequently separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then stained by Coomassie staining.</p><p>CFB2 was also expressed as a fusion with 6 His tags and the GB protein, by cloning into pETGB. Expression was induced and inclusion bodies purified as above. This protein was used for rabbit-antisera purification and as a positive control on Western blots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of soluble and insoluble <italic>E. coli</italic> fractions</title><p>Induction and harvest of the cultures were performed as described above. However, instead of lysing the cells with Laemmli buffer, the pellet was resuspended in 350 µl of bacterial lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin), after which 25 µl of lysozyme solution (stock: 10 mg/ml in Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) were added. After mixing the samples by vortexing for 3 s, lysis was performed for 4 hr at 4°C with constant rotation. This was followed by three freeze/thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> and 4°C. Soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) fractions were analysed separately by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining of the gels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Purification of inclusion bodies for antibody production</title><p>For large-scale purification of inclusion bodies, 1 l of an IPTG-induced culture was grown at 27°C until reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> 0.8 and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet was washed once with 1× PBS and stored at −80°C until further processing. Lysis of the bacteria was performed by addition of 500 µl of bacterial lysis buffer and 50 µl of lysozyme solution (see above). Furthermore, the samples were mixed by vortexing for 3 s, incubated for 4 hr at 4°C with constant rotation, and subsequently subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen. Inclusion bodies were pelleted by 20 min centrifugation at 15,000 rpm and 4°C, washed once with bacterial lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and eventually resuspended in 10 ml of 8 M urea. These were then left to dissolve for 16 hr at 4°C with constant rotation.</p><p>After determining the protein concentration spectrophotometrically (A280; Nanodrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany), 0.5 mg of the protein in inclusion bodies was then separated by SDS-PAGE and the band corresponding to NusA-CFB2 was cut from the gel. The gel slice was submitted to David’s Biotechnology (Regensburg, Germany) for the generation of antisera in rabbit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Purification of anti-CFB2 antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal antisera were purified by adsorption of total rabbit serum to immobilized recombinant CFB2-Gb1 carrier protein. 100 µg of the CFB2 recombinant protein was resolved in SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane. CFB2 containing region was excised, fragmented in small pieces, and transferred to a 1.5 ml tube. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS/0.05% Tween for 1 hr at room temperature with agitation, washed twice in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated with 1 ml of antisera for 16 hr at 4°C with agitation. After incubation, the depleted antiserum was discarded and the membrane washed three times in PBS/0.05% Tween-20. Finally, the bound antibodies were eluted with 200 µl of 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.4 for 5 min, under vortex and neutralized with 20 µl of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Tethering and yeast two-hybrid assays</title><p>Tethering assays were done using cells expressing mRNAs with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) open reading frame and a truncated version of the trypanosome <italic>actinA</italic> 3'-UTR, with five boxB sequences immediately upstream of the 3'-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mugo and Erben, 2020</xref>). Lines with tetracycline-inducible expression of different versions of CFB2 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) were made, and CAT was assayed with or without tetracycline addition. CAT activity was performed as previously described using 14C-labelled butyryl coenzyme A as the labelled substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mugo and Erben, 2020</xref>). Yeast two-hybrid assays were done using the Matchmaker Yeast Two-Hybrid System (Clontech) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The DNAs of the protein ORFs were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGBKT7 or pGADT7. Subsequent mutations of the ORFs were achieved via site-directed mutagenesis (Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis, New England Biolabs). The plasmids were co-transformed pairwise into AH109 yeast strains, and co-transformants were selected on double drop-out medium (minimal SD media lacking Trp and Leu). Positive interactions were indicated by growth on quadruple drop-out medium (minimal SD media lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ade). The interaction between murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen served as the positive control, with LaminC and the SV40 large T-antigen as the negative bait (DNA-binding domain) and prey controls, respectively. Expression of bait and prey proteins was checked by detection of HA and c-myc epitopes, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Gerst (Weizmann Institute) for providing the pcDNA4-MS2-CP-GFP-SBP plasmid and A Gkeka and F Aresta-Branco (DKFZ) for providing the cell line expressing the 3'-UTR of VSG2 and assistance in the generation of the tagged VSG construct.

One reason for the lack of a drug or a vaccine is the parasite's way to escape the immune system: their cell surface is covered by the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of which many variants exist, but only one is expressed. The switching between the different VSG forms is called antigenic variation and involves a not fully understood epigenetic mechanism. It is essential for the parasite's survival that the VSG surface coat is very dense at any given time: antibodies of the host should not be able to recognise any invariant proteins on the cell surface that are 'hidden' in between the VSG molecules. Consequently, the VSG protein is the most abundant protein in the cell (10% of total). This high protein abundance is achieved by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. One major posttranscriptional mechanism is the stabilisation of the VSG mRNA. Two cis-elements in the VSG mRNA 3´UTR have been known for a long time to be essential for this stability (an 8-mer and a 16-mer). However, nothing was known about the underlying mechanism of VSG mRNA stabilisation. In this work, the authors have addressed this problem. They have purified the VSG mRNA from trypanosomes in two very different ways and, in both approaches, they found the cyclin Fbox protein 2 (CFB2) to co-purify. They have defined the full complex that binds to the VSG mRNA. Most importantly, the authors could clearly show the very specific effect on VSG mRNA stability when CFB2 was RNAi depleted. Moreover, CFB2 RNAi mostly phenocopied the phenotype that was previously described for VSG RNAi. The CFB2 protein is present in a very low copy number and the authors provide data suggesting that it may be tightly autoregulated by interaction with SKP1. The authors further show that the regulation of VSG mRNA stability by CFB2 depends on the 16-mer cis-element, but not on the 8-mer. The data are, throughout, very convincing, experiments are done with all the essential controls and the data are well presented. The conclusions are supported by the data. The authors have, beyond any doubt, finally identified the major posttranscriptional regulator protein that is responsible for VSG mRNA stability, a milestone in the field, and provide a mechanism on how it could work and be autoregulated. I only have one major point (and a few very minor points)</p><p>My main criticism is on the introduction: major information is missing here or presented far too short. People from outside of the trypanosome field will find the paper almost impossible to understand. It is important to explain the life cycle and its stages (as these are mentioned later) as well as the parasites special transcription of mRNAs by PolI and PolII in more detail. Trypanosome translation initiation factors and PABPs should be introduced. Nomenclature of the VSG is also a confusing throughout. Why switching to VSG4 in Figure 8 for example. Also, it would be beneficial to phrase the question better and stress the importance of why this needs to be answered to understand the basic biology of the parasite.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the Introduction section as suggested. The reason for the switch is now explained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Line 76: ' supporting direct binding to mRNA in vivo'</p><p>Is this true? I thought the poly(A) oligos can also purify protein complexes? (but I may be wrong)</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, but probably not very much when the complexes have been washed with lithium chloride and urea. In any case, the readers can find in the supplementary Table 1 the false discovery rate (FDR) values obtained for each identified protein for both purifications (oligodT and VSG/Tub antisense) taking into consideration the data from the control experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 104: ‘Kinetoplastid specific’.

The correlation between presence of antigenic variation and number of CFB could be worked out a little better, perhaps presented in a main Figure.</p></disp-quote><p>CFB genes are absent in Leishmania; thus, we have edited it as suggested. Since we do not actually know whether it has any biological meaning, we have also removed the association between the presence of multiple copies of CFB genes and antigenic variation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 161: Tb927.8.1945, ad: 'encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function'.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 202: MG132, better: 'the proteasome inhibitor MG132'</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 310-311: no, best to delete this sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We prefer to leave it in.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>There is no doubt about this being a truly significant contribution to the trypanosome field. Method-wise, it is also a nice example of how mRNA binding proteins can be identified and validated and there are clear mechanistic insights here into the regulation of the VSG mRNA. This is not frequently found, in any organism. I believe that this work will be publishable in any parasitology journal, and, once the introduction has been changed (see above) also in any RNA journal.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The current study describes the isolation and characterisation of Variant Surface</p><p>Glycoprotein (VSG) mRNA-bound proteins in the bloodstream form African trypanosome.</p><p>CFB2 is identified as a VSG mRNA positive regulator which depends upon a conserved 16mer in the VSG mRNA 3'-UTR.</p><p>1. The authors state in their abstract that &quot;CFB2 is essential for VSG mRNA stability&quot;. They also &quot;describe cis-acting elements within the VSG 3'-untranslated region that regulate the interaction&quot;. Expression of a GFP reporter appears to be reduced by only ~3-fold in bloodstream-form cells when the relevant cis-acting element (the 16mer) is removed, however (Figure 8B). This would suggest that the mRNA lacking the 16mer could still be relatively stable (&quot;VSG mRNA is extremely stable, having a half-life of 1-2h compared with less than 20 min for most other mRNAs&quot;).</p><p>Was half-life measured for an mRNA lacking a 16-mer or for VSG mRNA in cells lacking CFB2?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this was previously published, references are in the Introduction. The presence of the 16-mer in VSG is essential for survival in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream stage (PMID: 28906055).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could CFB2 impact mRNA maturation rather than stability?</p></disp-quote><p>The reporter experiments rule this out since in Kinetoplastids, the 3'-UTR sequence has no role in controlling polyadenylation, beyond a preference for sites with several A residues. This is now explicitly stated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, which data demonstrate an altered interaction between CFB2 and the mRNA lacking a 16mer? The authors could consider adjusting these statements and also the quantitative impact that CFB2 has on VSG mRNA stability, as well as evidence supporting differing interactions between CFB2 and mRNAs containing or lacking the 16mer.</p></disp-quote><p>We do now show new data demonstrating that binding of CFB2 to the reporters depends on the VSG 3’-UTR and is unaffected by the 8-mer mutation. Unfortunately, the <italic>GFPVSGm16mer</italic> mRNA was too low in abundance to quantitate, even by qPCR. The 16-mer and 8-mer are the only sequences in the 3’-UTR that are conserved in different <italic>VSG</italic> mRNAs. Binding to the upstream UC-rich region remains a theoretical possibility but it seems very unlikely since this region is variable and such sequences are present in numerous other 3’-UTRs (for example, the α tubulin 3’-UTR, which is the first we looked at, includes the sequence CCUUCCUUCCCCUU). Our preliminary results suggest indeed that region is not involved (Suppl. Figure 13E). And in that case, why would mutating the 16-mer affect the response to CFB2 expression? We cannot rule out the possibility that CFB2 binds to m6A – it’s a chicken-and-egg problem, because mutation of the 16-mer eliminates the methylation. However, this too seems unlikely since m6A is by no means restricted to <italic>VSG</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.925776">(<italic>https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.925776</italic>;</ext-link> PMID: 30573362). To find out it would be necessary to identify the m6A “writers”, and reduce their expression; this is well beyond the scope of this manuscript and is being actively pursued in another lab. An alternative would be to express soluble CFB2 for in vitro binding studies, but so far this has not been possible despite several attempts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In relation to point 1 above, Figure 2A and Figure 3D show CFB2 binding to the VSG 3’-UTR, to the 16mer in the latter case. This interaction could be presented as a ‘model’ whereas it seems too speculative to be included in the current data-Figures. Indeed, the authors “suggest that CFB2 recognizes the 16mer” in their Discussion and do also consider alternatives.</p></disp-quote><p>A caveat has been added to the Figure 3D legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Given the emphasis on the experimental approach and &quot;the potential to supply detailed biological insight into mRNA metabolism in any eukaryote&quot; (end of abstract), can the authors explain how their method improves upon / differs from the approach of Theil et al., 2019 and other similar approaches?</p></disp-quote><p>Our approach is slightly different to the one described by Theil et al. (antisense oligo length, incubation temperature) and a detailed description of our protocol can be found in the Methods section. We have stressed the method because there is only one previous successful example attempting the purification of the protein bound to a native mRNA. Our intention is not to compare approaches but to encourage researchers willing to perform these experiments in a variety of other organisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1. Figure 2B: Why does N-GFP- SBP migrate more slowly in the Tet+ eluate? Also why does the slower-migrating form of the protein appear to dominate in Figure 2C?</p></disp-quote><p>N-GFP-SBP protein migrates as a single band. In Figure 2C, the membrane was first probed with anti-RBP10 and then with anti-GFP antibodies. What is observed in the input and flowthrough (I/FT) is RBP10 signal and not GFP. The concentration of N-GFP-SBP in the eluate is much higher than in the I/FT (it is the only protein visualized upon Ponceau staining in eluates). That causes the band to appear in the eluate as “ghost band” (ECL reagent is consumed in the middle region of the band) while in the I/FT, the concentration is still not enough to give a signal. The same occurs in Figure 2B. The faint bands that are seen in the I/FT in Figure 2B are likely products of cross-reactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 3D: What's the evidence that SKP1 interacts with VSG-mRNA-bound CFB2? Is this protein enriched in the data shown in Figure 1C and can the relevant data-point be labelled?</p></disp-quote><p>Our interactome capture results (PMID: 26784394) suggest that in bloodstream form, Skp1 (Tb927.11.6130) do not bind poly(A) RNA directly; thus, it is not enriched in the VSG mRNA-bound proteome. What we know is that Skp1 interacts, in a Y2H setting, with CFB2 and that mutations in the CFB2 F-box domain abolish this interaction. The data we have presented suggest the interaction with Skp1 regulates CFB2 levels. We actually do not know whether Skp1 binds to free or to VSG-mRNA-bound CFB2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There are four other highly abundant mRNAs in Figure 4C.

Much remains unknown regarding control of mRNA stability, nuclear export or translation and there are many uncharacterised or only partially characterised RBPs in eukaryotic cells. Trypanosomes present an important model in this context since global polycistronic transcription places a major emphasis on posttranscriptional controls. They are also important parasites. The variant surface glycoprotein is a key virulence factor and one of the few genes that is under transcriptional control in African trypanosomes, yet RBPs are thought to be important for generating/maintaining the highly abundant VSG mRNA in bloodstream form cells (and for low abundance in the insect stage), possibly via interaction with the highly conserved regulatory elements in the 3'-UTR.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
