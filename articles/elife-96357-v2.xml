cells. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells, play crucial roles in CNS functions, but the impact of the circadian clock on astrocyte functions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes through RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are under circadian control. Notably, <italic>Herpud1</italic> (<italic>Herp</italic>) exhibited robust circadian rhythmicity at both mRNA and protein levels, a rhythm disrupted in astrocytes lacking the circadian transcription factor, BMAL1. HERP regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by modulating the degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (ITPRs). ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release varied with the circadian phase, being more pronounced at subjective night phase, likely due to the rhythmic expression of ITPR2. Correspondingly, ATP-stimulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were heightened at the subjective night phase. This rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response led to circadian phase-dependent variations in the phosphorylation of Connexin 43 (Ser368) and gap junctional communication. Given the role of gap junction channel (GJC) in propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we suggest that this circadian regulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could affect astrocytic modulation of synaptic activity according to the time of day. Overall, our study enhances the understanding of how the circadian clock influences astrocyte function in the CNS, shedding light on their potential role in daily variations of brain activity and health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>circadian</kwd><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>Ca2+</kwd><kwd>Herpud1</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>ER</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019M3C7A1031905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Eun Young</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019R1A5A2026045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Eun Young</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1F1A1071248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jae-Hyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-2023-00208490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Eun Young</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Astrocytic ER calcium release and gap junction communication exhibit circadian modulation driven by HERPUD1, highlighting the importance of astrocytic circadian rhythms in brain function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The circadian clock orchestrates a range of behaviors, physiological processes, and cellular and biochemical activities in organisms with approximately 24 hr rhythms, facilitating adaptation to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>). In mammals, the master clock localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus synchronizes peripheral tissue clocks throughout the body to the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>). The circadian clock’s molecular mechanism is driven by a transcriptional translational feedback loop (TTFL). CLOCK and BMAL1 form a heterodimer that triggers expression of the repressor genes, <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry</italic>), along with other clock-controlled output genes. PER and CRY proteins then translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with CLOCK/BMAL1, halting further transcriptional activation. A secondary feedback loop involving the interplay between transcriptional activation by ROR and repression by REV-ERB finely regulates the rhythmic transcription of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that the circadian clock controls the rhythmic transcription of numerous genes, displaying notable tissue specificity. This characteristic underscores the time-of-day-specific functional specialization of diverse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mure et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, circadian clock-controlled genes significantly influence various physiological processes including development, metabolism, aging, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lananna and Musiek, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reinke and Asher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schultz and Kay, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, play vital roles in maintaining homeostasis of extracellular fluids, ions, and neurotransmitters; proving energy substrates to neurons; regulating local blood flow; modulating neuronal activity through gliotransmission; and assisting in interstitial fluid drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010</xref>). Although not electrically excitable, astrocytes exhibit complex intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, both spatially and temporally, within individual astrocytes and across astrocytic networks. Astrocytes express various types of Gq-coupled receptors activated by neurotransmitters such as ATP, epinephrine, glutamate, and dopamine <italic>etc</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Activation of these Gq-coupled receptors initiates the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) signaling cascade, causing a release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER that substantially increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guerra-Gomes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in astrocytes are involved in regulating numerous afore-mentioned processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giaume et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Recent studies have shown that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can regulate circadian rhythms and sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brancaccio et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of the circadian clock in astrocytes function. Cultured murine cortical astrocytes expressing a PER-luciferase reporter (PER::LUC) exhibit circadian oscillations and can be entrained by temperature cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prolo et al., 2005</xref>) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which synchronizes SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marpegan et al., 2009</xref>). These findings provide strong evidence that a molecular clock operates in astrocytes. In addition, disruption of clock genes specific to astrocytes has been linked to a range of deleterious effects, including excessive astrocyte activation, disruptions in daily activity patterns, impaired learning, metabolic imbalances, and a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barca-Mayo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barca-Mayo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lananna et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, these phenotypic changes closely resemble those observed in astrocytes during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brandebura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phatnani and Maniatis, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the rhythmic metabolic activity of astrocytes, including intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations and neurotransmitter release, is critical for circadian timing in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brancaccio et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the emerging significance of circadian rhythms in astrocyte function in health and disease, our understanding of the link between the circadian clock and specific astrocytic functions is still limited.</p><p>In this study, we conducted a transcriptome analysis to investigate how the circadian clock regulates astrocyte function. Our research uncovered that <italic>Herp</italic> (homocysteine-inducible ER protein with ubiquitin like domain 1; <italic>Herp</italic>) exhibited a BMAL1-dependent rhythmic expression, peaking at subjective midday phase and reaching its nadir at subjective midnight phase. HERP was crucial for ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation by modulating the degradation of ITPRs. Importantly, the ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response varied according to time post synchronization, a dependence that was absent in cultured astrocytes from <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, the pronounced release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the subjective night phase led to robust phosphorylation of the Ser368 residue of CX43, diminishing cell-to-cell communication between astrocytes. Overall, our study demonstrates that the circadian clock orchestrates a variety of astrocytic processes including Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by controlling the rhythmic transcription of genes, highlighting its pivotal role in CNS function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining circadian rhythmic transcripts in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes</title><p>To understand how the circadian clock regulates astrocyte physiology, we conducted a circadian transcriptome analysis of cultured mouse cortical astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were synchronized using serum shock (SS) and harvested every 4 hr for 2 days starting at 12 hr post-SS. The time series astrocyte transcriptome was determined by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

A total of 17,671 transcripts with the highest TPM values of the 12 time points exceeding 0.577, were considered expressed.

MetaCycle, integrates these three methods, facilitating the evaluation of periodicity in time-series data without requiring the selection of an optimal algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, BioCycle has been developed using a deep neural network trained with extensive synthetic and biological time series datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agostinelli et al., 2016</xref>). Because MetaCycle and Biocycle identify periodic signal based on different algorithms, we applied both packages to identify periodicity in our time-series transcriptome data. BioCycle and MetaCycle analyses detected 321 and 311 periodic transcripts, respectively (FDR corrected, q-value &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Among these, 220 (53.4%) were detected by both methods, but many transcripts did not overlap. MetaCycle is known for its inability to detect asymmetric waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mei et al., 2021</xref>). In our analysis, genes with increasing waveforms like <italic>Adora1</italic> and <italic>Mybph</italic> were identified as rhythmic only by BioCycle, while <italic>Plat</italic> and <italic>Il34</italic> were identified as rhythmic only by MetaCycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Despite these discrepancies, the clear circadian rhythmic expression profiles of these genes led us to conclude that using the union of the two lists compensates for the limitations of each algorithm. Consequently, we identified a total of 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts (2.3% of all transcripts; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The circadian oscillations of these transcripts are illustrated in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>Next, we compared rhythmic transcripts of astrocytes with those of 12 mouse tissues from CircaDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), a database of circadian rhythmic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A majority of the rhythmic transcripts in astrocytes (265 of 412, 65.3%) were not rhythmic or were rhythmic in one tissue. 14 transcripts were rhythmic in more than 10 tissues; most of these were core clock genes except <italic>Tspan4</italic>, <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, and <italic>Wee1</italic>. This result is consistent with previous reports of tissue-specific circadian rhythmic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mure et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). A phase comparison of these 14 common oscillating transcripts between CircaDB and our analysis showed a consistent time difference, with 8 hr after SS corresponding to ZT0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). An additional phase comparison of 82 transcripts that overlapped in only one tissue indicated a very robust phase correlation between astrocytes and the corresponding tissue (<italic>r</italic>=0.69, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, our analysis indicates that the identified oscillating transcripts were not false positive but were clearly associated with the circadian clock. Hierarchical clustering analysis of oscillating transcripts revealed two clusters: cluster 1 with 185 transcripts and cluster 2 with 227 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A circular map of peak phases across all rhythmic genes revealed two major peaks, one in the early night (ZT12 to ZT16) and one in the late night or dawn (ZT21 to ZT1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Here for more intuitive interpretation, we set 8 hr post synchronization (sync) to ZT0 based on a previous phase comparison. Circadian transcriptome studies conducted in multiple animal tissues have indicated that the phases of each tissue are not randomly distributed but are predominantly clustered in one or two narrow temporal windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with these previous reports, mouse cultured astrocytes exhibited a high degree of temporal organization. Intriguingly, there was a relatively quiescent zone during subjective daytime, a finding different from that observed for diurnal animals, which showed a quiescent zone during subjective nighttime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mure et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To understand the biological processes and pathways controlled by the circadian clock, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on each cluster using Metascape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metascape.org">https://metascape.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

It is strongly induced not only by homocysteine but also by ER stress-causing agents such as tunicamycin or thapsigargin. HERP, characterized by an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and present in the ER membrane facing cytoplasmic side, is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kokame et al., 2000</xref>) and is part of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, participating in the ubiquitination and relocation of ERAD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leitman et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, HERP modulates the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response through IP<sub>3</sub>R degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Torrealba et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we sought to investigate whether HERP-controlled processes are subject to circadian regulation by examining the HERP-regulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the astrocytes.

Thus, the circadian control of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to stimulation in cultured astrocytes is primarily attributable to ITPR2.</p><p>ER and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses following ATP treatment exhibited distinct circadian variation, but mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses did not show significant variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We think of several possibilities to account for the absence of significant circadian variations in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> relative to cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> change. Upon ATP stimulation, direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer occurs through IP<sub>3</sub>R in the cytosol. For mitochondrial uptake, Ca<sup>2+</sup> first transits to the intermembrane space via IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) complex before entering the matrix through mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). The Mito-R-GECO1 reporter is confined within the mitochondrial matrix and thus limiting assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Substantial changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels might occur in the intermembrane space, but the influx into the matrix via MCUs could remain constant across different time, resulting in apparent lack of significant change. Secondly, the amount of VDAC or the VDAC:IP<sub>3</sub>R complex on the mitochondrial membrane might vary inversely with HERP levels, potentially maintaining a consistent flow of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the mitochondria irrespective of the time. Additionally, the presence of several Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion mechanisms in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>) points to a more complex regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared with that in the cytosol. Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, our data indicate that the circadian variation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, particularly in response to stimuli, predominantly impacts cytoplasmic signaling rather than mitochondrial signaling.</p><p>During the subjective night phase (active period for mice), ATP- stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was pronounced than during the subjective day phase (rest period for mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This finding aligns with studies showing heightened stimulus-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes during wakefulness, which diminishes during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref>). In flies, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes is correlated with the duration of wakefulness, suggesting that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key factor in the homeostatic regulation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blum et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels observed between wake and sleep states, with circadian regulation of ITPR2 by HERP being a key factor in this process.</p><p>ATP-stimulated Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation is higher at 30 hr (subjective night phase) than at 42 hr post sync (subjective day phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>.), a finding further supported by in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). What are the implications of this day/night variation in CX43 (S368) phosphorylation? We reasoned that the circadian variation in CX43 phosphorylation could significantly impact astrocyte functionality within the syncytium. Indeed, our cultured astrocytes exhibited circadian phase-dependent variation in gap junctional communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). Astrocytes influence synaptic activity through the release of gliotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, D-serine, and ATP, triggered by increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to the activity of adjacent neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Importantly, this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spreads to adjacent astrocytes through GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>), influencing a large area of the neuronal network. Considering that Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation occurs to uncouple specific pathways in the astrocytic syncytium to focus local responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enkvist and McCarthy, 1992</xref>), our findings suggest that astrocytes better equipped for localized responses when presented with a stimulus during the active phase in mice. Conversely, during the rest period, characterized by more synchronous neuronal activity across broad brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>) higher GJC conductance might allow astrocytes to exert control over a larger area. In support of this idea, recent study showed that synchronized astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity advances the slow wave activity (SWA) of the brain, a key feature of non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Szabó et al., 2017</xref>). Blocking GJC was found to reduce SWA, further supporting this interpretation. However, conflicting findings have also been reported. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref> found that astrocytic synchrony was higher during wakefulness than sleep in the mouse frontal cortex. Whether these differing results in astrocyte synchrony during resting and active periods are attributable to differences in experimental context (e.g. brain regions, sleep-inducing condition) remains unclear. Indeed, astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during wakefulness/sleep vary according to brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsunematsu et al., 2021</xref>). While the extent of astrocyte synchrony might differ depending on brain region and/or stimulus, our results suggest that the baseline state of astrocyte synchrony, which is affected by GJC conductance, varies with the day/night cycle.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings enhance the understanding of the circadian regulation of astrocytic functions, particularly through the rhythmic expression of HERP and its impact on ER Ca²<sup>+</sup> signaling and CX43 phosphorylation. This study underscores the intricate interplay between the circadian clock and astrocyte physiology, highlighting the pivotal role of HERP in modulating key astrocytic processes such as sleep, gap junction communication and synaptic modulation. The day/night variations in ER Ca²<sup>+</sup> response and CX43 phosphorylation, and their implications for astrocytic network dynamics and neuronal interactions, open new avenues for exploring the broader implications of astrocytic circadian rhythms in brain function and health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Paired-end raw reads, generated using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system, were aligned to the mm10 mouse genome using STAR aligner (v.2.5.2b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Gene expression was subsequently quantified by calculating transcripts per million (TPM) using Ensemble gene (release 82) annotations. The threshold for defining expressed transcripts was set using a Gaussian mixture model in the R package ‘mixtools’. To detect circadian oscillating transcripts, we employed two circadian oscillation detection methods BioCycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agostinelli et al., 2016</xref>) and MetaCycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells and purified using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN, 74034). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using an oligo-dT primer and PrimeScript RTase (TaKaRa, Japan, 2680A).

Immediately before imaging, the medium was replaced with Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS (Gibco, 14175095). Live imaging was performed using a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope with a 488 nm argon laser and a x60 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective. Photobleaching was performed on a region of interest (ROI) cell, and fluorescence was measured at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Fluorescence intensity was recorded pre-bleach (5 images), during a 15 s laser pulse (100% power, 5.3 lines/s), and post-bleach (every 3 s for 3 min). Images were analyzed using NIS Elements C software. Fluorescence intensity at each time point (F<sub>t</sub>) was normalized to the pre-bleach intensity (F<sub>0</sub>), calculated as the average of 5 pre-bleach frames. The percentage of fluorescence recovery was calculated using: (F<sub>FR</sub>-F<sub>A</sub>)/(F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>A</sub>)x100, where F<sub>FR</sub> is the full recovery fluorescence intensity and F<sub>A</sub> is the intensity immediately after photobleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>To conduct the statistical analyses, all samples were first tested for normality. For cases where normality testing was not possible, such as with the Area Under/Above Curve, <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for comparing two groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for comparing three or more groups, considering the sufficient sample size. When comparing two groups, a <italic>t</italic>-test was performed if the data followed a normal distribution; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used. For comparisons among three or more groups, one-way ANOVA was used if the data were normally distributed, and the Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests were used if they were not. When comparing three or more groups across multiple time points, a two-way ANOVA was performed. A p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. The n value for all experiments represents biological replicates, and the experiments were conducted at least three times to ensure the reliability of the results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Designed and conducted experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Analyzed transcriptomic data and assisted with preparing the manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conducted experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Assisted with analysis of transcriptomic data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Analyzed transcriptomic data, edited the manuscript, and acquired funding</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Designed the research, analyzed the data, wrote and edited the paper, and acquired funding</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All of the animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol of Ajou University School of medicine (permit number : 2023-0102, 2024-0103).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>A total of 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts identified by MetaCycle or BioCycle, selected based on an FDR-corrected q-value &lt;0.05.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96357-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables.</title><p>(A) A table of transcripts associated with the &quot;Calcium ion homeostasis&quot; GO term from the GO Biological Process analysis, ordered by ascending MetaCycle p-values.

The authors' starting point is transcriptional output from serum-shocked culture, comparative informatics with existing tools and existing datasets. After fairly routine pathway analyses, they focus on the calcium homeostasis machinery and one gene, Herp, in particular. They argue that Herp is rhythmic at both mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes. They then use a calcium reporter targeted to the ER, mitochondria, or cytosol and show that Herp modulates calcium signaling as a function of circadian time. They argue that this occurs through the regulation of inositol receptors. They claim that the signaling pathway is clock-controlled by a limited examination of Bmal1 knockout astrocytes. Finally, they switch to calcium-mediated phosphorylation of the gap junction protein Connexin 43 but do not directly connect HERP-mediated circadian signaling to these observations. While these experiments address very important questions related to the critical role of astrocytes in regulating circadian signaling, the mechanistic arguments for HERP function, its role in circadian signaling through inositol receptors, the connection to gap junctions, and ultimately, the functional relevance of these findings is only partially substantiated by experimental evidence.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The paper provides useful datasets of astrocyte gene expression in circadian time.</p><p>- Identifies HERP as a rhythmic output of the circadian clock.</p><p>- Demonstrates the circadian-specific sensitivity of ATP -&gt; calcium signaling.</p><p>- Identifies possible rhythms in both Connexin 43 phosphorylation and rhythmic movement of calcium between cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- It is not immediately clear why the authors chose to focus on Ca2+ homeostasis or Herp from their initial screens as neither were the &quot;most rhythmic&quot; pathways in their primary analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We chose to focus on Ca2+ homeostasis processes because intracellular Ca2+ signaling plays crucial role in numerous astrocyte functions and is notably associated with sleep/wake status of animals, which is our primary interest (Bojarskaite et al., 2020; Ingiosi et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2021; Szabó et al., 2017). Among the genes involved in calcium ion homeostasis, Herp exhibited the most robust rhythmicity (supplementary table 1). The rationale for our focus on Ca2+ homeostasis and Herp is explained in the results section (line 143-150). We hope this provides a clear justification for our focus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would have been interesting (and potentially important) to know whether various methods of cellular synchronization would also render HERP rhythmic (e.g., temperature, forskolin, etc). If Herp is indeed relatively astrocyte-specific and rhythmic, it should be easy to assess its rhythmicity in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s insightful comment. In response, we examined HERP expression in cultured astrocytes synchronized using either Dexamethasone or Forskolin treatment. We found that Herp exhibited rhythmic expression at both the the mRNA and protein levels under these conditions. These results have been added to Figure S3 and are explained in the manuscript (lines 173-175).</p><p>Additionally, we measured HERP levels in the prefrontal cortex of mice at CT58 and CT70 and found no rhythmicity, as shown in Author response image 1. Given that Herp is expressed in various brain cell types, including microglia, endothelial cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and the astrocytes- with the highest expression in microglia(Cahoy et al., 2008), we reason that the potential rhythmic expression of HERP in astrocytes might be masked by its continuous expression in other cell types. Nonetheless, to assess HERP rhythmicity specifically in astrocytes in vivo, we attempted immunostaining using several anti-HERP antibodies, but none were successful. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether HERP exhibits rhythmic expression in astrocytes in vivo.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>HERP levels were constant at CT58 and CT70.</title><p>(A, B) Mice were entrained under 12h:12h LD cycle and maintained in constant dark.

The dynamics of the mitochondrial and cytosolic responses are not discussed in any detail and it is unclear what their direct relationship is to Herp-mediated ER signaling. What is the explanation for Herp (which is thought to be ER-specific) to calcium signaling in other organelles?</p></disp-quote><p>Our examination of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses was aimed at corroborating HERP’s effect on ER Ca2+ response. Upon ATP stimulation, Ca2+ is released from the ER via IP3R receptors (IP3Rs) and subsequently transmitted to other organelles including mitochondria (Carreras-Sureda et al., 2018; Giorgi et al., 2018). Ca2+ is directly transferred to the cytosol by IP3Rs located on the ER membrane, and to the mitochondria through a complex formed by IP3R and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) on the mitochondria (Giorgi et al., 2018). Consistent with previous reports, we observed an increase of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels accompanied by decrease in ER Ca2+ levels following ATP treatment (See Fig. 3B, E, H, control siRNA). The ATP-stimulated ER Ca2+ release was enhanced by Herp knockdown. We reasoned that if Ca2+ release was enhanced, then cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptakes would also be enhanced. The results were consistent with our hypothesis (See Fig. 3B, E, H, Herp siRNA). These observations are described in the Results section (lines 202-208) and in the Discussion (lines 333-348). We hope this explanation clarifies the relationship between Herp-mediated ER Ca2+ response and Ca2+ response in other organelles. Thank you for your consideration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What is the functional significance of promoting ATP-mediated suppression of calcium in ER?</p></disp-quote><p>In astrocytes, intracellular Ca2+ plays crucial role in regulating several processes. In this study, among various downstream effects of intracellular Ca2+, we examined the gap junction channel (GJC) conductance, which affects astrocytic communication. As discussed in the manuscript (lines 357-381), circadian variation in HERP results in rhythmic Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation linked with GJC conductance. We propose that during the subjective night phase, heightened ATP induced ER Ca2+ release reduces GJC conductance, uncoupling astrocytes from the syncytium, making them better equipped for localized response. On the other hand, during the subjective day phase, increased GJC conductance may allow astrocytes to control a larger area for synchronous neuronal activity which is a key feature of sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors then nicely show that the effect of ATP is dependent on intrinsic circadian timing but do not explain why these effects are antiphase in cytosol or mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>Moreover, the ∆F/F for calcium in mitochondria and cytosol both rise, cross the abscissa, and then diminish - strongly suggesting a biphasic signaling event. Therefore, one wonders whether measuring the area under the curve is the most functionally relevant measurement of the change.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments. As explained in our previous response, Ca2+ released from the ER is transferred to the cytosol and mitochondria. This transfer explains why the fluorescent intensities of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ indicators show anti-phasic responses to those of the ER.</p><p>We agree that cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses may be biphasic. The decrease below the abscissa in mitochondria and cytosol likely reflects Ca2+ extrusion from these organelles. However, our primary focus was on the initial uptake of Ca2+ following ER Ca2+ release. Thus, when calculating the area under the curve (AUC), we measured the area between the ∆F/F graph and the y=0 (X-axis) for both mitochondria and cytosol. We reason that the measuring the area under the curve (above the abscissa) fits with our objective.</p><p>While addressing your concerns, we noticed errors in the Y-axis labels of Fig. 3C, 4D, and 5C. For the ER Ca2+ dynamics, we measured the area above curve. These mistakes have now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why are mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium not also demonstrated for Bmal1 KO astrocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>In two sets of experiments (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4), we demonstrated that the increase in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ aligns with ER Ca2+ release. Since there were no circadian time differences in ER Ca2+ release in the Bmal1 KO cultures, we concluded that it was unnecessary to measure Ca2+ levels in the mitochondria and cytosol. Additionally, our primary focus is on the ER Ca2+ response rather than the Ca2+ dynamics in subcellular organelles. We hope this clarifies our rationale and maintains the focus of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors claim that Herp acts by regulating the degradation of ITPRs but this hypothesis - rather central to the mechanisms proposed in this study - is not experimentally substantiated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments regarding the role of HERP in the degradation of IP3Rs. In the original manuscript, we demonstrated that treating cells with Herp siRNA leads to an increase in the levels of ITPR1 and ITPR2, suggesting that HERP might be involved in the regulation of IP3Rs stability. This observation is consistent with previous studies, which showed that Herp siRNA treatment increases ITPR levels in HeLa and cardiac cells (Paredes et al., 2016; Torrealba et al., 2017). Torrealba et al. also showed that HERP regulates the polyubiquitination of IP3Rs. Based on our results and previous reports, we hypothesized that HERP similarly regulates ITPR degradation in cultured astrocytes.</p><p>However, as the reviewer rightly pointed out, further evidence is needed to confirm that HERP specifically regulates ITPR degradation. To address this, we conducted new experiments examining the effect of XesC, an inhibitor of IP3Rs, on ER Ca2+ release. The treatment of XesC reduced the ER Ca2+ release and abolished the enhancement of ER Ca2+ release by Herp KD. These results demonstrated that HERP influences ER Ca2+ response through IP3Rs. These new findings have been added to Fig. 3N – 3P and explained in the Results section (lines 217-221).</p><p>We believe these additional experiments and clarifications strengthen our hypothesis that HERP regulates IP3R degradation, thereby modulating ER Ca2+ responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There is no clear demonstration of the functional relevance of the circadian rhythms of ATP-mediated calcium signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the previous response, we examined Cx43 phosphorylation linked with GJC conductance in the context of ATP-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Our results demonstrated circadian variations in Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation leading to variations of gap junction channel (GJC) conductance (Fig. 6C – F and Fig. 7D - I). We have discussed the significance of this circadian rhythm in ATP driven ER Ca2+ signaling concerning astrocytic function during sleep/wake states in the manuscript (lines 357 – 382) as follows.</p><p>“ATP-stimulated Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation is higher at 30hr (subjective night phase) than at 42hr (subjective day phase) (Fig. 6C and 6D.), a finding further supported by in vivo experiments showing higher pCx43(S368) levels in the prefrontal cortex during the subjective night than during the day (Fig. 6E and 6F). What are the implications of this day/night variation in Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation? We reasoned that the circadian variation in Cx43 phosphorylation could significantly impact astrocyte functionality within the syncytium. Indeed, our cultured astrocytes exhibited circadian phase-dependent variation in gap junctional communication (Fig.7D – 7F). Astrocytes influence synaptic activity through the release of gliotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, D-serine, and ATP, triggered by increases in intracellular Ca2+ in response to the activity of adjacent neurons and astrocytes (Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018). Importantly, this increase in Ca2+ spreads to adjacent astrocytes through GJCs (Fujii et al., 2017), influencing a large area of the neuronal network. Considering that Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation occurs to uncouple specific pathways in the astrocytic syncytium to focus local responses (Enkvist &amp; McCarthy, 1992), our findings suggest that astrocytes better equipped for localized responses when presented with a stimulus during the active phase in mice. Conversely, during the rest period, characterized by more synchronous neuronal activity across broad brain areas (Vyazovskiy et al., 2009) higher GJC conductance might allow astrocytes to exert control over a larger area. In support of this idea, recent study showed that synchronized astrocytic Ca2+ activity advances the slow wave activity (SWA) of the brain, a key feature of non-REM sleep (Szabó et al., 2017). Blocking GJC was found to reduce SWA, further supporting this interpretation. However, conflicting findings have also been reported. For instance, Ingiosi et al. (Ingiosi et al., 2020) found that astrocytic synchrony was higher during wakefulness than sleep in the mouse frontal cortex. Whether these differing results in astrocyte synchrony during resting and active periods are attributable to differences in experimental context (e.g., brain regions, sleep-inducing condition) remains unclear. Indeed, astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics during wakefulness/sleep vary according to brain regions (Tsunematsu et al., 2021). While the extent of astrocyte synchrony might differ depending on brain region and/or stimulus, on our results suggest that the baseline state of astrocyte synchrony, which is affected by GJC conductance, varies with the day/night cycle.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The article entitled &quot;Circadian regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium response in mouse cultured astrocytes&quot; submitted by Ryu and colleagues describes the circadian control of astrocytic intracellular calcium levels in vitro.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors used a variety of technical approaches that are appropriate</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s acknowledgement of the strengths of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Statistical analysis is poor and could lead to a misinterpretation of the data</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment.

The RNA-seq, Herp expression, and Ca2+ release data across wild-type, Bmal1 knockout, and Herp knockdown cellular models are robust and lend considerable support to the study's conclusions, highlighting their importance. Despite these strengths, the manuscript presents a gap in elucidating the dynamics of HERP and the involvement of ITPR1/2 in modulating Ca2+ release patterns and their circadian variations, which remains insufficiently supported and characterized. While the Connexin data underscore the importance of rhythmic Ca2+ release triggered by ATP, the relationship here appears correlational and the role of HERP and ITPR in Cx function remains to be characterized. Moreover, enhancing the manuscript's clarity and readability could significantly benefit the presentation and comprehension of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s acknowledgement of the strengths of our manuscript.

Therefore, we are confident in the accuracy of our HERP protein measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- If HERP is rhythmic and ITPRs are not, if their model is correct, might we expect HERP suppression to result in 'unmasking' an ITPR rhythm?</p></disp-quote><p>Our model suggests that both HERP and ITPRs are rhythmic, with HERP regulating the degradation of ITPR proteins and driving their rhythms. Consistent with this, we observed that day/night variations in ITPR2 levels (Fig. 4N and 4O). Therefore, we concluded that circadian variations in HERP are sufficient to drive ITPR2 rhythms. We have explained this in detail in the Result section (lines 236-241) and the Discussion section (lines 324-332).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors make a rather abrupt switch to examining gap junctions and connexin 43 phosphorylation.

To address the reviewer's concern regarding the connection between Herp and the phosphorylation of CX43 at S368, we have conducted new experiments to test whether KD of Herp abolishes the rhythms of Cx43 phosphorylation at S368. We found that the phosphorylation of Cx43 at S368 is significantly enhanced at 30hrs post sync compared with 42hrs post sync in control siRNA-treated astrocytes consistent with our previous results (Fig. 6C &amp; 6D). On the other hand, this circadian phase dependent difference in phosphorylation was abolished in Herp siRNA treated astrocytes. These results clearly indicate that circadian variations in Cx43 phosphorylation are driven by the HERP. These new results are now included in Fig. 6G and 6H and explained in the Results section (lines 276-281).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Comment on data presentation: the authors repeatedly present histograms with attached lines between data points - from my understanding of the experiments, this is inappropriate unless these were repeated measures from the same cells.

The authors need to discuss what is the difference between the two methods used to detect rhythmic transcripts and make sense of them.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have provided a more detailed explanation about MetaCycle and BioCycle, as well as the rationale for using both packages in our analysis as follows: “Various methods have been used to identify periodicity in time-series data, such as Lomb-Scargle (Glynn et al., 2006), JTK_CYCLE (Hughes et al., 2010) and ARSER (Yang &amp; Su, 2010), each with distinct advantages and limitations. MetaCycle, integrates these three methods, facilitating the evaluation of periodicity in time-series data without requiring the selection of an optimal algorithm (Wu et al., 2016). Additionally, BioCycle has been developed using a deep neural network trained with extensive synthetic and biological time series datasets (Agostinelli et al., 2016). Because MetaCycle and Biocycle identify periodic signal based on different algorithms, we applied both packages to identify periodicity in our time-series transcriptome data. BioCycle and MetaCycle analyses detected 321 and 311 periodic transcripts, respectively (FDR corrected, q-value &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Among these, 220 (53.4%) were detected by both methods, but many transcripts did not overlap. MetaCycle is known for its inability to detect asymmetric waveforms (Mei et al., 2020). In our analysis, genes with increasing waveforms like Adora1 and Mybph were identified as rhythmic only by BioCycle, while Plat and Il34 were identified as rhythmic only by MetaCycle (Fig. S1C). Despite these discrepancies, the clear circadian rhythmic expression profiles of these genes led us to conclude that using the union of the two lists compensates for the limitations of each algorithm.”</p><p>Please refer to lines 105-117 in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reasoning for comparing CT0 with the phase of the clock 8 hs after SS needs to be explained.

In the original version of our manuscript's Discussion section, we mentioned the absence of a canonical E-Box in the upstream of Herp gene. However, following the reviewer’s suggestion and considering the potential role of non-canonical E-Boxes, we conducted an additional analysis. This analysis identified several non-canonical E-Boxes within the 6 kb upstream region of the Herp gene (Table S2). Notably, we found one non-canonical E-Box, “CACGTT,” known to regulate circadian expression (Yoo et al., 2005) is close to the transcription start site (chr8:94386194-94386543). Moreover, this element is evolutionarily conserved across various mammals, including humans, rats, mice, dogs, and opossums (See Author response image 2). Therefore, we reasoned that these non-canonical E boxes might drive the CLOCK/BMAL1 dependent expression of Herp.

Please refer to Author response image 3. We selected 100µM ATP for our experiments because it induces a medium level of ER Ca2+ response. Importantly, although measuring ATP concentrations at the synapse in vivo is challenging(Tan et al., 2017), estimates suggest synaptic ATP concentrations range from 5-500 µM (Pankratov et al., 2006).
