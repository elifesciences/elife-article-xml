However, techniques available to assess large-scale brain network activity with single-neuron resolution in behaving animals remain limited. Here, we present Mesotrode that integrates chronic wide-field mesoscale cortical imaging and compact multi-site cortical/subcortical cellular electrophysiology in head-fixed mice that undergo self-initiated running or orofacial movements. Specifically, we harnessed the flexibility of chronic multi-site tetrode recordings to monitor single-neuron activity in multiple subcortical structures while simultaneously imaging the mesoscale activity of the entire dorsal cortex. A mesoscale spike-triggered averaging procedure allowed the identification of cortical activity motifs preferentially associated with single-neuron spiking. Using this approach, we were able to characterize chronic single-neuron-related functional connectivity maps for up to 60 days post-implantation. Neurons recorded from distinct subcortical structures display diverse but segregated cortical maps, suggesting that neurons of different origins participate in distinct cortico-subcortical pathways. We extended the capability of Mesotrode by implanting the micro-electrode at the facial motor nerve and found that facial nerve spiking is functionally associated with the PTA, RSP, and M2 network, and optogenetic inhibition of the PTA area significantly reduced the facial movement of the mice. These findings demonstrate that Mesotrode can be used to sample different combinations of cortico-subcortical networks over prolonged periods, generating multimodal and multi-scale network activity from a single implant, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying specific behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mesoscale cortical imaging</kwd><kwd>subcortical</kwd><kwd>circuit</kwd><kwd>peripheral nerve</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>systems modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-180631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-143209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brain Canada Neurophotonics Platform</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004411</institution-id><institution>Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant in aid</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-03723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Leducq Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Low-profile tetrodes that are compatible with wide-field imaging provide the opportunity to evaluate the relationship between spiking neurons and broad networks.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>System-level mechanisms of cognition and action across networks of single neurons in awake, behaving mice remain largely elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aru et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roth and Ding, 2020</xref>). The difficulty comes from recording neural activity over large spatial scales but with single neuron resolution during sensory and motor processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alivisatos et al., 2012</xref>). In the mammalian brain, large-scale cortical network activity is dynamically sculpted by local or long-range inputs from individual neurons in various cortical or subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koch et al., 2016</xref>). Decoding the principles of neuronal network activity is essential for understanding brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). One important aspect of such understanding is mapping the functional connectivity of single neurons in relation to cortical networks. Emerging studies using in vivo electrophysiological and imaging techniques have revealed that activities of single neurons are functionally coupled to those of local microcircuits or the global cortical networks, and such connectivity is dynamically regulated depending on the behavioral state of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clancy et al., 2019</xref>). While most of the current studies only provide a snapshot of the connectivity map of a single neuron, the development of procedures where both single-unit activity and large-scale cortical network dynamics of awake-behaving mice can be chronically recorded is desirable.</p><p>Previously, chronic extracellular recordings in rodent brains were achieved most widely using bundled microwires called tetrodes, and more recently extended to the use of high-throughput recording devices such as silicon probes including Neuropixels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bragin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vandecasteele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voigts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delcasso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of conventional chronic tetrode recording setups, a common feature is the inclusion of a microdrive that provides axial control over the positioning of the electrodes which allows the electrode position to be adjusted for better recording qualities throughout the experimental periods. However, this microdrive hinders simultaneous wide-field optical imaging of the cortex, making it difficult to investigate the correlation between subcortical single-unit activation and cortical network activity. On the other hand, chronic silicon probe recordings rely on a skull-mounted probe and a large headstage, also have the same limitation of not allowing for simultaneous wide-field imaging.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, we designed the Mesotrode system where we combine in vivo electrophysiology via multi-site tetrode implants and mesoscale brain imaging to characterize the functional connectivity of individual cortical or subcortical neurons chronically. We show that these tetrode preparations can obtain high-fidelity, single-unit activity in any cortical or subcortical structure. More importantly, this setup preserves optical access to the entire cranial window of the animal which permits simultaneous functional brain imaging as well as optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity across the whole dorsal cortex. To obtain high-resolution wide-field imaging of mouse brain activity, we chose to utilize GCaMP6, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (GECI) widely used to optically record suprathreshold neuronal activation due to its high sensitivity and optimal signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that GECIs can stably report neuronal activity over several months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Margolis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Silasi et al., 2016</xref>), making them ideal for chronic studies of cortical network dynamics. We found that neurons from various subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and other midbrain areas, display distinct functional connectivity patterns with the cortex. More importantly, we show that the spike-triggered maps (STMs) of recorded neurons can be stable for up to two months. Moreover, we extended Mesotrode to record facial nerve spiking activity and identified a novel cortical network that is causally involved in controlling facial movement, further highlighting the wide applicability of this technique. These results indicate that our Mesotrode can be widely exploited to investigate multiscale functional connectivity within the central nervous system of mice over an extended timescale.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chronic single-unit recording with wide-field transcranial imaging window</title><p>We developed the Mesotrode implantation procedure with the aim to make them low profile, flexible in location, minimally invasive, and yet stable while maintaining optical access to the entire dorsal cortex such that we can record chronic single neuron activity and mesoscale cortical dynamics simultaneously. Briefly, we fabricated tetrodes from tungsten wires which were then soldered to a miniature connector that was cemented onto the back of the mouse skull during surgery (see Materials and methods). The single tetrode was stiff enough to be straightly inserted into the deep brain areas through a small burr hole (&lt;1 mm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The body of the tetrode that remained outside of the brain was bent parallel to the skull and the minimal size helped preserve optical transparency during imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As the miniature connectors are low-profile, mice were group-housed after the surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and we did not observe significant damage to the window or the connectors after long-term monitoring. The tetrodes can be flexibly implanted in almost any brain structure of interest, either cortical or subcortical. We have successfully obtained high-quality recordings in the mouse cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and midbrain. The recording site of each tetrode is confirmed using <italic>post-hoc</italic> histological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that the single unit activity was relatively stable during 1 week, 2 weeks, and 2 months of recordings after implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), which is consistent with previously reported chronic tetrode recordings in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tolias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hong and Lieber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voigts et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chronic tetrodes recording compatible with mesoscale transcranial Imaging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of skull surface during tetrode implantation.

For example, the STM of a hippocampus neuron was associated with the RSP, BCS, and M2 region for 10 recording sessions on different days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). To better visualize the stability of STMs across recording, we used Mesonet, a machine-learning based toolbox for parcellating brain regions, to accurately align our mesoscale images to a common brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). We show that the STMs of a midbrain neuron were relatively stable over 2 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The spiking activity of the neuron on different days was highly correlated with the lower limb, upper limb, and trunk sensorimotor areas on both hemispheres of the cortex. To examine the neural correlates of different behaviors, we also incorporated a Raspberry pi camera to monitor the spontaneous behavior of the mice during brain activity recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). In this example, we show that the instantaneous firing rate and patterns of this midbrain neuron were highly correlated with the paw movement of the mouse, consistent with our finding that this neuron is functionally associated with the limb sensorimotor areas. These results highlight the power of this multimodal approach, in that it can link high-resolution single neuron activity with network dynamics of the entire cortex and concurrent animal behavior, which greatly improves our ability to dissect the functional role of individual neurons of any brain region.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Chronic spike-triggered average maps of hippocampus and midbrain neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Unfiltered brain RGB image showing the position of the tetrode (left), GCaMP6 fluorescence image (middle), and histology showing the recording site of the tetrode (right).

In order to validate the optimal number of clusters for partitioning our dataset, we evaluated the clustering effectiveness of a varied number of clusters when applying K-means clustering algorithm using Silhouette score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rousseeuw, 1987</xref>) and confirmed that 10 clusters are most appropriate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We found that STMs in each region exhibited a stereotypical distribution pattern. For example, STMs of cortical neurons were primarily assigned to clusters #1â3 and #5â7, corresponding to motor, barrel, and primary somatosensory cortex activation patterns. These activation areas also matched the locations of the recorded cortical neurons (e.g. motor cortical neurons showed motor area activated STMs), suggesting that the functional connectivity patterns of cortical neurons were localized to cortical areas surrounding the recorded neuron, which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clancy et al., 2019</xref>). Hippocampal neurons primarily displayed STMs with retrosplenial cortex activation (cluster#10, 59.6% of all hippocampal neuron STMs), reaffirming the dense functional connectivity between these two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karimi Abadchi et al., 2020</xref>). STMs of striatal neurons were dominated by two opposing patterns, where 47.7% of them showed a global activation except for the body (limb and trunk) somatosensory regions (cluster#4) and 28.8% of them showed only activation in the body sensory regions (cluster#9). Thalamic neurons exhibited diverse STM patterns with the primary activated regions in lateral anterior cortical regions (cluster#5, 5.6%, cluster#6, 23.3%, cluster#7 26.3% of all thalamic STMs) and medial cortical regions (cluster#8, 6.5%, cluster#9, 11.6%, cluster#10, 9.9% of all thalamic STMs). This suggested that thalamic neurons had diverse functional connectivity patterns in relation to the dorsal cortex, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). STMs of midbrain neurons were most assigned to cluster#8 with medial frontal and somatosensory cortex activation (cluster#8, 44.6% of all midbrain STMs), but also included functional connectivity patterns with various other cortical regions (cluster#6, 10.5%, cluster#9, 12.6%, cluster#10, 11.2% of all midbrain STMs). Interestingly, we found that neurons of different subcortical origins sometimes have overlapping STMs (e.g. cluster#9, and #10 exhibited by neurons from all subcortical regions), which suggests that they may be involved in the same subcortico-cortical functional pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Taken together, these findings highlighted the capability of Mesotrode to capture the diverse cortical functional connectivity patterns of neurons across brain regions using chronic electrodes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Linkage of spiking peripheral nerve to specific mesoscopic cortical maps</title><p>One key advantage of using our minimally invasive micro-electrode setup is the flexibility of the location where they can be implanted and the relatively small footprint at the insertion site. This allows us to explore the functional connectivity of neurons that are otherwise difficult to study. For example, itâs difficult to simultaneously record the neural activity of the facial motor nucleus and cortex in order to investigate the cortico-brainstem motor pathways that directly innervate facial muscles that control whisker movement and facial expressions in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sreenivasan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mercer Lindsay et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we implanted micro-wires on the facial motor nerve to record the spiking activity of the axonal projections from the facial motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). We obtained the STMs of facial motor nerves by simultaneous wide-field imaging of GCaMP6 mice (n=5 mice). Surprisingly, we found a distinct cortical pattern, activation in RSP, M2, and PTA areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), associated with facial motor nerve spiking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) in awake mice showing spontaneous movements. Using automated light-based mapping technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ayling et al., 2009</xref>), we found a broad area of the dorsal cortex, including the PTA region could evoke facial motor nerve spiking activity when optogenetically stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplements 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) within Thy1-ChR2 mice (n=6 mice). To further investigate causal relationships, we directly inhibited the PTA by optogenetically stimulating inhibitory neurons of the PTA region of VGAT-ChR2 mice (n=3 mice). Echoing our previous finding, inhibiting the PTA not only stopped the PTA neurons from firing but also prevented the facial movements of these mice when the blue light stimulation was on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that this observation is due to indirect inhibition of other brain areas, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activities in M1 and the barrel cortex (BCS). We confirmed that the neuron firing in these brain areas was not decreased by PTA inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). More interestingly, we saw a ârebound effectâ, a sudden increase in PTA neuron firing and facial movement, right after the stimulation is turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). This âoff responseâ supports the causal relationships between PTA and facial movement. These findings are consistent with the previous report that the PTA is involved in controlling active movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen and Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rathelot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auffret et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lyamzin and Benucci, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).

It is additionally challenging to study long-range connectivities (e.g. those between subcortical and cortical structures) given the extraordinary complexity of neuronal wiring between brain regions. Non-invasive methods such as fMRI have generated important connectivity models, such as the default mode network (DMN) model, which advanced our understanding of how distinct brain regions communicate with each other during different behavioral contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutierrez-Barragan et al., 2022</xref>). However, these methods typically lack the spatial and temporal resolution to understand the connectivity patterns of individual neurons. On the other hand, for more invasive techniques such as viral tracing, although they often provide detailed characterizations of the anatomical patterns between brain areas, the nature of the preparation for these techniques precludes gaining insights into the dynamic nature of the connectivity rules. In this study, we developed the Mesotrode that combined chronic tetrode recording with mesoscale Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to characterize mesoscale connectivity patterns of individual neurons. We showed that the functional connectivity patterns of individual neurons are relatively stable in the same behavioral state, and neurons from different brain regions display distinct distributions of these patterns. We further showcased the utility of our procedure by recording from the facial motor nerve and found a distinct cortical activation associated with facial nerve activity. Additionally, Mesotrode provides a wide-field access window for optogenetic stimulations. We showed a causal link between PTA activity and facial movement in mice. These findings established that our multimodal recordings combining chronic electrophysiology, mesoscale imaging, optogenetics, and behavioral characterization can be widely applied to further our understanding of neuronal connectivity and behaviors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Compared to other chronic recording setups</title><p>Our work employs compact tetrode electrodes that permit simultaneous resolution of single units and mesoscale GCAMP activity. It is conceivable that improvements in spike sorting fidelity could be made by switching to more densely spaced silicon probes. While this is an obvious advantage, these probes do not have a compact footprint and would interfere with regional imaging. Our approach adds to the plethora of techniques previously described to characterize long-range functional connectivity by combining single-neuron activity recording and mesoscale cortical imaging. These techniques typically differ in how and where the individual neuronsâ activities are recorded. For instance, Barson et.al used two-photon imaging to record individual cortical neuronsâ activities, which allows differentiation of different neuronal types through genetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barson et al., 2018</xref>), but it has lower temporal resolution and is restricted to recording cortical neurons. Xiao et.al, Clancy et.al, Peters et.al, and Liu et.al all used either silicon probes or neuropixel probes to record large populations of cortical or subcortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clancy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peters et al., 2021</xref>), but it remains difficult to use these setups to track activities of the same neurons over days. In addition to these approaches, we can use our chronic tetrode implantation to track neuronal activities at multiple brain regions over long periods of time to better describe the dynamic nature of global neuronal affiliations; however, the number of neurons that can be recorded per tetrode is limited which does reduce our data acquisition throughput.</p><p>Compared to most of the previously reported chronic tetrodes setups with the inclusion of a microdrive, our approach has the unique advantages that setting up the apparatus and implanting the tetrodes is a lot more straightforward, mini-connector enables group housing and it is compatible with overhead cameras which permits simultaneous optical interrogation of neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Battaglia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voigts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Billard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delcasso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voigts and Harnett, 2020a</xref>). However, it does come with the price that the tetrode cannot be moved after it is implanted, which means that the implant would fail if the health of the neuron deteriorates too much over time. Albeit, since our goal is to record the activity of the same neurons, we deemed it a worthy tradeoff for our purpose. Future studies could include experiments that would take advantage of bilateral symmetry by placing high-resolution silicon probes in one hemisphere and then reading out mesoscale maps in the other.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Variability of spike-triggered average maps in different brain regions</title><p>Activities of cortical pyramidal neurons are known to be coupled to local network activity; as such, STMs of these neurons often display activity motifs localized to the cortical regions they reside, indicating that their functional connections are mostly involved in local networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clancy et al., 2019</xref>).

Here, we extended these characterizations to more subcortical regions (i.e. striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain), and found that these neurons, similar to thalamic neurons, generate functionally diverse STMs. This can be attributed to the diverse cell types within these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phillips and Irvine, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, by classifying these STMs, we found that the connectivity patterns of neurons in different subcortical structures are varied. For instance, STMs of midbrain neurons can be primarily categorized into 4 classes, with each class having distinct activity motifs, which is in contrast to the striatum neurons, the STMs of which are grouped into only two main classes. More interestingly, STMs of different subcortical regions display low levels of overlap, suggesting that neurons of different subcortical origins form their own distinct connectivity pattern to the cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The spike-triggered average map associated with specific brain function</title><p>The single neuron defined functional maps (STMs) can reveal functional cortical architecture related to the activity of individual cortical and subcortical-cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>).

Samples sizes were chosen based on previous studies using similar approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>). Given the use of automated acquisition and analysis procedures, we did not employ blinding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tetrode fabrication</title><p>Polyimide insulated, tungsten wire (40 cm long, diameter 25 Î¼m, Stablohm 650, California Fine Wire, USA) was folded into four wires and clamped together with the modified alligator clip. The loop of wires was hung over the horizontal bar. The alligator clip was placed into the motorized stage. Eighty clockwise twists were applied and followed by forty counter clock-wise twists to the wire bundle over the course of approximately three minutes. After tetrode twisting was completed, the wires were fused together by heating from three different angles with a heat gun (420 Â°C or 790 Â°F), using medium-low flow. For each angle, begin 1â2 cm below where the wire bundle splits, the heat gun was held 2 cm away from the wire and moved periodically over the length of the wire for about 5 s. The tetrode was removed from the twisting apparatus by gently lifting the alligator clip to relieve tension on the tetrode, and cutting the tetrode near the alligator clip. At the other end, the loop was cut off such that there were four non-bonded strands of wire of equal length. The tetrode was then soldered to a miniature connector using a fine-tip soldering iron (Thermaltronics M8MF375 Micro Fine 0.25 mm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance in air). The eyes were covered with eye lubricant (Lacrilube; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.well.ca/">https://www.well.ca/</ext-link>) and body temperature was maintained at 37 Â°C with a heating pad with feedback regulation. Mice were then placed in a stereotaxic frame and received an injection of Lidocaine (0.1 ml, 0.2%) under the scalp. Mice also received a 0.5 ml subcutaneous injection of a saline solution containing buprenorphine (2 mg/ml), atropine (3 Î¼g/ml), and glucose (20 mM). Respiration rate and response to toe pinch were checked every 10â15 min to maintain the surgical anesthetic plane. A skin flap extending over both hemispheres approximately 8 mm in diameter (3 mm anterior to bregma to the posterior end of the skull and down lateral to eye level) was cut and removed. Fascia or connective tissue is lightly scraped away from the skull and small (&lt;1 mm diameter) holes are drilled through the skull, using a high-speed dental drill with a sterile bit, over the cortex. Tetrode was directed toward the center of the hole and placed in the target using a motorized micromanipulator (MP-225, Sutter Instrument Company). Miniature connectors (2x2 x 2 mm) are cemented to the skull (with dental adhesive) around the imaging window (the total weight is &lt;1 gm). Ground and reference electrodes are fixed into place on the surface of the posterior skull.</p><p>After tetrode implantation, the chronic transcranial window was implanted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Silasi et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the skin between the ears and the eyes was properly cleaned with Betadine dissolved in water and ethanol. The skin covering the occipital, parietal, and frontal bones was cut away. The fascia and any connective tissue on the skull surface were gently wiped off. C&amp;B-Metabond transparent dental cement (Parkell, Edgewood NY, USA; Product: C&amp;B Metabond) was prepared in a ceramic bowl and used to glue a head-fixing titanium bar to the cerebellar plate or a 4/40 stainless steel setscrew slightly angled posteriorly (~120Â° relative to skull). With the bar or the setscrew in place, a thick layer of dental adhesive was applied to the skull. A coverglass (Marien-feld, Lauda-Konigshofen, Germany; Cat n: 0111520) previously cut to the size of the final cranial window (~8 mm diameter), was placed on top of the dental cement before it solidified, preventing the formation of bubbles. The cement remains transparent after it solidifies and the surface vasculature should be readily seen through the final result.</p><p>For facial nerve recordings, peripheral nerve activity was measured by fine wire recording directly from the nerves subserving the whisker. During surgery, mice will be anesthetized and positioned on a warming pad connected to a rectal probe and temperature maintained at 37 Â°C. A skin incision was made, exposing a small part of the buccal branch of the left facial nerve. Magnification of the surgical field with a dissecting microscope allowed a careful dissection of a nerve branch with minimum disruption of the tissues and blood supply surrounding the nerve. The appropriate site of exposure was determined by using two projection lines: a vertical line running downward, posterior from the outer corner of the eye, and a horizontal line running in caudal direction, starting at the whisker E-row. Then two insulated fine wires (about 25 Âµm tips) were hooked and placed around the nerve separated about 2 mm from one another. The insulation at the ends of the wires was removed and a knot was made on each wire to prevent it from slipping. The opposite ends of each wire were soldered to a mini connector attached by dental cement to the skull. Finally, 6â0 silk sutures were used to close the skin incisions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Recovery and post-operative monitoring</title><p>At the end of the surgical procedures, mice received a subcutaneous injection of saline (0.5 ml) with 20 mM of glucose and were allowed to recover in their home cages with an overhead heat lamp. The activity level of mice that underwent the procedure was monitored hourly for the first 4 hr and every 4â8 hr thereafter. Mice are allowed to recover for 7 days from the window implantation before performing electrophysiology recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology data acquisition</title><p>For Electrophysiology recordings, a custom adapter was connected to the miniature connector. The tetrode signals were amplified using a 16-channel data acquisition system (20 kHz, USB-ME16-FAI-System, Multi-Channel Systems) and recorded for at least 30 min every day.</p><p>Raw extracellular traces were imported into Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) or SpikeSorter software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swindale and Spacek, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Swindale et al., 2021</xref>) for spike sorting and analysis. Briefly, data were high pass-filtered at 1 kHz, and excitatory spikes were detected using a threshold of 4.5 times the median of the standard deviation over 0.675. Sorting was carried out by an automated method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swindale and Spacek, 2014</xref>) and followed by manual visual inspection of units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Wide-field calcium imaging</title><p>All mice were habituated for 1 week prior to data collection. Awake mice were head-fixed and placed on a wheel in a dark imaging chamber for data collection. A behavioral camera (Raspberry Pi camera) and an infrared light were placed inside the imaging chamber to monitor active behaviors, such as running or whisking. A Pantera 1M60 CCD camera (Dalsa) was equipped with two front-to-front lenses (50 mm, f Â¼ 1.435 mm, f Â¼ 2; Nikon Nikkor) and a bandpass emission filter (525/36 nm, Chroma). The 12-bit images were captured at a frame rate of 120 Hz (exposure time of 7ms) with 8Ã8 on-chip spatial binning using EPIX XCAP v3.8 imaging software. The cortex was sequentially illuminated with alternating blue and green LEDs (Thorlabs). Blue light (473 nm) with a bandpass filter (467â499 nm) was used to excite calcium indicators and green light (525 nm) with a bandpass filter (525/50 nm) was used to observe changes in cerebral blood volume. The blue and green LEDs were sequentially activated and synchronized to the start of each frameâs exposure period with transistor-transistor logic such that each frame collected only fluorescence or reflectance signals at 60 Hz each. This LED strobe frequency of 60 Hz exceeded the critical flicker fusion frequency for mice, which marks the highest temporal frequency that an observer can resolve flicker before it becomes indistinguishable from constant light and was likely imperceptible to the mice. Reflectance signals were subtracted from fluorescence signals to mitigate the contribution of hemodynamics to fluorescence signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optogenetic stimulation protocols</title><p>Inhibitory neurons in the cortex were optogenetically manipulated separately in VGAT-ChR2 mice. A 473 nm laser (Crystal Laser BCL-473â050, Reno, NV, USA) was connected to a fiber optic patch cable (0.22 NA, 200 Âµm gauge; Thorlabs FG200UCC, USA). During the experiment, 1 mW (measured from the end of the cable) of optical stimulation was delivered for an overall time of 10 s. For automated Thy1-ChR2-based facial motor mapping, we chose a relatively collimated 473 nm laser targeted through a simple microscope. The laser was moved in random order to each of the predefined stimulation locations (8x8 grid) and delivered a flash of laser light (10ms, 2.0 mW) to each point while collecting facial motor nerve response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spike-triggered average maps (STM) Clustering</title><p>We employed an unsupervised clustering algorithm, PhenoGraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levine et al., 2015</xref>), to categorize STMs. The graph was built in 2 steps: (1) it finds k nearest neighbors for N input vectors (4096 dimensions for 64x64 STMs) using Euclidean distance, resulting in N sets of k nearest neighbors, (2) a weighted graph is built where the edge weight between pairs of nodes depends on the number of neighbors they share. We then perform Louvain community detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>) on this graph to partition the graph that maximizes modularity. This algorithm only requires one input parameter which is k, the number of nearest neighbors to be found for each input vector, and the resulting number of clusters (10) is relatively insensitive to the k chosen over the range of typically chosen values. We also performed k-means clustering using the same input and compared clustering effectiveness using the Silhouette score and found that 10 clusters were optimal. We then performed a cluster identity refinement step, where an individual STM whose similarity (Pearson correlation value) with the cluster average STM of the assigned cluster was lower than 0.3 was manually reassigned if its similarity with group average STMs of any other clusters was higher than 0.3; otherwise, that STM was excluded. A total of 94 out of 1146 STMs (8.2%) were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology</title><p>At the end of each experiment, animals were killed with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (24 mg). Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by chilled 4% PFA in PBS. Coronal or sagittal brain sections (50 Âµm thickness) were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Images of brain tissues with counter-stained DAPI were acquired using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510) to reveal the electrode track and help identify the approximate cortical/subcortical location of recorded cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, Version 9. Statistical tests and results are reported in the figure legends. More than two groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnettâs test comparing experimental flies to each control. All graphs represent mean Â± SEM. Sample sizes are listed in the figure legends. No explicit power analyses were used to determine sample sizes prior to experimentation. Minimum sample sizes were decided prior to experimentation based on previous experience or pilot experiments revealing how many samples are typically sufficient to detect reasonable effect sizes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal protocols (A13-0336-A22-0054 and A14-0266-A22-0258) were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and conformed to the Canadian Council on Animal Care and Use guidelines.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-87691-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Code used for data analysis and data generated in this study have been deposited in Open Science Framework repositories <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/67p3s/">https://osf.io/67p3s/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/ke6fg/">https://osf.io/ke6fg/</ext-link>.</p><p>The following datasets were generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Mesotrode</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17605/OSF.IO/67P3S</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Mesotrode2</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17605/OSF.IO/KE6FG</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Foundation Grant FDN-143209 and project grant to THM and the UBC Institute of Mental Health Marshall Scholars and Fellowship program.

We do provide examples of repeated spiking measurements across days from the same electrodes and animals. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic interrupting data collection and other factors, this dataset does not contain a thorough analysis of response longevity using these electrodes, but we do show examples in the figures. In Figure 1F, G, we showed that the single unit activity was relatively stable during one week, two weeks, and two months of recordings after implantation. In Figure 4B we showed spiking activity in the hippocampus was stable across day 8 and day 9. We also showed that the STM of the hippocampus neuron was consistently associated with the RSP, BCS, and M2 region for 10 recording sessions across days. In Figure 4D, We showed that the STMs of a midbrain neuron were relatively stable over 2 months.

The methodology described in the paper is based on chronic tetrode recordings combined with widefield calcium imaging. The authors emphasize the advantages of using tetrodes in that they are (1) easy to implant (2) have a small footprint, and (3) allow to record the same neurons over days.</p><p>I agree regarding the first advantage, however, the ability to reliably record the activity of the same neurons over days using electrophysiological recordings is controversial. The authors claim that:</p><p>'We found that the single unit activity was relatively stable, during one week, two weeks, and two months of recordings after implantation (Figure 1F, G)',</p><p>The only 'proof' the authors show for recording stability are waveforms of one neuron on one channel (out of presumably four channels), which seem to differ in amplitude over days. Two-dimensional plots of the neuron waveform for all channel combinations could be a more convincing way to make this claim. But, as I already mentioned - the ability to record from the same neurons chronically with electrophysiological methods is rather controversial, especially with tetrodes that don't allow for laminar profiling of neuronal response to account for a potential drift over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We now make it more clear that examples of mesotrode stability are indicated in the figures. Furthermore, we acknowledge caveats that spike sorting experiments required to more conclusively identify single neurons would be improved with larger format silicon probes. Our work employs compact tetrode electrodes that permit simultaneous resolution of single units and mesoscale GCAMP activity. It is conceivable that improvements in spike sorting fidelity could be made by switching to more densely spaced silicon probes. While this is an obvious advantage, these probes do not have a compact footprint and would interfere with regional imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors present little analysis justifying the advantage of conducting chronic electrophysiological recordings instead of acute recordings with their data. In fact, throughout the paper, the authors mention that the results were consistent with their previous work with acute recordings. The only longitudinal analysis in this paper is qualitative and suggests that cortical maps were stable over days. I believe this was also shown in the past already. More in depth analysis of across days dynamics or showcase of an experiment centered on across days dynamics will strengthen the appeal of this approach. Generally speaking, there is very little quantitative analysis of longitudinal maps/functional coupling of single neurons over days. The paper will benefit from at least some quantification of this part.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge data showing the persistence of spike-associated maps longer than an acute experiment is novel. However, due to a low yield of recorded single neurons, we have not been able to follow these maps over a longer period in a population that would permit group statistics. We suggest that future experiments could be done using silicon probes with larger yields which would help to better align electrophysiological features with mesoscale GCAMP maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Recording with tetrodes gives very low yields compared to silicon probe recordings. While silicon probes have a larger footprint and may occlude the widefield imaging on the side of the silicon probe implant, it is unclear why not to use denser electrode arrays on one side of the brain and image from the other hemispheres, given that the maps are very correlated across hemispheres</p></disp-quote><p>Taking advantage of mirrored activity in the opposite hemisphere is a great idea. Future studies could include experiments that would take advantage of bilateral symmetry by placing high-resolution silicon probes in one hemisphere and then reading out mesoscale maps in the other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The advantage of the electrophysiological recordings is in providing access to single-neuron activity at high temporal resolution. The authors could add more quantifications regarding individual neuron functional coupling diversity. For instance, in the per-area distributions in Figure 5D -- did all neurons from a given area participate in the same functional maps, or did different neurons show diversity in the functional coupling. Did simultaneous recordings of neurons from the same tetrode show more similar maps, than recordings of other neurons from the same area conducted on different days/in different animals? Did the map differ when the neurons were bursting/were at specific phases of the LFP, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately the yield of neurons was not enough to investigate some of the interesting state-dependent phenomena the reviewer describes. In previous work we have examined heterogeneity between single neuron responses in more detail Xiao et al. 2027 in acute work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Facial nerve stimulation. This part feels detached from the rest of the paper and is not explained/discussed in sufficient detail. For example, there is no description of the surgical procedure or the electrode used for facial nerve recordings in the Methods (in the Results section, the authors mention 'micro-wires', but the Method section only contains information about tetrodes).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up the issue of surgical details for facial nerve experiments are now in the methods. This information is also available by contacting the authors and below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For facial nerve recordings, peripheral nerve activity was measured by fine wire recording directly from the nerves subserving the whisker. During surgery, mice will be anesthetized and positioned on a warming pad connected to a rectal probe, and the temperature maintained at 37 Â°C. A skin incision was made, exposing a small part of the buccal branch of the left facial nerve. Magnification of the surgical field with a dissecting microscope allowed a careful dissection of a nerve branch with minimum disruption of the tissues and blood supply surrounding the nerve. The appropriate site of exposure was determined by using two projection lines: a vertical line running downward, posterior from the outer corner of the eye, and a horizontal line running in the caudal direction, starting at the whisker E-row. Then two insulated fine wires (about 25 Âµm tips) were hooked and placed around the nerve separated about 2 mm from one another. The insulation at the ends of the wires was removed and a knot was made on each wire to prevent it from slipping. The opposite ends of each wire were soldered to a mini connector attached by dental cement to the skull. Finally, 6-0 silk sutures were used to close the skin incisions.</p></disp-quote><p>The functional maps associated with facial nerve spiking show different patterns from the optogenetic stimulation maps that led to significant facial nerve responses. Specifically, the STM maps show responses in the posterior parts of the cortex, but the photostimulation map showed almost an opposite pattern, where the effects were observed in the anterior parts. The authors do not discuss this mismatch in sufficient detail. Further, the authors refer to area PTA but use partitions based on the Allen Institute, which does not indicate this area.</p><p>The posterior parietal area location is based on our previous work Mohajerani et al. 2013 and using the Allen Institute Brain Atlas for guidance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1.
