The biological processes underlying learning and memory are mediated by a variety of genes in the nervous system, acting at specific times during memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Many studies have utilised candidate gene approaches or random mutagenesis screens in model animals to explore the key molecular drivers for learning and memory. We propose a complementary approach to identify this network of learning regulators: the proximity-labelling tool TurboID, which promiscuously biotinylates neighbouring proteins, to snapshot the proteomic profile of neurons during learning. To do this, we expressed the TurboID enzyme in the entire nervous system of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and exposed animals to biotin only during the training step of an appetitive gustatory learning paradigm. Our approach revealed hundreds of proteins specific to ‘trained’ worms, including components of molecular pathways previously implicated in memory in multiple species such as insulin signalling, G-protein-coupled receptor signalling, and MAP kinase signalling. Most (87–95%) of the proteins identified are neuronal, with relatively high representation for neuron classes involved in locomotion and learning. We validated several novel regulators of learning, including cholinergic receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, LGC-46) and putative arginine kinase F46H5.3. These previously uncharacterised learning regulators all showed a clear impact on appetitive gustatory learning, with F46H5.3 showing an additional effect on aversive gustatory memory. Overall, we show that proximity labelling can be used in the brain of a small animal as a feasible and effective method to advance our knowledge on the biology of learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>protein</kwd><kwd>proximity labelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/011kf5r70</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1173448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chew</surname><given-names>Yee Lian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05mmh0f86</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP220102511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chew</surname><given-names>Yee Lian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01kpzv902</institution-id><institution>Australian Graduate Research Training Program (Flinders University)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rahmani</surname><given-names>Aelon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01kpzv902</institution-id><institution>Flinders University Research Scholarship (Flinders University)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMillen</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An innovative and scalable proximity labelling method profiled proteins present in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> brain during learning, identifying known regulators as well as novel biological pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All animals with a brain have the capacity to change their behaviour in response to changes in the environment. This capacity – to learn and remember – is essential for survival. There are numerous structural and molecular changes in the brain that modulate learning and memory in specific brain regions, occurring in a time and context-dependent manner (examples in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huckleberry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Peixoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Watteyne et al., 2020</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). Research using model organisms has been essential towards understanding the key regulatory mechanisms underlying learning, many of which involve neurotransmitter signalling, neuromodulator signalling, signal transduction pathways, and cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Peng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lamprecht, 2014</xref>). Importantly, many of these mechanisms appear to be conserved across diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matsumoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Multiple studies have demonstrated that changes in the neuronal proteome are required for learning and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Inberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barzilai et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Rosenberg et al., 2014</xref>). New protein synthesis appears to be critical in several contexts, as the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor (e.g. cycloheximide) has been shown to abolish long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pedreira et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hernandez and Abel, 2008</xref>). Moreover, protein degradation together with new protein synthesis has been strongly implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fazeli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Park and Kaang, 2019</xref>). There is also evidence that local translation in neurons, specifically the synthesis of specific proteins in dendritic regions (thereby altering local proteome composition), plays a key role in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bradshaw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Das et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>). Additionally, several key regulatory proteins have been shown to be required at specific timepoints, such as during the training/learning step, to trigger memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Stefanoska et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Watteyne et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the spatiotemporal regulation of protein composition within neurons is critical for learning and memory formation.</p><p>The molecular requirements for learning have primarily been identified by combining genetic approaches with behavioural paradigms to test learnt associations, typically through assaying candidate genetic mutants or performing a forward genetics screen. These strategies have been extremely insightful; however, they have some limitations. The first being that candidate genetic screens are time-consuming and labour-intensive and require subjective selection of which candidate genes to test (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hukema, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>). The second is that large-scale screens tend to only reveal genes that have the strongest phenotypes, so genes that have more subtle phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiroki and Iino, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lindsay et al., 2022</xref>), or act in redundant pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gyurkó et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Shahmorad, 2015</xref>), may not be identified using these approaches despite their contributions to learning.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, and to gain a holistic view of the molecular pathways that contribute to learning, we used an objective proteomics approach to snapshot the protein-level changes that occur specifically during learning. To do this, we expressed the proximity-labelling tool TurboID in the entire <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nervous system and used this to identify the proteins present in neurons during the training step of an associative learning paradigm we call ‘salt associative learning’. TurboID is an enzyme based on the BirA* biotin ligase, engineered to provide greater catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Branon et al., 2018</xref>) compared with the original BirA* enzyme used in BioID experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). TurboID catalyses a reaction where biotin is covalently added onto lysine residues – as this process requires biotin, its timing can be controlled by depleting tissues of biotin, then adding it exogenously only at specific time points. Additionally, spatial control can be provided by regulating the site of TurboID expression using cell-specific transgenes. TurboID has been used in multiple studies for identification of protein-protein interactions, usually by tagging a ‘bait’ protein N- or C-terminally with the TurboID enzyme, allowing for rapid biotinylation of bait interactors. Through this approach, TurboID has been used for protein-tagging experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Artan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Holzer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). For example, this approach identified cytoskeletal proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> proximal to the microtubule-binding protein PTRN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>), and detected interactors for ELKS-1, which localises other proteins to the presynaptic active zone in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Artan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In our study, rather than focusing on specific protein-protein interactions, we expressed TurboID that was not tagged with any bait protein in the entire nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to identify as many proteins as possible within the cytoplasm. Using this approach, we identified hundreds of proteins specific to ‘trained’ worms, which we refer to here as the <italic>learning proteome</italic>, including those in molecular pathways previously shown to contribute to learning and memory formation in worms and other organisms. In addition, we validated several novel regulators of gustatory learning, including cholinergic receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, and LGC-46), Protein kinase A regulator KIN-2, and putative arginine kinase F46H5.3. These proteins all show a clear impact on appetitive gustatory learning. F46H5.3 showed an additional effect on aversive gustatory learning, suggesting a more general role for this kinase in memory encoding. In summary, we have demonstrated that our approach to using proximity labelling to snapshot the brain of a small animal during training is a feasible and effective method to further our understanding of the biology of learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TurboID expression in the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> successfully labels proteins during learning</title><p>To model learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used a simple yet robust associative learning paradigm called salt associative learning. Briefly, this assay involves training worms to associate the absence of salt (NaCl) with the presence of food. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is typically grown in the presence of salt (usually ~50 mM) and displays an attraction toward this concentration when assayed for chemotaxis behaviour on a salt gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). Training/conditioning with ‘no salt +food’ partially attenuates this attraction (group referred to ‘trained’). This is because the presence of abundant food (unconditioned stimulus) is a strong innate attractive cue, and pairing this with ‘no salt’ (the conditioned stimulus) leads to the animals showing the same behaviour towards the conditioned stimulus as they do to the unconditioned stimulus, that is attraction towards no salt, reflected as a preference for lower salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). Similar behavioural paradigms involving pairings between salt/no salt and food/no food have been previously described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). Here, learning experiments were performed by conditioning worms with either ‘no salt +food’ (referred to as ‘salt associative learning’) or ‘salt +no food’ (called ‘salt aversive learning’).</p><p>To identify the learning proteome, we adapted this learning paradigm to incorporate TurboID-catalysed biotinylation of proteins specifically during the learning/conditioning step. We did this by (1) performing the salt associative learning assay on transgenic animals expressing TurboID in the entire nervous system (P<italic>rab-3::TurboID</italic>) and (2) adding biotin only when the worms are being trained (i.e. exposed to both food and ‘no salt’ in the ‘trained’ group, or to food and ‘high salt’ concentrations in the ‘high-salt control’ group). As an additional control, we performed the same assay on non-transgenic (non-Tg) animals that do not express TurboID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We then isolated proteins from &gt;3000 whole worms per group for both ‘high-salt control’ and ‘trained’ groups, most of which were subjected to a sample preparation pipeline for mass spectrometry, and some of which were probed via western blotting to confirm the presence of biotinylated proteins. The same pipeline was used to generate five biological replicates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of the TurboID approach for protein labelling in all <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> neurons during learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for mass spectrometry-based analysis.

We did not include no-biotin treatment controls due to the practical challenges of handling &gt;4 groups in the combined learning assay/mass spectrometry pipeline, for which &gt;3000 worms are required per group. Therefore, all groups were exposed to biotin during the 6 hr exposure period to food and either high salt (for control) or no salt (for trained; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that each experimental group displayed the expected phenotype after training, a portion of worms from all groups was tested using a chemotaxis assay. The chemotaxis index (CI) was used as a readout of learning performance: a positive CI reflects high salt preference, a CI close to 0 represents a more neutral response, and a negative CI represents low salt preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We confirmed after each learning assay that naïve/untrained worms had a strongly positive CI (~0.7–0.9), whereas trained animals showed a lower CI (~0.0). We also performed a learning control (indicated as high-salt ‘control’) in which the presence of food (the US) is paired with high salt concentrations – worms in this group are attracted to high salt and showed a strongly positive CI (~0.7–0.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), displaying a similar behaviour to naïve worms.

We next subtracted from ‘TurboID, control’ lists any proteins that appeared in ‘Non-Tg, control’ samples to generate a revised ‘TurboID, control’ protein list specific to each replicate. We then compared revised protein lists for ‘trained’ and ‘control’ worms from all biological replicates and examined both unique and shared proteins between these two groups. We found 304 proteins that were shared between ‘trained’ and ‘control’ TurboID groups, 706 proteins unique to the ‘TurboID, trained’ group, and 388 proteins unique to the ‘TurboID, control’ group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We refer to the <italic>learning proteome</italic> as proteins unique to samples for ‘TurboID, trained’ worms. When generating the learning proteome, we categorised proteins as ‘assigned hits’ based on the criteria that at least one unique peptide was identified by the MASCOT search engine for the protein identity from at least one biological replicate. We also examined peptide sequences in our peak lists that were considered ‘unassigned’ by MASCOT, as these sequences were not detected as unique for any protein by the software, but specific protein identities could be found by performing a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) query (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>; see Materials and methods for details).

We then performed a gene ontology (GO) term analysis of ‘cellular component’ to obtain a broad overview of the subcellular localisation of proteins identified in trained animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To do this, we generated protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of assigned protein hits within the learning proteome for subcellular components of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–G</xref>), using data from STRING and curated with the Cytoscape ClueGO tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>). We found that a majority of proteins were categorised as ‘cytoplasmic’ (28.1%) as expected from our approach, which utilised the TurboID enzyme not tagged to any bait protein; this means that we would anticipate the enzyme to be present relatively evenly across the cell body and to catalyse biotinylation of proteins in this space. We saw that an unexpectedly high proportion of proteins were nuclear (18.1%), despite the presence of a nuclear export signal in our TurboID transgene, which should prevent TurboID from entering the nucleus and biotinylating nuclear proteins – this could be due to some ‘leaky’ entry of the enzyme or biotin reactive species into the nucleus, or that some proteins are categorised solely as ‘nuclear’ in the ClueGO database when they are also present in other cellular components. Importantly, we found that a proportion of proteins are categorised as present in neuronal compartments – the pre-synapse (0.5%), cilia/dendrites (2.7%), and in the axon/(synaptic) vesicles (4.0%) – as expected from transgenic expression of TurboID in the nervous system.</p><p>Learning and memory formation in organisms with brains of varying sizes has been shown to involve key regulatory pathways including signalling via neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the insulin/insulin growth factor-like pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matsumoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Myhrer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>). We next categorised proteins within the learning proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) based on their known roles within these signalling pathways. This included (1) several GPCR components, including the G<sub>i/o</sub> protein subunit GOA-1 and G<sub>α</sub> protein subunit GPA-2, (2) regulators of insulin signalling including the DAF-2 insulin receptor, phosphoinositide 3-kinase AGE-1, and serine/threonine protein kinases AKT-1 and SGK-1, which were previously reported to modulate salt-based learning in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Tomioka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sakai et al., 2017</xref>), (3) MAPK signalling components including NSY-1/MAPKKK, MEK-2/MAPKK, and MPK-1/MAPK/ERK, (4) cAMP/PKA (protein kinase A) signalling regulators such as the regulatory PKA subunit KIN-2, and (5) multiple components that modulate synaptic vesicle release, including N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein NSF1/NSF-1 and syntaxin/SYX-2. In addition, we identified several proteins relevant to glutamate, acetylcholine, and GABAergic signalling. Several components involved in protein synthesis and degradation were also detected in our learning proteome, in line with studies that suggest changes in total protein composition following memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Inberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barzilai et al., 1989</xref>).

In summary, the learning proteome includes both known learning regulators and potentially novel candidates that warrant further study. We focused on proteins functioning within these pathways of interest in our subsequent investigations (highlighted nodes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we consistently observed enrichment of two metabolic pathways, fatty acid metabolism via the TCA cycle and carbohydrate metabolism (gluconeogenesis and glycolysis), in multiple biological replicates of mass spectrometry data, uniquely in TurboID-trained animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These metabolic pathways play essential roles, including in cellular energy production and macromolecule biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Krebs and Johnson, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goetsch and Lu, 1993</xref>).

Therefore, neurons enriched within the learning proteome include those known to be required for learning; other neurons not previously identified in this context, such as pharyngeal neurons, may warrant further study.</p><p>We complemented this analysis by using the CeNGEN database to search for gene lists encoding proteins (assigned hits only, minus non-transgenic controls) identified in control worms (388 genes) versus trained animals (706 genes) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Using the bulk gene search function in CenGEN (threshold = 2), we determined the number of genes from each list that are expressed in a specific neuron type. Values for the trained gene list were normalized to account for the ~1.8-fold increase in the number of proteins detected in trained samples compared to the high-salt control. For each neuron class that appeared in both datasets (128 in total), we calculated fold-change values between the number of genes from trained vs control gene lists. Neurons were ranked in descending order of fold-change. This ranked list is based on the relative enrichment of training-associated genes compared to control, with higher ranks suggesting neurons that may be more transcriptionally responsive or involved during training. These data are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>. Given that CeNGEN utilises transcriptomic data from L4 (juvenile) animals, neuron classes were also ranked using equivalent datasets for young adult hermaphrodites: Worm-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ghaddar et al., 2023</xref>) and CeSTAAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Princeton University, 2025</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). Importantly, CeSTAAN and Worm-Seq provide data for 79 and 104 neuron classes, respectively (vs 128 from CeNGEN); this section therefore focuses on CeNGEN data due to its greater coverage, with other datasets described in brackets. Moreover, as this analysis is descriptive and does not include statistical testing (e.g. bootstrapping), the rankings should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive, and future work incorporating formal statistical approaches will be important to validate these observations.</p><p>Cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons constituted 15% and 55% of neurons ranked #1–20, respectively (45% and 30% for CeSTAAN; 40% and 20% for Worm-Seq). Glutamate signalling components previously have been implicated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> learning paradigms involving salt (e.g. NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits <italic>nmr-1</italic> and <italic>nmr-2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kano et al., 2008</xref>). Acetylcholine has not been explored extensively in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for its involvement in learning but has been described in other animal models and in humans (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Other neuron classes identified have previously been implicated in salt-based associative learning (ranks in brackets): AVK interneurons (rank #7 for CenGEN; #37 for CeSTAAN; #76 for Worm-Seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beets et al., 2012</xref>), RIS interneurons (rank #14 for CenGEN; #1 for CeSTAAN; #31 for Worm-Seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wang et al., 2025</xref>), salt-sensing neuron ASEL (rank #18 for CenGEN; #16 for CeSTAAN; #34 for Worm-Seq as ‘ASE’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beets et al., 2012</xref>), CEP and ADE dopaminergic sensory neurons (individually ranked #22 and #39, respectively, for CenGEN, vs ‘CEP_ADE_PDE’ ranked #20 and #80 for CeSTAAN and Worm-Seq, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2008</xref>), and AIB interneurons (rank #21 for CenGEN; #11 for CeSTAAN; #67 for Worm-Seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). In summary, although there are some exceptions that may be reflecting expression differences between adult and L4 animals, the same neuron classes are generally seen as highly represented for trained animals (vs control) for all three transcriptomic datasets.</p><p>Interestingly, unlike its counterpart ASEL (rank #18 for CenGEN), the salt-sensing neuron ASER was ranked only #104/128 (for CenGEN, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). ASER becomes activated in response to a decrease in salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>) and its downstream targets likely function to redirect worms toward higher salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Appleby, 2012</xref>). This activation is suppressed after training that reduces attraction to high salt levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wang et al., 2025</xref>). It is possible that this learning-dependent suppression of ASER activity may explain its lower fold-change in trained versus control groups. Alternatively, given it is ranked #4 using the CeSTAAN database, potentially due to the use of adults and not L4, it is equally possible that additional proteomic changes may be required in ASER (vs ASEL, with rank #16) to trigger salt chemotaxis changes. Nevertheless, these findings imply a molecular and cellular switch facilitated by dual ASE neurons to express gustatory learning in the worm, which complements previous research.</p><p>Some neurons identified were not previously implicated in learning: IL1 polymodal head neuron class (rank #1 for CenGEN; #44 for CeSTAAN; #42 for Worm-Seq), motor neuron DA9 (rank #2 for CenGEN; #78 for CeSTAAN as ‘PDA_AS_DA_DB’; #95 for Worm-Seq as ‘DA_VA’), and interneuron DVC (rank #5 for CenGEN; #23 for CeSTAAN; #3 for Worm-Seq). IL1 releases glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>) and mainly functions in regulating foraging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hart et al., 1995</xref>), potentially indicating a role in food-based responses. Separately, cholinergic neuron DA9 and glutamatergic neuron DVC are involved in backward locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ardiel and Rankin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). Changes in locomotion are critical for learning-dependent modulation of chemotaxis: the incidence of sharp turns or ‘pirouette’ movements in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is influenced by prior experience in salt-based gustatory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). IL1 may influence salt-based learning by signalling through interneurons AVE (rank #24 for CenGEN; #10 for CeSTAAN; #87 for Worm-Seq) and PVR (rank #114 for CenGEN; neuron class not available in CeSTAAN; #44 for Worm-Seq) to the DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bhatla, 2009</xref>), potentially modulating backward locomotion as part of the chemotaxis response. We also identified pharyngeal neurons I3 (rank #4 for CenGEN; data not available in CeSTAAN nor Worm-Seq) and I6 (rank #5; neuron class not available in CeSTAAN nor Worm-Seq), which have not previously been implicated in learning. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> provides a summary for the neural circuits implicated from these analyses, where neuron classes are highly connected to each other.

replicate), since it is a known regulator of memory and was detected as a weak candidate by TurboID. Adenylyl cyclase is a key signalling effector for Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>i</sub> proteins and regulates levels of the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) within the cell. cAMP binding to PKA regulates its activity, and therefore its downstream effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sassone-Corsi, 2012</xref>). We tested worms with the <italic>ce179</italic> mutant allele in <italic>kin-2</italic>, in which a conserved residue in the inhibitory domain (which normally functions to keep PKA turned off in the absence of cAMP) is mutated to cause an R92C amino acid change – this results in increased PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Schade et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>kin-2</italic> has previously been shown to be required for intermediate-term memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>), with cAMP/PKA signalling previously shown to be involved in memory in multiple systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kandel, 2012</xref>). We found that these <italic>kin-2</italic> mutant animals showed enhanced learning compared with wild-type (i.e. Non-Tg worms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We next re-expressed KIN-2(R92C) in wild-type worms using a pan-neuronal promoter, and these worms showed a similar phenotype to <italic>kin-2(ce179)</italic> worms, with enhanced learning compared with non-transgenic siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data suggest that increased PKA activity in the nervous system drives salt associative learning.</p><p>We next assessed two strong candidates not previously assessed for their role in learning: putative arginine kinase F46H5.3 (four replicates) or armadillo-domain containing protein C30G12.6 (three replicates). Unlike <italic>kin-2(ce179)</italic> worms, neither single gene mutant obtained from the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center had been backcrossed. We backcrossed mutant strains four times to N2 and tested both non-backcrossed and backcrossed versions. An improved learning phenotype was displayed by both non-backcrossed and backcrossed <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In contrast, we found that non-backcrossed <italic>C30G12.6</italic>(-) animals displayed an enhanced learning phenotype, whereas backcrossed <italic>C30G12.6</italic>(-) mutants behaved like wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This suggests that the non-backcrossed <italic>C30G12.6</italic>(-) strain contains a background mutation that impacts learning capacity, a potential avenue for future work.</p><p>F46H5.3 is a homolog for creatine kinase B (cytoplasmic) and mitochondrial creatine kinase 1B, but is considered an arginine kinase since <italic>C. elegans</italic> use arginine instead of creatine. Both creatine kinases are essential for energy metabolism via ATP modulation. Given notable representation of metabolic pathways from the learning proteome identified here (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), this provided additional rationale for testing F46H5.3. Moreover, the depletion of creatine kinase B reportedly increases the latency needed for memory encoding of a spatial learning task in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jost et al., 2002</xref>). Since F46H5.3 is expressed in most neurons in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>)<bold>,</bold> this putative arginine kinase may affect learning capacity through modulating ATP levels in neurons.</p><p>We also tested genetic mutants for candidates involved in neurotransmission, a key function for all neurons and a requirement for learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Myhrer, 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>). Two strong candidates, cationic acetylcholine-gated calcium ion channel ACR-2 (four replicates) and cholinergic receptor interactor ELP-1 (three replicates), were not observed to regulate learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, several acetylcholine receptors that were weak candidates showed differences in learning compared with wild-type controls. Those tested include ACC-1 (one replicate), ACC-3 (2 replicates), and LGC-46 (1 replicate) in the subfamily of anionic ‘ACC’ acetylcholine-gated ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Morud et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>lgc-46</italic> mutants demonstrate a reduced capacity for learning compared with wild-type, whereas <italic>acc-1</italic> and <italic>acc-3</italic> mutants appear to display better learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B and C</xref>). Although these ACC receptors are activated by acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>), or have been reported to possess the same protein domain/s as known acetylcholine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Takayanagi-Kiya et al., 2016</xref>), they vary substantially in expression pattern in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). We postulate that acetylcholine signalling in specific neurons may therefore contribute to learning in different directions, an interesting avenue for future research. We also tested other genes involved in neurotransmission, such as <italic>gbb-2</italic> (for GABAergic signalling, 2 replicates) and <italic>glr-1</italic> (for glutamatergic signalling, 1 replicate), neither showed a detectable change in learning capacity compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). <italic>maco-1</italic> (1 replicate) encodes a macoilin family protein that functions broadly in neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arellano-Carbajal et al., 2011</xref>), and has previously been shown to regulate memory of olfactory adaptation in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kitazono et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>maco-1</italic> mutant tested in our study (<italic>nj21</italic>) did not show a locomotor defect but also did not show any obvious learning phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Our data, therefore, indicate that specific components of cholinergic signalling are required for salt associative learning.</p><p>We tested several components of GPCR signalling that were identified as learning proteome hits, including <italic>gap-1</italic> (one replicate), <italic>gap-2</italic> (three replicates), <italic>gpa-2</italic> (two replicates), and <italic>rho-1</italic> (two replicates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2E, F</xref>), but found that worms with single mutations for these genes, when compared to wild-type controls, did not show statistically significant differences in learning capacity. We postulate that although GPCR signalling is broadly important for learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jong et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>), there may be high levels of redundancy built within this pathway such that single pathway components can be compensated for by other functionally similar genes.</p><p>Several components of MAPK signalling have been shown to be involved in different forms of learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Peng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Ryu and Lee, 2016</xref>), including NSY-1/MAPKKK, MEK-2/MAPKK, and MPK-1/ERK that were identified as part of the learning proteome in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>). We tested the dual leucine zipper MAPKKK-encoding gene <italic>dlk-1</italic> (two replicates)<italic>,</italic> a mutant of this gene showed no difference in learning capacity compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>). The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant UEV-3 (four replicates) has been shown to be a member of the DLK-1 pathway and a potential interactor of p38/MAPK PMK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Trujillo et al., 2010</xref>); trained phenotypes between wild-type and <italic>uev-3</italic> mutants were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also tested worms with a mutation in <italic>fsn-1</italic> (three replicates), proposed to attenuate synapse growth in a DLK-1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hung et al., 2013</xref>). These animals displayed learning capacity similar to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In summary, these data indicate that mutating single components of the MAPK pathway does not generally perturb salt associative learning.</p><p>Finally, we assessed additional hits that do not fit in the pathways above but were considered strong candidates. These include neuronal adhesion/IGCAM gene <italic>rig-4</italic> (three replicates) or putative guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor genes (<italic>aex-3</italic> or <italic>tag-52</italic>, both three replicates). Aversive associative learning in worms and mice both relies on IGCAM gene <italic>ncam-1/NCAM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cremer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Vukojevic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Doyle et al., 1992</xref>). Additionally, guanine nucleotide exchange factors ‘ArhGEF4’ and ‘RapGEF2’ in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jiang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>), as well as <italic>unc-73</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arey et al., 2018</xref>), have been linked to learning and memory previously. We found that <italic>aex-3</italic>(-), <italic>rig-4</italic>(-), and <italic>tag-52</italic>(-) single mutants did not show significant differences in salt associative learning compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F, G and H</xref>). We also tested <italic>elo-6</italic> (three replicates), which encodes a long chain fatty acid elongase that potentially functions together with another elongase encoded by <italic>elo-5</italic>, although only <italic>elo-6</italic> is expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kniazeva et al., 2004</xref>). Fatty acid composition has previously been demonstrated to be important for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wallis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pershina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akefe et al., 2024</xref>). Our data showed no significant learning defect or improvement in <italic>elo-6</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>), although, as mentioned, its role may be masked by functional redundancy.</p><p>Other strong candidates tested that did not show a learning phenotype include: (1) <italic>ift-139</italic> (5 replicates), a ciliogenesis gene that was explored since hippocampal cilia structures have been seen to be important for memory in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Niwa, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jovasevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Berbari et al., 2014</xref>). (2) <italic>tap-1</italic> (three replicates), which encodes an ortholog for TGF- β activated kinase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Meneghini et al., 1999</xref>), (3) SAEG-1 (four replicates), a suppressor for protein kinase G (PKG) ortholog EGL-4 activity, which has been implicated in behavioural changes induced by odour-sensory fatigue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">L’Etoile et al., 2002</xref>; cGMP-dependent kinase PKG also promotes long-term memory in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ota et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Paul et al., 2008</xref>), and (4) VER-3 (three replicates), which encodes a predicted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Popovici et al., 2002</xref>). VEGF/VEGFR was reported to be upregulated in rats following spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cao et al., 2004</xref>). These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref><bold>.</bold></p><p>There are several potential reasons why many mutants tested did not display a learning phenotype. Firstly, as mentioned above, effects may be masked by redundant or compensatory pathways. For example, IGCAM genes in the worm have been reported to act redundantly in axon navigation, including <italic>rig-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Schwarz et al., 2009</xref>). It is also possible that these mutations do not fully knock out protein function. We generally assessed animals with deletion mutations predicted to disrupt protein function, but we did not confirm this through qualitative or quantitative means. Additionally, many mutants used here were not backcrossed as it was beyond the scope of this study, so these lines may have background mutations masking learning phenotypes of the mutations of interest. This was seen for <italic>C30G12.6</italic>(-) animals in this study, where an enhanced learning phenotype in non-backcrossed worms was lost after backcrossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Separately, although memory encoding (learning) and retention are interlinked biological processes, they are molecularly distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Watteyne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>). Typically, learning is assayed for <italic>C. elegans</italic> immediately after training, whereas memory retention is assessed after a post-training rest period – this assessment usually relies on a behavioural change representing learning/memory formation. It is possible that some candidates detected in neurons during learning may correspond to those important for memory retention and not encoding, so it may be worth utilising this proteomic dataset as a resource to explore this concept in future. Finally, the population-wide chemotaxis assays we perform here to validate candidates may not be sensitive enough to capture subtle potential behavioural differences caused by these mutations. Pirouette and weathervane behaviours in <italic>C. elegans</italic> change based on previously experienced salt concentrations in the presence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). These behaviours can be measured through more in-depth investigation of locomotor behaviour through live tracking and analysis, providing a more sensitive measure for learning responses compared to the chemotaxis assays used here. These factors are important considerations for future experiments utilising the learning proteome as rationale to assess novel mechanisms in learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Arginine kinase F46H5.3 regulates both appetitive and aversive gustatory learning</title><p>Next, we explored whether the learning regulators identified from our learning proteome functioned more broadly in other types of learning. To do this, we assayed salt aversive learning capacity (training with aversive cue i.e. starvation) for candidates seen to affect salt associative learning (training with an appetitive cue i.e. presence of food): PKA regulatory protein KIN-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), arginine kinase F46H5.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and acetylcholine receptor subunits ACC-1, ACC3, and LGC-46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the salt associative learning assay used thus far, ‘trained’ worms are exposed to a pairing of no salt + food (‘control’ worms with high salt +food), whereas in salt aversive learning, ‘conditioned’ worms are exposed to high salt + no food (and control ‘mock-conditioned’ worms with no salt + no food). In the salt aversive learning assay, ‘conditioned’ worms therefore learn to avoid high salt (as it is associated with starvation, a strongly negative cue), whereas ‘mock-conditioned’ worms and naïve worms retain a preference for high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). We found that only <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutant worms showed a significant change in learning capacity for salt aversive learning compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Specifically, <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutants displayed a larger decrease in CI in trained animals compared to wild-type trained worms, demonstrating a potential learning improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutant phenotype also showed enhanced learning for the salt associative learning paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Although <italic>kin-2(ce179)</italic> mutants were not shown to impact salt aversive learning, they have been reported previously to display impaired intermediate-term memory (but intact learning and short-term memory) for butanone appetitive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>). These findings therefore suggest (1) a generalised effect for F46H5.3 in gustatory learning paradigms involving salt, (2) a specific role for KIN-2 in appetitive learning paradigms, and (3) a unique effect for ACC receptors ACC-1/2 and LGC-46 in salt associative learning only.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Using TurboID to predict potential molecular and cellular pathways for learning</title><p>Our TurboID approach provides a unique benefit as a systems-based tool, in that it can be used to map individual candidates onto broader molecular networks. F46H5.3 is mostly uncharacterised beyond its predicted homology to creatine kinase B and mitochondrial creatine kinase 1B. As its role within learning pathways is unknown, we tested for protein-protein interactions between F46H5.3 and other candidates in the learning proteome using the software STRING (version 12.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>), aiming to infer its potential function within a molecular network. Mitochondrial creatine kinases regulate phosphocreatine synthesis using ATP, which requires calcium influx into mitochondria to induce ATP synthesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schlattner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schlattner et al., 2006</xref>). Voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC-1 (identified in three replicates of learning proteome data) plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Shoshan-barmatz et al., 2017</xref>) and is predicted interactor of F46H5.3. Moreover, calcium influx into the mitochondria is regulated by calcium/calmodulin kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>), an established and highly conserved regulator of learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ataei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zalcman et al., 2018</xref>). The sole calcium/calmodulin kinase II in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (UNC-43, two replicates) is predicted to interact with VDAC-1. Our learning proteome also includes proteins involved in calcium/calmodulin complex formation (e.g. calmodulin/CMD-1 in four replicates and cyclic nucleotide–gated ion channel TAX-4 in one replicate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Karabinos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Komatsu et al., 1999</xref>). Calcium/calmodulin complexes can also modulate cAMP levels (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Sharma and Kalra, 1994</xref>), which influences PKA/KIN-1 activity regulation by KIN-2 and A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP-1 (two replicates; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sadeghian et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, cytoplasmic calcium homeostasis is one potential pathway through which both KIN-2 and F46H5.3, validated in our study as learning regulators, modulate learning and memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Learning regulators KIN-2 and F46H5.3 may modulate learning through calcium signalling pathways.</title><p>Pathway components present within the learning proteome are shown with protein names in bold.

These neurons are involved in reversals and forward locomotion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). It is possible that these learning regulators influence experience-based behaviour through modulating the function of these neurons to alter chemotaxis responses in the presence of gustatory cues.</p><p>KIN-2 and F46H5.3 share the same expression pattern in many neuron classes, whereas neurons expressing the three ACC receptors are more diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). ACC-3 is expressed in salt-sensing ASE, mechanosensory and dopaminergic CEP neurons, polymodal sensory neuron IL1, and two interneuron classes (ADA and RIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). ADA’s function is not well-characterised, but it is predicted to be involved in chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Sohn et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, ACC-1 and LGC-46 are expressed in several interneurons and motor neurons including those implicated in gustatory or olfactory learning paradigms (AIB, AVK, NSM, RIG, and RIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fadda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wang et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sato et al., 2021</xref>) and important for backward or forward locomotion (AVE, DA, DB, and VB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). There are also highly represented neuron classes which are not as well defined (ADA, I4, M1, M2, and M5), which may present interesting directions for future research. Cholinergic signalling may therefore regulate gustatory learning through integration of sensory signals as well as direct modulation of the motor circuit. In contrast, KIN-2 and F46H5.3 may play more general functions within the nervous system, such as through modulating calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Our five candidates of interest (ACC-1/3, F46H5.3, KIN-2, and LGC-46) were reported in the same neuron classes as in CeNGEN, further suggesting that these neurons may be important for memory encoding in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ghaddar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Roux et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Smith et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">St Ange et al., 2024</xref>).

The expression of TurboID in the whole nervous system of the worm, and addition of biotin only during the training step of salt associative learning, allowed us to label proteins in neurons during this critical stage of memory encoding. We identified these proteins by mass spectrometry and revealed a putative ‘learning proteome’ including known learning regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). Moreover, we identified five novel regulators of appetitive gustatory learning, namely three acetylcholine receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, and LGC-46), PKA regulatory subunit KIN-2, and the arginine kinase F46H5.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Finally, F46H5.3 was observed to modulate an aversive gustatory learning paradigm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>. These findings highlight that proximity labelling can be used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to elucidate novel learning regulators, which may function across learning paradigms characterised by different modalities or valences.</p><p>Learning and memory are key functions of the nervous system and are critical for survival. Forms of associative learning have been studied in invertebrate and vertebrate animals for decades, revealing many important insights on the behavioural, neuroanatomical, and molecular requirements for learning and memory formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hawkins and Byrne, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jong et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kandel, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matsumoto et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Peng et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Peng et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Ryu and Lee, 2016</xref>). However, many studies focus on single genes of interest and are therefore unable to reveal the entire network of molecular players that drive (or inhibit) learning. We used a complementary approach to take a snapshot of the proteins present in the brain during learning, using the protein-labelling tool TurboID. Previously, microarray analysis had been done to characterise transcriptomic changes during long-term memory formation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lakhina et al., 2015</xref>). While this provides useful insights into the mechanisms of memory formation, it does not capture proteomic information, which may differ from RNA levels. Separately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiroki and Iino, 2022</xref> applied TurboID to map protein-protein interactions of PKC/PKC-1 in untrained <italic>C. elegans</italic>, providing insight into how PKC-1 affects gustatory appetitive learning. Our work builds on this by directly comparing trained and high-salt control conditions, offering new insights into the proteomic landscape of learning. Our strategy identified several components of molecular pathways previously shown to be generally required for learning, including neurotransmitter signalling, MAPK signalling, insulin signalling, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and GPCR signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). We identified regulators of learning that may not have been obvious choices for a candidate screen and that may have had phenotypes too subtle to be highlighted through a random mutagenesis screen. We therefore conclude that our approach is a useful and scalable method that can be used in multiple systems to delineate the molecular requirements for different forms of learning.</p><p>There are several interesting unanswered questions: Firstly, why did some candidates only seem to affect gustatory appetitive learning, as opposed to showing effects in both gustatory appetitive and aversive paradigms? Mutants of ACC-1, ACC-3, LGC-46, and KIN-2 show significantly different learning capacities for salt associative learning compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) but did not show differences when tested for salt aversive learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, only <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutants showed a significant learning difference in both salt associative learning and salt aversive learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). One possibility is that our method for selecting hits from our mass spectrometry data for downstream validation introduced an unintended bias: to identify the learning proteome, we subtracted proteins in the list for ‘high-salt control’ worms from the protein list for ‘trained’ worms, for each biological replicate. The main difference between high-salt control and trained worms was whether they were exposed to a pairing of ‘salt + food’ (control) or ‘no salt + food’ (trained). It is possible that proteins present in trained worms, but not high-salt control worms, during conditioning are those that are strongly regulated by changes in salt concentration (and therefore impact mainly appetitive gustatory learning with ‘no salt’, versus salt aversive learning induced in the presence of salt). Indeed, our ‘simple subtraction’ approach may be an overly conservative method for selecting learning regulators, as it is likely that many neuronal proteins generally important for learning (i.e. across multiple learning paradigms) are present in both groups, but at higher (or lower) levels in trained worms.</p><p>Secondly, why do the different acetylcholine receptors that we identified in our study impact learning differently? We showed that loss-of-function mutants of ACC-1 and ACC-3 show improved learning, whereas <italic>lgc-46</italic>(-) mutants displayed a learning defect compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). One study suggested that ACC-1 and ACC-3 may function together: ACC-3 homomers do not respond robustly to acetylcholine, but ACC-1 and ACC-3 can form a functional heteromer, albeit with lower sensitivity to acetylcholine than ACC-1 homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>). ACC-1 and ACC-3 functioning as heteromers may be why these proteins impact learning in the same direction. On the other hand, LGC-46 is also a member of the acetylcholine-gated chloride channel (ACC) family but impacts salt associative learning in the opposite direction to ACC-1 and ACC-3. LGC-46 (in 81 neurons) has a much broader expression pattern than ACC-1 (in 32 neurons) or ACC-3 (in 14 neurons) and is expressed in many more interneurons and motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). It is therefore possible that some of the LGC-46-expressing neurons function to regulate learning in a different manner to ACC-1- or ACC-3-expressing cells.</p><p>Our approach demonstrates a powerful method to uncover regulatory networks for a variety of behaviours; however, one factor we aim to improve in the future is the amount of background ‘noise’ observed in the learning proteome. While the five biological replicates of learning proteome data did reveal genes and molecular pathways implicated in learning and memory, there was also potential background. For example, when assessing the overlap between all proteins (i.e. both assigned and unassigned proteins <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), a large proportion of genes identified were categorised as ribosomal (4–12%), mitochondrial (8–12%), or involved in reproduction (16–19%; STRING database, accessed Feb 2024). Mass spectrometers detect peptides by abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bakalarski et al., 2008</xref>), so many of these highly abundant proteins may have preferentially been detected over less abundant neuronal proteins. There are several ways to reduce background and improve the signal-to-noise ratio: (1) using an integrated transgenic line that expresses TurboID with 100% transmission, as the line used in our study had a 70–80% transmission rate, (2) using a cell-sorting strategy (e.g. by flow cytometry) to isolate a tissue of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Beets et al., 2020</xref>; this is particularly useful if the tissue of interest is only a low proportion of the worm biomass (e.g. neurons are 1% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Froehlich et al., 2021</xref>), as proteins from larger tissues, such as the gut and germline, may interfere with detection, and (3) removing highly abundant background proteins during mass spectrometry sample preparation, such as mitochondrial carboxylases that are endogenously biotinylated, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Artan et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>There are also inherent limitations to using a qualitative approach. While our approach includes weak candidates and does not include a statistical framework for comparing protein abundance between experimental groups, this flexibility allows for the identification of potentially novel regulators that might otherwise be overlooked in more stringent analyses. Notably, we did observe relationships between weak candidates and learning. For example, ACC-1, which modulates salt associative learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, was detected in one replicate of mass spectrometry as a potential learning regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To address the lack of quantitative comparison, we categorised each candidate with their occurrence per replicate of mass spectrometry data for TurboID trained versus high-salt control datasets (summary of this data for candidates tested shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the raw mass spectrometry data is provided for each biological replicate and experimental group via an open-access server (see ‘Data Availability’), enabling transparency and further analysis by the research community. Future studies could benefit from implementing a quantitative approach to directly measure protein abundance differences between trained and control groups. While integrating such approaches with TurboID is challenging due to the requirement for biotinylated protein enrichment, overcoming these limitations, or using an alternative proteomic strategy, could uncover additional learning regulators.</p><p>Finally, while the learning regulators identified in this study support the validity of our proteomic approach, further functional validation is important. Testing for rescue of learning phenotypes in transgenic lines re-expressing learning regulators pan-neuronally, endogenously, or in single neurons would provide valuable insight into their functions within the nervous system. Our attempts to generate such rescue lines using standard microinjection techniques encountered several technical challenges, including difficulties with low transmission rate, potentially due to plasmid toxicity, and culturing issues potentially caused by transgene-dependent reproductive defects. To overcome these challenges, future work may utilise single-copy integration methods to reduce transgene dosage or use tissue- or cell-specific RNA interference to achieve targeted knockdown. These approaches could provide more precise insights into the roles of learning regulators within specific neuronal contexts.</p><p>In conclusion, we present an effective and scalable approach to identify the network of molecular processes that drive learning and memory formation, using the compact <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system. Our data reveal proteins from established biological pathways linked to associative memory, and through which we have identified novel regulators of gustatory associative learning. Future studies using this approach to identify learning regulators in other contexts will advance our understanding of the complex spatiotemporal regulation of learning and memory. This may help to elucidate the principles through which different memory types arise from the combination of specific neuronal signals, individual brain regions/cells, and different sensory modalities, relevant to brains of many sizes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strain maintenance</title><p>Young adult (day 1) hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic> were grown using standard conditions on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar in petri dishes at 22 °C for all experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Our criteria for ‘unassigned hits’ were the protein identity required (1) at least one peptide for the protein with a peptide score ≥15 calculated by MASCOT, (2) a 100% identity match between peptide sequences with a peptide score ≥15 and the protein determined by BLAST, and (3) an e-value &lt;0.05 for the identity match calculated by BLAST, such that a smaller number represents an increased probability that the identity is true and not given by random chance.

The naïve group could then be immediately tested for their innate response to salt using the salt chemotaxis assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Rahmani et al., 2024</xref>).

Each table compares biotinylated protein signal between experimental groups, which are non-transgenic/Non-Tg (from N2) or TurboID/TbID-expressors (from YLC207). Rows corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> involve high-salt control and trained groups prepared for mass spectrometry experiments (i.e., with biotin exposure limited to memory encoding), whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> compares untreated versus biotin-treated animals, Each row corresponds to a unique biological replicate of western blot and mass spectrometry data as annotated under the ‘Replicate’ column. For each sample, the sum of areas containing bands within an entire lane is used as a readout for biotin-tagged protein signal intensity from whole worm lysates. Non-transgenic/Non-Tg <italic>C. elegans</italic> and TurboID/TbID were treated with biotin during salt associative learning, to generate high-salt control and trained groups for each line. (C) Protein lists for all assigned hits detected in TurboID, trained worms. <italic>C. elegans</italic> peptides were assigned corresponding protein identities by MASCOT and then assigned protein lists were generated for each biological replicate by subtracting proteins also present in ‘non-transgenic, trained’ worms and/or in ‘TurboID, control’ worms within the same replicate. Each protein list in rows 9–378 are defined in this table by its corresponding biological replicate, the mass spectrometer used, and the inclusion of data from unbound and bound peptide samples. Peptide samples generated for biological replicate 3 were run in both mass spectrometers used in this study, the Q Exactive or the Exploris, and the corresponding protein list is named ‘3 a’ and ‘3b’ respectively. (D) Protein lists for all unassigned hits detected in TurboID, trained worms. Protein identities were determined through bulk BLAST searching <italic>C. elegans</italic> peptides detected by mass spectrometry, rather than MASCOT, and then unassigned protein lists were generated for each experimental group in each biological replicate. Proteins also in ‘non-transgenic, trained’ and/or ‘TurboID, control’ lists for the same biological replicate were subtracted from the corresponding ‘TurboID, trained’ list.

(E) Cellular component GO terms associated with assigned hits in the learning proteome. All (1010) assigned protein hits detected in TurboID, trained worms were separated into 10 clusters by k-means clustering on STRING (version 12.0) and GO term analysis was conducted for each cluster using ClueGO (version 2.5.10) on Cytoscape (version 3.10.0). GO terms were then sorted into ‘plasma membrane &amp; extracellular matrix (ECM)’, ‘cilia &amp; dendrites’, ‘cell body &amp; cytoplasm’, ‘nucleus’, ‘Golgi apparatus’, ‘cytoskeleton’, ‘mitochondria’, ‘axon &amp; vesicles’, ‘pre-synapse’, and ‘other’ (i.e., non-informative terms) categories due to recurring and/or similar terms. Colour-coding is based on the GO Group. Each category is separated by underlined and bolded titles corresponding to the cellular component in rows 1–285. Consolidated lists of genes/proteins are detailed from rows 287–465. (F) Biological process and molecular function GO terms associated with assigned hits in the learning proteome. All (1010) assigned protein hits detected in TurboID, trained worms were separated into 10 clusters by k-means clustering on STRING (version 12.0) and GO term analysis was conducted for each cluster using ClueGO (version 2.5.10) on Cytoscape (version 3.10.0). GO terms were then sorted into ‘protein synthesis’, ‘protein degradation’, ‘insulin &amp; protein kinases’, ‘G protein signalling’, and ‘neurotransmission’ categories due to recurring and/or similar terms. Colour-coding is based on the GO Group. Each category is separated by underlined and bolded titles corresponding to the biological processes listed above in rows 1–109. Consolidated lists of genes/proteins are detailed from rows 111–162. (G) Identifying neuron classes represented within the learning proteome in this study. This table presents neurons that express ≥1 gene encoding proteins found in either the trained or control lists. For neurons present in both datasets, fold-change values were calculated as the ratio of the number of genes expressed in the trained condition to those in the control. Neurons are ranked in descending order of fold-change. Values under the '#Proteins from trained (normalised)' column are normalised based on the fold-difference between the number of proteins in the trained vs control protein lists (normalisation factor = ~1.8). Classifications for neuron type are assigned to each neuron class based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>. The CeNGEN database was used to identify gene expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Taylor et al., 2021</xref> and includes all 302 neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite nervous system. Only 128 neuron classes are listed here since neurons that do not express any proteins from trained or control groups are not shown. (H) Molecular pathways for proteins detected in TurboID, trained <italic>C. elegans</italic> only. Proteins unique to trained animals that express TurboID were identified by subtracting those also in ‘TurboID, control’ and/or ‘non-transgenic, trained’ protein lists. Gene names are listed with assigned hits in bold. Each gene/protein has been grouped based on ‘Biological Process’ GO term annotations provided by STRING (version 12.0) and information available on WormBase (version WS290) based on data accessed during September-November 2023.

Altogether, they uncover 706 proteins tagged by the TurboID method in worms that underwent the memory-inducing protocol. Next, the authors conduct a gene enrichment analysis that implicates specific molecular pathways in salt-associative learning, such as MAP kinase and cAMP-mediated pathways, as well as specific neuronal classes including pharyngeal neurons, and specific sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. The authors then screen a representative group of hits from the proteome analysis. They find that mutants of candidate genes from the MAP kinase pathway, namely dlk-1 and uev-3, do not affect performance in the learning paradigm. Instead, multiple acetylcholine signaling mutants, as well as a protein-kinase-A mutant, significantly affected performance in the associative memory assay (e.g., acc-1, acc-3, lgc-46, and kin-2). Finally, the authors demonstrate that protein-kinase-A mutants, as well as acetylcholine signaling mutants, do not exhibit a phenotype in a related but distinct conditioning paradigm-aversive salt conditioning-suggesting their effect is specific to appetitive salt conditioning.</p><p>Overall, the authors addressed the concerns raised in the previous review round, including the statistics of the chemotaxis experiments and the systems-level analysis of the neuron class expression patterns of their hits. I also appreciate the further attempt to equalize the sample size of the chemotaxis experiments and the transparent reporting of the sample size and statistics in the figure captions and Table S9. The new results from the panneuronal overexpression of the kin-2 gain-of-function allele also contribute to the manuscript. Together, these make the paper more compelling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108438.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study by Rahmani in colleagues, the authors sought to define the &quot;learning proteome&quot; for a gustatory associative learning paradigm in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

This approach revealed hundreds of proteins potentially involved in learning, which the authors describe using gene ontology and pathway analysis. The authors performed functional characterization of over two dozen of these genes for their requirement in learning using the same paradigm.

To identify learning-related proteins, authors employed nervous system-specific transcriptome analysis to compare whole proteins in neurons between high-salt-fed animals and saltless-fed animals. Authors identified &quot;learning-specific proteins&quot; which are observed only after saltless feeding. They categorized these proteins by GO analyses, pathway analyses and expression site analyses, and further stepped forward to test mutants in selected genes identified by the proteome analysis. They find several mutants that are defective or hyper-proficient for learning, including acc-1/3 and lgc-46 acetylcholine receptors, F46H5.3 putative arginine kinase, and kin-2, a cAMP pathway gene. These mutants were not previously reported to have abnormality in the learning paradigm.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>Upon revision, authors addressed all concerns of this reviewer, and the results are now presented in a way that facilitates objective evaluation. Authors' conclusions are supported by the results presented, and the strength of the proteomics approach is persuasively demonstrated.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>(1) Total neural proteome analysis has not been conducted before for learning-induced changes, though transcriptome analysis has been performed for odor learning (Lakhina et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029</ext-link>). This warrants the novelty of this manuscript, because for some genes, protein levels may change even though mRNA levels remain the same. Although in a few reports TurboID has been used in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this is the first report of a systematic analysis of tissue-specific differential proteomics.</p><p>(2) Authors found five mutants that have abnormality in the salt learning. These genes have not been described to have the abnormality, providing novel knowledge to the readers, especially those who work on <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavioural plasticity. Especially, involvement of acetylcholine neurotransmission has not been addressed before. Although transgenic rescue experiments have not been performed except kin-2, and the site of action (neurons involved) has not been tested in this manuscript, it will open the venue to further determine the way in which acetylcholine receptors, cAMP pathway etc. influences the learning process.</p><p>[Editors' note: this version has been assessed without input from the reviewers.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108438.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rahmani</surname><given-names>Aelon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McMillen</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Ericka</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ansaar</surname><given-names>Radwan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Renee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Michaela E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Poljak</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, University of New South Wales</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sydney</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chew</surname><given-names>Yee Lian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Comment from the editors at eLife:</bold></p><p>You could consider further strengthening the manuscript with the incorporation of new relevant public datasets for network modeling, but that is entirely your choice.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their thoughtful and positive feedback on our article.

Altogether, they uncover 706 proteins tagged by the TurboID method in worms that underwent the memory-inducing protocol. Next, the authors conduct a gene enrichment analysis that implicates specific molecular pathways in salt-associative learning, such as MAP kinase and cAMP-mediated pathways, as well as specific neuronal classes including pharyngeal neurons, and specific sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. The authors then screen a representative group of hits from the proteome analysis. They find that mutants of candidate genes from the MAP kinase pathway, namely dlk-1 and uev-3, do not affect performance in the learning paradigm. Instead, multiple acetylcholine signaling mutants, as well as a protein-kinase-A mutant, significantly affected performance in the associative memory assay (e.g., acc-1, acc-3, lgc-46, and kin-2). Finally, the authors demonstrate that protein-kinase-A mutants, as well as acetylcholine signaling mutants, do not exhibit a phenotype in a related but distinct conditioning paradigm-aversive salt conditioning-suggesting their effect is specific to appetitive salt conditioning.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, the authors addressed the concerns raised in the previous review round, including the statistics of the chemotaxis experiments and the systems-level analysis of the neuron class expression patterns of their hits. I also appreciate the further attempt to equalize the sample size of the chemotaxis experiments and the transparent reporting of the sample size and statistics in the figure captions and Table S9. The new results from the panneuronal overexpression of the kin-2 gain-of-function allele also contribute to the manuscript. Together, these make the paper more compelling. The additional tested hits provide a comprehensive analysis of the main molecular pathways that could have affected learning. However, the revised manuscript includes more information and analysis, raising additional concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>As reviewer 4 noted, and as also shown to be relevant for C30G12.6 presented in Figure 6, the backcrossing of the mutants is important, as background mutations may lead to the observed effects. Could the authors add to Table 1, sheet 1, the outcrossing status of the tested mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important point. A column has now been added to Table S1 to indicate the outcross status of all strains used in this study. Additionally, we have updated the table legend on page 77 to clarify how to interpret the information provided in this column.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is important to validate that the results of the positive hits (where learning was affected), such as acc-1, acc-3, and lgc-46, do not stem from background mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that confirming the absence of background mutations is important, we have taken alternative steps to address this concern:</p><p>- The outcross status of each strain is now clearly indicated in Table S1.</p><p>- Observed phenotypes were consistent across multiple biological replicates over extended periods (months, sometimes years), reducing the likelihood that results stem from background mutations.</p><p>We believe these measures provide confidence in the validity of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fold change in the number of hits for different neurons in the CENGEN-based rank analysis requires a statistical test (discussed on pages 17-19 and summarized in Table S7). Similar to the other gene enrichment analyses presented in the manuscript, the new rank analysis also requires a statistical test. Since the authors extensively elaborate on the results from this analysis, I think a statistical analysis is especially important for its interpretation. For example, if considering the IL1 neurons, which ranked highest, and assuming random groups of genes-each having the same size as those of the ranked neurons (209 genes in total for IL1 in Table S7)-how common would it be to get the calculated fold change of 1.38 or higher? Such bootstrapping analysis is common for enrichment analysis. Perhaps the authors could consult with an institutional expert (Dr. Pawel Skuza, Flinders University) for the statistical aspects of this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and agree that statistical testing can be valuable for enrichment analyses. However, implementing additional tests such as bootstrapping is beyond the scope of this study. Our aim was to provide a descriptive overview rather than inferential statistics. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we have:</p><p>- Clearly reported fold changes and rankings in Table S7.</p><p>- Discussed the limitations of this approach in the manuscript text (page 18, lines 17–20).</p><p>- Clearly outlined the methods used to perform this analysis (pages 53–54).</p><p>We believe this descriptive analysis provides sufficient context for interpreting these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The learning phenotypes from Figure S8, concerning acc-1, acc-3, and lgc-46 mutants, are summarized in a scheme in Figure 4; however, the chemotaxis results are found in the supplemental Figure S8. Perhaps I missed the reasoning, but for transparency, I think the relevant Figure S8 results should be shown together with their summary scheme in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion to improve clarity. We have now moved the panels corresponding to cholinergic signalling components from Figure S8 into Figure 4 on page 21, so that the summary scheme and underlying data are presented together. The figure legends and main text have been updated accordingly to reflect the correct figure numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study by Rahmani in colleagues, the authors sought to define the &quot;learning proteome&quot; for a gustatory associative learning paradigm in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using a cytoplasmic TurboID expressed under the control of a pan-neuronal promoter, the authors labeled proteins during the training portion of the paradigm, followed by proteomics analysis. This approach revealed hundreds of proteins potentially involved in learning, which the authors describe using gene ontology and pathway analysis. The authors performed functional characterization of over two dozen of these genes for their requirement in learning using the same paradigm. They also compared the requirement for these genes across various learning paradigms and found that most hits they characterized appear to be specifically required for the training paradigm used for generating the &quot;learning proteome&quot;.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have thoughtfully and transparently designed and reported the results of their study. Controls are carefully thought-out, and hits are ranked as strong and weak. By combining their proteomics with behavioral analysis, the authors also highlight the biological significance of their proteomics findings, and support that even weak hits are meaningful.</p><p>The authors display a high degree of statistical rigor, incorporating normality tests into their behavioral data which is beyond the field standard.</p><p>The authors include pathway analysis that generates interesting hypotheses about processes involved learning and memory</p><p>The authors generally provide thoughtful interpretations for all of their results, both positive and negative, as well as any unexpected outcomes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The authors use the Cengen single cell-transcriptomic atlas to predict where the proteins in the &quot;learning proteome&quot; are likely to be expressed and use this data to identify neurons that are likely significant to learning, and building hypothetical circuit. This is an excellent idea; however, the Cengen dataset only contains transcriptomic data from juvenile L4 animals, while the authors performed their proteome experiments in Day 1 Adult animals. It is well documented that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system transcriptome is significant different between these two stages (Kaletsky et al., 2016, St. Ange et al., 2024), so the authors might be missing important expression data, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete networks. The adult neuronal single-cell atlas data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cestaan.princeton.edu/">https://cestaan.princeton.edu/</ext-link>) would be better suited to incorporate into neuronal expression analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this important point. We have now incorporated transcriptomic data from young adult animals to complement the L4-based CeNGEN dataset. Specifically, we integrated data from CeSTAAN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cestaan.princeton.edu/">https://cestaan.princeton.edu/</ext-link>, including St. Ange et al., 2024) and WormSeq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormseq.org/">https://wormseq.org/</ext-link>, including Ghaddar et al., 2023), as outlined below. Importantly, CeSTAAN and WormSeq provide data for 79 and 104 neuron classes, respectively (compared to 128 from CeNGEN); for this reason, the main analysis focuses on CeNGEN due to its broader coverage, with additional datasets noted in brackets for completeness. This is stated on page 18, lines 15–17 to ensure transparency regarding our rationale.</p><p>The main text has been updated to describe these datasets and their integration into our analysis (pages 18–20), and further details on how these resources were used have been added to the Experimental Procedures (pages 53–54).</p><p>We also incorporated data from Kaletsky et al. (2016) and St. Ange et al. (2024) into our neuron identity checks for all assigned and unassigned hits (page 16, lines 8–19). This analysis shows that the nervous system is highly represented in our proteome data: 75–87% of assigned hits and 75–83% of all hits correspond to neuron-enriched genes identified by St. Ange et al. and Kaletsky et al.</p><p>In addition, we used several transcriptomic databases to confirm that learning regulators identified in this study through TurboID and validation experiments are expressed in the same neuron classes as suggested by CenGEN (page 36).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors offer many interpretations for why mutants in &quot;learning proteome&quot; hits have no detectable phenotype, which is commendable. They are however overlooking another important interpretation, it is possible that these changes to the proteome are important for memory, which is dependent upon translation and protein level changes, and is molecularly distinct from learning. It is well established in the field mutating or knocking down memory regulators in other paradigms will often have no detectable effect on learning. Incorporating this interpretation into the discussion and highlighting it as an area for future exploration would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have incorporated this interpretation into the Results section (page 31, lines 17–23), specifying the potential role of these proteomic changes in memory encoding and retention, which are molecularly distinct from learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A minor weakness - In the discussion, the authors state that the Lakhina, et al 2015 used RNA-seq to assess memory transcriptome changes. This study used microarray analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected on page 38, line 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance:</p><p>The approach used in this study is interesting and has the potential to further our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of associative behaviors. There have been multiple transcriptomic studies in the worm looking at gene expression changes in the context of behavioral training. This study compliments and extends those studies, by examining how the proteome changes in a different training paradigm. This approach here could be employed for multiple different training paradigms, presenting a new technical advance for the field. This paper would be of interest to the broader field of behavioral and molecular neuroscience. Though it uses an invertebrate system, many findings in the worm regarding learning and memory translate to higher organisms, making this paper of interest and significant to the broader field of behavioral neuroscience.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, authors used a learning paradigm in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; when worms were fed in a saltless plate, its chemotaxis to salt is greatly reduced. To identify learning-related proteins, authors employed nervous system-specific transcriptome analysis to compare whole proteins in neurons between high-salt-fed animals and saltless-fed animals. Authors identified &quot;learning-specific proteins&quot; which are observed only after saltless feeding. They categorized these proteins by GO analyses, pathway analyses and expression site analyses, and further stepped forward to test mutants in selected genes identified by the proteome analysis. They find several mutants that are defective or hyper-proficient for learning, including acc-1/3 and lgc-46 acetylcholine receptors, F46H5.3 putative arginine kinase, and kin-2, a cAMP pathway gene. These mutants were not previously reported to have abnormality in the learning paradigm.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>Upon revision, authors addressed all concerns of this reviewer, and the results are now presented in a way that facilitates objective evaluation. Authors' conclusions are supported by the results presented, and the strength of the proteomics approach is persuasively demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we appreciate this positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance:</p><p>(1) Total neural proteome analysis has not been conducted before for learning-induced changes, though transcriptome analysis has been performed for odor learning (Lakhina et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029</ext-link>).
