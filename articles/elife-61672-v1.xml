Neurons in different IO subnuclei are inhibited by synapses with wide ranging release kinetics. Inhibition can be exclusively synchronous, asynchronous, or a mixture of both. Whether the same boutons, neurons or sources provide these kinetically distinct types of inhibition was not known. We find that in mice the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and vestibular nuclei (VN) are two major sources of inhibition to the IO that are specialized to provide inhibitory input with distinct kinetics. DCN to IO synapses lack fast synaptotagmin isoforms, release neurotransmitter asynchronously, and are exclusively GABAergic.

Within the IO, the properties of neurotransmitter release at inhibitory synapses are highly variable between different subnuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>). In some IO subnuclei, GABA release is exclusively asynchronous, for others release is exclusively synchronous, and for the rest release has both a synchronous and an asynchronous component. This influences the jitter, the rise time and the decay time of synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>). Across the IO, the synchrony of GABA release is determined by the presence or absence of fast Synaptotagmin isoforms, Syt1 and Syt2 (Syt1/2). Release in the IO is synchronous if Syt1/2 are present, but asynchronous if they are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>), consistent with a role of Syt1/2 in release synchrony at other synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiAntonio and Schwarz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kochubey and Schneggenburger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Syt1/2 is expressed at glycinergic synapses and absent from exclusively GABAergic inputs to the IO.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of time course of the IPSC decay for the GABAergic component for different regions of the IO (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>).

The kinetics of release are determined by the presence of Syt1/2, but it is unclear whether the same presynaptic inputs provide both synchronous and asynchronous release. Neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) are a major source of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fredette and Mugnaini, 1991</xref>), with DCN to IO inputs anatomically segregated such that a single DCN region projects to a single IO subnucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anguat and Cicirata, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dietrichs and Walberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietrichs et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pijpers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruigrok, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1990</xref>). It is possible that neurons in different DCN regions differentially express Syt1/2 to tune the kinetics of inhibition within each IO subnucleus. Some IO subnuclei also receive inhibitory input from vestibular nuclei (VN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barmack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barmack et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Zeeuw et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelson, 1988</xref>), but it is unknown whether VN inputs are synchronous, asynchronous or both. Another aspect of inhibitory transmission in the IO that is poorly understood is the contribution of glycinergic transmission to synchronous and asynchronous inhibition. In other brain regions GABA and glycine are often co-released, and glycinergic transmission often has faster kinetics than GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolides and Trussell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jonas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moore and Trussell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Brien and Berger, 1999</xref>). This raises the possibility that glycinergic transmission could contribute to fast synaptic inhibition in the IO, but the properties of glycinergic transmission are not known because previous studies have focused primarily on GABAergic inhibition in the IO.</p><p>We examined the properties of inhibitory synapses within the IO. Our anatomical and electrophysiological experiments indicate that many inhibitory boutons in the IO have a glycinergic component. Viral expression of ChR2-YFP allowed us to isolate the properties of DCN and VN inputs. We find that inhibitory inputs to the IO from the DCN are exclusively asynchronous and mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. VN inputs provide rapid inhibition with synchronous release that activates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and glycine receptors. IO subnuclei with exclusively asynchronous release only received input from the DCN, regions with exclusively synchronous release received strong input from the VN, and regions with mixed kinetics received prominent input from both. These findings establish that different sources provide inhibitory synapses with distinct kinetics within the IO.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used immunohistochemistry to characterize inhibitory synapses in the IO. We immunolabeled Vgat in animals expressing Synaptophysin-Tdtomato (Syp-TdT) driven by GlyT2-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakizaki et al., 2017</xref>), and co-stained for Syt1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This strategy labels all inhibitory boutons with Vgat, and prominent labeling is present throughout the rostral and caudal IO and in regions surrounding the IO. Glycinergic boutons are present at modest levels in some regions of the rostral IO, and they are present at higher levels in the caudal IO and in the reticular formation (RF) surrounding the IO. Syt1/2 labeling is prominent throughout the IO, but Syt1/2 labeling is not restricted to inhibitory synapses, so much of this labeling is in glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>). We therefore identified Vgat-positive boutons and measured co-localization with Syt1/2 by correlating the signals of Vgat and Syt1/2. Signal correlation for each bouton was measured using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>), with low R<sup>2</sup> values indicating that Syt1/2 is absent from the bouton, and a large R<sup>2</sup> value indicating that Syt1/2 is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data</xref>, see Materials and methods). We also identified Vgat-positive boutons that are either glycinergic (TdT−containing, GlyT2+) or purely GABAergic (TdT−lacking, GlyT2−, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Differences in the properties of GlyT2+ synapses were evident in high power images of different subnuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and in summaries of R<sup>2</sup> for all Vgat boutons in IO subnuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Throughout the IO, Syt1/2 was absent in GlyT2− boutons, whereas Syt1/2 was present at most GlyT2+ synapses. GlyT2+ synapses were also segregated to distinct IO subnuclei. In the rostral IO, a majority of inhibitory synapses lacked Syt1/2 and were GlyT2− in the PIO and rMAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Other subnuclei contained mixed populations of GlyT2+, Syt1/2-expressing synapses (DAO, rIOBe/C, cIOBe/C). In the caudal IO and dorsal cap of Kooy, most synapses were GlyT2+ and expressed Syt1/2 (rDCK, cDCK, IOB/A). The anatomical segregation of GlyT2+ synapses was evident in the distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), and reconstructed maps of GlyT2+ and GlyT2− boutons in the IO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Our results indicate that glycinergic inputs to the IO are generally directed to distinct subnuclei and mostly express Syt1/2, whereas exclusively GABAergic inputs are targeted to complementary nuclei and lack fast Syt isoforms.</p><p>Nothing is known about the function of glycinergic transmission in the IO because previous studies of inhibition in the IO focused on GABAergic transmission and were therefore conducted in the presence of glycine receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>). However, our immunohistochemical studies make several predictions about inhibitory synapses in the IO. They suggest that glycinergic synapses are rapid due to the presence of Syt1/2. In contrast, exclusively GABAergic synapses are expected to be asynchronous based on the lack of Syt1/2. In addition, the spatial dependence of glycinergic boutons provides a guide to subregions where glycinergic synaptic responses are likely to be prominent. We performed electrophysiological studies to test these predictions and to characterize the glycinergic inputs to the IO.</p><p>The DAO is a particularly interesting place to test the hypothesis that glycinergic synapses are synchronous. In the DAO, GABAergic transmission is dominated by asynchronous release, and the slow average synaptic currents reflect variable long-latency occurrence of individual quantal events on individual trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>). We also found that in the DAO, GABA is primarily released asynchronously, and that most inhibitory synapses lack Syt1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>). However, a small subset of inhibitory synapses in the DAO contain both Syt1/2 and glycinergic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore re-examined the properties of evoked inhibitory transmission in the DAO with glycinergic and GABAergic transmission intact, and with excitatory input blocked by NBQX and (R,S)-CPP. These experiments, and most others in this study, were performed in conditions suited to measuring the kinetics of release (single stimuli, 2.5 mM external calcium). Experiments were performed at room temperature to avoid the subthreshold oscillations that are prominent at physiological temperatures and that make studies of synaptic transmission difficult. Inhibitory synaptic responses had two components of release with very different properties: a rapid synchronous component consistent across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left), was followed by a prolonged asynchronous component that varied across trials as described for asynchronous release of GABA in the DAO. Gabazine eliminated asynchronous release and left a rapid synchronous component intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right). We plotted the evoked currents sensitive to gabazine and strychnine that reflect the properties of GABA and glycine release respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared to GABA, the release of glycine had much faster rise and decay kinetics and had similar properties to synchronous release seen in synapses outside the IO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We observed considerable variability in the amplitude of the glycinergic component of release for different cells in the DAO, but GABA release typically contributed much more overall inhibitory charge transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Thus, in agreement with the predictions from immunohistochemistry, the DAO receives two distinct forms of inhibition. The synchronous component has a prominent glycinergic component, whereas the asynchronous component is exclusively GABAergic.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evoked and spontaneous glycinergic input to the IO.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrically evoked IPSCs in the DAO with average (top, black) and individual trials (gray), before (left) and after washing of Gbz.

We recorded mIPSCs in the presence of either gabazine to isolate glycinergic events, or strychnine to isolate GABAergic events. We found that the frequency of glycinergic mIPSCs is regionally segregated. In the PIO where mIPSCs mediated by GABA are abundant, we did not observe spontaneous glycine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the caudal A and B subnuclei of the IO (IOB/A), we observed prominent glycinergic mIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Glycinergic mIPSCs across all subnuclei of the IO had more rapid kinetics and larger amplitudes than GABAergic mIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The fast decay time of individual glycinergic quantal events contributes to the rapid kinetics of evoked glycine release we observed in the DAO. mIPSCs measured in the absence of antagonists of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors revealed large amplitude events with a slow decay that appeared to consist of both glycinergic and GABAergic components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Washing on gabazine eliminated small and slow mIPSCs, whereas large amplitude mIPSCs remained. The decay of the remaining large mIPSCs was faster in the presence of gabazine, suggesting that some glycinergic synapses in the IO also corelease GABA.</p><p>The frequency of glycinergic mIPSCs in the IO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) conformed to the observed prevalence of anatomically defined glycinergic synapses within subnuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Glycinergic mIPSCs were not observed in the PIO, and rMAO, where glycinergic boutons are not observed. At the opposite extreme, the frequency of glycinergic mIPSCs was reliably high throughout the IOB/A and other parts of the caudal IO, regions with a high density of glycinergic boutons. For regions such as the DAO and rIOBe where a subset of inhibitory synapses is glycinergic, glycinergic mIPSCs were apparent in a fraction of cells. The average frequency of glycinergic mIPSCs in these areas also was lower than for the IOB/A. Thus, both anatomical and electrophysiological approaches indicate that the contribution of glycinergic transmission to inhibition is highly subnucleus dependent.</p><p>Multiple regions provide inhibitory input to the IO, including the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and the vestibular nuclei (VN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It is not clear whether a single source of inhibition can mediate both synchronous and asynchronous release, or whether different sources provide inhibition with distinct release kinetics. The beta subnucleus (rIOBe) is an ideal region to distinguish between these possibilities, because electrical stimulation evokes inhibition within the rIOBe with prominent synchronous and asynchronous components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We assessed the properties of synapses provided by different sources by locally injecting AAV to restrict the expression of ChR2-YFP to either the DCN or the VN, and then measuring light-evoked responses in the rIOBe subnucleus.

DCN synapses are exclusively GABAergic, and lack Syt1/2, resulting in completely asynchronous release. VN synapses are mediated by both GABA and glycine, and express Syt1/2, leading to synchronized release.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Determination of release kinetics in the IO</title><p>Our results provide insight into the determinants of the kinetics of transmitter release at inhibitory synapses in the IO. Prior to this study, a leading possible explanation for differences in the kinetics of inhibitory transmission across IO subnuclei was that subregions of the DCN differentially express Syt1/2. The observation that DCN inputs to the IO are all asynchronous, regardless of their targets in the IO, indicates that this is not the case. Another major issue was whether regions of the IO where electrically evoked inhibition had both synchronous and asynchronous components reflected the ability of individual boutons and individual axons to mediate both synchronous and asynchronous release. The properties of release from isolated DCN or VN inputs indicates that, in general, a given brain region provides primarily either synchronous or asynchronous release. Consequently, we can conclude that for inhibitory transmission in the IO, individual boutons and individual axons with multiple boutons generally do not mediate both synchronous and asynchronous release. The mixture of asynchronous and synchronous release evoked by electrical stimulation in some regions is a consequence of activating axons that originate from two different sources. In subnuclei such as the rIOBe, where asynchronous and synchronous inhibition are both prominent, electrical stimulation evokes inhibition consisting of two components: one from synchronous VN synapses, and the other from asynchronous DCN synapses.</p><p>Optogenetics studies and immunohistochemical analysis indicate that release kinetics are segregated by presynaptic origin. Asynchronous release at VN to IO synapses and synchronous release at DCN to IO synapses are exceedingly small, but it is difficult to completely exclude contributions from these components. A fraction of glycinergic boutons in the rDCK (20%) and the cIOBe/C (46%) appear to lack Syt1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which raises the possibility that some glycinergic synapses are asynchronous in these regions. Similarly, Syt1/2 appears to be present at a small fraction of exclusively GABAergic synapses in the cIOBe/C and the rIOBe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that there is a synchronous component of release at a small fraction of exclusively GABAergic synapses in these regions. Interpreting these findings is complicated because regions other than the DCN and the VN provide some inhibitory inputs to the IO, and our anatomical experiments did not identify the presynaptic origin of inhibitory boutons. The contributions of glycine, GABA and Syt1/2 to the kinetics of release of inhibitory synapses from regions other than the DCN and VN are not known. It is therefore difficult to completely exclude the possibility that prominent synchronous release masks a tiny component of asynchronous release at VN to IO synapses, and similarly that prominent asynchronous release could mask a tiny component of synchronous release at DCN to IO synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Spatial extent of DCN and VN inputs to the IO</title><p>The optogenetic characterization of DCN and VN synapses combined with the immunohistochemical characterization of inhibitory synapses in the IO, allow us to estimate the regional distribution of DCN and VN inputs to the IO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anguat and Cicirata, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dietrichs and Walberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietrichs et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pijpers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruigrok, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1990</xref>).

Some GAD-immunoreactive boutons that synapse onto IO dendrites are in close proximity to gap junctions, suggesting that they are well suited to this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Zeeuw et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sotelo et al., 1986</xref>). In the rMAO it was shown that many of the inhibitory boutons associated with gap junctions originated in the DCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>), and our findings suggest that in mice the rMAO is inhibited exclusively by the DCN. Asynchronous release of GABA may be ideal to provide slow tonic inhibition that could shunt current away from gap junctions and effectively uncouple or desynchronize neurons in the IO. It has also been shown that some vestibular inhibitory inputs from the PPH to the DCK are present within glomeruli containing gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Zeeuw et al., 1993</xref>), and may therefore also regulate electrical coupling between DCK neurons. It is unclear what fraction of synapses from each source target gap junctions, and how they ultimately influence the firing and coupling of IO neurons in different subnuclei. Since IO subnuclei are part of distinct cerebellar and vestibular circuits the kinetics of neurotransmitter release and inhibition may be suited to the needs of their unique functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6, <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">GlyT2<sup>Cre</sup> <break/>(C57BL/6-Slc6a5 &lt; tm1.1(cre)Ksak&gt;), <break/>C57BL/6,</td><td valign="top">Obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Research center; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakizaki et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top">BRC No: RBRC10109</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">Ai34 (B6;129S-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm34.1(CAG-Syp/tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock: <break/>012570</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV9-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP</td><td valign="top">UNC Viral Vector Core/Addgene</td><td valign="top">26973-AAV9</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Matlab</td><td valign="top">Mathworks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/">https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version R2019a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">IgorPro</td><td valign="top">Wavemetrics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wavemetrics.com/order/order_igordownloads6.htm">https://www.wavemetrics.com/order/order_igordownloads6.htm</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 6.22</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ImageJ/Fiji software</td><td valign="top">Fiji <break/>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/">http://fiji.sc/</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 1.52N</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ZEN software</td><td valign="top">Zeiss (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/products/microscope-software/zen.html">https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/products/microscope-software/zen.html</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013672">SCR_013672</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 2.3 SP1 FP3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Tetrodotoxin citrate</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Ab120055</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">NBQX disodium salt</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Ab120046</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">(R)-CPP</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Ab120159</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Strychnine hydrochloride</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Ab120416</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SR95531 (Gabazine)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Ab120042</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">TTA-P2</td><td valign="top">Alamone Labs</td><td valign="top">T-155</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult (≥P40) animals of both sexes were used for experiments.

Vgat-positive boutons in the DAO were identified as described above. The presence of YFP was assessed using the signal correlation between Vgat and YFP identically as for Vgat and Syt1/2. A set threshold was used to isolate YFP+ boutons (R<sup>2</sup><sub>Vgat-YFP</sub><underline>&gt;</underline> 0.4). These boutons were then isolated analyzed for their co-localization with Syt1/2 as described above. To determine whether Syt1/2-containing Vgat boutons expressed YFP, we selected Vgat boutons that co-localized with Syt1/2 (R<sup>2</sup><sub>Vgat-Syt1/2</sub> <underline>&gt;</underline> 0.4) and then analyzed those boutons for their co-localization with YFP using the same correlation approach described above (R<sup>2</sup><sub>Vgat-YFP</sub>).</p><p>Subnuclei of the IO were outlined and defined by visual inspection of mosaic images. A 170 × 170×3 µm volume just dorsal to the DAO was sampled as the reticular formation. Some nuclei were grouped because they could not be reliably distinguished, and could not be compared across experiments, especially in acute brainstem slices. The ventrolateral outgrowth could not be reliably distinguished from the rostral beta subnucleus. For others, borders could not be clearly defined in acute slices such as for caudal beta subnucleus, subnucleus C and more recently defined subnucleus D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>), or for the caudal subnuclei A and B, and were therefore grouped for analysis. The dorsal fold of the DAO was not examined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>Source data files for all figures are provided, and custom-written Igor and Matlab analysis scripts will be made available at github, upon acceptance of the manuscript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/josefturecek/Elife_IO_inhibitory_inputs">https://github.com/josefturecek/Elife_IO_inhibitory_inputs</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Regehr lab for comments on the manuscript.

olive, a brain region that sends climbing fiber projections to cerebellar Purkinje cells. This paper demonstrates that two distinct inputs to the inferior olive, the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei, provide inhibitory inputs with distinct kinetics, a finding that could have important implications for signaling within the cerebello-olivary network. In addition, this work provides further evidence that synaptotagmin isoforms determine the mode of synaptic vesicle release.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cerebellar and vestibular nuclei synapses within the inferior olive have distinct release kinetics and neurotransmitters&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jaideep Singh Bains (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work is an extension of the 2019 Turecek and Regehr paper in Neuron that explored synchronous and asynchronous inhibitory transmission in the inferior olive. Here the focus was on contrasting distinct sources of GABA vs. glycine and whether the kinetics of transmission at those synapses differ. A major conclusion is that input from the cerebellar nuclei is GABAergic and releases vesicles asynchronously, while input from vestibular nuclei releases synchronously and uses dual GABA/glycine transmission. The mapping of these inputs through the different IO subnuclei is determined, and the overlap with synaptotagmin isoforms 1/2 is also mapped out. These findings will be important on at least two fronts, 1) this work provides further evidence that synaptotagmin 1/2 expression determines the mode of vesicle release, and 2) the remarkable differences in synaptic kinetics will be important for understanding signaling and control in the cerebello-olivary network.</p><p>There was consensus among the reviewers that the work was well done and potentially interesting. However, the experimental conditions used for the recordings were atypical and there was concern about how the non-physiological temperature and high calcium would influence the results and interpretation of the data. It was recognized that these choices were likely related to the difficulties of recording from the inferior olive, and to minimize oscillations. There was also substantial discussion during the consultation period about whether recording at room temperature would over- or underestimate the differences in release mode between the two synapses. However, given these concerns, there was consensus that these issues need to be addressed and statements of physiological relevance in vivo should be tempered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a clearer rationale for the experimental conditions and provide additional information in the discussion about the limitations and caveats in the study. Specifically, the limitations of recording at room temperature and possible effects on synchronous vs. asynchronous release should be discussed. In addition, if the authors happen to have data in lower Ca or higher temp, then that could be added. Points a) and b) below are the original comments of reviewer 2, which should be addressed.</p><p>a) A major concern is that the conclusions regarding release and IPSC kinetics are so dependent on the unusual experimental conditions as to make the work very difficult to generalize to the in vivo setting and to the functional significance of these synaptic differences. Three conditions in particular are of concern: 1) All recordings were at room temperature, 2) the bath contained 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (twice normal levels), 3) voltage clamp did not employ series resistance compensation.</p><p>Recordings at room temperature will of course slow down the IPSCs, as will lack of Rs compensation. The physiological decay kinetics and how they differ remains unknown. Of even greater concern is the well-described effect of low temperature on facilitating asynchronous release. As shown by Huson et al., 2019 (and others), elevating recording temperature to the physiological level profoundly attenuates asynchronous release. The authors must know this work, given the recent Huson and Regehr review in Curr. Opin Neurobiol. Presumably this effect of temperature relates to Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the terminal (or perhaps also tagmin kinetics). Elevating bath Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 2.5 mM could only exacerbate the degree of asynchronous release, as it would prolong clearance from the terminals.</p><p>Accordingly, while the distinctions between GABA and glycine release outlined here are very clear, the conclusions about differences in kinetics among the different inputs are artificially magnified. (Editor note: Here were some differences of opinion among the reviewers, with reviewer 3 stating, &quot;Regarding the Huson paper, my reading is that asynchronous release is increased with raising temperature at synapses lacking syt1, but decreased at synapses expressing syt1. This makes me think that DCN inputs to IO (presumably lacking syt1) would show greater asynchronous release at physiological temperature, and vestibular inputs (presumably containing syt1) would show less asynchronous release. If this is the case, recording at room temperature may underestimate the differences in release mode between these two synapses.&quot; The authors should address these issues directly.)</p><p>b) It is remarkable that such dramatic asynchronous release could be obtained with single stimuli rather than trains of shocks. It seems likely the experimental conditions enabled this to happen, but that under more normal ionic and temperature conditions and with trains, release might be relatively synchronous at first then decay into an later asynchronous mode.</p><p>Additional concerns:</p><p>1) More explanation for interpretation of R<sup>2</sup> values for colocalization. For example how is an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.5 to be interpreted? The illustrated boutons in 1C show discontinuous labeling across the structure yet the R<sup>2</sup> versions below show continuous value. Does 0.5 mean only half the bouton showed colocalization? Also, how does variation in antibody penetrance factor in to this variation? In addition, the authors did not clarify whether the results in Figure 1E were obtained from one animal or multiple animals. How many animals were used in this experiment?</p><p>2) Authors interpret the slow IPSCs purely as a presynaptic phenomenon, i.e., asynchronous release, without considering the potential contribution of pooling and spillover, which has been shown for GABA and glycine synapses in the past.</p><p>3) In Figure 6B, rDCK was labeled in red which means it receives synchronous inputs. However, no electrophysiological data support this idea (see Figure 4D). The authors need to add more data or remove the red color from rDCK.</p><p>4) The conclusion in the first paragraph of the Discussion: &quot;DCN synapses are exclusively GABAergic, and lack Syt1/2, resulting in completely asynchronous release. VN synapses are mediated by both GABA and glycine, and express Syt1/2, leading to synchronized release.&quot; However, the authors showed no direct evidence between the expression of Syt1/2 and the source of inputs; all evidences are circumstantial. To make this conclusion more valid, it is necessary to check if the expression of EYFP (as a result of viral injection to DCN or VN) co-localizes with Syt1/2.</p><p>5) In the Materials and methods, both AAV2 and AAV9 were used, which is not consistent with the information listed in the Key Resources Table. In addition, the source of the virus is inconsistent between the table and the text.</p><p>6) Please rewrite the following sentence in the Materials and methods: &quot;Jitter was calculated by measuring the time of peak current amplitude for each individual trial was measured and calculating the standard deviation of peak times.&quot;</p><p>7) Much of this work depends on the accuracy of viral expression of ChR2 in the vestibular or deep cerebellar nuclei. More quantification of YFP expression in the target regions and surrounding areas would be helpful. In Figure 3C it appears there is also high YFP expression in the cerebellar cortex, was this generally true?</p><p>8) In previous work the same group has shown that synaptic responses from optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic fibers can differ from responses evoked by electrical stimulation, depending on cell-type. This raises the possibility that optogenetic stimulation affects responses from DCN terminals differently than responses from vestibular terminals, possibly accounting for the observed differences in synaptic properties, at least in part. This potential issue should be discussed briefly.</p><p>9) I find this study well executed. I have no concerns about the dataset, analysis or interpretation. It is intriguing that 2 different inputs use different strategies to manipulate the temporal window of inhibition. Conceptually, I find this idea fascinating and perhaps the authors could consider a short Discussion point on this.</p><p>10) Do the authors have any information on whether individual vesicles released at VN terminal onto IO cells contain both GABA and glycine? One possibility would be to assess the decay of mIPSCs. In some cases, there would be a fast monoexponential decay (glycine), in others, a slower monoexponential (GABA) and in a third population, perhaps a double exponential decay (glycine and GABA). This is more a curiosity on my part and not a requirement for the study.</p><p>11) The Huson paper uses trains of stimuli and, here, I think things are very different. The authors could discuss this issue (single stim vs. multiple stim) and consequences for synapses that release synchronously vs. asynchronously.</p><p>12) The title reads awkwardly with 'nuclei' modifying synapses, almost as if the nuclei themselves are within the inferior olive. Suggest using the more grammatically correct 'nuclear' instead, or rearranging the components of the title to clarify that the synapses are from those nuclei.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61672.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] There was consensus among the reviewers that the work was well done and potentially interesting.

We agree with the reviewers that in general it is important to study synapses under physiological conditions. In our original studies of inhibitory synapses in the IO (which were done in rat) we performed experiments at near physiological temperatures (Best and Regehr, 2009). Those studies were very challenging because of the strong electrical coupling between IO neurons, which allows IO neurons to generate subthreshold oscillations and bursts that can interfere with studies of synaptic responses.</p><p>In our recent study (Turecek and Regehr, 2019) we moved to mice to determine the mechanisms that control the kinetics of transmitter release, and we felt that the best way to characterize the kinetics of neurotransmitter release was to study synaptic currents evoked by single stimuli. Trains of electrical stimuli can generate bursting and oscillations from electrically-coupled olivary neurons that would contaminate recordings, so we maximized asynchronous release from single stimuli by performing experiments in 2.5 mM Ca. We also preferred single stimuli for optogenetic experiments, where it is sometimes difficult to reliably activate presynaptic fibers with high-frequency trains. Subthreshold oscillations and bursting from electrically-coupled olivary neurons are more prominent at physiological temperatures. Even if oscillations are absent at room temperature, oscillations will often emerge when slices are warmed to physiological temperatures.</p><p>We now more extensively describe the rationale for our experimental approach. We also discuss the issue of oscillations and provide a supplementary figure highlighting this problem (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We performed additional experiments in physiological calcium at elevated temperatures to address these concerns (Figure 6). As a result of oscillations most synaptic experiments performed in physiological conditions had to be discarded. Electrical stimulation was employed because we were concerned about using optogenetic approaches to stimulate with trains, as we discussed here and illustrated in previous work (Jackman et al., 2014). The additional experiments were performed using electrical stimulation in regions where either fast or slow inhibitory inputs predominate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a clearer rationale for the experimental conditions and provide additional information in the discussion about the limitations and caveats in the study.

With regard to the specific paper by Huson et al., they found that in cultured cells asynchronous release evoked by trains of activity became much more prominent at low temperature. They did not see such an effect for single stimuli. We have added new figures to explain our rationale for performing most experiments at room temperature with single stimuli (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), and we have performed additional experiments in physiological calcium at near physiological temperatures (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It is remarkable that such dramatic asynchronous release could be obtained with single stimuli rather than trains of shocks. It seems likely the experimental conditions enabled this to happen, but that under more normal ionic and temperature conditions and with trains, release might be relatively synchronous at first then decay into an later asynchronous mode.</p></disp-quote><p>We find that release can be entirely asynchronous. This appeared to be the case in previous work performed at near-physiological temperature in rats (Best and Regehr, 2009), and also appears to be true in our new experiments performed in physiological calcium at elevated temperatures in mice (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional concerns:</p><p>1) More explanation for interpretation of R<sup>2</sup> values for colocalization. For example how is an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.5 to be interpreted? The illustrated boutons in 1C show discontinuous labeling across the structure yet the R<sup>2</sup> versions below show continuous value. Does 0.5 mean only half the bouton showed colocalization? Also, how does variation in antibody penetrance factor in to this variation? In addition, the authors did not clarify whether the results in Figure 1E were obtained from one animal or multiple animals. How many animals were used in this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>The top 4 panels of Figure 1C show raw images of immunostaining, whereas the analyzed images below are identified boutons that are color coded for the correlation coefficient between Vgat and Syt signal for the voxels of the bouton. R<sup>2</sup> is a measure of how correlated Vgat and Syt are for a given bouton. The analysis is performed for each bouton. A small volume around each bouton is taken, and the intensity of Syt fluorescence is plotted vs. Vgat intensity for all voxels. A linear fit is made to the resulting plot, and the correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> is used as a measure of co-localization. We illustrated the co-localization analysis in our previous paper (Turecek and Regehr, 2019, Supplementary Figure 3), where we provided a detailed description of the method. We provide a basic description of the methods in the paper and provide a reference to the detailed methods in our previous paper.</p><p>We do not think that tissue penetration is an issue. We collected anatomical data from the top 5 µm of tissue where antibodies abundantly penetrate the tissue. We now point out that two animals were used for fluorescence image analysis, one animal for Figure 1 and a second for Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The distribution of Vgat-Syt1/2 co-localization in the IO matched that of two other animals from our previous study (Turecek and Regehr, 2019). We analyzed many thousands of boutons per animal, the distributions have been consistent across animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors interpret the slow IPSCs purely as a presynaptic phenomenon, i.e., asynchronous release, without considering the potential contribution of pooling and spillover, which has been shown for GABA and glycine synapses in the past.</p></disp-quote><p>Individual trials show that release is mediated by asynchronous quantal events (Figure 3D, Figure 4A, Figure 5A and Figure 6B). This is shown in Figure 3 of Best and Regehr, 2009, in which the timing is shown for individual quantal events. The kinetics of asynchronous release in mice are consistent with previous experiments in which individual events were detected and analyzed. We have revised the text regarding this issue in the third paragraph of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 6B, rDCK was labeled in red which means it receives synchronous inputs. However, no electrophysiological data support this idea (see Figure 4D). The authors need to add more data or remove the red color from rDCK.</p></disp-quote><p>The properties of release in the rDCK have been measured previously and were shown to be exclusively synchronous and receive input from the prepositus nucleus and not the DCN. We have clarified in the manuscript that this aspect of the summary is based on previous work and not data shown in this paper, and we have provided the appropriate citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion in the first paragraph of the Discussion: &quot;DCN synapses are exclusively GABAergic, and lack Syt1/2, resulting in completely asynchronous release. VN synapses are mediated by both GABA and glycine, and express Syt1/2, leading to synchronized release.&quot; However, the authors showed no direct evidence between the expression of Syt1/2 and the source of inputs; all evidences are circumstantial. To make this conclusion more valid, it is necessary to check if the expression of EYFP (as a result of viral injection to DCN or VN) co-localizes with Syt1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) that shows that axons from the DCN that express YFP co-localize with Vgat, but not Syt1/2, even in a region where Syt1/2 is present in a subset of synapses. Those Syt1/2-containing inhibitory synapses lack YFP. This provides direct evidence that DCN inputs lack Syt1/2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Materials and methods, both AAV2 and AAV9 were used, which is not consistent with the information listed in the Key Resources Table. In addition, the source of the virus is inconsistent between the table and the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this mistake. During the course of this study, the UPenn vector core transitioned viral services to Addgene and so batches of the same virus was purchased from both vendors. We did not observe any major differences in expression level or infection efficiency between vendors. We have clarified this in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please rewrite the following sentence in the Materials and methods: &quot;Jitter was calculated by measuring the time of peak current amplitude for each individual trial was measured and calculating the standard deviation of peak times.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the sentence and thank the reviewer for a careful reading of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Much of this work depends on the accuracy of viral expression of ChR2 in the vestibular or deep cerebellar nuclei. More quantification of YFP expression in the target regions and surrounding areas would be helpful. In Figure 3C it appears there is also high YFP expression in the cerebellar cortex, was this generally true?</p></disp-quote><p>We found it difficult to quantify expression of ChR2 because YFP is membrane-bound and it is often unclear whether YFP is being expressed locally or by projecting axons. For this reason we only focused on ensuring that YFP was either excluded from the DCN when the VN were targeted, or excluded from the VN and brainstem when the DCN was injected. For DCN injections, we did observe that parts of the cerebellar cortex were labeled, usually along the track of the injection pipette or superficial to the DCN itself. For VN injections, parts of the dorsal brainstem closely surrounding the VN were also sometimes labeled with YFP. We have added these details to the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In previous work the same group has shown that synaptic responses from optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic fibers can differ from responses evoked by electrical stimulation, depending on cell-type. This raises the possibility that optogenetic stimulation affects responses from DCN terminals differently than responses from vestibular terminals, possibly accounting for the observed differences in synaptic properties, at least in part. This potential issue should be discussed briefly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section clarifying this point. Our previous study (Jackman et al., 2014) was concerned with short term plasticity and the responses to repetitive activation. We have never seen anything to suggest that optogenetic manipulation can transform responses evoked by single stimuli from synchronous to asynchronous. In support of this, we have found that in areas where electrical stimulation evokes purely synchronous or purely asynchronous release, optical stimulation also generates purely synchronous or asynchronous release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) I find this study well executed. I have no concerns about the dataset, analysis or interpretation. It is intriguing that 2 different inputs use different strategies to manipulate the temporal window of inhibition. Conceptually, I find this idea fascinating and perhaps the authors could consider a short Discussion point on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting topic, and this is certainly an issue that we will pursue in future studies. We have provided a few sentences on this point in the Discussion, but we would like to avoid speculation before understanding more about different IO subnuclei and how they interact with the DCN and VN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Do the authors have any information on whether individual vesicles released at VN terminal onto IO cells contain both GABA and glycine? One possibility would be to assess the decay of mIPSCs. In some cases, there would be a fast monoexponential decay (glycine), in others, a slower monoexponential (GABA) and in a third population, perhaps a double exponential decay (glycine and GABA). This is more a curiosity on my part and not a requirement for the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis of mIPSCs suggests that for some cells a large fraction of vesicles that release glycine also release GABA (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The Huson paper uses trains of stimuli and, here, I think things are very different. The authors could discuss this issue (single stim vs. multiple stim) and consequences for synapses that release synchronously vs. asynchronously.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences between single and multiple stimuli are illustrated in our new figure (Figure 7) where the two are presented side-by-side for synchronous and asynchronous synapses under near-physiological conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The title reads awkwardly with 'nuclei' modifying synapses, almost as if the nuclei themselves are within the inferior olive. Suggest using the more grammatically correct 'nuclear' instead, or rearranging the components of the title to clarify that the synapses are from those nuclei.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title as the reviewer suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
