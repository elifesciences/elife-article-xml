We examined peripheral blood of male F344 rats ranging from 3 to 27 months of age and found significant age-associated changes with distinct leukocyte population shifts. We report CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> population frequency is a strong predictor of healthy aging, generate a model using blood parameters, and find rats with blood profiles that diverge from chronologic age indicate debility; thus, assessments of blood composition may be useful for non-lethal disease profiling or as a surrogate measure for efficacy of aging interventions. Importantly, blood parameters and DNA methylation alterations, defined distinct juncture points during aging, supporting a non-linear aging process. Our results suggest these inflection points are important considerations for aging interventions. Overall, we present rat blood aging metrics that can serve as a resource to evaluate health and the effects of interventions in a model system physiologically more reflective of humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our blood contains many types of white blood cells, which play important roles in defending the body against infections and other threats to our health. The number of these cells changes with age, and this in turn contributes to many other alterations that happen in the body as we get older. For example, the immune system generally gets weaker at fighting infections and preventing other cells from developing into cancer. On top of that, the white blood cells themselves can become cancerous, resulting in several types of blood cancer that are more likely to happen in older people.</p><p>Many previous studies have examined how the number of white blood cells changes with age in humans and mice.

The experiments found that it is possible to accurately predict the age of healthy rats by measuring the frequency of populations of white blood cells, especially a certain type known as CD25+ CD4+ cells. If the animals had any form of illness, their predicted age deviated from their actual age. Furthermore, while some changes in the blood were gradual and continuous, others displayed distinct shifts when the rats reached specific ages.</p><p>In the future, these findings may be used as a tool to help researchers diagnose illnesses in rats before the animals develop symptoms, or to more easily establish if a treatment is having a positive effect on the rats’ health.

This has made blood the prevailing tissue for a wide variety of applications requiring a sizable amount of material, such as: clinical diagnosis, immune surveillance, and molecular investigations, including DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fahy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levine et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To date, peripheral blood aging has been largely characterized in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Márquez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahlknecht and Kaiser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wayne et al., 1990</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinchuk and Filipov, 2008</xref>). Studies in mouse models have provided important insights as this model system allows investigation of the impact of a variety of genetic interventions and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant assays. Many murine aging phenotypes accurately reflect reports from human studies including a decline in immunogenic response of lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinchuk and Filipov, 2008</xref>), decreased CD4/CD8 T cell ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nikolich-Zugich, 2008</xref>), and an increase in myeloid cells at the expense of lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). These phenotypes have been shown to be influenced, at least in part, by intrinsic HSC aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beerman et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, the mouse has drawbacks as a model of human hematopoiesis including the fact that the common laboratory strains do not reliably develop spontaneous blood cancers, which is a common aging phenotype in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zjablovskaja and Florian, 2019</xref>). The differences between the two species are further exemplified by the fact that mouse blood is dominated by lymphocytes whereas human blood is rich in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>); which in the murine model may dampen the impact of the age-associated decrease in lymphoid potential.</p><p>An attractive alternative system is the rat model. Rat physiology is more analogous to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibbs et al., 2004</xref>), yet these rodents still have relatively short lifespans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turturro et al., 1999</xref>) in which to study aging phenotypes. Furthermore, the rat and human genomes share genes involved in immunity and hematopoiesis absent in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibbs et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, rats display age-related incidence of leukemia, especially the Fischer 344 CDF (F344) strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ward and Reynolds, 1983</xref>). All the above suggest the rat may be better suited to study the aging of the blood and immune systems. Despite these advantages, use of the rat model is less common for hematopoietic studies as mice are smaller, generally cost less to maintain, and transgenic tools to manipulate the murine genomes have been extensively developed. As a result, the impact of aging on the blood compartment in rats is not well characterized.</p><p>We sought to describe changes in the composition of the peripheral blood during aging in the F344 male rat using flow cytometry. Additionally, we found that CD25<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency is a novel marker for predicting aging, and rats have defined age-associated inflection points linked to altered methylation profiles and cell composition. These results indicate that age-associated blood phenotypes in rats provide relevant insight into human blood aging and point to a critical time period of hematopoiesis which may best be targeted for anti-aging interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aging patterns in rat peripheral blood leukocyte populations</title><p>We analyzed the peripheral blood composition of 146 male F344 rats ranging in age from 3 to 27 months, using a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies to evaluate major leukocyte populations. As cell-specific gating strategies for rat blood populations are less defined than in humans or mice, we initially evaluated the flow cytometry results in an unbiased manner using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and self-organizing maps analyses. Cells generally clustered in a manner that allowed for identification of defined populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and clustering analysis helped inform decisions for gating strategies we devised for cell-type classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Age-related changes were also profiled from single-cell analyses and revealed an accumulation of cells in clusters corresponding to myeloid lineage cells and a reduction of cells in clusters expressing markers associated with B and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Globally CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells decreased with age, but we identified two distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> populations with different trajectories during aging. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell cluster expressing high levels of CD25 did not show an age-associated decline in cell number and instead increased in frequency over time. t-SNE-defined clusters 5 and 9 (brown and cyan, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) also show age-associated increases in frequency (same top left location as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, but blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>); however, these clusters could not be fully identified from this combination of antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cluster 5, due to a high expression of CD11b/c, is most likely a type of myeloid cell, whereas cluster 9 most likely consists of debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) as it stained equally positive for all antibodies. Most identified cell populations that were categorized encompassed two or more clusters, indicating potential subpopulations we were unable to define with the panel of antibodies in this study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unsupervised clustering of all F344 rat peripheral blood cells.</title><p>Clustering of rat peripheral blood using a self-organizing map algorithm.

This increase in CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is similar to what is seen in human peripheral blood aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gregg et al., 2005</xref>), while in the murine model CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells only accumulate in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen and lymph nodes) but not in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2007</xref>). This analysis also defines a specific ‘middle age’ profile that is distinct from both young and old phenotypes, but clusters more closely to the young rat profile than the old.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Peripheral blood parameters predict age and pathology in rats</title><p>To assess the blood cell types most predictive of aging, we fit all leukocyte frequencies in a standard least square model to predict aging in animals with no detected pathology and then eliminated the least significant parameters in a backstep fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The health status of all rats was recorded throughout the study, and necropsy was performed on all animals, less than a month post blood collection (for full health/pathology report see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). This enabled testing of how the health status of each rat fit into the model. One caveat was that moribund animals were excluded and euthanized per vet recommendation, so the health analysis captures mostly underlying illnesses only discernable during necropsy. The resulting blood parameter model predicted age with an approximate 2-month margin of error (as indicated by the root mean square error value). The single most predictive parameter of rat age was the proportion of CD25 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, right panel). Animals with histological indication of disease, including indications of large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) in spleen or liver, described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finesso et al., 2021</xref>, are generally predicted by our model as more variable than their actual age (i.e. have stronger residual age values) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). When constructing an age prediction model only for ill animals, we found the myeloid/lymphoid ratio was the strongest contributor to age prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Additionally, we constructed a nominal logistic regression model to predict illness and found that myeloid/lymphoid ratio is the strongest contributor, even more so than age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the myeloid/lymphoid ratio increases with aging, this phenomenon is more pronounced in sick animals. However, this ratio alone is not sufficient to predict illness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, left) and must be combined with the other blood parameters that are characteristic of age and how variable the predicted age is from the chronologic age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>). We also observed that myeloid/lymphoid ratio increases concurrently with severity of LGLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finesso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, right).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Age and illness prediction by blood leukocyte composition.</title><p>All blood cell population frequencies were used to create a standard least square model of age prediction.

Despite these differences, applying the age-prediction model, generated from fixed blood samples, on the blood profiles generated on unfixed samples of varying ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) demonstrated that the existing model (from fixed blood) could be used in a similar fashion to predict age with only minor mathematical adjustments.</p><p>As this study was primarily focused on male rats, we wanted to evaluate if the model could be used in a sex-independent manner.

We analyzed the epigenic landscapes for hematopoietic-specific changes in methylation associated with aging using the Bismark pipeline. Global, age-dependent hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) occurred, located mostly in intergenic and intronic regions. Promoter regions had a more balanced ratio of sites that either gained or lost methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Interestingly, overall decreases in methylation were more pronounced in the transition between middle and old age compared to the global methylation changes seen in the shift from young to middle age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). To gain insight into the difference between the early-aging and late-aging changes, we performed differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis on locations near transcription start sites (TSS). Most regions with significant DNA methylation changes were progressively altered during aging, which is slightly incongruous with the phase shifts seen in blood composition. However, we also found non-linear changes in methylation using a differential methylation analysis of three major age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We identified 140 DMRs unique to the young vs. middle age comparison and 94 DMRs unique to the middle-aged vs old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). 456 DMRs appeared as significantly differential only between the young and old animals, which we attribute to a slow progressive change that only passed the cutoff of significance and fold change in the young vs old comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Enrichment analysis of DMRs showed age-associated hypermethylation for several processes and included some overlaps between the early (Y-M) and late (M-O) aging phenotypes, such as regulation of T cells and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). However, some enrichments were unique to the middle age transition (regulation of apoptosis) and the late age (notch signaling pathway), again indicating a difference between the early and late aging phenotypes. Of note, while hypomethylated DMRs between young and middle age were identified for several processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, right panel), hypomethylated DMRs in the transition from middle-aged to old were not enriched for any specific process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>); perhaps suggesting that these changes are more reflective of drift or random alterations and not necessarily concerted DNA methylation changes.

Significant age-associated methylation changes in whole blood from both human and rat were predominantly hypomethylation; but in mice the distribution between hypomethylation and hypermethylation is more balanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and f</xref>). When comparing the DMRs observed in rats to other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>) we find a high level of concordance, suggesting that many age-associated methylation changes may be common to several mammalian species.

Here, a relatively simple blood profiling technique using eight antibodies led us to construct a model that predicts both age and, potentially, pathology. The model can be used to predict the risk of illness as a function of the deviation from predicted age to actual age, and we propose such a model could also be used to determine if intervention experiments mitigate aging phenotypes. While our dataset and analyses were for a specific set of flow cytometric parameters generated on fixed cells, we found we were able to adapt these analyses to also predict the age of freshly isolated blood (using similar flow cytometry markers). Thus, with inclusion of proper controls to account for experimental design variation, this resource of aging rat blood parameters could be adapted for studies of rat aging or pathology without requiring euthanasia of the animals. We believe this would be especially useful for longitudinal or intervention studies given the ease of blood collection at multiple timepoints. It would also be interesting to see how our reported blood parameter changes synergize with other non-invasive measurements such as the frailty index, gait speed, etc.</p><p>This experiment was performed in male rats. In humans, clear sex aging differences have been defined, both before and after menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Márquez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gubbels Bupp, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we were surprised to observe a good fit of females to the male generated age prediction model. However, we only tested a relatively small sample of 15 females of varying ages. Additionally, we found sex-specific leukocyte frequency differences that were accentuated by age. These differences highlight potential sex-specific aging patterns that remain to be fully explored. This comparison would be especially intriguing if viewed in the context of aging of the reproductive system as in the males we observed an alignment between hematopoietic aging and the end of the late reproductive period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>A strong predictor of age was the accumulation of CD25 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the F344 rat model. These results support previous findings that report an age-dependent accumulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sharma et al., 2006</xref>). This stable increase in the F344 rat is more similar to that observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gregg et al., 2005</xref>) than in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2007</xref>) and highlights the relevance of the rat model to study hematopoietic aging. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garg et al., 2014</xref> have previously suggested that this accumulation is driven by hypomethylation of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; however, in our dataset analyzing total blood cell methylation, we do not see differential methylation of Foxp3. This is likely because CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are a rare subpopulation of the total blood, and DNA methylation changes in this population would not significantly affect the global blood methylation profiles.</p><p>We observed an age-dependent myeloid bias with rat aging, similar to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beerman et al., 2010</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). The observed myeloid bias was a strong predictor of pathology in general, and of LGLL in particular. Importantly, strong myeloid bias was correlated with illness that was otherwise only noticeable during autopsy and undetectable during routine veterinary observation. A caveat to this observation is that myeloid bias increases with age, even in healthy animals, meaning that the myeloid/lymphoid ratio can only be useful as a diagnostic parameter when plotted against the expected ‘normal’ age-dependent increase. In this reference dataset, we found a significant association between severity of LGLL and increased myeloid cell numbers. The myeloid bias we report in rats has previously been documented in mice; however, most mouse models do not develop age-associated blood diseases seen in humans. Thus, we find the correlation between increased myeloid cells and LGLL severity in rats to be of particular relevance for potential modeling of human blood aging phenotypes.</p><p>Our analysis of the age-related changes in leukocyte profiles indicates inflection points in the trajectories occurring at early middle age (~15 months) and at ~24 months of age. The first inflection point is characterized by several shifts in leukocyte frequencies, including a stabilization of T cell decline, peak in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, rapid drop of B cells, deceleration in the accumulation of CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and an acceleration in the increase of stimulated monocytes. The second shift point we observed is defined by a marked increase in variance between individual rats which alludes to a pan-hematopoietic loss of homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Alternatively, this increased variability could be the result of a divergence in biological aging rates between individual rats. It would be interesting to investigate this further in a longitudinal study that can make a clear distinction between these postulations. We hypothesize that interventions aiming at mitigating aging phenotypes would be significantly more effective if performed prior to these defined shift points. The inflection points in the blood are similar to the transition pattens (linear, early logistic, and mid-logistic) of gene expression on tissues isolated from aging Sprague-Dawley rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shavlakadze et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, supporting a claim for interventions predating the observed switch point are studies of caloric restriction (CR). It is quite clear that early onset CR has more benefits than late onset, but it is yet unclear what the ideal starting age should be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingram and de Cabo, 2017</xref>). In fact, late onset CR has even been shown to be potentially detrimental to cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Todorovic et al., 2018</xref>). However, Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) reported a beneficial effect of late onset CR to muscle mass and metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats, indicating that the ideal points of intervention could vary greatly between different systems. In fact, interventions that aim to prevent or delay aging could be fundamentally different than those that aim to reverse it, even to the extent where harm could be caused when one strategy is applied instead of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hadley et al., 2005</xref>). It is therefore critical to understand which systems display aging switch points, and when, in order to design the appropriate intervention regimen. This is especially true when translating experimental paradigms to human interventions due to the great heterogeneity between the aging rates of both individuals and different systems within the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The combined results of changes in population frequencies and the DNA methylome indicate that hematopoietic aging of rats occurs in phases as opposed to a continuous process. However, with the current data, we cannot ascertain the drivers underlying the shift between these aging phases, whether they are triggered by a specific event, or simply manifest when a critical mass of small changes reaches a threshold. Whichever the case, investigating these relatively early timepoints in which blood profiles begin to irreversibly shift, indicating critical trajectory alterations, is of great interest.</p><p>The age-related DNA methylation changes in all leukocytes highlight the potential involvement of epigenetic changes that have occurred in HSCs and/or early progenitors, and are transmitted to all the differentiated progeny, as indicated by the hypermethylation of <italic>Runx1</italic> and the gene enrichment analysis. In addition, the lack of enrichment for hypomethylated TSS in the transition from middle age to old indicates that age-related gains of methylation may be a directed process, whereas loss of methylation later in life is more non-specific and perhaps attributed to drift. If so, mitigating the seemingly random loss of methylation would be an interesting potential aging intervention. Intriguingly, there is a surprising concordance between the rat and human differential methylation patterns, both in terms of a predominant global loss of methylation with age and in specific DMRs that are near orthologous genes. However, a more comprehensive coverage of overlapping methylation sites is needed to validate these initial findings. As we observed a change of leukocyte frequencies with age consistent between species, and different cell types present different DNA methylation profiles, it would be interesting to ascertain in future studies to what extent the observed methylation change rely on distinct changes in blood composition. However, we observed different breakpoints for the population frequencies and the DNA methylation, which indicate a slight disconnect between the two. This supports the notion that at least some of the methylation changes are derived from aging alterations in stem/progenitor cells that are inherited by their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beerman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we present this work as a resource for investigators studying aging in the rat model, which appears to be a robust system for modeling the aging human hematopoietic system. Our research emphasizes the importance of studying changes in homeostasis during aging as we present key trajectory shifts in blood populations that occur at relatively early age (15 months). Finally, our research model describes aging ‘juncture points’. Given these specific breakpoints in composition of the hematopoietic system, we posit that strategic aging interventions would likely be more robust and beneficial if performed earlier in life to mitigate or stall the major changes that occur under homeostatic conditions. While our data support that the male-derived model can be used for female predictions, it was evident there are sex-specific differences in the blood of rats. We hope these data will be expanded upon in a female longitudinal study, in which fraility measurements would also be included. It would be exciting to further explore if an illness prediction model based off of these defined blood parameters could be extrapolated for a broad range of diseases, and ultimately if similar age-associated shifts occur in other organs/tissue systems, animal models, and specifically in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Institute on Aging) Animal Care and Use Committee (467-CMS-2018 and 469-TGB-2022). Male and female Fischer 344 CDF (F344) rats (were obtained from the NIA Aged Rodent Colony housed at the Charles River Laboratories [Frederick, MD]). The animals were housed with Nylabone supplementation and ad libitum access to food (Envigo 2018åSX) and water. Rats younger than 3 months were housed in groups of three; all other rats were single housed. All rats were maintained on a 12/12 lighting schedule, with all procedures carried out during the light cycle. Rats were habituated to the facility for at least 3 days before sample collection. Some of rats reported here were also analyzed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finesso et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Flow cytometry and sample collection</title><p>500 µl of whole blood was collected via retro-orbital bleedings for DNA and FACS analysis. Blood for DNA for DNA methylation was collected in heparinized tubes, spun, and the plasma removed; buffy coat and red blood cells were frozen at −80°C until DNA extraction. Blood for FACS analysis was collected in EDTA-treated tubes, chilled on ice, and 100 µL was stained and then processed using a Beckman Coulter TQ-prep (fixation step) and the Beckman Coulter immunoprep reagent system. For the fresh sample analysis, blood was drawn as above, ACK treated, and immediately stained with antibodies. For all samples, staining was performed on ice for 30 min in a 100 µl staining cocktail containing the following antibodies at a dilution of 1:200: FITC-conjugated anti-rat CD3 (clone 1F4, Cat#201403), PE-conjugated anti-rat CD25 (clone OX-39, Cat#202105), PerCP-conjugated anti-rat CD8a (clone OX-8, Cat#201712), PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-rat CD11b/c (clone OX-42, Cat#201818), APC-Cy7 conjugated anti-rat CD4 (clone W3/25, Cat#201518) from Biolegend (San Diego, USA), and AF647-conjugated anti-rat RT1B (clone OX-6, Cat#562223), BV421-conjugated anti-rat CD45RA (clone OX-33, Cat#740043), and BV605-conjugated anti-rat CD45 (clone OX-1, Cat#740515) from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, USA). Immunophenotyping data was acquired on a BD FACSCanto II and analyzed using FlowJo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flowjo.com/">https://www.flowjo.com/</ext-link>).

The raw sequencing datasets are available from GEO (GSE161141). To identify differentially methylated loci: we trimmed reads of adapter dimers using Trim Galore (0.4.3) and quality trimmed with a minimum quality score above &gt;25 (--rrbs -q 25). The attached adapter dimers were trimmed using cutadapter. First, bisulfite-converted index (GA and CT conversion) was generated using F344 rat genome with bismark build option and trimmed reads were aligned with bismark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</xref>). Once we created aligned reads and corresponding locations, we used the bismark_methylation_extrator tool to summarize the level of methylation in CpG sites (bismark_methylation_extractor -p –comprehensive –no_overlap –bedGraph –counts –buffer_size 16 G [$Aligned read bam file]). Approximately a total 1–2 million sites per sample were predicted with DNA methylated sites (or unmethylated). DMR and blocks of differentially methylated sites were identified with a minimum of 3 CpG sites per block and at least &gt;5% methylation difference (FDR &lt;0.05) using MethylKit (PMID: 23034086 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akalin et al., 2012</xref>) and DMRseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korthauer et al., 2019</xref>). Functional annotation was performed using ClusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To generate RRBS(Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) DNA methylation block: RRBS datasets were processed in a uniform way and DNA methylation levels for each sample were extracted. Then, we generated 200 base-pair binned DNA methylation levels across the genome. Each DNA methylation block contains 1–20 CpG sites. We first calculated the average DNAm level per DNAm block for each rat age then used this average DNAm level for mean CpG imputation. We calculated the DNAm level using all methylated and unmethylated sites from the binned CpG sites when the minimum coverage was more than 5. The F344 build of the rat reference genome was used for bisulfite sequencing alignment, and the rn6 genome feature was used to extract genomic annotation information using the Homer package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Genes, exons, introns, and UTRs were taken from Homer annotation tools (annotatePeaks.pl DMR rn6). TSS-promoter sites were considered the identified DMRs close to TSS (less than 1 kb). TSS-proximal sites were considered the identified DMRs close to TSS (less than 20 kb), and TSS-distal sites were considered the DNAm block whose distance to TSS is above 20 kb. For downstream analysis to find inflection points, we used the TSS-promoter DNAm block for searching inflection point analysis (e.g. Runx1, Dnmt3a).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Calculation of DNA methylation breakpoints</title><p>Genes for DNA methylation breakpoint analysis were selected by first filtering for DMRs that changed as a function of age, determined by a response screening analysis (JMP platform) with an FDR p-value&lt;0.05.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based on our 3 assessments, the most salient points the authors need to address for a revision are:</p><p>1. Add additional important context and discussion for choices that may have a significant impact on results (all 3 reviewers):</p><p>– Using only males (the expectations if females were included should be discussed);</p><p>– Censoring of overtly ill animals (would the results differ if included?), which may bias against frail animals; (If these data points can be included, that would be ideal, if not, the caveat must be discussed explicitly);</p><p>– Choice of time breakpoint for the analysis;</p><p>– Mentioning the cell composition shifts as caveats for the methylation data.</p><p>2. Methodologies need to be reported in more detail and in a more transparent manner for long-term reproducibility (i.e. staining for flow cytometry, availability of the model for other people to reuse, per animal data needs to be reported in a way that allows re-analysis [with identical animal identifiers in all data forms], use of fresh/fixed protocol for the flow cytometry, etc.) (reviewers 1 and 2).</p><p>3. Clarifications need to be brought to the relative importance/results linked to myeloid bias (reviewers 1 and 2).</p><p>4.

Though we are unable to comprehensively compare female rats at all ages, we too appreciated the relevance of comparing female data. To attempt to address this concern, we analyzed leukocyte frequencies in the peripheral blood of female F344 rats taken from 3 age groups: 5 young (5 months old), 5 middle-aged (15 months old), and 5 old (23 months old) and have included these results (please see Figure 3 —figure supplement 2, Results, and Discussion). To briefly address the finding here, we were pleasantly surprised to see the age prediction model generated from the male rats seems to work robustly on predictions for female data (prediction p &lt;0.0001). This was true even though we were able to observe sex-specific differences, that appear to become exacerbated with age. The blood parameters with sex-specific differences though, do not seem to be dominant parameters driving the prediction model. Though these data would need to be more comprehensively validated, we show both sex-specific aging differences in male and female rats, but also demonstrate the current prediction model robustly predicts the female age as well. We did not have any sick or overtly ill females from this small data set, so we were cautious in the overall conclusions drawn from the additional female samples; however, were still pleased with the data supporting the utility of the male-derived model for female rats as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Censoring of overtly ill animals (would the results differ if included?), which may bias against frail animals; (If these data points can be included, that would be ideal, if not, the caveat must be discussed explicitly);</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies for not making the analyses statement more clear. The excluded animals were part of the originally planned cohort, but these rats did not have blood measurements taken as the veterinarian staff identified them as moribund and the rodents were culled for humane reasons. Their blood was not collected as the rest of the age-matched cohorts were not being assessed at the time of the sick animals’ humane euthanasia. Instead, we attempted to determine how the blood parameters were presented in illness based on veterinary assessment and necropsy on non-overtly ill rodents. We acknowledge that, in retrospect, it would have been beneficial to collect blood from these animals for analysis but unfortunately, we did not. As our study was cross-sectional and blood collections were grouped, we can only get a “snapshot” of the state of the animals during collection. We believe that tracing individual rats in a longitudinal study, ideally using our blood parameters examined in this manuscript, would be an excellent topic to tackle to pre-identify animals that are projected to become moribund.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Choice of time breakpoint for the analysis;</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the specific response to reviewer #2, but briefly: the breakpoints for the analysis were data-driven. In the case of blood parameters, we performed a multiple regression analysis for each cell population and identified time points in which there was a major trajectory shift and most of these shifts appear to converge at approximately 15 months of age. For the methylation data, we performed both linear and logistic regressions on significant age-associated DMRs near TSSs and for each DMR selected the regression with the best fit (based on Akaike Information Criterion). Most sites changed linearly with age, while ~40% showed a better fit to a logistic regression. We used the DMRs that better fit the logistic regression to determine the breakpoint. This was calculated using the breakpoint analysis formula described in Supp Figure 7C. The methylation switch points defined from these analyses, converged at around 22 months of age and mildly at close to 12 months of age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Mentioning the cell composition shifts as caveats for the methylation data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that we overlooked mentioning and we now raise this caveat in the discussion. As this analysis is a correlative analysis, it is naturally difficult to distinguish between the effects of co-factors that change together. To fully answer this question, we would need to obtain the DNA methylation profiles of individual cell types. This would also require the generation of profiles from each cell type from aged animals, as we hypothesize that specific populations will likely display unique age-associated methylation changes. We have attempted to provide some insight into this question bioinformatically with our existing data by comparing the aging methylation changes to the population frequency changes. While we found some interesting correlations, we do not believe the evidence is strong enough to be included in the main paper and will only be described here.</p><p>Briefly, we compared the correlations between the top 2311 DMRs that changed as a function of age with leukocyte population frequencies. To do that, we ran a least-square model that predicts the DNA methylation levels, with or without age as a predictor:</p><p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, Age is a stronger predictor for DNA methylation levels than leukocyte populations on their own. Myeloid/lymphoid ratio is also a strong coefficient, suggesting that cell composition does indeed contribute to the observed DNA methylation changes. However, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, overall R-square values (where the higher the value, the more accurately the parameters describe the observed changes in the DMR) are higher when age is included as a variable than without. This suggests that age, on its own, is a contributor to the DNA methylation changes. Further, the breakpoints between changes in the blood parameters do not overlap directly with the breakpoints in the methylation changes, suggesting the methylation and blood parameter changes may not be completely dependent. While we think this analysis is indicative of a cell composition independent methylation change, we do not believe this evidence is strong enough to make that claim definitively. Therefore, we have added a caveat describing that we cannot exclude the possibility that the methylation changes are driven by changes in the cell composition in the Discussion.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Heatmap summarizing the impact of each leukocyte population on predicting DNA methylation by least-square model.</title><p>A least square model was constructed for each DMR of the 2311 top hits using age and leukocyte frequencies as predictive variables.

Methodologies need to be reported in more detail and in a more transparent manner for long-term reproducibility (i.e. staining for flow cytometry, availability of the model for other people to reuse, per animal data needs to be reported in a way that allows re-analysis [with identical animal identifiers in all data forms], use of fresh/fixed protocol for the flow cytometry, etc.) (reviewers 1 and 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Materials and methods to include all data needed to reproduce the experiment.

Clarifications need to be brought to the relative importance/results linked to myeloid bias (reviewers 1 and 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see specific responses to reviewers. Briefly, we should reiterate that the model was generated on healthy rats, and as such myeloid/lymphoid ratio was not among the strongest predictors. The other parameters (such as CD25+ CD4 cells, NK frequency, CD8<sup>+</sup> frequency of T-cells, etc.) are the drivers of the healthy model. The myeloid bias has a small dynamic range in the young rats and therefore is not a strong predictor of “healthy” aging. If we had included sick rats in the model, myeloid/lymphoid ratio would indeed be a robust predictor of illness. We believe that a model to predict age should be based on animals that are healthy (as measurable) to reduce the confounding effects of pathologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. If possible, providing more contextualization as compared to studies in other species (reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We were excited to see the analyses when we performed this suggested comparison as we found that the rat blood had quite similar trends to what was seen in human blood with aging, with the dominant changes being loss of methylation in the older cells. Interestingly, the mouse data show similar amounts of both loss and gains of methylation. When we looked for concordance between the three species, we see that the majority of DMRs that gain or lose methylation during aging in rats, also show the same trends in both mouse and human data. Our one large caveat to this analysis is each of these data sets was generated using different platforms with different levels of coverage. While the human global analysis looks similar to what we report in the rats, when examining concordance, there were excessive amounts of missing orthologous data points. We have included these analyses in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, we would suggest careful copyediting, including checking the numbers of animals, making sure all figures are referenced and clarifying the study goals in the abstract clarification, may be needed (reviewer 1 and 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely apologize for the oversights and likely annoyance that they caused.

Suppl. Table 2 is now presented in a more approachable form and includes all the population frequencies on an individual animal basis to reflect inter-individual variability and allow others to re-analyze the results.

We have now included the CD4/CD8 ratio in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 and discuss it in the results. We do find a modest decline in CD4/CD8 ratio in the first half of life (as seen in humans).

We explored including all rats (healthy and ill) into the prediction model and found that myeloid/lymphoid becomes a significant contributor (p = 0.000232). However, due to the low dynamic range during the early ages, it was not amongst the strongest predictors when excluding sick rats.

We have performed the comparison between our dataset and publicly available DNA methylation aging datasets from both humans and mice, including the one suggested. We find the results interesting and have expanded main Figure 5 to include these results showing the overall trends towards hypomethylation in the rat and humans, and how mice have a more balanced change- with similar numbers of both gains and loss of methylation associated with aging. However, it is important to note that due to differences in how the DNA methylation data was generated and ultimately sequenced, the comparison is not completely straightforward.
