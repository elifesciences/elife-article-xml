organellar homeostasis, and DNA damage repair, and its de-regulation is linked to neuromuscular diseases and cancer. p97 is tightly controlled by numerous regulatory cofactors, but the full range and function of the p97–cofactor network is unknown. Here, we identify the hitherto uncharacterized FAM104 proteins as a conserved family of p97 interactors. The two human family members <underline>V</underline>CP nuclear <underline>c</underline>ofactor <underline>f</underline>amily member 1 and 2 (VCF1/2) bind p97 directly via a novel, alpha-helical motif and associate with p97-UFD1-NPL4 and p97-UBXN2B complexes in cells. VCF1/2 localize to the nucleus and promote the nuclear import of p97. Loss of VCF1/2 results in reduced nuclear p97 levels, slow growth, and hypersensitivity to chemical inhibition of p97 in the absence and presence of DNA damage, suggesting that FAM104 proteins are critical regulators of nuclear p97 functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p97 VCP Cdc48</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin proteasome system</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>DNA damage repair</kwd><kwd>FAM104A FLJ14775</kwd><kwd>FAM104B FLJ20434 CXorf44</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>440766788; INST 93/1023-1-FUGG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuelein-Voelk</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2243/1+2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchberger</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HBFG-133-612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuelein-Voelk</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily conserved FAM104 proteins VCF1/2 stimulate the nuclear import of p97/VCP, with their absence causing reduced nuclear p97/VCP levels, slow growth, and hypersensitivity to pharmacological inhibition of p97/VCP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The abundant, highly conserved AAA+-type ATPase p97 (also known as VCP in mammals and Cdc48 in plants and lower eukaryotes) plays a central role in the maintenance of protein and organelle homeostasis as well as genome integrity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahlstedt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franz et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Papadopoulos and Meyer, 2017</xref>). The best-characterized function of p97 is the segregation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in various protein quality control pathways for their subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dantuma and Hoppe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2001</xref>). p97 is also involved in the lysosomal degradation of endocytic cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>) and in the selective autophagy of protein aggregates, stress granules, as well as damaged mitochondria and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ju et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turakhiya et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, p97 possesses a number of crucial nuclear functions, for instance, in DNA replication and DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maric et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meerang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mouysset et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raman et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, mutational perturbation of p97 function causes the neuromuscular degenerative disease multisystem proteinopathy 1 (MSP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pfeffer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watts et al., 2004</xref>), and several cancers as well as viral and bacterial pathogens rely on p97 activity, making p97 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das and Dudley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deshaies, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humphreys et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huryn et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The molecular basis underlying the diverse cellular functions of p97 is the partial or complete unfolding of substrate proteins by threading through the ring-shaped p97 homohexamer in an ATP hydrolysis-driven process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blythe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchberger, 2022</xref>). Since p97 itself lacks appreciable specificity for its physiological substrates, a large number of cofactor proteins control substrate binding, subcellular localization, and oligomeric state of p97 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchberger et al., 2015</xref>). Some of these cofactors bind to p97 in a mutually exclusive manner and define functionally distinct, major p97 complexes: a heterodimer of UFD1 (also known as UFD1L) and NPL4 (also known as NPLOC4) recruits ubiquitylated substrates for p97-dependent unfolding and subsequent proteasomal degradation or processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jarosch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rape et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2001</xref>), whereas UBXN6 (also known as UBXD1) controls p97 functions in lysosomal and autophagic degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>) and SEP domain-containing cofactors such as p47 (also known as NSFL1C) and UBXN2B (also known as p37) mediate the maturation of protein phosphatase 1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weith et al., 2018</xref>). At least in the case of p97-UFD1-NPL4, auxiliary cofactors from the UBA-UBX family can fine-tune the subcellular localization and/or substrate specificity of a major p97 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schuberth and Buchberger, 2008</xref>). For example, the yeast cofactor Ubx2 recruits Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria to promote ER- and outer mitochondrial membrane-associated protein degradation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mårtensson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neuber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schuberth and Buchberger, 2005</xref>). Similarly, the metazoan cofactors UBXN7 and FAF1 direct p97-UFD1-NPL4 to nuclear chromatin to promote the removal of ubiquitylated substrates such as CDT1 and the CMG helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franz et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujisawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kochenova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tarcan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The majority of cofactors interact with p97 through a small number of defined domains/motifs, including the UBX(-like) domain, the PUB and PUL domains, the SHP box, the VCP interacting motif (VIM), and the VCP binding motif (VBM) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchberger et al., 2015</xref>). However, some p97 interactors do not possess any of these canonical binding motifs, suggesting that the current inventory of p97 cofactors is incomplete and, hence, that the full scope of the p97–cofactor network is far from being understood. Examples illustrating this point include ZFAND1 (yeast Cuz1) and GIGYF1/2 (yeast Smy2), which were recently shown to regulate p97 functions in stress granule clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turakhiya et al., 2018</xref>) and the transcription stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lehner et al., 2022</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Here, we report the identification of the previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily conserved FAM104 protein family as p97 cofactors. We show that the human FAM104 family members VCF1 and VCF2 bind p97 directly via a non-canonical helical motif and that they associate with different p97 complexes in cells. We demonstrate that VCF1/2 promote the nuclear localization of p97 and that their loss causes impaired growth and hypersensitivity to chemical inhibition of p97.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FAM104 proteins are a conserved family of p97 interactors</title><p>In our ongoing efforts to identify p97 binding partners, we isolated multiple clones encoding the hitherto uncharacterized proteins FAM104A (also known as FLJ14775) and FAM104B (also known as FLJ20434, CXorf44) in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human testis cDNA library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the following, we will use the new official names VCF1 and VCF2 for human FAM104A and FAM104B, respectively, and the term FAM104 when addressing the entire protein family. VCF1 and 2 are both expressed in various isoforms originating from alternative transcript variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For VCF1, the two-hybrid hits matched isoforms 1, 2, and 5, whereas isoforms 3 and 4, which share just the N-terminal 73 residues with isoforms 1/2, were not isolated. For VCF2, the two-hybrid hits matched isoforms 3 and 4/5/6, respectively, which differ by the insertion of a single valine residue after residue 40. Compared to isoform 4, isoforms 5 and 6 of VCF2 possess slightly different N termini. Isoforms 1 and 2, which possess 30 divergent C-terminal residues, and isoform 7, which is truncated after 46 residues, were not isolated. Of note, those isoforms of VCF1 and 2 that were isolated in the two-hybrid screen possess significant sequence homology, suggesting that they are evolutionarily related. Indeed, FAM104-like proteins are present in vertebrates as well as in many invertebrates, including insects, octopuses, and echinodermata, whereas the occurrence of two distinct, VCF1- and VCF2-like homologs appears to be restricted to mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Basically, FAM104 family members possess a predicted mono- or bipartite classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) at or close to the N terminus and a C-terminal, highly conserved helical region, which are separated by largely unstructured stretches of variable length and lower sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VCF1/2 bind to p97.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of human VCF1 and VCF2 isoforms isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen.

In order to determine the VCF1/2 binding region of p97, we performed pulldown assays with VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 using different truncated variants of p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). The ND1 variant of p97 lacking the D2 ATPase domain as well as the N domain alone bound efficiently to VCF1 and 2, whereas the ΔN variant lacking the N domain did not. Taken together, these results show that FAM104 proteins are a new family of evolutionarily conserved p97 interactors, and that the N domain is necessary and sufficient for the direct binding of p97 to VCF1/2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FAM104 proteins bind to p97 via their C-terminal helix</title><p>As VCF1/2 do not possess any of the canonical p97 binding motifs found in other cofactors, we next sought to map their binding site for p97. The shortest VCF1 fragment isolated in the two-hybrid screen starts at glycine residue G131 of isoform 1 (equivalent to G110 and G64 of isoforms 2 and 5, respectively). Since the C-terminal alpha-helical region shows the highest sequence conservation among FAM104 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and is missing in those isoforms of VCF1/2 that were not isolated in the two-hybrid screen, we truncated this region from the C-terminus to test its importance for p97 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While deletion of the four C-terminal residues did not affect the two-hybrid interaction between VCF1 isoform 5 and p97, larger deletions of 7–26 residues completely abolished p97 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), even though the truncated proteins were expressed to similar levels in the reporter yeast strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with this, deletion of the C-terminal 26 residues impaired the ability of all four VCF1/2 isoforms to bind p97 in a pulldown experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the C-terminal region contains the p97 binding site. We therefore tested whether a peptide spanning the conserved alpha-helical and flanking residues (residues C180 to G203 in VCF1 isoform 1) can bind to p97. To that end, we immobilized the N-terminally biotinylated peptide on streptavidin sepharose beads and performed a pulldown assay with p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The peptide pulled down full-length p97 as well as the ND1 and N domain variants, demonstrating that the C-terminal conserved region of FAM104 family proteins is not only necessary, but also sufficient for p97 binding. We also noted some residual binding of the p97 ΔN variant, suggesting that the VCF1-derived peptide has some weak affinity for a p97 region(s) outside the N domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>FAM104 proteins bind to p97 via their C-terminal helix.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the C-terminal truncations of VCF1 isoform 5 used for yeast two-hybrid analysis.

The central part of the C-terminal region was predicted as an alpha-helix that binds to the subdomain cleft of the p97 N domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which is the major binding site for other N domain binding motifs including the UBX(-like) domain and the VIM and VBM linear motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchberger et al., 2015</xref>). Closer inspection of the modeled interface revealed that the four most strongly conserved residues of the helix, Y184, N188, L191, and H195, all contact the N domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The predicted interactions are centered around L191, which occupies a predominantly hydrophobic pocket in the p97 subdomain cleft. Adjacent residues contribute to a hydrogen bonding network with p97, while Y184 is predicted to exhibit an orthogonal pi-stacking with Y138 of p97. To test the importance of this interface, we mutated the two central residues N188 and L191 to either alanine or arginine. We reasoned that the NL-&gt;AA double exchange should eliminate key contacts with the N domain, whereas the NL-&gt;RR double exchange should introduce steric clashes. Intriguingly, both double mutations abolished the interaction of VCF1 with p97 as efficiently as the deletion of the entire C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Consistent with a conserved essential role of residues N188 and L191 for p97 binding, an AlphaFold Multimer model of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homologs of VCF1/2 (CG14229) and p97 (TER94) showed a highly similar binding interface with basically identical positions of the equivalent residues N90 and L93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, our data identify the C-terminal alpha-helix of FAM104 proteins as a novel p97 binding motif and show that the strictly conserved residues N188 and L191 are of central importance for the interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>VCF1/2 bind to several p97 complexes in cells</title><p>To investigate whether FAM104 proteins associate with p97 in cells, we ectopically expressed N-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged VCF1/2 in HEK293T cells and performed anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Endogenous p97 was efficiently co-precipitated with all four wild-type VCF1/2 proteins tested, despite the fact that VCF1 isoform 5 was less and VCF2 isoform 3 was much less well expressed than VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2, and that the levels of soluble p97 in the input were strongly reduced upon ectopic expression of VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2. Importantly, UFD1 and NPL4 were co-precipitated at levels roughly proportional to those of p97, strongly suggesting that VCP1/2 form complexes with p97-UFD1-NPL4. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that VCF1 Cdel26 variants lacking the C-terminal helix failed to co-precipitate not only p97, as expected, but also UFD1 and NPL4. (The expression level of the VCF2 isoform 3 Cdel26 variant was below the detection limit, precluding its analysis in this experiment.) We also detected a robust co-precipitation of the SEP domain cofactor UBXN2B with the wild-type, but not Cdel26 VCF1/2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating the existence of ternary p97-UBXN2B-VCF1/2 complexes and thereby confirming and extending recent data from high-throughput interaction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luck et al., 2020</xref>).

By contrast, the more weakly expressed VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 did not interfere with binding of UFD1-NPL4 and p47 and even appeared to increase the association of ubiquitylated substrates with p97.

Whereas FAF1 bound to isoforms 1 and 2 of VCF1, UBXN7 bound to all four VCF1/2 isoforms. Of note, the amounts of co-precipitated FAF1 and UBXN7 did not correlate with those of p97, UFD1, and NPL4, suggesting that the interaction of FAF1 and UBXN7 with VCF1/2 may not strictly depend on the p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex. To directly address this possibility, we performed pulldown experiments with purified p97 cofactors and found that FAF1, but not p47, UFD1-NPL4, or UBXN7, bound to VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2, whereas no binding of FAF1 to VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).

To analyze whether the reduction of nuclear p97 in the absence of VCF1/2 has consequences for the cell fitness, we performed growth assays with HeLa VCF1/2 double-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Importantly, CB-5083 treatment decreased the already reduced nuclear p97 signal of the VCF1/2 knockout cells even further to 67 and 65%, demonstrating that the effects of p97 inhibition and lack of VCF1/2 on the nuclear localization of p97 are additive. Together with the synthetic growth defects described above, these results strongly suggest that the combined VCF1/2 deletion and inhibitor treatment reduces nuclear p97 levels and functions to an extent that is no longer compatible with viability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we characterized FAM104 proteins as a family of evolutionarily conserved p97 interactors and identified their C-terminal helix as a novel p97 binding motif. We showed that the human FAM104 proteins VCF1 and VCF2 associate with p97 complexes containing the cofactors UFD-NPL4, FAF1, UBXN7, and UBXN2B in living cells, and that they efficiently recruit p97 to the nucleus. Loss of VCF1/2 reduced nuclear p97 levels, impaired cell growth, and caused hypersensitivity to p97 inhibition in the absence and presence of DNA damage, indicating that VCF1/2 support optimal p97 activity in the nuclear compartment.</p><p>Whereas VCF2 had not been reported to interact with p97 before, VCF1 (FAM104A) was identified as a p97 interactor in several high-throughput proteomic and yeast two-hybrid screening projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fogeron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haenig et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luck et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rolland et al., 2014</xref>). However, the interaction between p97 and VCF1 was not further validated in any of these previous studies. In fact, the validation of p97 binding is complicated by the existence of five different isoforms, of which only three (isoforms 1, 2, and 5) contain the p97-interacting C-terminal helix. The existence of p97 binding and non-binding isoforms of VCF1 and 2 in humans also initially obscured the prevalence of FAM104 proteins in the animal kingdom. Nevertheless, bioinformatic searches using the C-terminal p97 binding helix as query readily identified homologs in all five vertebrate classes as well as in <italic>Saccoglossus</italic> and sea urchin, leading to the subsequent identification of numerous invertebrate homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Outside of the chordates, FAM104 proteins are found in many arthropods (insects, spiders, crustaceans) and selected other invertebrate lineages, including mollusks (octopi, snails), tardigrades, and rotifers, but are absent in nematodes, protists, plants, and fungi. The three human p97-interacting VCF1 isoforms possess an N-terminal 74-residue extension exclusively found in eutheria, a 21-residue insertion after residue 107 (numbering referring to isoform 1/2) that is found in mammals, birds, and reptiles, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Amphibian, fish, and invertebrate homologs contain neither insertion and are therefore more similar to human VCF2 with respect to their overall organization. The widespread occurrence of FAM104 proteins strongly suggests a conserved function, even though very little information is available for non-human homologs. The fly homolog CG14229 lacks any functional annotations, whereas mouse Vcf1 (Fam104a) was reported to interact with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The binding preference for K6-, K48-, and K29-linked di-ubiquitin observed in that study closely resembled that of p97, suggesting that Vcf1 did not bind ubiquitin directly, but in the context of a p97–cofactor complex such as p97-Ufd1-Npl4.</p><p>Here, we showed for the first time that FAM104 proteins and p97 interact directly via their highly conserved C-terminal alpha-helix and N domain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Structural modeling revealed that the C-terminal helix binds to the subdomain cleft of the p97 N domain. Interestingly, the position of the VCF1 helix in the model is similar to those of the helical VIM and VBM p97 binding motifs in the absence of any significant sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hänzelmann and Schindelin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). Even the respective key p97-contacting residues are distinct, with N188 and L191 in the C-terminal helix of VCF1 versus predominantly arginine residues in VIM and VBM. The finding that alpha-helices can efficiently bind to the N subdomain cleft via just one or two key residues underlines the plasticity of this binding interface and raises the intriguing possibility that additional interactors bind p97 through yet other helical motifs.</p><p>Our cell-based experiments revealed a significant effect of VCF1/2 on the subcellular localization of p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Their overexpression resulted in a strong increase in p97 nuclear localization and, for VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2, chromatin association, whereas both CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion and siRNA-mediated depletion caused a decrease in nuclear p97 levels. While we were unable to detect endogenous VCF1/2 due to the lack of suitably sensitive antibodies, the highly consistent effects of the deletion and depletion experiments on nuclear p97 levels provide strong indirect evidence that endogenous VCF1/2 indeed localize to the nucleus, in agreement with their potent cNLS and the robust nuclear accumulation of ectopically expressed VCF1/2. Because the de(p)letion of VCF1 alone had similar effects as the VCF1/2 double knockout in these experiments, VCF1 apparently plays a more important role for the nuclear localization of p97 than VCF2, at least in HeLa and HEK293T cells.</p><p>p97 homologs from yeast to mammals possess a relatively weak potential cNLS (residues K60-R65 in human p97, score 5 according to cNLS mapper). Available three-dimensional structures of p97 suggest that this potential cNLS is part of a beta-hairpin in the N domain that is unlikely to be constitutively exposed due to nucleotide-dependent conformational changes of and cofactor binding to the N domain. Interestingly, an additional, functional bi-partite cNLS found closer to the N terminus in yeast Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madeo et al., 1998</xref>) is conserved in several p97 homologs from organisms lacking FAM104 proteins, but lost or poorly conserved in most p97 homologs from organisms possessing FAM104 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that FAM104 proteins compensate the loss of the functional bipartite cNLS in the latter p97 homologs by exposing a very strong cNLS that is connected via a long, flexible region with the C-terminal helix tightly interacting with the p97 N domain. This speculation is further supported by our finding that the fusion of the strong SV40 cNLS to the N terminus of p97 can fully compensate for the loss of VCF1/2 with respect to p97 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>).</p><p>On a more general note, our study underscores the importance of a sufficiently high number of NLSs that has to be present on large cargoes for their efficient nuclear import. In a recent quantitative study, a model cargo of roughly the same size as the p97 hexamer, MS2<sup>S37P</sup>, had to be decorated with at least 10 NLSs for detectable nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paci et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that the six moderately strong and potentially masked cNLSs in the p97 hexamer are insufficient and have to be assisted by the strong cNLSs of VCF1/2. Since de(p)letion of VCF1/2 caused only a partial reduction in nuclear p97 levels in our experiments, it is likely that additional nuclear cofactors such as UBXN7 with its strong cNLS contribute to the efficient nuclear targeting of p97. Intriguingly, two other small proteins possessing strong NLSs were recently found to possess functions analogous to VCF1/2 in the nuclear import of essential protein complexes of the ubiquitin proteasome system. AKIRIN2 and HAPSTR1 promote the nuclear import of the assembled 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Almeida et al., 2021</xref>) and of the E3 ligase HUWE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monda et al., 2023</xref>), respectively, indicating that the decoration of protein complexes with small, NLS-containing interaction partners is a general strategy of cells.</p><p>We were able to show that VCF1 and 2 associate with the major p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), potentially implicating FAM104 proteins in nuclear p97 functions such as DNA damage repair, regulation of DNA replication, and control of transcription. Consistent with this possibility, isoforms 1 and 2 of VCF1 bound the auxiliary cofactors UBXN7 and FAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and promoted the chromatin association of p97 upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The finding that VCF1/2 can also associate with the p97-UBXN2B complex involved in protein phosphatase 1 regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) is intriguing as it indicates that FAM104 family proteins are likely to control p97 functions beyond proteasomal degradation pathways. While it is possible that the strong chromatin association of p97 is a consequence of overexpressing the chromatin-binding VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2 and/or of the massive loss of cofactor interactions observed under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the impact of VCF1/2 on p97 nuclear levels was also observed in immunofluorescence microscopy upon the much weaker ectopic expression of VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 preserving p97-cofactor complexes, as well as upon de(p)letion of VCF1/2. Thus, the accumulated evidence strongly supports a direct regulatory function of VCF1/2 on the nuclear localization of p97. It is hardly compatible with the scenario that the observed relocalizations of p97 are merely secondary, compensatory effects of increased or reduced VCF1/2 levels, respectively.</p><p>While the finding that VCF1/2 double-knockout cells are hypersensitive to p97 inhibition in the absence and presence of the DNA damaging agent camptothecin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>) is in line with an involvement of VCF1/2 in p97-dependent DNA damage repair processes, we were unable to detect a camptothecin sensitivity in the absence of p97 inhibitor. The partial reduction of VCF1 expression by not more than 50% in the knockout cell pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) is likely to prevent the detection of more severe phenotypes. It is conceivable that the decrease in nuclear p97 levels by 25% under these conditions is insufficient to severely compromise p97-dependent nuclear processes and/or that these essential processes are safeguarded by redundant p97 cofactors. Importantly, we found that chemical inhibition reduces nuclear p97 levels and further aggravates the effect of VCF1/2 deletion on the nuclear localization of p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>), strongly suggesting that the cellular basis for the synthetic growth defect observed upon combined VCF1/2 deletion and inhibitor treatment are limiting nuclear levels and activities of p97.</p><p>The nuclear recruitment function of FAM104 proteins is reminiscent of two other small p97 interactors, SVIP and VIMP (also known as SELENOS, selenoprotein S). SVIP is myristoyl-anchored to the lysosomal membrane, whereas VIMP is a single-spanning ER membrane protein. It therefore appears that FAM104 proteins, SVIP, and VIMP recruit p97 to distinct subcellular localizations with high demand for p97 activity.</p><p>According to the Human Protein Atlas and Proteomics DB databases, VCF1 and 2 are broadly expressed in many human tissues, including strong expression in the brain. In this context, it is interesting to note that both proteins have recently been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (VCF1: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; VCF2: Alzheimer’s disease), based on systematic yeast two-hybrid screening and computationally predicted neurodegenerative disease-associated protein clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haenig et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the potential link between VCF1/2 and p97-mediated DNA damage repair suggested by our data could hint to a role of VCF1/2 in p97-dependent cancer cell survival, an area of intense biomedical research efforts. While the exact role of VCF1/2 in the control of nuclear p97 functions remains to be determined, this work provides a starting point for the future exploration of the FAM104 protein family in basic and translational research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Plasmids, antibodies, and other key resources used in this study are listed in Appendix 1—key resources table.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Full-length and C-terminally truncated coding sequences of human VCF1 isoforms 1 (NCBI reference sequence NM_001098832.2), 2 (NM_032837.3), and 5 (NM_001289412.2) and of human VCF2 isoform 3 (NM_001166700.2) were PCR-amplified from a yeast two-hybrid human testis cDNA library (Clontech, Cat# 638810) and cloned via appropriate restriction sites into pGAD-C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 1996</xref>), pGEX-4T1 (Cytiva), and pCMV-Tag2B (Agilent) using standard procedures.

The adaptors in question, members of the FAM104 family, direct p97 to the nucleus to enable unwinding events in that location.

Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>[…]</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>- Are the claims and the conclusions supported by the data or do they require additional experiments or analyses to support them?</p><p>Claims concerning the mapping of FAM104 and p97 (Figures 1&amp;2) are generally well concluded. Yet, minor issues concerning Fig2D (FAM104Aiso1 cdel26) as well as Figure 2E (p97-deltaN pull down) lack of interaction-are not supported by the presented data (both show weak interactions).</p></disp-quote><p>We actually did not claim that Figures 2DE show a <italic>complete</italic> lack of interaction. Rather, we stated that &quot;deletion of the C-terminal 26 residues <italic>impaired</italic> the ability of all four FAM104A/B isoforms to bind p97 in a pulldown experiment (Figure 2D)&quot;, and &quot;We also noted some residual binding of the p97 ΔN variant, suggesting that the FAM104A-derived peptide has some weak affinity for a p97 region(s) outside the N domain.&quot; (Figure 2E). However, in light of the other in vitro binding data and the complete loss of p97 binding by the Cdel26 variants in the immunoprecipitation experiment (Figure 3A), we strongly feel that our claims regarding the binding of FAM104 proteins via their C-terminal helix to p97 are well supported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claims concerning nuclear/cytosol p97 distribution impact upon FAM104 manipulations (over-expression or KO) need to be further evaluated by additional methodologies. For example, the distribution impact using the FAM104 mutants in 4B should be evaluated by cell fractionation experiments (as performed in figure 5). Cell fractionation performed for FAM104A isoforms 1 and 2 should be performed on isoforms 5 and 3, the fact that they are expressed at lower levels has no impact, as the evaluation is on p97 and they were able to show in figure 3A an impact on p97 levels. Impact on distribution performed in Figure 6 using FAM104 KO cells should also include cell fractionation experiments in order to enable clear conclusion regarding FAM104 impact on p97 nuclear distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>Compared to VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2, wild-type VCF1 isoform5 and VCF2 isoform3 are expressed at much lower levels (an estimated 30 and 100 times less, respectively), as evident from the inputs shown in Figure 3A and new Figure 3–figure supplement 1AC. Importantly, reduced levels of soluble p97 were only observed for the strongly overexpressed VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2 (see Figures 3A and Figure 3–figure supplement 1AC, inputs), clearly indicating that the expression levels correlate with the impact on p97 solubility. Given the low expression levels of the other two isoforms, a reduction of the highly abundant p97 protein in fractionation experiments cannot be expected. We nevertheless performed the requested experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Expression of VCF1 isoform 5 was much weaker (30-40 times less) than that of isoforms 1 and 2, requiring very long exposure times for detection, and did not result in any detectable redistribution or reduction of p97 compared to the vector control. The even more weakly expressed VCF2 isoform 3 could not be detected at all after fractionation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Fractionation of cell lysates after ectopic expression or deletion of VCF1/2.</title><p>(A) HEK293T cells ectopically expressing the indicated VCF1 isoforms were processed to cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear (nucleoplasmic) and chromatin fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting as indicated.

(C) Quantification of the ratio of nucleoplasmic to cytoplasmic p97 levels in (B). p97 band intensities were normalized to the whole lane intensity of the total protein stain (Coomassie) of the respective lane. The p97 intensities in the nucleoplasmic fraction were divided by the intensity in the cytoplasmic fraction, and this ratio was set to 1 for the control cells.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92409-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As requested, we performed the fractionation experiments with cells expressing the Cdel26 and delNLS mutants of VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2 used in Figure 4B. Clearly, expression of the p97 binding-deficient Cdel26 variants did not result in any depletion of cytoplasmic p97 or accumulation of chromatin-bound p97 (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A), in good agreement with the microscopy data shown in Figure 4B. Expression of the NLS-deleted variants resulted in some accumulation of p97 in the nuclear fractions, consistent with the nuclear/chromatin localization of these mutant VCF1 proteins (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>We also performed the requested fractionation of VCF1 KO and VCF1/2 double KO cell lysates after additional siRNA-mediated depletion to reduce any residual VCF1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>; see Figure 7—figure supplement 2 for residual VCF1 expression in the knockout cell pools). Even though not obvious to the naked eye, normalization revealed a reduction in the ratio of nucleoplasmic to cytoplasmic p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). However, such reduction was not always observed, potentially because the fractionation experiments are not sensitive enough to reliably detect differences in the range of 25% of the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. We therefore felt uncomfortable including these data in the revised manuscript. Instead, we corroborated the microscopy data shown in Figure 6 by performing high content microscopy followed by automated image analysis of more than 3,000 cells each in five biological replicates per cell pool (in total, &gt;15,000 cells per cell pool), which revealed a highly significant reduction by 25% of the nuclear/cytoplasmic p97 ratio in the VCF1/2 double KO cells (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D), in excellent agreement with the previous confocal microscopy analyses. This result was further confirmed in the high content microscopic analysis shown in new Figure 6EF, where VCF1-depleted cells under control conditions consistently showed a significantly reduced nuclear/cytoplasmic p97 ratio. Importantly, this reduction was eliminated upon ectopic expression of a cNLS-p97 fusion protein, in line with the hypothesis that VCF1/2 binding provides p97 with a strong additional cNLS promoting its efficient nuclear import. Taken together, the impact of VCF1/2 on the nuclear localization of p97 was consistently observed upon overexpression, CRISPR/Cas-mediated genomic deletion and siRNA-mediated de(p)letion, in different cell lines and under different experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, statistics presented are somewhat problematic at several points. In figure S4C the ** difference between vector and deNLS mutant make no sense (I think they should have been non-significant). Figure 7 make no sense to compare WT and KO cells (in panels B and C) if their original growth was different.

One-way ANOVA confirmed that the strong nuclear enrichment of p97 upon ectopic expression of all four full-length VCF1/2 proteins is highly statistically significant, whereas expression of NLS-deleted or p97 binding-deficient variants does not lead to a significant change in p97 localization in comparison to the vector control (new Figure 4C).</p><p>Regarding Figure 7BC, we actually did account for the growth difference of the WT and KO cells by normalizing growth separately for the WT and KO cells to the respective mean values at 0 nM CB-5083, as stated in the figure legend. We also explained this in the main text: &quot;Note that growth of both cell lines was normalized to their respective growth in the absence of CB-5083, thus taking account of the slower growth of the knockout cells under unperturbed conditions.&quot; Thus, the growth differences for the various drug concentrations are shown relative to the respective cell type, as requested by the reviewer. To do so, the absolute cell numbers for each condition were divided by the mean of the cell numbers in the absence of CB-5083 for the same cell type, resulting in relative growth (in %). These numbers are thus directly derived from cell numbers. In order to avoid confusion with growth rates, we renamed the y-axis in Figures 7BC to &quot;relative cell count (%)&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are the data and the methods presented in such a way that they can be reproduced?

In the corresponding experiments, overexpression of FAM104 species (Figures 4 and 5) in otherwise unperturbed cells is used. Because recruitment of p97/VCP to client proteins is thought to depend in large part on ubiquitylation, it is unclear how overexpression of FAM104 is sufficient to enhance nuclear/chromatin localization of VCP. Is nuclear/chromatin localization accompanied by changes in ubiquitylation and/or turnover of the corresponding proteins? In other words, does enhanced localization also correlate with increased activity, or could the enhanced nuclear/chromatin association also be explained by inhibited/captured p97/VCP?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Our data are consistent with the simple model that the FAM104 proteins VCF1/2 bind strongly to p97 and promote its nuclear import via their potent cNLS. In addition, VCF1 isoform 2 and particularly isoform 1 associate with nuclear chromatin independently of p97 (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A), suggesting that their affinity for chromatin drives the sequestration of p97 on chromatin. Thus, the observed effects on p97 localization appear to be the consequence of VCF1/2 protein localization and are therefore in the first instance independent of client proteins and their ubiquitylation state. As stated in the Discussion, FAM104 proteins in that respect resemble two other small p97 interactors combining a helical p97 binding motif with a localization feature, i.e. SVIP and VIMP, which recruit p97 to endo/lysosomes and the ER, respectively.</p><p>We also determined the effect of VCF1/2 overexpression on the co-IP of other cofactors and substrates with endogenous p97 (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C) and found that the strongly overexpressed VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2 efficiently outcompeted the major cofactors UFD1-NPL4 and p47 as well as bona fide polyubiquitylated substrates, while the much weaker expressed VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 did not interfere with cofactor binding and actually increased the association of ubiquitylated substrates with p97. In light of these results, we cannot exclude the possibility that the strong chromatin association of p97 seen upon ectopic expression of VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2 is caused by inhibited/captured p97. However, the much weaker ectopic expression of VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 clearly induces the nuclear accumulation of p97 (Figure 4AC) in the absence of adverse effects on p97 cofactor binding (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Moreover, de(p)letion of VCF1/2 clearly reduced the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic p97, indicating that endogenous VCF1/2 indeed promote the nuclear localization of p97.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors link the function of FAM104 proteins in nuclear targeting of p97/VCP to the absence of a unique NLS peptide.

All p97 homologs from yeast to mammals possess a relatively weak potential cNLS (K60R65 in human p97, score 5 according to cNLS mapper). Available three-dimensional structures of p97 suggest that this potential cNLS is part of a β-hairpin in the N domain that is unlikely to be constitutively exposed. In yeast Cdc48, an additional bi-partite cNLS closer to the N terminus has been experimentally validated (Madeo et al., MBoC 1998). Interestingly, this additional NLS is conserved in several p97 homologs from species lacking FAM104 proteins, but lost or poorly conserved in most p97 homologs from species possessing FAM104 proteins (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), consistent with the hypothesis that FAM104 proteins compensate for the loss of the functional bipartite cNLS in those p97 homologs. We obtained further experimental support for this hypothesis by fusing an efficient NLS peptide to p97 – see reply to point (3) below.</p><p>Analysis of potential NLS peptides in UFD1, NPL4, FAF1 and UBXN7 using cNLS mapper revealed a strongly predicted cNLS for UBXN7, which is not conserved in the yeast homolog Ubx5, but only weakly predicted or no cNLSs for the other cofactors.

To address this point, we fused the prototypical cNLS of SV40 to the N terminus of p97 and analyzed the effect on p97 localization and on cell growth. In the high content microscopic analysis shown in new Figure 6EF, VCF1-depleted cells showed a significantly reduced nuclear/cytoplasmic p97 ratio under control conditions. Importantly, this reduction was eliminated upon doxycycline-induced ectopic expression of the cNLS-p97 fusion protein, showing that the cNLS fusion can indeed compensate for the lack of VCF1/2. Unfortunately, we could not observe a similar compensation of the growth/drug sensitivity of VCF1/2 knockout cells (data not shown). It is possible that the stronger nuclear accumulation of p97 among expression of the cNLS-p97 fusion protein compared to control cells has adverse effects on cell growth, or that the N-terminal cNLS fusion interferes with normal p97 activity, among other possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Re (3) How does overexpression of FAM104 alter drug sensitivity compared to knock-out cell lines (Figure 7)?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we transfected a plasmid encoding the strongly expressed VCF1 isoform 1 into HEK293T cells, which can be more efficiently transfected than HeLa cells.

Are FAM104 protein levels stabilized under these conditions? Are FAM104 proteins differentially regulated (e.g., in terms of localization) under these conditions? Figure 3A suggests that FAM104 proteins may have a different function in relation to p97/VCP protein levels: FAM104A iso1/2 have lower p97/VCP protein levels than FAM104A iso5 and B iso3. The authors suggest that this is due to the solubility of p97/VCP. It should be clarified whether lower solubility equates to increased chromatin association.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Regarding the mechanism of p97 targeting to the nucleus and to chromatin, please see the first part of our reply to point 1 above.</p><p>Regarding VCF1/2 expression levels and regulation, we unfortunately were unable to analyze this on the protein level, because commercial antibodies detecting endogenous VCF1 or 2 are not available. (Please note that the antibodies available via the Human Proteome Atlas project detect either proteins of the wrong size (VCF2/FAM104B) or require ectopic expression of the specific target (VCF1/FAM104A).) Nevertheless, we were able to identify PCR primer pairs enabling the efficient and specific amplification of VCF1 isoform 1 and 2 cDNA. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that CB-5083 treatment indeed induced an up to two-fold increase in VCF1 expression (new Figure 7D), in line with an increased demand for VCF1/2 under conditions of limiting p97 activity. Intriguingly, the microscopic analysis shown in new Figure 7EF demonstrates that not only VCF1/2 deletion, but also CB-5083 treatment reduces nuclear p97 levels, and that both conditions have an additive effect, thereby providing a straightforward explanation for the synthetic growth defects observed in Figure 7BC.</p><p>Regarding the effect of ectopic expression of VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2 on the solubility of p97, we used an alternative fractionation protocol including a benzonase treatment step to solubilize chromatin-bound proteins. Comparing cells overexpressing VCF1 isoform 1 with control cells, we found that the majority of p97 is re-solubilized upon benzonase treatment, similar to VCF1 isoform1 itself and the chromatin-associated proteins MYC, MCM7 and UbH2B (new Figure 5B). We therefore conclude that the lower solubility of p97 upon overexpression of VCF1 isoform 1 (and, by extension, isoform 2) indeed reflects increased chromatin association. While we believe that the differences between VCF1 isoforms 1/2 versus VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 observed in the fractionation and IP experiments reflect the very strong differences in expression levels rather than intrinsically different functions in relation to p97, this interesting point remains to be addressed in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It remains unclear whether a FAM104-dependent shift in nuclear/chromatin-associated p97/VCP could also be a secondary compensatory effect versus functional impairment in FAM104 overexpression/de(p)letion.

We actually believe that the very strong accumulation of p97 on chromatin upon ectopic expression of VCF1 isoforms 1 and 2 (Figure 5) is likely to be unphysiological in light of their very high expression levels and of their massive impact on cofactor binding to p97 (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). However, we would like to emphasize that the nuclear (not chromatin) accumulation of p97 was also observed for the much more weakly expressed VCF1 isoform 5 and VCF2 isoform 3 under conditions of unperturbed p97-cofactor interactions (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C), strongly suggesting that the nuclear accumulation of p97 is the primary result of its tight binding to the nuclear VCF1/2 proteins. Even more importantly, the reduction in nuclear p97 upon de(p)letion of VCF1/2 is extremely unlikely to be a secondary effect, as one would have to postulate that loss of the nuclear VCF1/2 proteins would lead to a retention of p97 in the cytoplasm by some unclear mechanism. We think that the accumulated evidence strongly supports a direct regulatory function of VCF1/2 on the nuclear localization of p97 and is hardly compatible with the scenario that the observed relocalizations of p97 are merely secondary, compensatory effects of increased or reduced VCF1/2 levels, respectively.

However, the functional role of FAM104 proteins in p97/VCP biology remains unclear. Therefore, the authors need to further elaborate the physiological contribution of FAM104 proteins to p97/VCP function in additional experiments.

We performed additional experiments to characterize the synthetic defects of VCF1/2 knockout and p97 inhibition (new Figure 7EF). Importantly, we found that inhibitor treatment alone reduced nuclear p97 levels, and that loss of VCF1/2 led to a further decrease. These results indicate that the synthetic growth defects observed in Figure 7BC are caused by the even stronger reduction of nuclear p97 to an extent that is no longer compatible with viability. At the same time, we don´t think that VCF1/2 possess highly specific functions in one or few p97-dependent pathways, which is in line with our finding that VCF1/2 can not only bind to p97-UFD1-NPL4, but also to the p97-UBXN2B complex possessing distinct functions (Figures 3A; Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). In essence, we believe that the nuclear targeting of p97 in fact <italic>is</italic> the physiological function of VCF1/2, in analogy to similar small proteins that were recently shown to promote the nuclear import of the 20S proteasome and HUWE1.
