innate immune response and play a vital role in host defense against pathogens. Here we report a new antimicrobial peptide belonging to the cathelicidin family, cathelicidin-MH (cath-MH), from the skin of <italic>Microhyla heymonsivogt</italic> frog. Cath-MH has a single α-helical structure in membrane-mimetic environments and is antimicrobial against fungi and bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast to other cathelicidins, cath-MH suppresses coagulation by affecting the enzymatic activities of tissue plasminogen activator, plasmin, β-tryptase, elastase, thrombin, and chymase. Cath-MH protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis, effectively ameliorating multiorgan pathology and inflammatory cytokine through its antimicrobial, LPS-neutralizing, coagulation suppressing effects as well as suppression of MAPK signaling. Taken together, these data suggest that cath-MH is an attractive candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of septic shock.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antimicrobial peptides</kwd><kwd>cathelicidin</kwd><kwd>microhyla heymonsivogt</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31772476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Xueqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31861143050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Xueqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31911530077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Xueqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82070038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The novel cathelicidin cathelicidin-MH was identified from the skin of <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> frog, which protects against lipopolysaccharide- and cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis, effectively ameliorates multi-organ pathology, especially in lung.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Septic shock represents an unbalanced host response to infection and remains a major cause of death in intensive care units in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Severe sepsis is associated with tissue damage, abnormal coagulation and immune responses, and ‘cytokine storms’ triggered by inflammatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) is the main component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria which, as one of the most potent natural immunostimulatory compounds, plays a crucial role in sepsis and septic shock through hyperactivation of the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomao et al., 2012</xref>). LPS-stimulated endotoxemia is mediated by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), which causes overwhelming production of tissue-damaging cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Amersfoort et al., 2003</xref>). Despite decades of research, there are still no effective preventative therapies for sepsis-induced death, and with the rising incidence and mortality of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), new drugs to decrease the morbidity and mortality of septicemia are urgently required.</p><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a key first line of defense against pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varga et al., 2018</xref>). Cathelicidin is a family of AMPs present in monocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and epithelial cells in various mammalian species. Cathelicidins are derived from precursor proteins consisting of an N-terminal signaling peptide and a highly conserved cathelin domain in front of a C-terminal mature peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agier et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, cathelicidins, particularly those adopting helical structures in lipids, possess diverse biological activities including LPS neutralization, antioxidant, direct chemotaxis, and wound healing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). For example, the well-characterized human cathelicidin LL-37 inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis in sepsis-induced acute lung injury, macrophage activation and cytokine production, and endothelial cell apoptosis in Gram-negative infections and improves the survival of polybacterial septic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dürr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, cathelicidin represents an important therapeutic candidate for sepsis after traditional therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Cathelicidin-AL is the first amphibian cathelicidin identified in <italic>Amolops loloensis</italic> in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hao et al., 2012</xref>) and, since then, over 20 cathelicidin AMPs have been discovered in 11 amphibian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Microhyla heymonsivogt</italic> frogs mainly inhabit Southern China and survive in the wild by arming themselves with multiple biomolecules against various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varga et al., 2018</xref>), but no <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> AMP has yet been identified.</p><p>Since some amphibian cathelicidins have shown antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, we investigated whether <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> harbors a cathelicidin. We identified the novel cathelicidin cathelicidin-MH (cath-MH) from the skin of <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> frogs. Cath-MH contains one α-helix structure in membrane-mimetic environments and has favorable antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, LPS-binding, and protease interference activities. In addition, cath-MH markedly decreased the mortality and inhibited pathological abnormalities and inflammatory cytokine expression in tissues of LPS- and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic mice. Therefore, Cath-MH represents a novel potential anti-inflammatory therapy, particularly for bacterial sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and characterization of cath-MH</title><p>Based on PCR-based cDNA cloning, a novel AMP was obtained from the cDNA library derived from the skin of <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> frogs. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the 693 bp cDNA contained a complete open reading frame and the deduced amino acid precursor consisted of 172 amino acid residues including a predicted 22-residue signal peptide, a representative 105-residue cathelin domain, and a 39-residue mature peptide. NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis and multisequence alignment revealed that the cath-MH precursor had high sequence similarity with other members of the cathelicidin family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), containing four cysteine residues at the end of the cathelin domain and a highly variable C-terminal mature region. According to the amino acid sequences of known frog cathelicidins, the predicted mature cath-MH sequence (APCKLGCKIKKVKQKIKQKLKAKVNAVKTVIGKISEHLG) possessed 12 strongly basic residues distributed across the entire molecule, resulting in an 11 charge at pH 7.0. The molecular weight was 4.26 kDa, and isoelectric point was 10.32. Sequence alignment with other amphibian cathelicidins revealed that mature cath-MH also contained a typical intramolecular pentapeptide ring-forming disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, sequence alignment also demonstrated 22.5% sequence identity and 50% sequence similarity between cath-MH and human LL-37 (PDB ID: 5NMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sancho-Vaello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence characterization of cath-MH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of cath-MH.

Cath-MH was classified into the bottom cluster according to its phylogenetic relationships and was not closely related to other frog cathelicidins, indicating that it may have some different functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Secondary structure of cath-MH</title><p>The optimal concentration of cath-MH for crystallization was 2.719 mg/ml. The small trigonal-shaped crystals of the peptide were successfully grown under Crystal ScreenHT (Hampton Research) conditions of 2 M ammonium sulfate over 60 d at 277 K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While cath-MH crystals diffracted X-rays to 1.95 Å resolution, the crystal structure was solved at 2.20 Å resolution because the initial resolution did not provide a complete non-protein 2F<sub>o</sub> - F<sub>c</sub> electron density map. The peptide crystals belonged to the rhombohedral space group <italic>R</italic>32. The crystal asymmetric unit contained one molecule of the peptide with a solvent content of 41.76%. As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (PDB ID: 7AL0), the final cath-MH structure consisted of all 39 amino acid residues forming one α-helix composed of 31 amino acids (from L5 to S32) with two short loops marked as loop-1 and loop-2. Loop-1 was formed by the first four amino acids A1-K4 at the N-terminal part of the structure, and loop-2 contained the last four amino acids E36-G39 at the C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Non-protein electron density was interpreted as 13 water molecules and two chloride ions. The stabilization of the α-helical monomer was provided by a disulfide bridge formed from sulfur atoms of C3 and C7 and by several H-bonds between O atom C3 and Nζ atom K8 at 3.15 Å; between O atom Q25 and Oγ1 T29 at 2.70 Å; between O atom of I31 and Oγ S35 at 2.92 Å; and between Nζ K33 and Oε1 E36 at 2.68 Å distance. Further stabilization was realized by interactions between Sγ atom C3 with Nζ atom of K11; O atom of Q14 and Oε1 Q18; and Nζ atom of K17 and Nζ atom of K21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The monomer was more positively charged at the N-terminus than the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and shared high secondary structural similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, the X-ray structure revealed that the N-terminus was ordered in an α-helix and that a short loop formed from the first four residues due to disulfide bridge formation between the sulfur atoms of C3 and C7 and additional H-bond interactions provided by K11, Q14, Q18, K17, and K21 amino acid side chains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The secondary structure of cath-MH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the cath-MH structure with labeled N and C termini.

Multiorgan dysfunction or failure, including acute lung injury, is the most important pathological feature of sepsis. Over the past few decades, despite significant advances in the development of antimicrobial therapies and management strategies, sepsis has become a global health crisis and continues to be one of the main causes of death in intensive care units in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, new therapies to improve clinical outcomes from sepsis are urgently needed. Here, we identified cath-MH in the skin of <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> frogs and demonstrate that it may be a promising new candidate therapeutic for sepsis.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that some natural AMPs like cathelicidin with strong antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity may be excellent therapeutic candidates for sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coorens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giacometti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murakami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2019</xref>). NCBI BLAST analysis and multisequence alignment revealed that cath-MH is a cathelicidin peptide. Furthermore, CD and X-ray structural analyses showed that mature cath-MH assumes an primarily amphipathic α-helical structure in membrane-mimicking environments and LPS solutions, which is a common structural characteristic of most cathelicidins from tailless amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agier et al., 2015</xref>). Adopting such a helical shape during membrane interactions allows unilateral segregation of its hydrophobic residues and results in membrane penetration, transmembrane pore formation, and bacterial lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dürr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sancho-Vaello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement, our antimicrobial mechanistic study showed that cath-MH permeates negatively charged bacterial membranes and disrupts membrane integrity, thereby killing bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>As a trigger of inflammation and the dysregulated host response in sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomao et al., 2012</xref>), circulating LPS is known to induce extensive pro-inflammatory cytokine expression including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which contribute to the pathophysiology of endotoxic shock such as tissue injury, capillary leakage, circulatory failure, and multiorgan dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Amersfoort et al., 2003</xref>). Like LL-37, OL-CATH2, Lf-CATH1, cathelicidin-PP, cathelicidin-PY, and cathelicidin-RC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dürr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), our compelling evidence demonstrates that cath-MH can neutralize LPS and inactivate bacterial pathogens. Thus, it was rational to speculate that cath-MH, like LL-37, can effectively protect against sepsis-induced death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dürr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murakami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scott et al., 2002</xref>). In agreement, cath-MH reduced mortality and tissue damage in LPS-induced septic mice. Concurrently, LPS-induced transcription and production of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in tissues were also markedly decreased by cath-MH. Intriguingly, cath-MH particularly inhibited lung injury in LPS-induced septic mice, although it also had positive effects in other organs. Previous studies have shown that sepsis-induced lung dysfunction leads to the complete failure of other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matute-Bello et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, CLP results in polymicrobial infection of the peritoneal cavity that can lead to sepsis, major organ failure, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rittirsch et al., 2009</xref>), and the inflammatory response in CLP septic mice is similar to that in patients with sepsis. Consistent with the results in LPS-induced sepsis models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), cath-MH decreased the mortality, lung injury, inflammatory cytokine expression, and inflammatory cell infiltration in CLP septic mice. Overall, these results show that cath-MH is strongly protective against sepsis-induced organ dysfunction such as acute lung injury.</p><p>It is generally accepted that TLR signaling contributes to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in endotoxic shock induced by LPS through activation of downstream MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leifer and Medvedev, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomao et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this mechanism, cath-MH significantly suppressed the activation of MAPKs in all tested organs. However, similar to the differential effects of black mulberry leaf or pulp extracts on TNF-α protein and mRNA expression in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Pádua Lúcio et al., 2018</xref>), TNF-α protein expression was not increased by LPS or inhibited by cath-MH. Host responses to infection are compartmentalized and cytokines undergo post-transcriptional modifications, which may be responsible for the observed differences in TNF-α protein and mRNA expression in the liver during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Pádua Lúcio et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, our results suggest that the protective effect of cath-MH in experimental sepsis models is associated with LPS binding and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by blocking MAPK signaling.</p><p>Although both LL-37 and cath-MH share high secondary structural similarity and can protect mice from lethal endotoxic shock, LL-37 displays low sequence identity with cath-MH and lacks loop2 at the C-terminus as well as a disulfide bridge at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, different to any other known cathelicidins from frogs, more residues in cath-MH are extended in the C-terminus of the disulfide bridge and the KVKQ sequence is in the interval between the conserved K10 and KIK16 residues. Finally, compared to cathelicidin-PY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2013</xref>), cath-MH contains a larger helix and five extra hydrogen bonds. Thus, cath-MH might have extra functions to other known cathelicidins. Surprisingly, our results show that cath-MH can inhibit plasma coagulation and tPA, plasmin, thrombin, β-tryptase, and elastase while increasing the activity of chymase, which has not been shown for other cathelicidins. Sepsis is almost invariably associated with coagulation abnormalities that facilitate the recruitment of profibrinolytic enzymes such as uPA, tPA, and plasmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, a lack of human chymase and its homolog in mouse mast cells can increase FXIIIA expression and activity and decrease bleeding time during sepsis. Therefore, fibrinolytic enzymes and chymase closely correlate with disease severity and fatality in sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zeerleder et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, neutrophil elastase is associated with pulmonary endothelial injury under LPS-induced endotoxemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2019</xref>), and inhibitors such as sivelestat can attenuate sepsis-related acute tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, β-tryptase promotes early pulmonary fibrosis in sepsis-induced lung injury and anti-tryptase treatment has a therapeutic effect in experimental colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Isozaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villar et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, inhibiting coagulation with anticoagulants like antithrombin is beneficial for patients with severe infection and sepsis in experimental and initial clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levi and van der Poll, 2017</xref>). Given the observed anticoagulation effect and protease inhibition/promotion activities of cath-MH, we cannot exclude that these functions also contributed to its anti-sepsis role in vivo. Taken together, all these findings support that cath-MH, with multiple functions, can effectively protect mice from LPS- and CLP-induced death and injury and is therefore a suitable candidate therapeutic for bacterial sepsis.</p><p>Cath-MH forms aggregates and stable dimers in solution and lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, unlike other AMPs, it is protected from proteolytic degradation, similar to LL-37, the only cathelicidin peptide in humans, cleaved from a human cationic antimicrobial polypeptide of 18 kDa (hCAP18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dürr et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, synthetic LL-37 is rapidly degraded in periodontitis gingival crevicular fluid, restricting its application as a potential therapeutic in the gingival crevice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCrudden et al., 2013</xref>). In purified human lung mast cells, β-tryptase rapidly cleaves LL-37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schiemann et al., 2009</xref>). Since it inhibits or activates proteases, cath-MH is likely to have advantages over LL-37 as an anti-sepsis molecule.</p><p>In conclusion, cath-MH from the skin of <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> frogs contains single α-helix structure in membrane-mimetic environments and favorable antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, LPS-binding, and protease-inhibiting activities. In addition, cath-MH markedly decreases the mortality, pathological alterations, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in LPS- and CLP-induced septic mice by killing microorganisms, neutralizing LPS, and suppressing MAPK signaling and potentially by interfering with coagulation. Taken together, multi-functional cath-MH may serve as a potent potential therapeutic agent for sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ethical statement</title><p>Male and female adult <italic>M. heymonsivogt</italic> frogs (n = 3), which are not an endangered or protected species, were captured from the countryside of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China (23.12°N, 113.28°E) without the need for specific permissions.

The experiment was repeated three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>SPRi assay</title><p>The PlexArrayTM HT A100 system (Plexera LLC, Bothell, Washington, DC) with bare gold SPRi chip (Nanocapture gold chip, with a gold layer of 47.5 nm thickness) was used to explore the real-time binding reaction of cath-MH with proteases, plasma, LPS, and <sc>d</sc>-(+)-galacturonic acid as described in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, 8.52 mg/ml cath-MH dissolved in PBS was spotted in multiplex onto the gold chip surface before incubating overnight in a 4°C humid box according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The SPRi chip was mounted on the instrument after being washed with PBS and blocking with 1 M ethanolamine/H<sub>2</sub>O solution (pH 8.5) for 30 min. The following program was used to complete the SPRi procedure: stabilizing baseline with PBS; flowing over the chip with the indicated concentrations of proteases, plasma, LPS, or <sc>d</sc>-(+)-galacturonic acid as the analytes, respectively; washing the chip with PBS, and regenerating the chip with glycine buffer (pH 2.0). Data were analyzed with the PLEXEA data analysis module and ORIGINLab software (OriginLab). The 1:1 Langmuir model of kinetics fitting from three different concentrations was used to calculate the average kinetics of different complexes, and the values from three different spots were used to compute standard deviations. The K<sub>d</sub> was obtained on the basis of kinetic constants counted by curve-fitting association and dissociation rates to real-time binding and washing data. The experiment was repeated three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>LPS neutralization assay</title><p>To explore whether LPS could inhibit the antimicrobial activity of cath-MH against <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, CFU assays were carried out as reported previously with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). In short, LPS at graded concentrations of 0–150 μM was mixed with 0.5×, 1×, 2×, and 3× MICs of cath-MH for 30 min at room temperature. The mixtures were separately added into 96-well plates with 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml <italic>B. subtilis</italic> at log-growth phase. One hour after incubation at 37°C, aliquots were sucked out and serially diluted for spreading on MH agar plates. Viable colonies were counted after the plates had been incubated at 37°C for 16 hr. The LPS without peptide incubation was used as negative control, and all experiments were repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Plasma recalcification time determination</title><p>The anticoagulant activity of cath-MH was measured by the recalcification time of normal human platelet-free plasma as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, blood was collected from heathy humans with single-use evacuated tubes for blood specimen collection (Jiangsu Yuli Medical Equipment Co., Ltd, China) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Serial concentrations of cath-MH (0.4–53 μg/ml) in 50 μl of 0.15 M NaCl were pre-incubated with 50 μl of normal human plasma at 37°C for 5 min, and 50 μl of 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to initiate clotting reactions. The clotting time was monitored at 405 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland). 0.15 M NaCl was used as a negative control. All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Enzyme inhibition assay</title><p>Enzyme inhibition assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assumpção et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, cath-MH (4.26 μg/ml) was pre-incubated with elastase, chymase, trypsin type III, trypsin type II, thrombin, protease 3, FXIIa, FXIa, FXa, β-tryptase, kallikrein, plasmin, or tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) for 10 min before adding the corresponding substrates at 250 mM final concentration. The hydrolysis rate of the fluorescent substrate was measured with a Tecan Infinite M200 96-well plate fluorescence reader (Tecan Group Ltd) at 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission wavelengths with a cutoff at 435 nm. The linear fit of the fluorescence increase as a function of time was demonstrated with Magellan Data Analysis Software (Tecan Group Ltd, Männedorf, Switzerland). The observed substrate hydrolysis rate in the presence of cath-MH was compared with that without peptide, which was considered 100% enzyme activity. The different buffers and concentrations of enzymes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. All assays were performed at 30°C in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Bleeding time</title><p>The bleeding time of cath-MH was measured by a tail transection method as described in our previous study with minor modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, 1 hr after treatment with either tested 5 mg/kg cath-MH or saline water, mice were maintained in a immobilization cage that keeps the tail steady and immersed in 0.9% isotonic saline at 37°C. After 2 min, a distal 2 mm segment of the tail was severed with a razor blade. For the bleeding time of CLP-induced septic mice, the tails were cut down 5 mm at 24 after CLP. The tail was immediately re-immersed in warm saline with the tip of all tails 5 cm below the body. The bleeding time was defined as the time required for the stream of blood to cease. The end point was the arrest of bleeding lasting more than 30 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>LPS-induced sepsis in mice</title><p>Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal LPS injection (25 mg/kg) into female BALB/c mice except those in the control group 1 hr before cath-MH (5 mg/kg), dexamethasone (10 mg/kg), or PBS were intraperitoneally administered into septic mice at random. The clinical manifestations of endotoxic shock and mortality were recorded for up to 72 hr after LPS injection. In further experiments, another set of mice were injected and grouped as described above and their lungs, livers, and kidneys surgically isolated 12 hr after LPS injection for macroscopic scoring and ELISA, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and histopathological experiments. The histological injury score criteria were as follows: vascular congestion, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration for lungs; portal inflammation, hepatocellular necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration for livers; and vacuolization and cast formation for kidneys. Each indicator was graded on a scale of 0–3 denoting ‘absent’, ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, and ‘severe’. The total injury score was the sum of all indicators (a maximum of 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>MPO determination</title><p>MPO activity was determined according to our previous paper with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kotsyfakis et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, tissues from septic mice were weighed and homogenized in 50 mM PBS, pH 6.0, containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide at 4°C. The samples were freeze-thawed three times followed by sonification and then centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. Ten microliter supernatants were added into 96-well plates and treated with 90 μl of 50 mM PBS containing 0.167 mg/ml o-dianisidine dihydrochloride and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. In parallel, dilutions of pure MPO (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to construct a standard curve. The absorbance at 460 nm was determined with a microplate reader. MPO activity in the tissues was shown as units of enzyme/g of tissue. A unit of MPO activity was defined as that catalyzing 1 µM of hydrogen peroxide to water in 1 min at 22°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>Lung, liver, and kidney tissues were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.

Briefly, six week old BALB/c mice with eight animals in each group were weighed and intraperitoneally anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine plus 8 mg/kg xylazine. The cecum on the left side of the abdomen was isolated under a sterile environment and then was tightly ligated about 1 cm from the end before puncturing two holes in the middle with 22-gauge needles. Subsequently, the cecum was squeezed gently to exteriorize a small amount of feces before returning it to the abdominal cavity. The abdomen was sewn up and then prewarmed 0.9% NaCl (50 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously to complete resuscitation after the operation. At the same time, a lamp was used to warm the animals for 30 min. cath-MH (5 mg/kg) and PBS were intraperitoneally administered into septic mice at random 1 hr after the operation, respectively. Then, mice were placed in cages with access to food and water for 3 days observation. In further experiments, another set of mice were prepared as described above, and blood and lung tissues were collected 24 hr after surgery for histopathological analysis, dry/wet weight ratios, pathological scoring, and cytokine assays. Sham operation mice were used as negative controls without CLP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Acute toxicity in vivo</title><p>Briefly, six week old BALB/c mice were weighed and randomly divided into three groups with six animals each, and cath-MH (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) and PBS were intraperitoneally administered into mice of different groups.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Chai et al describe the identification, structural elucidation, antimicrobial and antiseptic mechanism of a new cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, heymonin, which was identified from the skin of the frog Microhyla heymonsivogt. The authors show that heymonin suppresses coagulation by affecting the enzymatic activities of tissue plasminogen activator, plasmin, β-tryptase, elastase, thrombin, and chymase, and protects against LPS and CLP-induced sepsis, effectively ameliorating inflammatory response and inflammatory damage in mice through its antimicrobial activity, LPS-neutralizing effect and suppression of MAPK signaling pathway. The study is designed carefully and reports a new cathelicidin with a somewhat unusual function in that it can modulate enzymatic activities of blood components and exhibits a very potent anti-septic shock potential comparable to dexamethasone.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>• It seems that the binding affinity (Kd) between Heymonin and D-(+)-galacturonic acid is stronger than that with LPS in ITC assay but is converse in SPR assay, the authors should explain the reason.</p><p>• The structure data is not closely associated with its function related with sepsis. Primary structural analysis indicated that heynonin possesses 12 basic residues. Secondary structural analysis indicated that heynonin mainly adopts α-helical conformation. Are these structural characterizations responsible for its activities? The current work lacks structure-activity relationship study.</p><p>• According to authors description, severe sepsis is associated with abnormal coagulation and it seems that Heymonin can reverse this abnormal process in vivo during the treatment of septic mice. However, the evidence is lack although authors demonstrated that Heymonin can dose-dependently inhibit plasma coagulation in vitro.

ITC and SPR are different technique to examine binding reaction. ITC is a biophysical technique directly characterizing the heat change of binding interactions in solution. However, SPR is a powerful tool monitoring dynamic process of binding and degradation of the reaction between solid and liquid phases (Du X, et al.,2016). Therefore, the interaction between solid and liquid phases is inevitably different with one between two liquid phases. Thus, it is normal to have different binding affinity values measured by two experimental methods, which were also reported by some researchers (Yujia He 2021, Chen, et al.,2014). For example, Yujia He et al. reported that the Kd values of myosin and Hexanal /Octanal detected by SPR were both 5.9 ± 3.9 M ×10<sup>−5</sup>. However, they obtained by ITC were 55.9 ± 15.1 M ×10<sup>−5</sup> and 26.0 ±1.0 M ×10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively. Thus, we think it reasonable for the discrepancy of dissociation constants from two different assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The structure data is not closely associated with its function related with sepsis. Primary structural analysis indicated that heynonin possesses 12 basic residues. Secondary structural analysis indicated that heynonin mainly adopts α-helical conformation. Are these structural characterizations responsible for its activities? The current work lacks structure-activity relationship study.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your valuable and meaningful comments about our manuscript. Sepsis is a fatal disease, characterized by multiple organ failure. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a crucial role in sepsis and septic shock through hyperactivation of the innate immune system. Heymonin (cath-MH) primarily adopted an amphipathic α-helical structure in membrane-mimicking environments and LPS solutions, which is a common structural characteristic of most cathelicidins from tailless amphibians (Agier et al., 2015). By contrast to defensins, cathelicidin family of AMPs, particularly those who adopt helical structures in lipids, were demonstrated to possess antimicrobial and LPS neutralization activity (Durr et al.,2006; Gennaro et al.,2000; Hirata et al.,1994). Sequence alignment demonstrated 50% sequence similarity between Heymonin (cath-MH) and human LL-37. However, human LL-37 has multifunction. Heymonin (cath-MH) contained more loop than LL-37 in their spatial structure. Generally, the loop structure is assumed to play more role for maintaining extra functions. For example, SMAP-29 contains multiple binding sites and a central hinge which cooperatively to bind LPS with high affinity (B.F. et al.2002).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• According to authors description, severe sepsis is associated with abnormal coagulation and it seems that Heymonin can reverse this abnormal process in vivo during the treatment of septic mice. However, the evidence is lack although authors demonstrated that Heymonin can dose-dependently inhibit plasma coagulation in vitro. If they can prove its anti-coagulation effects with tail bleeding experiment in vivo, it will be perfect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your meaningful suggestion. We have added this experiment in the revised version. As showed in Figure 8—figure supplement 1, the bleeding time of CLP-induced septic mice decreased significantly compared to the control, and Heymonin (cath-MH) treatment group could reverse this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The author must point out the unique difference between Heymonin and other cathelicidin through data analysis or background search.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kindly suggestions. As shown in the following table, Cathelicidins have been shown to kill microbes, neutralize LPS and modulate the activation of several toll-like-receptor (TLR) ligands. Different to any other known cathelicidins from frogs, as shown in Figure 1C, more residues in Heymonin (cath-MH) are extended after the C-terminus of the disulfide bridge and the KVKQ sequence is in the interval between the conserved K10 and KIK16 residues. Furthermore, compared to cathelicidin-PY (Wei et al.,2013) and cathelicidin-RC1 (Ling et al.,2014), Heymonin (cath-MH) contains a larger helix and extra hydrogen bonds. However, compared to LL-37, Heymonin (cath-MH) has an extra loop at its C-terminus (Dürr et al.,2006). The predicted structures of Hc-CATH (Wei et al.,2015) and cathelicidin-RC2 (Ling et al.,2014) exhibit a helix-strand-helix conformation. In addition, cathelicidin-PP mainly adopts a β-sheet structure with a small α-helix (Mu et al.,2017). All of them also are different from Heymonin (cath-MH). Due to its difference in spatial structure with other Cathelicidins, Heymonin (cath-MH) has extra functions to other known cathelicidins such as inhibitory activity of serine proteases.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>The structure and function of different cathelicidins.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Peptide</th><th>Origin</th><th>Amino acid sequence</th><th>#AA</th><th>Function</th><th>Ref.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Heymonin</td><td>Frog Microhyla heymonsivogt</td><td>APCKLGCKIKKVKQKIKQKLKAKVNAVKTVIGKISEHLG</td><td>39</td><td>antimicrobial activity; LPS <break/>neutralization; Sepsis therapeutic efficacy; Serine protease inhibitory activity</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>cathelicidin-PY</td><td>frog Paa yunnanensis</td><td>RKCNFLCKLKEKLRTVITSHIDKVLRPQG</td><td>29</td><td>antimicrobial activity; LPS neutralization; anti-inflammatory</td><td>(Wei et al., 2013)</td></tr><tr><td>human LL-37</td><td>human</td><td>LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES</td><td>37</td><td>antimicrobial activity; LPS neutralization; anti- inflammatory; wound healing and angiogenesis; Sepsis therapeutic efficacy; platelet activation induction</td><td>(Durr et al., 2006)</td></tr><tr><td>Hc-CATH</td><td>sea snake Hydrophis cyanocinctus</td><td>KFFKRLLKSVRRAVKKFRKKPRLIGLSTLL</td><td>30</td><td>antimicrobial activity; LPS neutralization; anti-inflammatory</td><td>(Wei et al., 2005)</td></tr><tr><td>chicken CATH-2</td><td>Chicken</td><td>RFGRFLRKIRRFRPKVTITIQGSARG</td><td>26</td><td>antimicrobial activity; immunomodulatory</td><td>(Kraaij et al., 2020)</td></tr><tr><td>cathelicidin-PP</td><td>tree frog Polypedates puerensis</td><td>ASENGKCNLLCLVKKKLRAVGNVIKTVVGKIA</td><td>32</td><td>antimicrobial activity; <break/>LPS neutralization; anti-inflammatory</td><td>(Mu L et al., 2017)</td></tr><tr><td>cathelicidin-RC1</td><td>Bullfrog Rana <break/>Catesbeiana</td><td>KKCKFFCKVKKKIKSIGFQIPIVSIPFK</td><td>28</td><td>antimicrobial activity</td><td>(Ling et al., 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Cathelicidin-RC2</td><td>Bullfrog Rana <break/>Catesbeiana</td><td>KKCGFFCKLKNKLKSTGSRSNIAAGTHGGTFRV</td><td>33</td><td>weak antimicrobial activity</td><td>(Ling et al., 2014)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors said that the putative cleavage site of the mature heynonin was based on the known frog cathelicidins, and the putative cleavage site of the mature heynonin was between Gly and Ala.

The proteolytic maturation is necessary for cathelicidin to manifest its antimicrobial activity (Cole et al., 2001). For mammalian sequences, this cleavage usually occurs through the action of elastase at a valine or alanine or isoleucine. However, other elastase-sensitive sites also exist (Shinnar et al., 2003). For amphibian, most mature bioactive peptides are generated from the precursor by cleavage at a classical -KR- cleavage site located proximal to the N-terminus. But partial peptides are cleaved from their precursors by -RR- or -KK- cleavage sites. Compared with other cathelicidins, most mature peptides are released after the four residues following -KR- cleavage site (Xu and Lai, 2015). In addition, the analysis of physicochemical parameters has showed that the mature peptide of Heymonin (cath-MH) is more positive charged than the sequence with extra more four residues after -KR- cleavage site. With the high cationicity, AMPs can exhibit the initial electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bacterial membrane components (Takahashi et al., 2010). Based on these analysis, we predicted the sequence of mature peptide is APCKLGCKIKKVKQKIKQKLKAKVNAVKTVIGKISEHLG, which is demonstrated right by function assays with synthetized peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The antimicrobial activity of heynonin (Supplementary file 1D) and bacterial killing kinetics of heynonin (Supplementary file 1E) are important results of the study, and I suggest the authors move these results to Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion and we have moved these tables as supplement to Figure 4 and renamed it as Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Both circular dichroism analysis of heynonin and crystal structural analysis of heynonin are secondary structural analysis.

Different to any other known cathelicidins from frogs, more residues in Heymonin (cath-MH) are extended in the C-terminus of the disulfide bridge and the KVKQ sequence is in the interval between the conserved K10 and KIK16 residues. In addition, compared to cathelicidin-PY (Wei et al.,2013), Heymonin (cath-MH) contains a larger helix and five extra hydrogen bonds. Thus, Heymonin (cath-MH) might have extra functions to other known amphibian cathelicidins. The Heymonin (cath-MH) functions in vivo as inhibitors of serine protease formation. Human LL-37 is also known to inhibit physiological processes by attacking more than one activating pathway simultaneously (Su et al., 2016) which is associated with a serial of proteases. Different with LL-37, Heymonin (cath-MH) contains an extra loop at C-terminus. Generally, the loop structure is assumed to play more role for maintaining extra functions. The peptide may, therefore, display different activity against enzymes. Of course, we also cannot rule out the possibility that Heymonin (cath-MH) can target to specific location by other way.</p><p>The protein docking between Heymonin (cath-MH) and chymase or thrombin were performed by the ZDOCK server and analyzed by PyMOL software, the results showed that Heymonin (cath-MH) can bind both chymase and thrombin by hydrogen bonding (Figure 1A). However, Heymonin (cath-MH) can bind the surface of chymase which is different with other chymase inhibitors, such as sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 (Li, et al.,2020). However, Heymonin (cath-MH) is in close contact with multiple residues in exosite-I (one of prominent active site cleft of thrombin) as depicted in Figure 1B (Koh, et al.,2011). For the complex of Heymonin (cath-MH) and thrombin, the residues, Lys13, Lys19, Val30 and Ile34 of Heymonin (cath-MH) can form five hydrogen bonds with Asp60, Gln151, Arg75 and Arg78 of the thrombin. In addition, the Lys23 residues of Heymonin (cath-MH) can form four hydrogen bonds (Arg73, Trp141, Glu192 and Asn143) with thrombin residues. Heymonin (cath-MH) bound to the thrombin active site surfaces that interact with substrate residues because the inhibitory site peptide already occupied an external site, which inhibited blood coagulation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Model comparison of Heymonin (cath-MH) bound to chymase (A) and thrombin (B).</title><p>Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to examine the binding interactions of Heymonin (cath-MH) using models generated from the existing X-ray crystal structures of chymase (PDB ID 4AG1) and thrombin (PDB ID 4UD9).

The hemolysis and toxicity of Heymonin (cath-MH).</p><p>The results showed that Heymonin (cath-MH) had no hemolysis effect in red blood cells from mice and its hemolysis rate was 2.64 ± 1.40 at a concentration of 212.77 μg/ml. In order to evaluate the acute toxicity of Heymonin (cath-MH) to mice, the blood biochemical analyses of normal mice inoculated with PBS or Heymonin (cath-MH) were conducted, and the histopathological changes of mice tissues were examined. As depicted in Figure 8—figure supplement 2B-E, there were no significant differences in serum levels of AST, ALT, BUN and Cr between the two groups after 24 hr and 48 hr inoculation. Furthermore, no significantly histopathological changes were observed in tissues of lung, liver and kidney between the control and Heymonin (cath-MH)-treated mice (Figure 8—figure supplement 2F). All mice survived and appeared healthy without any abnormal behavior and obvious differences in body weight gain between the two groups during the 7-days observation period (data not shown). Therefore, the injected Heymonin (cath-MH) dose, 10 mg/kg caused no or little acute toxicity to mice, there were no significantly histopathological changes in tissues between the control and Heymonin (cath-MH)-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In order to elucidate the binding reaction of heymonin with LPS and D-(+)-galacturonic acid are specific, an isotype peptide (scrambled heymonin) should be introduced in bacterial agglutination tests, ITC assay, and SPRi assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your valuable and meaningful comments about our manuscript.
