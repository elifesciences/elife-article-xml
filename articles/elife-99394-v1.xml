factor-β (TGF-β) family, including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Here, we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks (identified by modEncode) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes. At a genome-wide scale, SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in <italic>sma-9</italic> partially suppress the small body size phenotype of <italic>sma-3,</italic> suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase <italic>dpy-11</italic>. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Growth and development depend on the ability of cells to communicate through an intricate ballet of molecular signals that determine cell behaviors. Signaling proteins belonging to the BMP family, in particular, play an important role by activating certain ‘transcription factors’, known as Smad proteins, which then bind to specific DNA sequences to switch target genes on or off. The activity of these BMP-activated transcription factors is modulated by other molecular partners – Schnurri, for instance, is a well-known transcription factor partner of Smad. Still, exactly how Smad and Schnurri interact to control the expression of genes across the genome, and thereby execute complex biological programs, has remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate this question, Vora, Dietz et al. examined how Smad and Schnurri partner to regulate body size during the development of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a transparent, non-parasitic worm widely used in research. Various genomic techniques were used to reveal where on the genome the transcription factors could bind, as well as to track resulting changes in gene expression. Software approaches were then adapted to combine these datasets, showing that Smad and Schnurri have both shared and independent targets. The two proteins usually cooperate to activate gene expression, but they sometimes antagonize each other’s functions. Finally, analyses showed that Smad and Schnurri help control body size by regulating the secretion of collagen. This protein is the primary component of the cuticle, a flexible external layer that shields the worms from the environment as well as determines their bodies’ shape and size. Overall, the work by Vora, Dietz et al. demonstrates that previous models for Smad and Schnurri interactions were incomplete, paving the way for further research into these proteins and their role in development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Smad</kwd><kwd>Schnurri</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>body size</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15GM112147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savage-Dunn</surname><given-names>Cathy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG075315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rongo</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Savage-Dunn</surname><given-names>Cathy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM130351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM101972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rongo</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Smad and Schnurri transcription factors engage in context-dependent interactions as well as independent genomic activities, leading to regulation of collagen secretion to mediate body size regulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Members of the TGF-β family of secreted ligands play numerous roles in development and disease. In humans, there are 33 ligand genes that can be broadly separated into two subfamilies: the TGF-β/Activin subfamily and the BMP subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Massagué, 1998</xref>). Due to the conservation of these ligands and their signaling pathways across metazoans, genetic studies in invertebrate systems have been instrumental in identifying signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Savage et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sekelsky et al., 1995</xref>). Canonical signaling occurs when ligand dimers bind to transmembrane receptors generating a heterotetrameric complex consisting of two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Following ligand binding and complex assembly, the constitutively active type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor on the GS domain and thereby activates its kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wrana et al., 1994</xref>). The activated type I receptor phosphorylates the C-terminus of intracellular receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), promoting their heterotrimeric complex formation with co-Smads. The heterotrimeric Smad complex accumulates in the nucleus and binds DNA directly to elicit changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrana et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Estevez et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chacko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Souchelnytskyi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdollah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lagna et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicolás et al., 2004</xref>). Co-Smads for all ligands and R-Smads for TGF-β/Activin ligands bind a 4 bp GTCT Smad Binding Element (SBE); furthermore, R-Smads for BMP ligands associate with GC-rich sequences (GC-SBE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rushlow et al., 2001</xref>). The SBE is considered too degenerate and low affinity to account fully for binding specificity, so transcription factor partners likely contribute to target gene selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill, 2016</xref>). To date, only a few direct target genes of Smads have been extensively studied, including <italic>Drosophila brinker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pyrowolakis et al., 2004</xref>); Xenopus <italic>mixer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Germain et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>Xvent2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2006</xref>); and the mammalian <italic>ATF3</italic> and <italic>Id</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2003</xref>). Genome-wide studies have the potential to expand these examples and elucidate general principles of target gene selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deignan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morikawa et al., 2011</xref>). More of these studies are needed to understand how Smad transcriptional partners influence target gene selection and contribute to the execution of specific biological functions.</p><p>In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> a BMP signaling cascade initiated by the ligand DBL-1 plays a major role in body size regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suzuki et al., 1999</xref>). In nematodes, body size is constrained by a collagen-rich cuticle, which is secreted by an epidermal layer (the hypodermis) and remodeled over four successive molts during larval growth and then continuously during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazetic and Fay, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Page and Johnstone, 2007</xref>). DBL-1 signals through type I receptor SMA-6, type II receptor DAF-4, and Smads SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4 (founding members of the Smad family), which act together in the hypodermis to promote body size growth during the earliest larval growth stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gumienny and Savage-Dunn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). The exact mechanism by which the DBL-1 pathway regulates body size is not fully understood, but is known to involve the regulated synthesis of cuticular collagen, of which there are over 170 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madaan et al., 2018</xref>). A complete understanding of how DBL-1 regulates body size will require the identification of all direct transcriptional targets of the pathway during larval growth.</p><p>In addition to body size, the DBL-1 pathway also regulates male tail patterning, mesodermal lineage specification, innate immunity, and lipid metabolism. A transcription factor partner for this pathway, SMA-9, has been identified that plays a role in each of these biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foehr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike for the core components of the signaling pathway, however, loss of SMA-9 function can result in a different effect depending on the phenotype, suggesting that this factor can either be an equivalent co-factor, a factor with a more limited role, or an antagonistic factor depending on the specific function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foehr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2018a</xref>). SMA-9 is the homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schnurri<italic>,</italic> which was identified for its roles in Dpp/BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Staehling-Hampton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieder et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 1995</xref>). Three vertebrate Schnurri homologs regulate immunity, adipogenesis, and skeletogenesis, acting through both BMP-dependent and BMP-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Glimcher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinfeld et al., 2016</xref>). Schnurri proteins are very large transcription factors with multiple Zn-finger domains. At the <italic>brinker</italic> locus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the <italic>Xvent2</italic> locus in Xenopus, binding of an R-Smad and a Co-Smad with a precise 5 bp spacing between binding sites has been shown to recruit Schnurri, which controls the direction of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2006</xref>). This model for Smad-Schnurri interaction has not been tested at a genomic scale.</p><p>In this study, we use BETA software to combine RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets for SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri to identify direct versus indirect target genes of these factors, as well as to identify common versus unique targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vora et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis of <italic>sma-3; sma-9</italic> double mutants further extends our understanding of how these factors interact to produce locus-specific effects on target genes. We use GO term analysis and loss-of-function studies that shed light on the downstream effectors for body size regulation, lipid metabolism, and innate immunity. Finally, we use a ROL-6::wrmScarlet reporter for collagen synthesis and secretion to show that SMA-3, SMA-9, and the transcriptional target gene DPY-11 regulate body size growth by promoting the secretion and delivery of collagen into the cuticle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription factors SMA-3 and SMA-9 bind overlapping and distinct genomic sites</title><p>Smads and Schnurri are known to bind DNA as a physical complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Müller et al., 2003</xref>), but a limitation of the previous work is that only a small number of specific target genes were analyzed. We sought to determine the extent to which these factors act together or independently by identifying the binding sites of SMA-3 and SMA-9 on a genome-wide scale. We generated GFP-tagged transgenes for SMA-3 and SMA-9, and then demonstrated that they are functional, as evidenced by their ability to rescue the mutant phenotypes of respective loss-of-function <italic>sma-3</italic> and <italic>sma-9</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foehr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2018a</xref>). We provided these constructs to the modENCODE/modERN consortium, which then analyzed genome binding via ChIP-seq at the second larval (L2) stage, a developmental stage at which a Smad reporter is highly active, and both SMA-3 and SMA-9 are first observed to affect body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kudron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). ChIP sequencing reads identified 4205 peaks for GFP::SMA-3 and 7065 peaks for SMA-9::GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although these data were previously released publicly as part of the modENCODE/modERN consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kudron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>), our examination here provides the first comprehensive analysis of these datasets.</p><p>Because Smads and Schnurri are known to form a complex on DNA, we sought to determine the frequency with which SMA-3 and SMA-9 bind together at a genome-wide scale by analyzing the distances between the centroids of SMA-3 and SMA-9 ChIP-seq peaks. If SMA-3 and SMA-9 bind independently, then we would expect a Gaussian distribution of inter-centroid distances, whereas if they frequently bind in a complex, we should see a non-Gaussian distribution with increased representation of distances less than or equal to the average peak size. This analysis demonstrated an increased representation (approaching 45%) of inter-centroid distances of 100 bp or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>), smaller than the average peak size for SMA-3 (400 bp) or SMA-9 (250 bp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), consistent with the interpretation that SMA-3 and SMA-9 frequently bind as either subunits in a complex or in close vicinity to each other along the DNA. The midpoint of the cumulative probability distribution of inter-centroid distances was 788 bp; by contrast, a randomization of the positions of SMA-3 and SMA-9 ChIP peaks expanded the midpoint of the cumulative probability distribution of inter-centroid distances to 8211 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). From this analysis, a substantial subset (3101 peaks) of the SMA-3 (73.7%) and SMA-9 (43.9%) peaks overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We, therefore, considered these instances of overlapping peaks to be evidence of SMA-3/SMA-9 association (possibly physical complexes, although this would require a formal biochemical demonstration), whereas adjacent but non-overlapping peaks likely represent an independent binding, leading us to conclude that (1) SMA-3 typically binds together with SMA-9 to DNA sites, and that (2) over half of all SMA-9 sites do not overlap with these SMA-3 occupied sites.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcription factors SMA-3 and SMA-9 bind both overlapping and distinct genomic sites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cumulative probability distribution graph of the distances between the centroids (base pair position located centrally within each peak) of nearest neighbor SMA-3 and SMA-9 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks.

About half (129) of the 279 SMA-9-exclusive direct targets are activated by SMA-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), whereas the other half (150) appear to be inhibited by SMA-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Surprisingly, many of these target genes contained overlapping SMA-3 and SMA-9 binding peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, e and f</xref>), although a loss of one of the two factors did not result in changes in gene expression, perhaps suggesting that the presence of the other factor at these targets was sufficient to regulate gene expression to physiological levels. Interpretation is further complicated for target genes surrounded by a mixture of distinct and overlapping SMA-3 and SMA-9 peaks. Nevertheless, our results suggest that (1) SMA-3 and SMA-9 can act independently of one another, (2) they usually (although not always) act as transcriptional activators of shared target genes when they co-occupy the same sites along the DNA, and (3) SMA-9 without SMA-3 can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor of its own SMA-3-independent targets.</p><p>The large number of total SMA-3 and SMA-9 ChIP-seq peaks yet the small number of functional peaks identified by BETA was surprising. The ModENCODE/ModERN consortium previously demonstrated the existence of High Occupancy Target (HOT) sites where ChIP-seq association with 15 or more transcription factors occurs, perhaps due to ‘sticky’ regions of the genome leading to false signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kudron et al., 2018</xref>). We surveyed the binding sites of transcription factors within the ModERN database for overlap with either SMA-3 or SMA-9 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Less than 25% of all the numerous SMA-3 or SMA-9 sites were associated with HOT sites. Restricting our analysis to just functional SMA-9 sites identified by BETA reduced HOT site association down to 15%, although a similar effect was not observed for functional SMA-3 sites identified by BETA. SMA-9-exclusive sites showed even lower HOT site association, whereas 40% of SMA-9 sites overlapping with SMA-3 sites (i.e. co-regulated) were associated with HOT sites. These results suggest that the large number of total SMA-3 and SMA-9 sites is not explained by binding to HOT sites, although there might be some affinity for SMA-3/SMA-9 co-regulated genes to be near HOT sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Integration of SMA-3 and SMA-9 function</title><p>SMA-3 and SMA-9 both regulate body size, and a loss of function mutation in either gene results in a small body size phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Savage et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foehr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2003</xref>).

For each gene, we also compared body length effect size, gene ontology/classification, and the BETA rank scores for SMA-3 and SMA-9 ChIP-seq/RNA-seq data, which gives an indication of whether a gene is a direct target of one or both factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). For each gene, we plotted the -log<sub>10</sub> for each BETA rank score (for SMA-3 on the X-axis and SMA-9 on the Y-axis) such that the greater the -log<sub>10</sub> BETA rank value, the greater probability that the gene is a direct target of that transcription factor. Circles represent individual genes tested such that the coordinate of the circle reflects the coordinate SMA-3 and SMA-9 BETA ranks, and the size of the circle represents the reduction in body size, normalized as Glass’ effect size, relative to control. Circle color represents key associated GO terms for each gene. We found that the genes that promoted body length and belonged to the SMA-3-exclusive category encoded chaperones and collagen secretion factors. SMA-9-exclusive genes that promoted body length encoded a lectin and a gene involved in one-carbon metabolism. Co-regulated genes showing a role in body length also encoded one-carbon metabolism factors, as well as collagens and chaperones.</p><p>We reasoned that if target genes truly act downstream of the DBL-1 signaling pathway to regulate body size, then we would also expect them to act downstream of the negative regulator LON-2, a glypican which antagonizes the DBL-1 pathway with respect to body size at the level of ligand-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gumienny et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we also performed RNAi depletion in a <italic>lon-2; rrf-3</italic> double mutant, which demonstrates exaggerated DBL-1 signaling and elongated body size; we expected that candidate transcriptional effectors of the DBL-1 pathway might have a more prominent requirement in mediating the exaggerated growth defect of a <italic>lon-2</italic> mutant and hence show a suppression phenotype in this genetic background. RNAi of one of the target genes, <italic>mttr-1,</italic> prevented the development of <italic>rrf-3; lon-2</italic> animals to the L4 stage, so body length could not be quantified at this stage. Nearly two-thirds of the remaining 36 genes tested caused a statistically significant reduction in body length (with a statistical effect size greater than one) upon RNAi treatment in at least one of the two genetic backgrounds. Half of the genes tested caused a significant reduction in body length in both genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), making them strong candidates for direct transcriptional effectors of body size regulation. Consistent with our results in the wild-type background, we found that SMA-3-exclusive regulators of body size were enriched for chaperones and factors involved in ER secretion, whereas co-regulated genes mediating body size growth were enriched for one-carbon metabolism factors and collagens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), suggesting that the upregulation of these activities is a key aspect of how DBL-1 signaling promotes growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DBL-1 signaling promotes body size through collagen secretion</title><p>We observed that <italic>dpy-11</italic> depletion via RNAi resulted in the most severe reduction in body length among the tested target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and c</xref>).

Canonical signaling is mediated by the Smad transcription factor complex, but Smad binding sites are too degenerate and have low affinity to account for the specific context-dependent effects, so transcription factor partners must also be involved. Some of the characterized partners are cell type-specific transcription factors. In contrast, Schnurri proteins are transcriptional partners that co-regulate target genes across multiple cell types. Here, we used genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq integrated through a novel software analysis pipeline to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnurri transcription factors in the developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> larva. We chose the second larval (L2) stage because Smad activity is elevated at this stage as determined by the RAD-SMAD activity reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tian et al., 2010</xref>), and because this stage is the earliest point at which one can observe a clear difference for one of the best-studied Smad mutant phenotypes: body size growth.</p><p>Using ChIP-seq, we detected numerous SMA-3 and SMA-9 binding sites. The large number of sites could reflect the low affinity and degenerate DNA sequence recognition of known targets for their respective families of transcription factors. By using an analysis pipeline that combines BETA, which integrates ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify targets, with LOA, which integrates two separate RNA-seq pairwise comparisons to identify shared DEGs, we identified nearby direct transcriptional targets based on their functional impact on transcript levels in corresponding mutants. Only a fraction of the total SMA-3 and SMA-9 sites were classified as functional based on BETA analysis of the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets. Most SMA-3 and SMA-9 sites were not found at HOT sites, which are often considered to be non-specific binding sites typically found in open regions of chromatin. The high number of additional sites classified as non-functional could represent the detection of weak affinity targets that do not have an actual biological purpose. Alternatively, these sites could have an additional role in DBL-1 signaling besides transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, or they could be regulating the expression of target genes at a far enough distance to not be detected by our BETA analysis. The difference between total binding sites and those associated with changes in gene expression underscores the importance of combining RNA-seq with ChIP-seq to identify the most biologically relevant targets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional interactions between SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri</title><p>Our analysis revealed that SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri have target genes that are co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate target genes that they independently and exclusively regulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

The significant number of shared (co-regulated) target genes with overlapping binding peaks is consistent with a model in which SMA-3 and SMA-9 bind as a complex (or at least adjacent along DNA), as has been demonstrated at a few loci in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Xenopus. Our results extend this model to a genome-wide level. Further investigation will be needed to determine if SMA-3 and SMA-9 form a direct complex at these sites, and whether the presence of one factor affects the binding of the other.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for the regulation of growth by DBL-1/BMP Signaling.</title><p>During early larval development, the DBL-1 ligand binds to the BMP receptors SMA-6 and DAF-4, which activate the Smads SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4.

These co-regulated genes include several collagen genes, factors involved in one-carbon metabolism, innate immunity genes, and genes involved in lipid metabolism. The Smad complex also binds to another category of sites (in orange/red) which lack SMA-9, perhaps associating instead with other transcription factors or co-factors (gray question mark). These SMA-3-exclusive genes include chaperones and the disulfide reductase DPY-11, which in turn promote the secretion of collagen into the cuticular extracellular matrix, thereby remodeling the cuticle to allow for growth. In addition to binding either with or near Smad complex components, SMA-9 (in blue) also binds to sites along the genome lacking Smad (or at least SMA-3), perhaps associating instead with other transcription factors or co-factors (gray question mark).

Thus, SMA-3 activation of these genes is dependent on the presence of SMA-9. This dependence could occur if SMA-9 is needed to recruit SMA-3 to the DNA. This possibility would be a novel mode of interaction, because, for the previously analyzed <italic>brinker</italic> and <italic>Xvent2</italic> target genes, Schnurri was shown to be recruited by the Smad complex rather than vice versa. A second possibility is that SMA-3 can bind in the absence of SMA-9 but cannot engage with the transcriptional machinery; that is, both proteins are required to form a transcriptional activation complex. With either possibility, SMA-9 represses the expression of these genes in the absence of SMA-3.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biological functions of target genes</title><p>DBL-1 signaling regulates multiple developmental and physiological processes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including body size, lipid metabolism, innate immunity, and male tail development.

We, therefore, conducted a functional analysis of these target genes by performing body size measurements on their corresponding mutants. We also performed body size measurements on RNAi knockdowns for identified target genes in an RNAi-sensitive strain, examining their effect in both a wild-type background and a <italic>lon-2</italic> background in which DBL-1 signaling is exaggerated, resulting in an elongated body size.

Using this reporter for collagen synthesis and secretion, we demonstrated that the DBL-1 pathway influences the secretion of this cuticle collagen. In particular, ROL-6::wrmScarlet accumulates in a perinuclear ER compartment in both <italic>sma-3</italic> and <italic>sma-9</italic> mutants. Consistent with a secretion defect, we found a corresponding decrease in the amount of ROL-6::wrmScarlet in the cuticle of <italic>sma-3</italic> mutants, although not in <italic>sma-9</italic> mutants, which could reflect the differential enrichment of <italic>dpy-11</italic> and chaperones in the list of SMA-3-exclusive target genes. Interestingly, treatment with tunicamycin, which impairs ER secretion, was sufficient to reduce body size, which is consistent with a model in which BMP signaling promotes collagen secretion to foster growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We remain cautious in our interpretation of this result, as blocking ER secretion with tunicamycin could affect the secretion of the BMP receptors or other proteins that function together with the receptors, which could also lead to a body size defect.</p><p>The collagenous cuticle is a major target of DBL-1/BMP signaling in body size regulation. For example, others have also demonstrated that DBL-1 signaling regulates cuticle collagen LON-3 post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>). In addition to direct transcriptional regulation of cuticle components, here, we highlight the importance of regulating other target genes such as <italic>dpy-11</italic> that are needed for collagen post-transcriptional processing. One powerful element of our approach was that our ChIP-seq/RNA-seq BETA analysis identified direct target genes and combined those findings with a functional analysis of a subset of those targets, thereby demonstrating that a combination of SMA-3-exclusive targets (including chaperones and collagen secretion factors) work together with SMA-3/SMA-9 co-regulated targets (including collagen genes and factors involved in one-carbon metabolism) to affect the process of body growth through their regulation of the extracellular matrix of the surrounding cuticle. TGF-β family members are well-known regulators of collagen deposition and extracellular matrix composition, suggesting that this class of transcriptional targets is conserved over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacFarlane et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the multi-level interactions identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are also relevant to the functions of these factors in vertebrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Images were then deconvolved using DeconvolutionLab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sage et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Animals expressing ROL-6::wrmScarlet together with the ER marker VIT2ss::oxGFP::KDEL were imaged using a Zeiss Elyra 7 Lattice SIM. A 60 X water objective (NA 1.2) was used to detect fluorescence, and a z-series was completed as described above.</p><p>RNAi treatment of ROL-6::wrmScarlet animals was performed similarly to the RNAi treatment in the body length analysis with these exceptions: nematodes exposed to <italic>dpy-11</italic> RNAi grew for one generation until day 1 adulthood before imaging, nematodes exposed to C54H2.5 and F41C3.4-containing RNAi plasmids were introduced to the animals at the L1 development stage and allowed to develop until day 1 adulthood, and nematodes exposed to Y25C1A.5 and Y113G7A.3-containing RNAi plasmids were introduced to animals at the L4 development stage and grown for 24 hr before imaging. Tunicamycin treatment of ROL-6::wrmScarlet-expressing animals was completed by allowing animals to the develop from eggs to L4 stage in the presence of 5 µg/mL in NGM plates. Experiments were conducted over three to four biological replicates. The data were analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed t-test ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test correction for multiple comparisons, where appropriate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Works at ModOmics Ltd, no other competing interests to declare</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>SMA-3 and SMA-9 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) sites.</title><p>This file contains the chromosomal location of 4205 ChIP-seq peaks for SMA-3 and 7065 ChIP-seq peaks for SMA-9 in separate tabs labeled ‘SMA-3’ and ‘SMA-9,’ respectively.

In their paper, Vora et al. analyze ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data to identify direct transcriptional targets of SMA-3 (Smad) and SMA-9 (Schnurri) and understand the respective roles of SMA-3 and SMA-9 in the nematode model <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The Authors use SMA-3 and SMA-9 ChIP-Seq data and RNA-Seq data from SMA-3 and SMA-9 mutants, and bioinformatic analyses to identify the genes directly controlled by these two transcription factors (TFs) and find approximately 350 such targets for each. They show that all SMA-3-controlled targets are positively controlled by SMA-3 binding, while SMA-9-controlled targets can be either up- or downregulated by SMA-9. 129 direct targets were shared by SMA-3 and SMA-9, and, curiously, the expression of 15 of them was activated by SMA-3 but repressed by SMA-9. In case of such opposing effects, the SMA-9 appears to act epistatically to SMA-3. Since genes responsible for cuticle collagen production were eminent among the SMA-3 targets, the Authors focused on trying to understand the body size defect known to be elicited by the modulation of BMP signaling. Vora et al. provide compelling evidence that this defect is likely to be due to problems with the BMP signaling-dependent collagen secretion necessary for cuticle formation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Vora et al. provide a valuable analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets, which will be very useful for the community.

In the absence of proof that SMA-3 and SMA-9 physically interact (e.g. that they co-immunoprecipitate - as they do in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), this is an unfounded claim, which still has to be experimentally substantiated.

We have revised the text to highlight what this study and others demonstrate about SMA-9’s role in body size. Simply stated, SMA-9 is needed together with SMA-3 to promote the expression of genes involved in one-carbon metabolism, collagens, and chaperones, all of which are required for body size. SMA-3 has additional, SMA-9-independent transcriptional targets, including chaperones and ER secretion factors, that also contribute to body size. Finally, SMA-9 regulates additional targets independent of SMA-3 that likely have a minimal role in body size. We have adjusted Figure 5 with new graphs of the original data to make these points more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors clearly show that both TFs can bind independently of each other, however, by using distances between SMA-3 and SMA-9 ChIP peaks, they claim that when the peaks are close these two TFs act as complexes.

As the reviewer has indicated, a physical interaction between Smads and Schnurris has been amply demonstrated in other systems. A limitation in these previous studies is that only a small number of target genes were analyzed. Our goal in this study was to determine how widespread this interaction is on a genomic scale. Our analyses demonstrate for the first time that a Schnurri transcription factor has significant numbers of both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent target genes. We have revised the text to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The second part of the paper (the collagen story) is very loosely connected to the first part. dpy-11 encodes an enzyme important for cuticle development, and it is a differentially expressed direct target of SMA-3. dpy-11 can be bound by SMA-9, but it is not affected by this binding according to RNA-Seq.

We have added more context to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In the present study, Vora et al. elucidated the transcription factors downstream of the BMP pathway components Smad and Schnurri in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and their effects on body size. Using a combination of a broad range of techniques, they compiled a comprehensive list of genome-wide downstream targets of the Smads SMA-3 and SMA-9. They found that both proteins have an overlapping spectrum of transcriptional target sites they control, but also unique ones. Thereby, they also identified genes involved in one-carbon metabolism or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway. In an elaborate effort, the authors set out to characterize the effects of numerous of these targets on the regulation of body size in vivo as the BMP pathway is involved in this process. Using the reporter ROL-6::wrmScarlet, they further revealed that not only collagen production, as previously shown, but also collagen secretion into the cuticle is controlled by SMA-3 and SMA-9. The data presented by Vora et al. provide in-depth insight into the means by which the BMP pathway regulates body size, thus offering a whole new set of downstream mechanisms that are potentially interesting to a broad field of researchers.</p><p>The paper is mostly well-researched, and the conclusions are comprehensive and supported by the data presented. However, certain aspects need clarification and potentially extended data.</p><p>(1) The BMP pathway is active during development and growth. Thus, it is logical that the data shown in the study by Vora et al. is based on L2 worms. However, it raises the question of if and how the pattern of transcriptional targets of SMA-3 and SMA-9 changes with age or in the male tail, where the BMP pathway also has been shown to play a role. Is there any data to shed light on this matter or are there any speculations or hypotheses?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are intriguing questions, and we are interested in the roles of transcriptional targets at other developmental stages and in other physiological functions, but these analyses are beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As it was shown that SMA-3 and SMA-9 potentially act in a complex to regulate the transcription of several genes, it would be interesting to know whether the two interact with each other or if the cooperation is more indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>A physical interaction between Smads and Schnurri has been amply demonstrated in other systems. Our goal in this study was not to validate this physical interaction, but to analyze functional interactions on a genome-wide scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would help the understanding of the data even more if the authors could specifically state if there were collagens among the genes regulated by SMA-3 and SMA-9 and which.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. col-94 and col-153 were identified as direct targets of both SMA-3 and SMA-9. We noted this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The data on the role of SMA-3 and SMA-9 in the regulation of the secretion of collagens from the hypodermis is highly intriguing. The authors use ROL-6 as a reporter for the secretion of collagens. Is ROL-6 a target of SMA-9 or SMA-3? Even if this is not the case, the data would gain even more strength if a comparable quantification of the cuticular levels of ROL-6 were shown in Figure 6, and potentially a ratio of cuticular versus hypodermal levels. By that, the levels of secretion versus production can be better appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that rol-6 mRNA levels are reduced in dbl-1 mutants at L2, but RNA-seq analysis did not find enough of a statistically significant change in rol-6 to qualify it as a transcriptional target and total levels of protein are also not significantly reduced in mutants. We added this information in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is known that the BMP pathway controls several processes besides body size. The discussion would benefit from a broader overview of how the identified genes could contribute to body size. The focus of the study is on collagen production and secretion, but it would be interesting to have some insights into whether and how other identified proteins could play a role or whether they are likely to not be involved here (such as the ones normally associated with lipid metabolism, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more information to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 1 - Figure 3: The authors might want to think about condensing this into two figures.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid confusion with the different workflows, we prefer to keep these as three separate figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1a-b: Measurement unit missing on X.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the unit “bps” to these graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 244-246: The authors should stress in the Results that they analyzed publicly available ChIP-Seq data, which was not generated by them, - not just by providing a reference to Kudron et al., 2018.

We have also added information regarding the anti-GFP antibody to the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 267-270: The authors should either provide experimental evidence that SMA-3 and SMA-9 form complexes or write something like &quot;significant overlap between SMA-3 and SMA-9 peaks may indicate complex formation between these two transcription factors as shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; - but in the absence of proof, this must be a point for the Discussion, not for the Results. Moreover, similar behavior of fat-6 (overlapping ChIP peaks) and nhr-114 (non-overlapping ChIP peaks) in SMA-3 and SMA-9 mutants may be interpreted as a circumstantial argument against SMA-3/SMA-9 complex formation (see Lines 342-348). Importantly, since ChIP-Seq data are available for a wide array of <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFs, it would be very useful to have an estimate of whether SMA-3/SMA-9 peak overlap is significantly higher than the peak overlap between SMA-3 and several other TFs expressed at the same L2 stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified our goals regarding SMA-3 and SMA-9 interactions and softened our conclusions by indicating in the text that a formal biochemical demonstration would be required to demonstrate a physical interaction. Moreover, we toned down the text by stating that our results suggest that either SMA-3 and SMA-9 frequently bind as either subunits in a complex or in close vicinity to each other along the DNA. We have added an analysis of HOT sites to address overlap of binding with other transcription factors. We disagree with the interpretation that transcription factors with non-overlapping sites cannot act together to regulate gene expression; however, nhr-114 also has an overlapping SMA-3 and SMA-9 site, so this point becomes less relevant. We have clarified the categorization of nhr-114 in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 272-292: The authors do not comment on the seemingly quite small overlap between the RNA-Seq and the ChIP-Seq dataset, but I think they should. They have 3205 SMA-3 ChIP peaks and 1867 SMA-3 DEGs, but the amount of directly regulated targets is 367. It is important that the authors provide information on the number of genes to which their peaks have been assigned. Clearly, this will not be one gene per peak, but if it were, this would mean that just 11.5% of bound targets are really affected by the binding. The same number would be 4.7% for the SMA-9 peaks.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion of the discrepancy between binding sites and DEGs. The high number of additional sites classified as non-functional could represent the detection of weak affinity targets that do not have an actual biological purpose. Alternatively, these sites could have an additional role in DBL-1 signaling besides transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, or they could be regulating the expression of target genes at a far enough distance to not be detected by our BETA analysis as per the constraints chosen for the analysis. The difference between total binding sites and those associated with changes in gene expression underscores the importance of combining RNA-seq with ChIP-seq to identify the most biologically relevant targets. And as the reviewer indicated, more than one gene can be assigned to a single neighboring peak.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 294-323: I feel like there is a terminology problem, which makes reading very difficult. The authors use &quot;direct targets&quot; as bound genes with significant expression change, but then run into a problem when the gene is bound by SMA-9 and SMA-3, but significant expression change is only associated with one of the two factors. I am not sure this is consistent with the idea of the SMA3/SMA9 complex. Also, different modalities of the SMA3 and SMA9 effect in 15 cases can be explained by co-factors. Reading would be also simplified if the order of the panels in Figure 3 were different. Currently, the authors start their explanation by referring to the shared SMA-3/SMA-9 targets (Figures 3c-d), and only later come to Figure 3b. In general, the authors should start with a clear explanation of what is on the figure (currently starting on Line 313), otherwise, it is unclear why, if the authors only discuss common targets, it is not just 114+15=129 targets, but more.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-ordered the columns in Figure 3 to match the order discussed in the text. We also incorporated more precise language about regulation by SMA-3 and/or SMA-9 in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 325-355: The chapter has a rather unfortunate name &quot;Mechanisms of integration of SMA-3 and SMA-9 function&quot;, although the authors do not provide any mechanism. Using 3 target genes, they show that if the regulatory modality of SMA-3 and SMA-9 is the same (2 examples), there is no difference in the expression of the targets, but if the modalities are opposing (1 example), SMA-9 repressive action is epistatic to the SMA-3 activating action. Can this be generalized? The authors should test all their 15 targets with opposite regulations. Moreover, it seems obvious to ask whether the intermediate phenotype of the double-mutants can be attributed to the action of these 15 genes activated by SMA-3 and repressed by SMA-9. I would suggest testing this by RNAi. I would also suggest renaming the chapter to something better reflecting its content.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the word “mechanism” from the title of this section. We also performed additional RT-PCR experiments on another 5 targets with opposing directions of regulation. The results from these genes are consistent with the result from C54E4.5, demonstrating that the epistasis of sma-9 is generalizable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4b: Why was a two-way ANOVA performed here? With the small number of measurements, I would consider using a non-parametric test.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are parametric and the distribution of the data is normal, so we chose to use a parametric test (ANOVA).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 354-355. The authors offer two suggestions for the mechanism of the epistatic action of SMA-9 on SMA-3 in the case of C54E4.5, but this is something for the Discussion. If they want to keep it in the Results they should address this experimentally by performing SMA-3 ChIP-seq in the SMA-9 mutants and SMA-9 ChIP-Seq in the SMA-3 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We moved these models to the discussion as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 365-367: &quot;We expect that clusters of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and innate immunity mediate the physiological functions of BMP signaling in fat storage and pathogen resistance, respectively.&quot; - This is pretty confusing since the Authors claim in the previous sentence that regulation of immunity by SMA-9 is TGF-beta independent.</p></disp-quote><p>Co-regulation of immunity by BMP signaling and SMA-9 is already known. The novel insight is that SMA-9 may have an additional independent role in immunity. We have clarified the language to address this confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 377, and 380: Please explain in non-<italic>C. elegans</italic>-specific terminology, what rrf-3 and LON-2 are (e.g. write &quot;glypican LON-2&quot; instead of just &quot;LON-2&quot;) and add relevant references.</p></disp-quote><p>We added information on the proteins encoded by these genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 382-384: I am not sure what the Authors mean here by &quot;more limiting&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We substituted the phrase “might have a more prominent requirement in mediating the exaggerated growth defect of a lon-2 mutant”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 388-392: I found this very confusing. What were these 36 genes? Were these direct targets of SMA-3, SMA-9, or both? Top 36 targets? 36 targets for which mutants are available?</p></disp-quote><p>The new Figure 5 clarifies whether target genes are SMA-3-exclusive, SMA-9-exclusive, or co-regulated. The text was also updated for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 397: This is the first time the authors mention dpy-11 but they do not say what it is until later, and they do not say whether it is a target of SMA3/SMA9. Checking Figure 3, I found that it is among the 238 genes bound by both but upregulated only by SMA3. The authors need to explicitly state this - from this point on, they have a section for which SMA-9 appears to be irrelevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the molecular function of dpy-11 at its first mention. Furthermore, we included the hypothesis that SMA-3 may regulate collagen secretion independently of SMA-9. Our subsequent results with sma-9 mutants disprove this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 402: Is ROL-6 a SMA-3/SMA-9 target or just a marker gene?</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that rol-6 mRNA levels are reduced in dbl-1 mutants at L2, but RNA-seq analysis did not find enough of a statistically significant change in rol-6 to qualify it as a transcriptional target and total levels of protein are also not significantly reduced in mutants.
