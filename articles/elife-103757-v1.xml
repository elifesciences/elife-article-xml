However, there are few analogous tools for manipulating the structure of neural circuits. Here, we introduce three rationally designed genetically encoded tools that use E3 ligase-dependent mechanisms to trigger the degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins, leading to functional ablation of synapses. First, we developed a constitutive excitatory synapse ablator, PFE3, analogous to the inhibitory synapse ablator GFE3. PFE3 targets the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 and the proteasome-interacting region of Protocadherin 10 to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, leading to efficient ablation of excitatory synapses. In addition, we developed a light-inducible version of GFE3, paGFE3, using a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c. paGFE3 degrades Gephyrin and ablates inhibitory synapses in response to 400 nm light. Finally, we developed a chemically inducible version of GFE3, chGFE3, which degrades inhibitory synapses when combined with the bio-orthogonal dimerizer HaloTag ligand-trimethoprim. Each tool is specific, reversible, and capable of breaking neural circuits at precise locations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Within the brain are circuits of neurons that communicate with one another via junctions known as synapses. The pre-synaptic neuron, which sends the signal, releases proteins known as neurotransmitters into the synapse which then bind to receptors on the receiving, or postsynaptic, neuron.</p><p>If the receptors at the synapse are excitatory, they increase the chances of the postsynaptic neuron âfiringâ and propagating the signal. In contrast, if the receptors are inhibitory, this reduces the likelihood of the neuron firing, dampening communication across the circuit.</p><p>In a previous study, a tool known as GFE3 was developed that can specifically eliminate inhibitory synapses by binding to scaffolding proteins called gephyrins that anchor inhibitory receptors in place.

Although there are many genetically encoded tools for modulating neuronal function, existing tools for eliminating synapses are inadequate for providing a clear understanding of neural circuits. Previously, we developed GFE3, a protein that can ablate inhibitory synapses efficiently, rapidly, and without toxicity by targeting an E3 ligase to the scaffolding protein Gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gross et al., 2016</xref>). GFE3 consists of GPHN.FingR (<bold>F</bold>ibronectin <bold>in</bold>trabody <bold>g</bold>enerated by m<bold>R</bold>NA display), a recombinant, antibody-like protein, which binds Gephyrin at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prior et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gross et al., 2013</xref>) fused to the RING domain of the E3 ligase XIAP (RING<sub>XIAP</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilkinson et al., 2008</xref>). GFE3 mediates the ubiquitination of Gephyrin and disassembly of inhibitory synapses. Importantly, it specifically targets postsynaptic sites containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and can be expressed in genetically determined cell types. Thus, GFE3 can manipulate circuits in a manner that is not possible with optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>), DREADDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Urban and Roth, 2015</xref>), and modulators of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), which do not target specific postsynaptic receptors, or with traditional pharmacological approaches that target specific receptors but do not allow for cell-type specificity. GFE3 has been used to probe the contribution of inhibitory inputs to LTP in hippocampal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davenport et al., 2021</xref>), recurrent loops in the oscillator that drives rhythmic whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Golomb et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Takatoh et al., 2022</xref>), and the temporal coordination of vocalization and inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Park et al., 2024</xref>). However, no tool analogous to GFE3 that ablates excitatory synapses currently exists. Furthermore, because GFE3 is constitutively active, its temporal and spatial resolution is limited.</p><p>In this study, we generated three tools for ablating synapses based on GFE3: (1) PFE3, an excitatory synapse ablator; (2) paGFE3, a photoactivatable version of GFE3; (3) chGFE3, a chemically activated version of GFE3. We show that the expression of PFE3 in cultured neurons causes the loss of PSD-95 puncta and excitatory synapses, which is reversible. In vivo, its expression leads to the functional loss of excitatory synaptic transmission. We generated paGFE3 by incorporating GPHN.FingR and the RING<sub>XIAP</sub> into a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). paGE3 is activated by 400 nm light and causes ablation of inhibitory synapses within 5 hr of exposure that is subsequently reversible. In the absence of 400 nm light, paGFE3 has no background activity. In addition, the expression of paGFE3 labels inhibitory synapses, allowing their size and location to be monitored before and after ablation. chGFE3, a chemogenetic version of GFE3 analogous to paGFE3, mediates efficient, reversible degradation of labeled synapses when a cell-permeant chemical is added.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Degrading exogenous PSD-95 through ubiquitination</title><p>Initially, to generate an excitatory synapse ablator, we fused RING<sub>XIAP</sub> to PSD-95.FingR, which binds at high affinity and specificity to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, which is found at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hunt et al., 1996</xref>). However, PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>XIAP</sub> did not efficiently ablate PSD-95 (data not shown). As an alternative, we fused PSD-95.FingR to the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 (RING<sub>Mdm2</sub>), which is necessary for PSD-95 degradation and excitatory synapse ablation during homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colledge et al., 2003</xref>). To determine whether PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> degrades PSD-95, we examined how co-expression with PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> affected the expression of exogenous PSD-95-myc in COS7 cells. Cells transfected with PSD-95 alone had a PSD-95-myc expression level of 203 Â± 32 au, as measured by western blot, while the expression level of PSD-95 in cells co-expressing PSD-95-myc and PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> reduced to 107 Â± 12 au, a ~50% decrease (<italic>n</italic> = 5, p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with multiple comparisons). To determine whether this reduction in PSD-95 was due to ubiquitination, we tried a third condition, where the ubiquitination inhibitor TAK243 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Majeed et al., 2022</xref>) was added to cells co-expressing PSD-95-myc and PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2.</sub> In this case, PSD-95 expression levels increased to 239 Â± 31 au, a ~20% increase relative to cells expressing PSD-95-myc alone, which was not significant (<italic>n</italic> = 5, p &gt; 0.6, ANOVA with multiple comparisons). Furthermore, cells co-expressing PSD-95-myc and PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> without TAK243 had ~55% less PSD-95 vs. those with TAK243, a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA with multiple comparisons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mdm2.RING ubiquitinates PSD-95.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of cell lysate from COS7 cells transfected with PSD-95-myc alone, PSD-95-myc + Dox-induced TRE-PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>MDM2</sub>, and PSD-95-myc + TRE-PSD-95.FingR-RING <sub>MDM2</sub> + TAK243, a ubiquitination inhibitor.

After 48 hr, we reimaged the neurons for PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP and then fixed and stained them with anti-PSD-95 and anti-HA.

However, when we counted the number of puncta labeled with PSD-95.FingR at T0 and compared that to the number of puncta labeled with immunostaining of endogenous PSD-95 in the same cells at the end of the experiment, it showed a reduction of only 52% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001, MannâWhitney, <italic>n</italic> = 9 cells, 3 independent experiments). A strategy for improving this relatively low ablation rate might be provided by the results of experiments where the expression of MEF2 was found to cause the elimination of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). In those experiments, efficient synapse elimination was found to require a combination of ubiquitination mediated by Mdm2 and interaction with the proteasome, which was mediated by Protocadherin 10 (PCDH 10). PCDH 10 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cell adhesion protein that binds to both PSD-95 and the proteasome via its proteasome-interacting region (PIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that adding the PIR domain to the PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub> complex might increase the efficiency with which PSD-95 is ablated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Optimization of degradation using the PIR</title><p>We generated a new protein, PSD-95.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub>-PIR, which we called PFE3. To test PFE3, we co-transfected TRE-PFE3-HA with PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP in dissociated cultures of rat cortical neurons. Following 4 days of incubation, we imaged the PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP and induced the expression of PFE3-HA with Dox. The neurons were imaged 48 hr after induction of TRE-PFE3 and subsequently fixed and immunostained for endogenous PSD-95 and HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). By comparing images at T0 and 48 hr, we found that the expression of PFE3 reduced the labeling of PSD-95.FingR-tagRFP by 65%, a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, D</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 14 cells, 3 distinct experiments, p &lt; 0.0001, MannâWhitney).

Thus, PFE3 consistently and efficiently reduced both total labeling of PSD-95 by the PSD-95.FingR, and the number of endogenous PSD-95 puncta. As a control, we induced RandE3 (Random.FingR-RING<sub>Mdm2</sub>-PIR), which contained a fibronectin scaffold with a random binding pocket instead of PSD-95.FingR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gross et al., 2016</xref>).

Furthermore, because AMPARs are the predominant ionotropic glutamate receptor responsible for excitatory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gouaux, 2004</xref>), our results suggest that PFE3 reduces functional excitatory connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Degradation of PSD-95 with PFE3 is reversible</title><p>To test whether the ablation of excitatory synapses by PFE3 is reversible, we used a previous paradigm for testing GFE3.

Cells were imaged immediately before adding Dox, immediately after removing Dox, and after 5 days of incubation in Dox-free medium, followed immediately by fixation and immunostaining.

Furthermore, immunocytochemistry of neurons following incubation with Dox-free media showed that endogenous PSD-95 is found on dendritic spines following synapse regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1J</xref>).

We further tested PhLIC by co-transfecting COS7 cells with Golgi-targeted PhoCl2c (GTS-PhoCl2c) and PBP-tagRFP and exposing them to 400 nm light. If PBP binds to photocleaved PhoCl2c but not full-length PhoCl2c, we would expect PBP-tagRFP to be expressed diffusely throughout the cell initially and then translocate to the Golgi after photocleavage of PhoCl2c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Following expression in COS-7 cells, GTS-PhoCl2c localized in a concentrated oval in the center of the cell, consistent with Golgi localization.

Note that tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c performs two functions. It is targeted to inhibitory synapses, where it acts as an anchor that recruits PBP-E3 once PhoCl2c has been cleaved. It also acts as a label, allowing inhibitory synapses to be visualized before and after PhCl2c is cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Subsequently, neurons were intermittently exposed to 400 nm light for 1 min (see methods). After 5 hr, the cultures were reimaged. The neurons showed a 61 Â± 3% reduction in tagRFP labeling (130 Â± 9 vs. 52 Â± 6 a.u., a significant difference, p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, <italic>n</italic> = 17 cells, 3 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâE</xref>) and a 40 Â± 6% drop in the number of GPHN.FingR puncta (268 Â± 24 vs. 161 Â± 20 puncta), a significant change (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, <italic>n</italic> = 17, 3 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâE</xref>).

However, the number of GPHN.FingR-labeled puncta did not show a significant change (0.4 Â± 2%, p &gt; 0.7, Wilcoxon, <italic>n</italic> = 14 cells, 3 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), indicating the reduction in total GPHN.FingR labeling is likely a result of photobleaching and not due to the decrease in Gephyrin. Thus, our results are consistent with cells expressing paGFE3 undergoing efficient degradation of Gephyrin puncta when exposed to 400 nm light.</p><p>To determine whether Gephyrin ablation mediated by paGFE3 is reversible, we transfected both components of pa-GFE3 in dissociated cortical neurons as before. Four days after transfection, cells were imaged and then exposed to 400 nm light for 1 min at time point T0. Five hours later, the cells were reimaged and incubated for another 4 days, at which point they were imaged again. We reasoned that the PhLIC-GFE3 complexes would be self-degrading, as was GFE3. Thus, in the absence of light, they should be degraded, and Gephyrin puncta should be allowed to be regenerated after a sufficient waiting period. Comparing the images, we found the total fluorescence from the tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c label was reduced by 63 Â± 5% between T0 and +5 hr, then increased by 130 Â± 28% between +5 hr and +4 days, a significant difference (p &lt; 0.001 for T0 to +5 hr; p &lt; 0.05, +5 hr to +4 days, Friedman test, multiple comparisons, <italic>n</italic> = 9 cells, 2 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FâI</xref>).

We found similar results when we counted the number of GPHN.FingR puncta which showed a 43 Â± 7% reduction (p &lt; 0.01, Friedman test, multiple comparisons) followed by a 76 Â± 22% increase (p &lt; 0.05, Friedman test, multiple comparisons), representing a nonsignificant 6 Â± 12% decrease from the original (p &gt; 0.99, Friedman test, multiple comparisons, <italic>n</italic> = 9 cells, 2 experiments). We also found that puncta before and after ablation were in similar locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Together, our results indicate that paGFE3 can mediate light-inducible degradation of endogenous Gephyrin that has virtually no background and is reversible.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Chemically induced GFE3</title><p>We also generated a chemogenetic version of GFE3 (chGFE3) that can be used when an inducible version of GFE3 is needed, but paGFE3 is unsuitable. We used a chemically induced dimerization system based on <italic>E. coli</italic> dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and the HaloTag protein. When combined with the small molecule TH, a fusion of trimethoprim (TMP) and HaloTag ligand, eDHFR and HaloTag form a bio-orthogonal complex in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballister et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the formation of the complex is reversible because the binding of eDHFR to TMP is not covalent and can be outcompeted by adding excess TMP. We divided GFE3 into its two principal components, GPHN.FingR and RING<sub>XIAP</sub> and fused transcriptionally regulated GPHN.FingR to the HaloTag peptide and RING<sub>XIAP</sub> to eDHFR, to give tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and eDHFR-E3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As with tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl2c, tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag will both label inhibitory synapses and provide an anchor to which E3 can be recruited to initiate the degradation of Gephyrin. To test whether recruiting eDHFR-E3 to inhibitory synapses would lead to the loss of Gephyrin, we transfected cultured neurons with transcriptionally controlled tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and DHFR-E3 (chGFE3). After visualizing Gephyrin puncta, neurons were treated with 100 nM TH to induce dimerization. Incubation of the neurons with TH for 4 hr showed a reduction of Gephyrin by 73% Â± 3% (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâE</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 12 cells, 3 experiments) and a decrease in GPHN.FingR puncta by 53 Â± 7% (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon, <italic>n</italic> = 12 cells, 3 experiments).

Immunocytochemistry against endogenous Gephyrin confirms the loss of inhibitory synapses at 4 and 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, H</xref>). To verify that Gephyrin loss depends on the dimerization between the GPHN.FingR and RING<sub>XIAP</sub> neurons were transfected with tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag and SnapTag-E3 and treated with TH. There were nonsignificant increases in labeling with GPHN.FingR (+20 Â± 16%, p &gt; 0.5, Wilcoxon, <italic>n</italic> = 8, 2 experiments), and the number of GPHN.FingR puncta (+11 Â± 10%, p &gt; 0.99, Wilcoxon, <italic>n</italic> = 9, 2 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>).

All three tools ablate specific postsynaptic sites and can be expressed in particular cell types, allowing circuit breaking with twofold specificity.</p><p>PFE3 is composed of three distinct functional domains. The E3 ligase Mdm2 mediates the ubiquitination of PSD-95; the PIR domain recruits proteasomes to the synapse to degrade the ubiquitinated protein, and both domains are targeted to PSD-95 through PSD-95.FingR. Its design is based on work showing that coordinated actions of Mdm2 and PIR from PCDH 10 mediate the degradation of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). These findings were corroborated when we found efficient degradation of PSD-95 and ablation of synapses was only achieved if all three components were included in PFE3. Expression of PFE3 caused highly efficient ablation of PSD-95 in cultured cortical neurons and blocked excitatory synaptic transmission in retinal ganglion cells in vivo.</p><p>Efficient elimination of excitatory synapses was achieved after 48 hr of PFE3 expression, which contrasts with PSD-95 knockout mice, where reductions in AMPA receptors and excitatory transmission were either not significant or small depending on the stage of development. One reason for this discrepancy could be that transcription of the MAGUK protein SAP-102, which is highly homologous to PSD-95, is upregulated in PSD-95 knockout mice and could provide compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coley and Gao, 2019</xref>). PSD-95.FingR labels SAP-102<sup>3</sup>, which suggests that PFE3 would degrade any SAP-102 that might otherwise compensate for the reduction in PSD-95. Thus, in the context of PFE3, the binding of PSD-95.FingR to MAGUKs homologous to PSD-95, such as SAP-102 and SAP97, could enable more effective and widespread ablation of excitatory synapses than if it bound only to PSD-95. Alternatively, compensatory changes in transcription could be relatively slow, or they respond specifically to changes in mRNA levels rather than protein levels. In the future, it should be possible to use PFE3 to explore mechanisms of compensation that maintain homeostasis when protein levels change.</p><p>Another obvious application of PFE3 is to probe the role of PSD-95 in maintaining synaptic structure. For instance, what is the relationship between PSD-95 and dendritic spines? It would also be interesting to closely examine how synapses change before and after ablation of PSD-95. PSD-95 puncta grow back in cultured neurons, but what would happen in mature neurons in vivo? If they grow back, would they reconnect with their original presynaptic partners, and if so, would neural circuit function be changed following regrowth? It would also be interesting to see whether it is possible to permanently alter the connectivity of circuits after extended periods of PFE3 expression.</p><p>We added temporal and spatial control capability to GFE3 by enabling its activation with light (paGFE3) or chemicals (chGFE3). We used a standard method for regulating a protein where two distinct domains that are necessary and sufficient for protein function are fused to separate components of a light- or chemically induced protein complex. Previously, this approach has been used for controlling transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>), neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Polstein and Gersbach, 2015</xref>), recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duplus-Bottin et al., 2021</xref>), and protease cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sanchez and Ting, 2020</xref>). However, background activation in photoactivatable complexes based on photoreceptors, such as cryptochrome 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>), phototropin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>), or Vivid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>), makes them unsuitable for regulating GFE3, which is highly potent. As an alternative, we developed a novel photoactivatable complex, PhLIC, based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl and the 10-mer PBP, which exhibited no measurable background when tested in the context of paGFE3.</p><p>This lack of background would make paGFE3 ideal for use in transgenic animals such as mice or zebrafish, where the complex would have to remain inert for long periods before activation. Expressing paGFE3 in a Gal4 (zebrafish) or Cre (mouse) driver line would allow inhibitory synapse ablation in specific cell types with precise temporal control without injecting viruses. In addition, with precise application of 400 nm light, it could be possible to ablate inhibitory synapses with single-cell spatial resolution. Furthermore, the PhLIC complex could be used to make photoactivatable versions of proteins other than GFE3. For instance, it could be used to create a split version of a potent toxin, which requires that no background activity be present until photoactivation causes it to kill or alter the function of specific cells at a particular time.</p><p>chGFE3 is based on a system similar to one for degrading exogenous proteins with eDHFR tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Etersque et al., 2023</xref>). Our system has the same benefits of efficiency and reversibility, but it can target endogenous Gephyrin and ablate inhibitory synapses. In addition, we showed that, like paGFE3, chGFE3 has no background. Although its desirable qualities overlap with those of paGFE3, it could be used in contexts where it would be too difficult or time-consuming to photoactivate GFE3. For instance, if the target cells were spread over a relatively large region or when sustained ablation is necessary. One potential drawback to applying chGFE3 in vivo is the necessity of injecting the chemical dimerizer TH. However, it may be that TH can be administered systemically, particularly since both components of TH (the HaloTag ligand and TMP) can penetrate the brain when injected systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mohar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ineichen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have generated novel proteins for ablating excitatory and inhibitory synapses, which can be used to probe the structure and function of neural circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-CAG-PFE3-P2A-GFP (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236178">Addgene_236178</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV version of constitutive PFE3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-TRE-PFE3-P2A-GFP (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236180">Addgene_236180</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV version of Tet-inducible PFE3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-CAG-RandE3-P2A-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236181">Addgene_236181</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV version of constitutive control plasmid</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-TRE-RandE3-P2A-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236179">Addgene_236179</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV version of inducible control plasmid</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-PhoCl (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236183">Addgene_236183</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Half of photoactivatable GFE3 (paGFE3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PBP-E3 (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236182">Addgene_236182</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other half of paGFE3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TRE-PFE3-HA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236114">Addgene_236114</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tet-inducible-PFE3-HA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">tagRFP-GPHN.FingR-HaloTag (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236112">Addgene_236112</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Half of chemically inducible GFE3 (chGFE3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">eDHFR-E3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_236113">Addgene_236113</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other half of chGFE3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-PSD-95<break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercially available.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novus Biologicals cat. #

Immediately after imaging, neurons were transferred back to the culture media, and TH was added to the medium at 100 nM final concentration. After 4 or 24 hr of incubation, neurons were transferred to the imaging buffer, and the same neurons were imaged to track changes in GPHN.FingR. To confirm the loss of endogenous Gephyrin, neurons were immediately fixed and immunostained, as described above. To recover inhibitory synapses, the cultured neurons were washed three times with conditioned media and incubated with conditioned media with 50 mM TMP for 48 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used nonparametric tests for paired (Wilcoxon), unpaired (MannâWhitney), or multiple (&gt;2) samples (Friedman multiple comparison) because we could not be certain that the data being tested were normally distributed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Previously, the authors developed GFE3, a tool that efficiently ablates inhibitory synapses by targeting an E3 ligase to the inhibitory scaffolding protein Gephyrin via GPHN.FingR, a recombinant, antibody-like protein (Gross et al., 2016). Building on this work, they now present three new ablation tools: PFE3, which targets excitatory synapses, and two new versions of GFE3-paGFE3 and chGFE3-that are photoactivatable and chemically inducible, respectively. These tools enable selective and efficient synapse ablation in specific cell types, providing valuable methods for disrupting neural circuits. This approach holds broad potential for investigating the roles of specific synaptic input onto genetically determined cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The primary strength of this study lies in the rational design and robust validation of each tool's effectiveness, building on previous work by the authors' group (Gross et al., 2016). Each tool serves distinct research needs: PFE3 enables efficient degradation of PSD-95 at excitatory synapses, while paGFE3 and chGFE3 allow for targeted degradation of Gephyrin, offering spatiotemporal control over inhibitory synapses via light or chemical activation. These tools are efficiently validated through robust experiments demonstrating reductions in synaptic markers (PSD-95 and Gephyrin) and confirming reversibility, which is crucial for transient ablation. By providing tools with both optogenetic and chemical control options, this study broadens the applicability of synapse manipulation across varied experimental conditions, enhancing the utility of E3 ligase-based approaches for synapse ablation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While this study provides valuable tools and addresses many critical points for varidation, examining potential issues with specificity and background ubiquitination in further detail could strengthen the paper. For PFE3, the study demonstrates reductions in both PSD-95 and GluA1. In their previous work, GFE3 selectively reduced Gephyrin without affecting major Gephyrin interactors or other PSD proteins. Clarifying whether PFE3 affects additional PSD proteins beyond GluA1 would be important for accurately interpreting results in experiments using PFE3. Additionally, further insight into PFE3's impact on inhibitory synapses would be valuable to assess the excitatory specificity and potential for circuit-level applications. For paGFE3 and chGFE3, the E3 ligase (RING domain of Mdm2) is overexpressed and thus freely diffusible within the cell as a separate construct. Although the authors show that Gephyrin is not significantly reduced without light or chemical activation, it remains possible that other proteins, particularly non-synaptic proteins, could be ubiquitinated due to the presence of freely diffusing E3 ligase in cytosol. Addressing these points would clarify the strengths and limitations of tools, providing users with valuable information.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103757.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bareghamyan</surname><given-names>Aida</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03taz7m60</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Changfeng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Daoudi</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03taz7m60</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Shubhash C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berkeley</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Xiaocen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alberta</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edmonton</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alberta</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edmonton</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tokyo</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tokyo</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California Berkeley</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berkeley</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chenoweth</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>Don B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03taz7m60</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>The biggest concern in this regard is: that almost all the characterization is performed in cultured dissociated neuronsâ¦</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that most of the characterization done in this paper was in cultured neurons, we verified that PFE3 mediates functional ablation of excitatory synapses in vivo (Fig. 3).

Furthermore, the PSD-95.FingR was extensively tested and has been used in dozens of studies without any indication that its expression alters cellular function or morphology. Note also that the transcriptional regulation system of PSD-95.FingR limits the expression such that there is virtually no background, so it is not really being overexpressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I am missing some control experiments for the excitatory synapses ablator- can the authors show that cells transfected with the plasmid and no DOX, show similar numbers of synapses as neurons without transfection?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an experiment comparing cells expressing PSD-95.FingR alone, and others expressing PFE3 with no Dox.

However, the methods of labeling were different- the initial counting of synapses was done, so we agree with the reviewer that it would be best not to use a paired analysis. Accordingly, we have changed Figs. 1F and 2D.</p></body></sub-article></article>
