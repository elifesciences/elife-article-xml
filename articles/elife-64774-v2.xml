But with resistance formation, these compounds become increasingly ineffective, while the majority of microbial and with that chemical compound diversity remains inaccessible for cultivation and exploration. Culturing recalcitrant bacteria is a stochastic process. But conventional methods are limited to low throughput. By increasing (i) throughput and (ii) sensitivity by miniaturization, we innovate microbiological cultivation to comply with biological stochasticity. Here, we introduce a droplet-based microscale cultivation system, which is directly coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. We demonstrate that highly parallelized in-droplet cultivation starting from single cells results in the cultivation of yet uncultured species and a significantly higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation. Strains able to inhibit intact reporter strains were isolated from the system. A variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected for a selected potent antibiotic producer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibiotics are chemicals derived from microorganisms that can kill the bacteria that harm human health. In the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries antibiotics saved millions of lives, but new strains of dangerous bacteria that cannot be killed by antibiotics, known as antibiotic resistant strains, are becoming more frequent. Most antibiotics are produced by only a small group of microorganisms, but many more microorganisms exist in nature. So it is possible that microorganisms outside this small group can produce different antibiotics that are effective against antibiotic resistant strains.</p><p>Unfortunately, finding the microorganisms that produce these alternative antibiotics is challenging because researchers do not know which bacteria are producing these molecules and how to grow these microorganisms in the laboratory. To solve this problem, Mahler et al. developed a new method for growing a new subset of microorganisms in the laboratory. This would allow researchers to study the new microorganisms under controlled conditions, and determine whether any of the substances they produce have antibiotic properties.</p><p>Mahler et al. generated tiny droplets that could only contain a single cell of a microorganism, so each microbe could grow alone in its own protected environment. Using this approach, it was possible to grow completely different types of microorganisms than with traditional techniques, and keep them isolated from each other. This allowed each different species of microbe to be screened for antimicrobial activity, allowing the identification of chemicals that could potentially be developed into new antibiotics. This new method is automated and miniaturized, paving the way for growing many more cells in few hours, with very low material and space requirements.</p><p>These results showcase a way of growing new types of microorganisms in the laboratory, making it easier and faster to study them and determine what chemicals they produce. Understanding a greater variety of microorganisms in detail can help identify new chemicals for industrial applications, including new ways of combating infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>high-throughput cultivation</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial compound</kwd><kwd>uncultured microorganisms</kwd><kwd>strain isolation</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004404</institution-id><institution>Thuringian Ministry of Education, Science and Culture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13008-715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahler</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004538</institution-id><institution>Thuringian Ministry of Economy, Labour and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014FE9037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahler</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009139</institution-id><institution>German Center for Infection Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TTU 09.811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahler</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GSC 214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahler</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>239748522 - SFB 1127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hertweck</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Niehs</surname><given-names>Sarah P</given-names></name><name><surname>Scherlach</surname><given-names>Kirstin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>This microscale cultivation strategy will help in the discovery of novel bacterial species and their prioritization for antibiotic screening campaigns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The microbial diversity in environmental habitats provides a rich resource for medically relevant substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moloney, 2016</xref>), and fortunately, it is far from being exhaustively mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lloyd et al., 2018</xref>). Only 1–15% of the bacterial diversity are cultivable under standard laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lok, 2015</xref>), which promises further revolutionizing compounds to be discovered in the remaining unexplored majority. The question is: How can we unlock the hidden biosynthetic potential of so far uncultured microbes? Initial continuous propagation of cultures is mandatory to study the chemical and biological characteristics of their respective natural products. Thus, elucidation and application of appropriate growth conditions are required for cell replication of species that are recalcitrant to cultivation.</p><p>To narrow the gap between the naturally occurring complexity of microbial communities and the limited diversity of culture collections, several new techniques have been developed. For instance, the concentration and composition of media have been adapted for a large number of oligotrophic uncultured species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Olsen and Bakken, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janssen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sait et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joseph et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stevenson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">da Rocha et al., 2010</xref>). Other techniques mimic the conditions in situ in more detail by supplying extracts derived from the environment containing unspecified mixtures of macro- and micronutrients and other growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Olsen and Bakken, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rappé et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zengler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sipkema et al., 2011</xref>). The most advanced development in this direction is to provide direct contact with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Dov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeberlein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sizova et al., 2012</xref>), which proved highly productive in culturing species regarded as unculturable.</p><p>A complementary trend is the miniaturization of culture vessels to save material and time while increasing throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zengler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Dov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Terekhov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watterson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nichols et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tandogan et al., 2014</xref>). Thereby, the chance of finding non-dormant, culturable variants of naturally occurring species, as stochastic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epstein, 2013</xref>), rises. These microscale culture techniques enable partitioning of complex bacterial communities at the single-cell level, which allows various species to grow at their own speed without competition for space or nutrients. At the same time, the miniaturized vessels that confine single cells are small and densely packed to establish a highly parallelized cultivation. The reported microscale approaches can be divided into methods that arrange the compartments into arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nichols et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tandogan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2017</xref>) and techniques that keep the compartments not fixed to positions but rather mobile within the bulk population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zengler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Dov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Terekhov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watterson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villa et al., 2020</xref>). The clear advantage of arrays is the possibility to address the same culture several times since the compartments are identified by their coordinates.</p><p>However, array technologies also come with inherent disadvantages. First, space is lost by introducing a distance between array positions and omitting the expansion in the third dimension. Arrays, like microtiter plates or miniaturized versions thereof, have so far only vessels arranged in a 2D plane. Second, fast automation is simpler with moving compartments and the continuous flow of compartments can be easily adjusted in speed and direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vincent et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, without arrays, higher absolute numbers of compartments can be generated and processed per unit of time.</p><p>We propose an integrated cultivation and screening strategy based on surfactant-stabilized microfluidic droplets in a perfluorinated oil phase. Microfluidic droplets provide a genotype–phenotype linkage also for secreted products, meaning that those compounds stay confined with the cell from which they originated. Droplets can be stored in bulk, allowing to generate and incubate large droplet populations under controlled aerobic conditions. Furthermore, we implemented a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products using bacterial reporter strains in droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahler et al., 2018</xref>). We verified our cultivation and screening strategy by culturing a complex bacterial community derived from a soil sample in a growth substrate designed accordingly and compared the cultivation outcome to classical agar plate cultivation for the same sample. For one of the isolates that showed antimicrobial activity in the droplet screening, we identified and characterized the secreted metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Concept of cultivation in pL-droplets and workflow</title><p>We used a droplet-microfluidic platform to singularize, cultivate, and screen bacterial cells from complex environmental communities. The workflow featured three major phases: first, cells were separated from each other by encapsulating them in droplets during droplet generation. All droplets were collected in a vessel, where they lost their order. We refer to the state of a droplet population, in which the positional information of droplets is unrelated to the order of droplet generation, as ‘droplets in bulk’. Second, droplets in bulk were incubated together using dynamic droplet incubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mahler et al., 2015</xref>), which ensured aerobic and homogenous cultivation conditions for months. Third, grown microbial cultures were isolated from droplets by depositing them on agar plates. Either all droplets were deposited in an untargeted manner or droplets were first screened for antimicrobial activity and then only selected droplets were distributed on agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Concept of microbial droplet cultivation and activity screening.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General workflow of in-droplet cultivation with two options for strain isolation. (1) Single cells of the soil community are encapsulated in droplets.

We transferred abundance of occupied droplets to CFU under the assumption that one cell was initially encapsulated per occupied droplet. For example, among 1000 droplets in total 224 were occupied by colonies, meaning that in 200 nL droplet liquid (1000*200 pL) at least 224 CFU were contained.

We used low amounts of defined nutrients typically originating from plants supplemented with a cold-extracted soil extract (CESE), prepared from the same soil that the community was derived from, and several solid soil particles (diameter &lt;40 µm). CESE contained dissolvable macro- and micronutrients and other effectors, like signaling molecules. The number of cells occupying a droplet during an encapsulation event follows a Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2015</xref>). As we aimed at one cell per droplet, we minimized the probability of several cells per droplet by adjusting the concentration of cells at inoculation to obtain not more than 30% occupied droplets (λ = 0.4, on average 0.4 cells/droplet). Nevertheless, the occurrence of several cells per droplet cannot be excluded due to a small statistical probability of 6.16% and biological reasons like cells adhering to the same soil particle or to each other. The droplets were stabilized by a biocompatible surfactant forming a monolayer at the aqueous/oil interphase. The level of miniaturization (~200 pL droplet volume), in conjunction with bulk incubation, permitted droplet populations comprising on average 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> droplets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In-droplet cultivation results in higher CFU concentration in comparison to conventional plating</title><p>To prove the capability of our droplet cultivation technique, we directly compared the cultivation outcome of droplets with standard plating for the extracted microbial community of a brown earth soil sample (eight replicates, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

On plates, the colony count is equivalent to 1.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL of the soil community.

A miniaturized droplet volume of 200 pL facilitated high-density long-term cultivation of 2 million compartmentalized single cells in a total volume of 1.5 mL. Additionally, we were able to screen for antibiotic production, which demanded the addition of reporter strains to the cultivation compartments.</p><p>One major advantage of our method compared to previous microscale cultivation systems lies in the space-efficient incubation of droplets in bulk. Thereby, we attain a 180-fold higher number of droplets and a higher cultivation density than the microfluidic streak plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2016a</xref>), for instance (50.000 × 180 pL droplets in an array). In contrast to systems relying on agarose-stabilized gel microdroplets incubated in aqueous medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zengler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akselband et al., 2006</xref>), our method does not suffer from cross-contamination of cells between the compartments or compartment and continuous phase. Although we could not use commercial FACS instruments for droplet sorting, we demonstrated a stable on-chip sorting, which enabled our screening procedure. The screening was conducted after an extensive aerobic incubation period allowing environmental cells to replicate and reach the physiological state for natural product biosynthesis before the reporter strain was injected into the droplets. Such a protocol is not feasible when double emulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Terekhov et al., 2017</xref>) or gel-stabilized droplets are used.</p><p>For the cultivation of a complex bacterial community rich in recalcitrant and slow growing genera, we have demonstrated the advantages of our in-droplet cultivation strategy. A more diverse subset of cultured bacteria and a twofold higher CFU concentration compared to plates have presumably been achieved for three reasons: (i) absence of competition in single-cell confinement, (ii) the high number of incubated cells, and (iii) the new and unique cultivation conditions in our droplets during long-term dynamic droplet incubation.</p><p>We also specifically chose conditions like low nutrient amounts and long incubation times that might favor growth and metabolic activity of slow growing species over fast growing species. We installed this bias towards slow growing species in our screening as a dereplication strategy because fast growing species are usually readily culturable and have been extensively screened in standard natural product screenings. In future work, we even consider to actively deselect for fast growers by image-based droplet sorting within the first week to further reduce the chance of rediscovery of natural products.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the surfactant-stabilized droplet boundary, though forming a mechanical barrier to prevent cell cross-contamination, is not completely abolishing molecular transport for all types of molecules. In general, only a few molecules with relatively high partitioning coefficients, meaning fairly hydrophobic compounds, might leak into the oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skhiri et al., 2012</xref>). Other molecules, which are usually poorly soluble in the perfluorinated continuous phase, can only partition into the continuous phase mediated by excessive surfactant molecules, unbound to the droplet border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruner et al., 2016</xref>). This kind of interdroplet transport can be minimized by decreasing surfactant concentrations, as was done here. Although the risk for chemical cross-talk is low, it could be problematic for the detection of antibiotics. Local concentrations of traveling compounds in producer droplets would be diluted towards other droplets causing false-negative detection. In contrast, chances for false-positives, that is, leakage of a specific compound from droplet with confined producer and its accumulation in one random other droplet without producing organism, are low due to constant droplet mixing and the comparably large amount of oil used during incubation (~7 mL oil vs. 200 pL droplet × 9000 = 1.8 µL, assuming that one in 1000 droplets contains a producers of the same leaking compound). Overall, the risk to miss antibiotics is higher for hydrophobic compounds, making the system favor the detection of hydrophilic substances. We understand the focus on hydrophilic antibiotics as a strength since the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens, makes them more resistant to a number of hydrophobic antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Savage, 2001</xref>). Interdroplet transport of molecules might also present an advantage in the cultivation phase. Allowing communication between species might preserve to some extent the growth-stimulating influence of multispecies communities.</p><p>We were able to recover part of the increased bacterial diversity during strain isolation from droplets, exemplified by several rare genera (e.g., <italic>Kocuria</italic> sp. and <italic>Leifsonia</italic> sp.) and a candidate for a new species in the family of Cytophagaceae, among relatively few isolates. Presumably, the yield of unusual isolates could be further increased by solely focusing on exceptional morphologies during colony picking. We avoided to do so to learn about the abundance distribution of species we obtained with the practiced isolation workflow. Our isolation procedure enabled us to spread droplets on agar plates without mechanically disrupting cell agglomerates. Hence, also droplets that contained large cell numbers were represented by only one colony on the plate. Nevertheless, the overall taxonomic distribution found after in-droplet cultivation could not be recovered with our droplet depositioning and isolation procedure on agar plates. The isolate collection was biased by organisms abundantly found on solid media plates and a number of species able to grow in droplets could not be recovered. The strongest impact might be through the change from liquid to solid cultivation conditions. Large differences in culturability for several known strains and isolation campaigns have been described depending on the choice of liquid or solid cultivation media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nosho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shigematsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wai et al., 2000</xref>). Hence, it can be assumed that this is the case also for many so far unknown species. We, therefore, hypothesize that the change from liquid to solid cultivation contributed to the loss of some isolates, which could not be maintained in culture for extended periods outside of droplets. Consequently, we are currently developing other upscaling strategies into liquid culture like droplet deposition in microtiter plate wells. However, this bias likely does not abolish a droplet-aided strain discovery with the here presented droplet depositioning. We consider the theories of the scout model, postulating that cells of a dormant population switch stochastically into an active state scouting the current conditions, and spontaneous domestication as described by Buerger and Epstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunge and Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buerger et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buerger et al., 2012b</xref>). The high parallelization in droplet cultivation leads to substantially increased chances to find rare scout cells, which can replicate and turn into culturable variants (spontaneous domestication). Those domesticated variants would subsequently also grow on agar plates and become accessible within our droplet workflow.</p><p>We increased the practical relevance of our cultivation approach by combining it with a screening step in order to detect and specifically select droplets containing environmental cells producing compounds with antibiotic activity. Even though axenic cultures of putative new species could not be maintained with standard microbiological cultivation after isolation from droplets, the cells could be used for obtaining high-quality genome information. Thereby, our method assists in strain prioritization during genome mining or guide future isolation campaigns. Additionally, cloning and heterologous expression of unusual biosynthetic gene clusters with non-canonical domain architectures might pave the way for identifying novel antibiotics that would have otherwise stayed undetected.</p><p>To further increase the number of rare taxa cultivated in droplets, we could charge the perfluorinated oil carrying dissolved gases with nitrogen or other gases during dynamic droplet incubation. Thereby, a microaerophilic or even anaerobic incubation would be enabled, which was recently shown to dramatically increase the species richness in droplets for human microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watterson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villa et al., 2020</xref>). We are also working on a less bulky droplet generation setup, which can be moved easily into an anaerobic chamber for anaerobic droplet generation. With that also obligate anaerobic bacteria like from the human or animal gut could be cultured. To conduct also the screening with bacterial reporter strains under anaerobic conditions, a more comprehensive adaptation of the screening system would be required, encompassing selection of anaerobic reporter strains and fluorescent proteins that do not need oxygen for maturation. Besides encapsulating single cells, several cells could be confined per droplet creating simplified multispecies communities, which have the potential to either support growth of dependent species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tanaka and Benno, 2015</xref>) or to exert a change in natural product biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molloy and Hertweck, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we here have isolated strains after one incubation round in droplets, but alternatively the emulsion can be broken under controlled conditions and a new droplet cultivation can be started from the pooled cell suspension. By passaging a community several times through the in-droplet cultivation, replicating organisms become enriched, and the chance of strain domestication increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollmann et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our cultivation and screening strategy has proven to be comprehensive and adaptable to the challenging needs of fastidious microorganisms representing interesting sources for natural products. Therefore, we envision that the bacterial diversity of numerous natural habitats, especially including environments with limited access to samples (e.g., patient biopsies), will be explored in more depth with our strategy. The combination of bacterial strain discovery during the in-droplet cultivation phase with subsequent selection of the most auspicious candidates for natural product biosynthesis through a highly robust reporter assay will streamline our efforts towards new scaffold structures for the development of antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microfluidic device fabrication and operation</title><p>Microfluidic chips were designed in AutoCAD 2015 (Autodesk Corp., USA).

Droplets were generated at 1500 Hz with a volume of 200 pL. One droplet population, which was incubated in one droplet incubator, comprised approximately 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> droplets. Droplet populations were generated with eight replicates and compared to eight plate sets. One plate set consisted of eight plates with 1:100 dilution of the soil community and seven plates with 1:1000 dilution. The conducted replicates are regarded as biological since independent cultivation experiments were started from one common soil cell extract. The chosen sample size represents a compromise between maximum available droplet incubation units and minimum required replicate number for maximum statistical power.</p><p>For each cultivation technique, three positive controls were prepared and incubated along with the soil community samples.

Afterwards, 0.3 volumes of 20% (w/v) SDS (Roth, Germany) were added, and precipitates removed by centrifugation. The cell lysate was extracted with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1, Roth, Germany). To remove phenol traces, the samples were further extracted three times with one volume of chloroform:isoamylalcohol (24:1, Roth, Germany). Finally, the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. DNA samples were mixed with 0.1 volume 3 M sodium acetate, 0.001 volume of 20 mg/mL glycogen, and 2.5 volumes of 98% (v/v) cold ethanol.

To detect chimera, the implemented uchime algorithm was used in combination with the SILVA reference database (release 128) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glöckner et al., 2017</xref>), which was also used to taxonomically classify the reads. For clustering into OTUs, the vsearch method ‘abundance-based greedy clustering’ and a distance cutoff of 0.03 were employed. Read numbers across all samples were subsampled in Mothur to 88,435 sequences to obtain better comparability. No sample outliers were detected or removed. The OTU table was further processed and visualized in R and with the R package phyloseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McMurdie and Holmes, 2013</xref>).

After 1 month, droplets were reinjected from the incubator into a microfluidic chip and spaced to a frequency of 10–50 Hz. All droplets were directed to a glass capillary (TSH, 100 µm ID, 360 µm OD, Molex, USA), which led to a positioning system (neMAXYS 200, cetoni GmbH, Germany). The tip of the capillary was attached to a z-steerable arm of the system, while an agar plate was positioned below on an x–y-steerable platform. Thereby, droplets were continuously deposited in a spiral pattern on an agar plate over which the outlet of the capillary was moved at 1 mm/s. Plates were incubated for 15 days at 20 °C, after which colonies were picked and streaked onto new agar plates.

A significant number of antibiotics currently in use are natural products that are part of the antibacterial arsenal of microorganisms found in nature. Most of these were discovered from rather readily culturable soil microorganisms. However, recent reports suggest that only a very small fraction of the microbiome diversity found in nature is culturable under standard growth conditions. Against this backdrop, this study provides a methodology that allows better cultivation of this bacterial diversity. The authors use a droplet-microfluidic platform to isolate and cultivate the bacterial cells in droplets. After the cultivation period, the droplets are either deposited on solid medium to enable growth of the microorganisms or are combined with reporter strains to screen for antimicrobial activity. Using this approach the authors demonstrate a higher and more diverse recovery of bacterial species when compared to standard plating techniques. Finally they screen the strains for production of antibiotic compounds by injecting reporter strains into the droplets. One isolate showing potent activity was then subjected to detailed characterization. LC-MS analysis of these compounds lead to their identification as previously described antibacterial polyketides, bacillaene A and B and the lipophilic molecules, surfactins. While these molecules have been reported earlier, it demonstrates the potential of the screening platform to identify new classes of antimicrobial compounds.</p><p>The approach and platform is quite exciting so it was a bit disappointing that after all the extensive characterization of the active compounds, it led to the identification of previously known antimicrobial species. Despite lacking any novel scientific findings, the platform itself is useful as it combines and simplifies several different steps required for isolation of environmental microbial species as well as antimicrobial compounds.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Cultivation of microbes is a requirement for functional exploration of any species. However, cultivation of bacteria is a hard problem. This paper describes the use of a microscale droplet based cultivation system that allows cultivation of increased bacterial diversity when compared to plate based system. The microdroplet system allows long incubation times and cultivation of species based on dilution to extinction principle. The dilution to extinction reduces mixed species growth (less than 7% droplets as per the data presented). Cultivated droplet allow diffusion of metabolites that may allow cross talk of metabolites between droplets. This may also help to increase retrieval of bacterial diversity. The cultivation system is conveniently combined with a screening system for antibiotic producing species. While the system overall appears attractive, several points needs to be clarified to better understand the results presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Mahler et al. describe an experimental approach using microdroplets to isolate and grow the different bacterial strains that can be found in a complex environment such as a soil sample. The advantage of this approach is that, probably due to the lack of competition and thanks to growth in a liquid environment, it is possible to enrich for strains that are not found when growth is taking place on a solid agar plate. For example, they show that about 60% of the taxa found after growth in the droplets are not found when the same sample is grown on agar. The enrichment of these rare taxa can be used to identify novel antibiotic producer strains. The authors provide an experimental approach using Gram positive and Gram negative reporter strains to screen the droplets for the presence of growth inhibitors within specific droplets isolated via on-chip sorting. Finally, the authors were able to increase the production titer of the natural products to identify possible growth inhibitor molecules by mass spectrometry. In my opinion the conclusions of this paper are supported well by the data. The approach outlined here will be very useful for a wide range of researchers interested in the characterization of complex bacterial communities, not only in soil, but also other environments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64774.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The microbial diversity presented is based on the 16S amplicon sequencing of samples after 28 days of incubation.

We even meant to do that as a mean of dereplication. Fast growing species are usually readily culturable and have been extensively screened in standard natural product screenings. Since the goal of our miniaturized droplet cultivation and screening was to make a new subset of the naturally occurring bacterial diversity available for screens, we specifically decided to choose conditions like low nutrient amounts and long incubation times that might help to culture less known species.</p><p>To follow the ratio of fast growers to slow growers, we monitored the growth of bacteria over time in droplets microscopically by determining the relative abundance of droplets with bacterial colonies inside as depicted in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Figure 1B shows an example for images derived in the counting procedure.</p><p>Fast growing species will still be detected by the 16S analysis after 28 days unless they completely lysed, which is generally unlikely. We sequenced after 28 days to get an understanding of the entirety of species diversity that grows in droplets without differentiation between fast- and slow growers. Our goal was to compare for the first time the overall cultivation outcome obtained in droplets and on agar plates. Indeed, for scientific interest, it would have been reasonable to sequence weekly sub-samples to differentiate fast from slow growers, but this was not in our focus.</p><p>We agree that some fast growers might not be metabolically active in droplets after 28 d anymore and in consequence might not be successfully isolated and upscaled, even though they might have produced antimicrobial substances. However, as just highlighted, fast growers have very likely been cultivated and screened before. For future work, we even discuss to deselect for fast growers by image-based droplet sorting within the first week to further reduce the chance of rediscovery of natural products. Also, even if the fast growers are not viable anymore, we would still benefit from the information that reporter cells have been inhibited by accumulated metabolites in combination with the genetic information of the producer strains (similar as for the cultures, which we lost again soon after isolation). The genetic information for metabolically inactive cells or species could be obtained by sorting droplets with inhibited reporters and depositing single droplets in wells for single cell genomics, even if they cannot be cultivated outside of droplets (anymore).</p><p>We are aware of the mentioned risk that active metabolites might not lead to an inhibition because leakage of the metabolites over droplet borders may dilute the concentration too much and this risk of course increases with time. On the other hand, this risk is higher for the fast growers than for the slow growers (i.e., is not so relevant for the group of interest). However, the droplet border also is not as permeable to as many metabolites as we might have made it appear. To clarify that matter, we included further information in the manuscript (see below). The more hydrophilic a metabolite, the less likely it is partitioning from the aqueous into the oil phase. This means, we might have a bias towards hydrophilic antibiotics in our screening, which could even be a strength, since the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria makes them resistant to a number of hydrophobic antimicrobials.</p><p>In conclusion, we agree that our screening is biasing for slow growers. We intended to do so, hypothesizing to find more rare and previously not screened species in the fraction of slow growers. Regarding the characterization of the cultivation outcome, we intended to describe the in-droplet cultivation in comparison to standard plate cultivation without distinguishing into slow and fast growers.</p><p>To increase the informative value of the manuscript on this topic and to further clarify these points, we included the following lines:</p><p>“We also specifically chose conditions like low nutrient amounts and long incubation times that might favor growth and metabolic activity of slow growing species over fast growing species. […] In future work, we even consider to actively deselect for fast growers by image-based droplet sorting within the first week to further reduce the chance of rediscovery of natural products.”</p><p>“It is noteworthy that the surfactant-stabilized droplet boundary, though forming a mechanical barrier to prevent cell cross contamination, is not completely abolishing molecular transport for all types of molecules. […] Interdroplet transport of molecules might also present an advantage in the cultivation phase. Allowing communication between species might preserve to some extent the growth-stimulating influence of multispecies communities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What fraction of species in the droplet is viable after 28 days incubation. Knowing this is important know whether the inhibition of the pathogen is solely because of direct bacterial competition, by metabolites or combination of both. A simple experiment that may answer this could be the measurement of ATP produced by growing species in the droplets.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid inhibition by nutrient competition/depletion, we have added the reporter strains in nutrient rich medium to the droplets, which is stated in the Discussion. We ensured while establishing the reporter assay that reporter cells bring with them enough nutrients to grow and produce a strong signal when a non-producer strain was encapsulated in the droplet before and co-consumed nutrients. Other ways of direct bacterial out competition might indeed be detected by the system, but might be also worth to investigate further. To confirm inhibition, the pool of resulting isolates can be tested with the reporter strain again in 96-well plates.</p><p>For our droplets, we are currently not able to read out ATP production and presence of cells at the same time reliably and in high throughput. We would need to have a high throughput method to detect the presence of bacteria independently of metabolic markers, because we would be interested in the ratio of metabolically active cells (ATP producing) to all cells (including metabolically inactive cells). General cell staining methods like membrane dyes are usually not giving intense enough readout signals for the inherent high droplet throughput. A reliable method compatible with our droplet system would be automated image analysis for marker free detection of bacterial colonies. Due to the simultaneous presence of soil particles in droplets, we could not yet develop an image analysis algorithm that distinguishes successfully between cells and soil particles. We are working on such an image analysis for follow up experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The strength of the system is that the cultivated droplets could be used for screening of antibiotic producing species. This approach possibly could be used for screening of other metabolite production as well. However, the leakage of metabolites produced by grown species in the metabolites is a drawback in the screening step. Could this issue be solved by sorting the droplets to another bulk vessel? This should remove diffused metabolites and should reveal inhibition by live bacteria vs. accumulated metabolites in the droplets. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>a) Leakage of metabolites is not as extensive as is assumed here. Only fairly hydrophobic or very small molecules will leak into the oil phase. We added information on that to an existing paragraph:</p><p>“It is noteworthy that the surfactant-stabilized droplet boundary, though forming a mechanical barrier to prevent cell cross contamination, is not completely abolishing molecular transport for all types of molecules. […] Allowing communication between species might preserve to some extent the growth-stimulating influence of multispecies communities.”</p><p>b) If metabolites leak, they leak constantly according to their partitioning coefficient for the water/oil interphase. Even after transferring droplets to another bulk vessel and continuing incubation, the (low) risk of droplet cross contamination would remain.</p><p>c) The oil surrounding the droplets works as bridge for leaking metabolites in a cross-over to other droplets. It is continuously pumped through the droplets in the incubation device, resulting in a constant droplet mixing. The comparatively large amount of oil used during incubation (~7 mL oil vs. ~200 pL of a single droplet, or for instance 1.8 µL of droplets when assuming that 1 in 1000 droplets contains a high producer) dilutes any metabolite and makes it unlikely that leaking metabolites have a chance to accumulate in a random other droplet to a minimum inhibitory concentration, especially since droplets change their neighboring droplets constantly. Theoretically, it would also be possible, to regularly exchange the oil phase completely during incubation, however, because of the high intrinsic dilution effect, we don’t think this is necessary. Additionally, our inoculation density to reach single cell inoculations results in ~80 % of droplets being empty, which again lowers the chance of any effective levels of interdroplet transfer. We hypothesize therefore that the risk of missing metabolites due to leakage is much higher than false positively selecting droplets with inhibited reporter due to metabolite accumulation away from the producer. We have summarized these thoughts in the manuscript (see copy above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The soil samples after culturing in droplets are plated on solid agar medium to allow growth and characterization. Considering that some of the microorganisms that have grown in the droplets are probably incapable of growing on solid media, maybe it could be useful to inoculate the droplets into microwells containing liquid recovery medium for improved recovery and follow-up characterization of the strains. Was this done? If not, please insert some comments/discussion around solid versus liquid culturability.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that deposition of droplets in microwells with liquid medium is favorable and we are working on that. However, the technical setup is more complex and needs more optimization to guarantee that only a single droplet is deposited in a well. We extended an already existing paragraph in the Discussion to increase comprehensibility.</p><p>&quot;Nevertheless, the overall taxonomic distribution found after in-droplet cultivation could not be recovered with our droplet depositioning and isolation procedure on agar plates. […] Consequently, we are currently developing other upscaling strategies into liquid culture like droplet deposition in microtiter plate-wells&quot;</p><p>We also included another idea to achieve strain domestication in a liquid environment:</p><p>“Furthermore, we here have isolated strains after one incubation round in droplets but alternatively, the emulsion can be broken under controlled conditions and a new droplet cultivation can be started from the pooled cell suspension. By passaging a community several times through the in-droplet cultivation, replicating organisms become enriched, and the chance of strain domestication increases [Bollmann, Lewis and Epstein, 2007].”</p></body></sub-article></article>
