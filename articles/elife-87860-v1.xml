complexes (MTC) comprising a catalytic subunit and at least five additional proteins. The yeast MTC is critical for meiosis and was known to comprise three proteins, of which two were conserved. We uncover three novel MTC components (Kar4/Ygl036w-Vir1/Dyn2). All MTC subunits, except for Dyn2, are essential for m6A deposition and have corresponding mammalian MTC orthologues. Unlike the mammalian bipartite MTC, the yeast MTC is unipartite, yet multifunctional. The mRNA interacting module, comprising Ime4, Mum2, Vir1, and Kar4, exerts the MTC’s m6A-independent function, while Slz1 enables the MTC catalytic function in m6A deposition. Both functions are critical for meiotic progression. Kar4 also has a mechanistically separate role from the MTC during mating. The yeast MTC constituents play distinguishable m6A-dependent, MTC-dependent, and MTC-independent functions, highlighting their complexity and paving the path towards dissecting multi-layered MTC functions in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>N6-methyladenosine</kwd><kwd>methyltransferase complex</kwd><kwd>m6A</kwd><kwd>MTC</kwd><kwd>Ime4</kwd><kwd>Vir1</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>sporulation</kwd><kwd>Kar4</kwd><kwd>Slz1</kwd><kwd>Mum2</kwd><kwd>Dyn2</kwd><kwd>VIRMA</kwd><kwd>ZC3H13</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ensinck</surname><given-names>Imke</given-names></name><name><surname>van Werven</surname><given-names>Folkert J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sideri</surname><given-names>Theodora</given-names></name><name><surname>Albihlal</surname><given-names>Waleed S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ensinck</surname><given-names>Imke</given-names></name><name><surname>van Werven</surname><given-names>Folkert J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sideri</surname><given-names>Theodora</given-names></name><name><surname>Albihlal</surname><given-names>Waleed S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ensinck</surname><given-names>Imke</given-names></name><name><surname>van Werven</surname><given-names>Folkert J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sideri</surname><given-names>Theodora</given-names></name><name><surname>Albihlal</surname><given-names>Waleed S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>913/21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maman</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Schraga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>714023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maman</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Schraga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101000970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maman</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Schraga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In mammals, the deposition of m6A occurs at DRACH motifs throughout transcripts that are distant from splice sites, biasing this modification towards long internal and last exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uzonyi et al., 2023</xref>). The presence of m6A on mRNA primarily impacts mRNA stability but has also been linked to a wide array of additional molecular outcomes, and its disruption is associated with diverse phenotypes ranging from immune dysfunction to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murakami and Jaffrey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>METTL3, which forms a hetero dimer complex with METTL14, is the catalytic unit of the MTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Several auxiliary proteins that interact with METTL3/METTL14 are required for the deposition of m6A. These include the scaffold proteins WTAP and VIRMA, E3 ligase HAKAI, ZCH13H3, and RNA binding proteins RBM15/RBM15b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bawankar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knuckles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ping et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). Structural and topological analyses of the mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> MTCs revealed that MTCs can be divided into two subcomplexes: (1) the m6A METTL complex (MAC) which consists of METTL3/METTL14, and an (2) m6A-METTL-associated complex (MACOM) consisting of WTAP, VIRMA, HAKAI, ZCH13H3, and RBM15/RBM15b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lence et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Su et al., 2022</xref>).

Like in mammals, m6A-modified mRNAs are turned over more rapidly compared to unmodified mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushkin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scutenaire et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varier et al., 2022</xref>). The decay of m6A transcripts requires active translation and is mediated by the YTH domain containing protein Pho92/Mrb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varier et al., 2022</xref>). Several studies have shown that preventing the m6A modification at single meiotic transcripts can cause defects in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushkin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scutenaire et al., 2022</xref>). However, the exact function of the m6A modification in yeast meiosis remains elusive. In yeast, Ime4 has both m6A-dependent and m6A-independent functions in meiosis as a catalytically inactive mutant of Ime4 shows milder delay in meiotic progression compared to the Ime4 deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The fact that MTCs in mammals, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and plants harbour at least six conserved protein subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) motivated us to re-examine the composition of the yeast MTC. Here we uncover and characterize three novel components of the yeast MTC (Kar4, Ygl036w/Vir1, and Dyn2). We further demonstrate that Kar4 and Vir1, and potentially also Slz1, a previously known component, are orthologues of known components of the mammalian MTC (METTL14, VIRMA, and ZCH13H3, respectively). In total, five members of the yeast MTC likely have orthologues matching the mammalian MTC. We show that Ime4, Mum2, Vir1, and Kar4 form a stable complex on mRNAs required for meiotic progression, while the Slz1 subunit is essential for m6A deposition but not for MTC integrity. The composition of the yeast MTC is considerably more similar to its mammalian counterparts than previously thought. Our findings also suggest that in contrast to mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the yeast MTC has no MAC and MACOM arrangement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Mum2 (and Kar4)-interacting proteins</title><p>The inconsistency in the composition of the yeast MTC, comprising only three known components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>), in comparison to its mammalian, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and plant MTC counterparts all comprising at least six conserved proteins (seven in the case of mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>), prompted us to re-evaluate the yeast MTC using a proteomics approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We generated a yeast strain with the conserved scaffold protein in MTCs, Mum2, fused to the ProA-tag followed by a TEV cleavage sequence at the carboxy terminus. Subsequently, we performed immunoprecipitation with the ProA-tag in protein extracts generated from cells staged in early meiosis followed by elution with the TEV protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As expected, Ime4 was strongly enriched in the Mum2 IP-MS analysis. We also identified two other proteins that were strongly enriched, Ygl036w and Kar4. Two additional RNA-binding proteins, Pab1 and Npl3, and light chain dynein protein, Dyn2, were significantly enriched in the Mum2 IP, albeit to a lesser extent (log<sub>2</sub> protein intensity fold change [FC] &gt; 2, and -log <italic>t</italic>-test p-value&gt;1). Noteworthy, Slz1, a known component of the MIS complex, was not significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that Kar4 and Ygl036w are integral parts of the yeast MTC, we performed a Kar4 IP-MS using a similar setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The Mum2-IP MS analysis identified Ime4, Ygl036w, Kar4, Slz1, and Dyn2 in both control and RNAse-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We conclude that Ime4, Ygl036w, Kar4, Slz1, and Dyn2 interact with Mum2 in an RNA-independent manner, while Pab1 interaction with Mum2 is RNA-dependent and hence indirect. These data suggest that Kar4, Ygl036w, and Dyn2 are MTC components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Kar4, Ygl036w, and Slz1 are essential for m6A deposition</title><p>Next, we determined whether known members and newly identified interactors are required for m6A deposition. Previous work showed that m6A deposition is severely reduced in deletion mutants of two components of the MIS complex: <italic>IME4</italic> and <italic>MUM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>). To confirm these previous findings, we determined m6A levels in diploid cells undergoing early meiosis (4 hr in sporulation medium [SPO]) harbouring gene deletion in <italic>MUM2</italic> and <italic>IME4</italic> (<italic>mum2</italic>Δ and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ). Both deletion mutants showed a severe reduction in m6A over A levels as determined by LC-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ensinck et al., 2023</xref>). We also quantified m6A levels in an <italic>SLZ1</italic> deletion strain. We found that <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells showed a similar reduction in m6A levels as <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells (LC-MS), suggesting that Slz1 is also required for m6A deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The analysis contrasts previous work that showed only a partial reduction in m6A levels in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>). One possibility for the discrepancy is that <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells had a delay in m6A accumulation during early meiosis, and possibly m6A accumulation occurs later in meiosis in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells. However, m6A levels in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells did not accumulate at any time in the 12 hr following meiotic induction and showed background levels similar to <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, Kar4 is known to act as a transcription factor important for the mating response pathway; however, no clear mechanistic role for Kar4 in meiosis has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurihara et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, high-throughput studies suggest that the <italic>KAR4</italic> deletion negatively affects meiosis and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deutschbauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003</xref>). Based on sequence homology analysis, Kar4 has been proposed to be the yeast orthologue of METTL14, a critical component of MTCs in mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and plants. Phylogenetic analysis of methyltransferase domains showed that Kar4 and METTL14 belong to the same subfamily, but are relatively different from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bujnicki et al., 2002</xref>). Since METTL14 is considered a structural subunit in the METTL3/METTL14 heterodimer, we hypothesized that Kar4 may play a related role in m6A deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We found that like <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells entering meiosis, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ cells showed no detectable m6A levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether Ygl036w, Dyn2, and the other identified Mum2-interacting proteins (Pab1 and Npl3) are important for m6A deposition, we performed m6A-ELISA and m6A-seq2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Both analyses by m6A-ELISA and m6A-seq2 showed that <italic>ygl036w</italic>Δ had no detectable m6A levels, similar to <italic>ime4</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Additionally, <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ had reduced m6A levels (50% of WT) as detected by m6A ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Pab1 is an essential gene and Npl3 is essential for entry into meiosis. To examine whether the two are required for m6A deposition, we depleted both proteins using the auxin-induced degron (AID) system during meiosis (Figure S2). To obtain efficient depletion in meiosis, we let cells enter early meiosis (2 hr SPO) and subsequently induced depletion of Pab1 (<italic>PAB1-AID</italic>) or Npl3 (<italic>NPL3-AID</italic>) for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a control, we also depleted Slz1 (<italic>SLZ1-AID</italic>). We found that depletion of Pab1 and Npl3 showed no significant reduction in m6A levels compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As expected, depletion of Slz1 showed a strong reduction in m6A. Also given that Pab1 and Npl3 interactions with Mum2 were RNA-dependent or not reproducible (in the case of Npl3), both RNA-binding proteins are likely not part of the yeast MTC. We conclude that in addition to Ime4 and Mum2, Slz1, Kar4, and Ygl036w are all essential for m6A deposition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional characterization of Mum2 interactors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT, <italic>ime4</italic>Δ, and <italic>ygl036w</italic>Δ cells (FW1511, FW7030, FW9307) were induced to enter meiosis.

However, it does not exclude the possibility that other proteins might be required for MTC assembly. Therefore, we co-expressed all five subunits essential for m6A (Ime4, Kar4, Mum2, Vir1, Slz1) in insect cells. Subsequently, we performed a single-step affinity purification using the Strep-tag system with a Strep-tag II fused to the amino-terminal domain of Ime4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We reasoned that the availability of three (Vir1, Kar4, Dyn2) new additional components of the MTC complex might allow us to distinguish between these possibilities.

We took samples at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hr following meiotic induction, which covers the early and middle phases of the yeast sporulation programme. For the analysis, we compared WT, <italic>ime4</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ, and <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ. The experiment allowed us to assess more precisely which stage of meiosis was affected in the different deletion mutants of the m6A writer complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Two approaches were taken to analyse the data. First, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering across all time points and all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Second, we assessed gene expression across different gene clusters in meiosis described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 1998</xref>). These genes clusters represent the early metabolic genes (cluster C1), early meiotic genes (clusters C2 and C3), early to middle meiotic genes (cluster C4), and middle meiotic genes (cluster C5), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with the meiotic phenotypes, we found that <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ displayed the most severe expression phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is most pronounced between the 4-to-6-hr time points, where <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ remained staggered at cluster C2, whereas WT transitioned into clusters C4 and C5. The fact that the different MTC mutants clustered together is highly suggestive of a function common to all of them, as opposed to moonlighting functions of individual components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Also consistent with the phenotypic analysis, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ showed a mild delay, distinct from the remaining mutants, whereas <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ showed little difference in comparison to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, despite the general lack of differences between the strains at the 2 hr time point, the histone genes, <italic>HHF2</italic> and <italic>HTB2</italic>, were significantly reduced in expression in five of the deletion mutants (<italic>ime4</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2Δ</italic>, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ), potentially hinting at an early role of the MTC complex in regulation of histone levels, reminiscent of recent findings in planaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we determined whether the m6A-dependent decay function is reflected in the RNA-seq dataset. Recent work showed that the sole m6A reader protein in yeast Mrb1/Pho92 controls the decay of m6A-modified mRNAs during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varier et al., 2022</xref>). We used an iCLIP dataset that identified the mRNAs associated by Pho92 in an m6A-dependent manner to assess how these mRNAs were affected throughout the time course in WT and deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varier et al., 2022</xref>). Using this subset of the transcripts, we observed that in WT cells these transcripts were generally induced up to the 2 hr time point, following which their levels declined. In contrast, in all five deletion mutants essential for m6A (<italic>ime4</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2Δ</italic>, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ), their levels failed to decline after their initial induction at 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistent with the m6A and meiotic phenotype, the <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ only showed marginal difference compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A control set of randomly chosen transcripts did not display a difference between the WT and the deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These data support the m6A-dependent function of the MTC complex subunits, which is to m6A modify mRNAs for decay via Pho92 during early yeast meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varier et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these analyses suggest that Kar4, Mum2, Vir1, and Ime4 play a dual role in controlling the expression program of meiosis via both m6A-dependent and m6A-independent yet MTC-complex-dependent functions, in contrast to Slz1 exhibiting only an m6A-dependent function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The molecular functions of Kar4 in meiosis and mating differ</title><p>Kar4 has been shown to be important for controlling transcription of genes involved in the mating pathway in yeast. When haploid cells sense mating pheromone, Kar4 is induced and is recruited to promoters predominantly controlled by the transcription factor Ste12 to activate transcription of genes involved in the mating pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gammie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurihara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lahav et al., 2007</xref>). Our above-described findings reveal that Kar4 is also an integral component of the yeast MTC and important for meiosis. We therefore wondered whether the mating and meiotic functions might be mediated via a shared mechanism. Under such a scenario, Kar4’s roles in mating might require the additional MTC components, and – conversely – the role of Kar4 in meiosis might be mediated via binding to chromatin. Under the latter scenario, we speculated that Kar4 might function in directing the MTC to chromatin to facilitate co-transcriptional m6A deposition, which could be consistent with one of the proposed modes of action of METTL14 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To examine this, we first tested whether Ime4, Slz1, or Mum2 are expressed during mating.

However, Ime4 and Mum2 expression was not elevated and Slz1 expression was not detected at all upon pheromone treatment. We also examined whether Kar4 expression during mating was dependent on the components of the MIS complex as observed in meiosis. We found that Kar4 levels were unaffected in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ, and <italic>mum2</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In line with protein expression data, we found that Kar4 was bound to the <italic>AGA1</italic> promoter upon mating pheromone treatment as determined by ChIP, while other MTC subunits (Ime4, Mum2, Slz1) showed no enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aymoz et al., 2018</xref>).

While Kar4 was bound to 800 genomic locations in <italic>MAT</italic>a cells treated with α-factor, only a few Kar4 peaks were detected during meiosis in <italic>MAT</italic>a/α cells (&lt;10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). As expected, Kar4 ChIP-seq peaks were enriched for the Ste12-binding sites (motif 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), but other motifs were also identified, perhaps indicating that Kar4 can bind to promoters in a Ste12-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In line with Kar4, ChIP-seq of Ime4, Mum2, and Slz1 showed no enrichment throughout the genome during meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As a control, we included ChIP-seq of the key meiotic transcriptional regulator Ume6 under the same conditions, which showed, as expected, enrichment at over 1000 genomic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chia et al., 2021</xref>). Lastly, we examined whether the Ste12 transcription factor, which is important for Kar4 recruitment during mating, plays a role in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurihara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lahav et al., 2007</xref>). We found that <italic>ste12</italic>Δ did not affect the onset of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The above results thus rule out the requirement of additional MTC components during mating and further rule out a Kar4-mediated association of the yeast MTC with chromatin during early meiosis. We conclude that the Kar4 function in the MTC during meiosis differs from its known role as transcription regulator in the mating response pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Kar4 stabilizes the MTC on mRNAs</title><p>Given the different roles of Kar4 in meiosis and mating, and that Kar4 was not required for stabilization of Ime4, we sought to better understand the molecular role played by Kar4 in the MTC complex during meiosis. Specifically, we examined whether Kar4 was required for allowing Ime4 to associate with mRNAs.</p><p>We assessed RNA binding of the m6A writer complex in cells staged in early meiosis. We applied RNA-protein interaction capture after chemical crosslinking to purify protein-RNA complexes from cells after short and mild crosslinking with formaldehyde using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The assay revealed that both Ime4 and Kar4 efficiently co-purify with mRNA following RNAse elution from the beads, while pull-down from extracts pre-treated with RNAse did not show Ime4 and Kar4 signals with immunoblot as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As an orthogonal approach, we performed photo-activatable UV crosslinking to determine whether RNA associate with Kar4. The analysis revealed Kar4 can crosslink to RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, Ime4 and Kar4 can both associate with mRNAs during early meiosis.</p><p>Next, we assessed whether Ime4 association with mRNAs is regulated by Kar4, Slz1, and Mum2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). We applied RNA-protein interaction capture on extracts from <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, and <italic>mum2</italic>Δ cells that were induced to enter meiosis. After the polyA pull-down, and elution with RNase, Ime4 was specifically enriched to comparable degrees in both the control and <italic>slz1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). In contrast, Ime4 association to mRNAs was reduced in <italic>kar4</italic>Δ cells with the no effect on Ime4 levels in input. Given Mum2’s stabilizing role in the yeast MTC, the Ime4 signal in <italic>mum2</italic>Δ cells was greatly reduced in both input and eluate from polyA pull-down. The Pab1 protein signal, which served as a positive control for RNA binding, did not differ across the different samples. These data suggest that Kar4 is important for stabilizing the interaction between Ime4 (and likely the whole MTC) and mRNAs, and that Slz1 is not required for this.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous work showed that the yeast MTC consists of only three subunits (Mum2, Ime4, Slz1), which contrasted the six or seven subunits described for MTCs in mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and plants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we showed that the yeast MTC comprises six subunits of which five are essential for m6A deposition and have orthologues in the mammalian MTC. While the yeast MTC subunits are considerably more conserved than previously described, our findings suggest that the MTC is configured differently compared to the mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts (see below). The yeast MTC exerts both m6A-dependent and -independent functions that are both crucial for yeast meiosis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Composition and features of the yeast MTC</title><p>Our analysis suggests that five subunits of the yeast MTC have orthologues in mammalian MTCs (Ime4/METTL3, Kar4/METTL14, Mum2/WTAP, Vir1/VIRMA, and potentially also Slz1/ZC3H13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the composition of the yeast MTC is more conserved than previously described; however, we propose that the yeast MTC subunits are configured differently in a complex. The mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> MTCs are configured into MAC (METTL3 and METTL14) and MACOM (WTAP, VIRMA, ZC3H13, HAKAI, and RBM15) complexes, of which MAC harbours the catalytic activity and MACOM is critical for stimulating MAC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knuckles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Su et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with the presence of two complexes, diverse studies over the years have reported that METTL3 and METTL14 mutually stabilize each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, subunits of the MACOM complex (e.g. WTAP and VIRMA) mutually stabilize each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). However, depletion of components in one of subcomplex was not reported to impact the integrity of the other subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). In yeast, we show that five subunits (Mum2, Ime4, Vir1, Kar4, and Slz1) are essential for m6A deposition and form a stable complex. We also provide evidence that the yeast MTC subunits Ime4, Mum2, and Vir1 stabilize each other and Kar4, indicating that in yeast the MAC and MACOM subunits are interweaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This interweaved arrangement of the yeast MTC is accompanied also by loss of a mutual stabilizing interaction between Ime4 and Kar4, which is in contrast to their mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of the yeast methyltransferase complexes (MTC).</title><p>Comparison of the yeast and the human MTCs.

Like its mammalian/<italic>Drosophila</italic>/plant counterparts, Vir1 has a central role in the MTC and m6A deposition. Structurally, Vir1 and VIRMA showed strong conservation; however, Vir1 does not contain the VIRMA domain, which is thought to bridge the interaction between HAKAI and Fl2(d) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bawankar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The absence of this domain may underlie the lack of a discernible HAKAI orthologue in yeast. We showed that in yeast Vir1 stabilizes Mum2, Ime4, and Kar4, and that it is stabilized by Mum2 and Ime4. This contrasts with the mammalian MTC, where VIRMA and WTAP stabilize each other, but not METTL3 and METTL14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yue et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Though Kar4 has been proposed to be the METTL14 orthologue in yeast, no molecular function in meiosis and in m6A deposition for yeast Kar4 was described previously. Here we showed that Kar4 is a critical subunit of the yeast MTC. Like METTL14, Kar4 is essential for m6A deposition and facilitates mRNA binding of the yeast MTC in vivo. We speculate that that the role of Kar4 in bridging mRNA binding of the yeast MTC is critical since in yeast the MTC likely does not harbour a designed RNA binding protein such as RBM15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patil et al., 2016</xref>). This function of Kar4 is perhaps related to how METTL14 stabilizes METTL3 on mRNAs in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We found that Slz1 shows some sequence similarities with ZC3H13 in humans, suggesting that Slz1 and ZC3H13 are possible orthologues despite being very different in size. Previous work showed that Slz1 is required for localizing the yeast MTC to the nucleus, which is also consistent with findings for ZC3H13 in mammals where it also is important for MTC nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wen et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Flacc (ZC3H13/Slz1) bridges the interaction between Nito (RBM15) and the MTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knuckles et al., 2018</xref>). However, our analysis failed to identify a yeast orthologue for Nito (RBM15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knuckles et al., 2018</xref>). Slz1 does not seem to be important for MTC association with mRNAs and is dispensable for the m6A-independent role of the MTC. However, Slz1 is essential for driving the m6A deposition reaction since cells lacking Slz1 showed no m6A. Recent structural work on the human MTC showed that ZC3H13 facilitates a conformational change in VIRMA and WTAP, which may be important for m6A deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Su et al., 2022</xref>). The relevance of such a role in yeast remains to be confirmed.</p><p>Our analysis showed that dynein light chain protein, Dyn2, is a subunit of the yeast MTC. Despite the small size of Dyn2, we identified Dyn2 in all Mum2-IP-MS experiments. Moreover, the interaction between Dyn2 and the yeast MTC Mum2 is RNA independent but requires Slz1. In contrast to the remaining components, loss of Dyn2 led to a partial loss of mRNA methylation accompanied by a very mild meiotic phenotype. We therefore decided to primarily focus on the remaining components in this study. However, it is worth noting that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> a dynein light chain protein Dlc1 is involved in stabilizing the m6A writer Mett10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorsett and Schedl, 2009</xref>). More work is needed to dissect the role of Dyn2 in the yeast MTC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multifunctionality of the yeast MTC</title><p>Previous studies have pointed at m6A-dependent and m6A-independent roles played by Ime4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2002</xref>). These conclusions were primarily guided by the differences in phenotypes between <italic>IME4</italic> deletion and an <italic>IME4</italic> catalytic inactive mutant, both of which abolish methylation but are associated with phenotypes of distinct severity. The nature of such m6A-independent roles had been so far unknown. Such a phenotype could be ‘MTC complex independent,’ that is, mediated via a completely new function of ime4, unrelated not only to its catalytic activity but also to its participation in the methylation complex. Alternatively, such a phenotype could be MTC-dependent. The discovery of additional components of the yeast MTC allowed us to uncover that the substantially more severe phenotype of the <italic>IME4</italic> deletion mutant was shared also upon loss of other components of the yeast MTC, strongly suggestive of an MTC-dependent function. These results suggest that an intact MTC is critical for yeast meiosis, independent of its ability to methylate RNA. In this sense, these results are reminiscent of studies conducted on diverse proteins playing a role in modifying the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA), often revealing that catalytically inactive mutations display considerably less pronounced phenotypes than full deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Létoquart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leulliot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2008</xref>). In such cases, there was no moonlighting activity of the modifying enzyme reported, but instead the modifying enzyme played a scaffolding or chaperoning role, for which its catalytic activity was not essential.</p><p>m6A-independent functions have been reported for METTL3 and METTL14 of the mammalian MTC; however, to our knowledge no role for an inactive but intact MTC in mammals has been documented so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to the m6A-dependent and -independent roles of the yeast MTC in meiosis, Kar4 also has a separate function where it acts as a transcription factor in mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurihara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lahav et al., 2007</xref>).

Additionally, the same group showed in two different studies that Kar4 has an important role in controlling gene expression in meiosis, and elegantly identified separation of function mutants that affect either the mating or meiotic function of Kar4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2023c</xref>).

The supernatant was dried by vacuum centrifugation, and the samples were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoro acetic acid. 1–10 μl of acidified protein digest was loaded on an Ultimate 3000 nanoRSLC HPLC (Thermo Scientific) onto a 20 mm × 75 um Pepmap C18 trap column (Thermo Scientific) prior to elution via a 50 cm × 75 um EasySpray C18 column into a Lumos Tribrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A 70 min gradient of 6–40% B was used followed by washing and re-equilibration (A = 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid; B = 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid). The Orbitrap was operated in ‘Data Dependent Acquisition’ mode followed by MS/MS in ‘TopS’ mode using the vendor-supplied ‘universal method’ with default parameters. Raw files were processed using Maxquant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://maxquant.org">maxquant.org</ext-link>) and Perseus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://maxquant.net/perseus">maxquant.net/perseus</ext-link>) with a recent download of the UniProt <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> reference proteome database and a common contaminants database. A decoy database of reversed sequences was used to filter false positives, at a peptide false detection rate of 1%. <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed with a permutation-based FDR of 5% to address multiple hypothesis testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fluorescence microscopy and image quantification</title><p>Kar4-mNeongreen and Htb2-mCherry image acquisition was conducted using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope. Exposure times were set as follows: 500 ms GFP, and 50 ms mCherry. An ORCA-FLASH 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu) and NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon) were used to collect images. Quantification of fluorescence signals was performed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). ROIs were manually drawn around the periphery of each cell or around the nucleus. The mean intensity in each channel per cell was determined and used for the analysis. Values for nuclear protein localisation were derived via the division of nuclear/whole cell signal. For the analyses, 50 cells were quantified per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>m6A-mRNA quantification by LC-MS/MS and m6A-ELISA</title><p>RNA was extracted and DNase treated as described above and polyA RNA isolated after purification twice with oligodT dynabeads (Ambion, 61005) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. M6A LC-MS was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varier et al., 2022</xref>). In short, polyA selected RNA was digested with addition of reaction buffer (2.5 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na acetate), two units of nuclease P1 (Sigma, N8630), and incubated for 4 hr at 37°C. Followed by 2 hr with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 1 μl alkaline phosphatase (NEB, M0525). Formic acid was added to the reaction mixture and filtered with a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. The sample was then injected (20 μl) and analysed by LC-MS/MS using a reverse-phase liquid chromatography C18 column and a triple quadrupole mass analyser (Agilent 6470 or Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantiva) instrument in positive electrospray ionisation mode. Flow rate was at 0.2 ml/min and column temperature 25°C with the following gradient: 2 min 98% eluent A (0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate in water) and 2% eluent B (0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate in MeOH), 75% A and 25% B up to 10 min, 20% A and 80% B up to 15 min, 98% A and 2% B up to 22.5 min. Nucleosides were quantified using a calibration curve of pure nucleosides standards.</p><p>For ELISA, we either used the EpiQuik m6A RNA methylation quantification kit from EpiGentek (P-9005) according to the manufacturer’s protocol or an m6A ELISA protocol previous described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ensinck et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Chemical crosslinking RNA-protein interactome capture</title><p>To determine Ime4 and Kar4 binding to mRNAs, we adapted an RNA-protein interactome protocol using chemical crosslinking instead of UV crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matia-González et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Na et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patton et al., 2020</xref>).

This complex was known to contain three proteins, but is much more complex in mammals, insects and plants. Through IP-MS analysis they identified three more proteins Kar4, Ygl036w and Dyn2. Of these Kar4 and Ygl036w are homologous to Mettl14 and Virma, respectively, and, like the previously described factors are essential for m6A deposition, mating and binding of the reader Pho92 to mRNA during meiosis by evidence acquired with appropriate methodology. Dyn2 is a novel factor not described for any m6A complex and is not essential for m6A deposition, mating and binding of the reader Pho92 to mRNA during meiosis.</p><p>In addition, detailed analysis of the Slz1 revealed homology to the mammalian factor m6A complex member ZC3H13 to comprise a conserved complex of five proteins, Mettl3, Mettl14, Mum2/WTAP, Virma and Slz/ZC3H13. When co-expressed in insects cells, they co-purify stoichiometrically and presence of Mum2 as a dimer is also indicated as shown for WTAP.</p><p>Complementary to these data they show that stability of the individual complex members is affected in mutants supporting that they are stabilized through complex formation.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors then show that kar4 has additional roles in mating that is separable from its role through the m6A complex in meiosis.</p><p>The authors employ appropriate methodology throughout to address their aims and present convincing evidence for their claims.

While MTC in mammals/flies/plants consists of at least six subunits, yeast MTC was known to contain only three proteins. Ensinck, Maman, et al. revisited this question using a proteomic approach and uncovered three new yeast MTC components, Kar4/Ygl036w/Dyn2. By applying sequence and structure comparisons, they identified Kar4, Ygl036w, Slz1 as homologs of the mammalian METTL14, VIRMA. ZC3H13, respectively. While these proteins are essential for m6A deposition, the dynein light chain protein, Dyn2, is not involved in mRNA methylation. Interestingly, while mammalian and fly MTCs are configured as MAC (METTL3 and METTL14) and MACOM (other subunits) complexes, yeast MTC subunits appear to have different configurations. Finally, Kar4 has a different role as transcription regulator in mating, which is not mediated by other MTC members. These data establish fundamental framework for the yeast MTC and also provide novel insights for those studying m6A deposition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This study is well presented and contains all the necessary experiments to support their claims. They made the interesting finding of an additional factor Dyn2. However, it is unclear whether it is present in the human complex. Hence, it would be interesting to see whether Dyn2 co-purifies when expressed with the other complex components in insect cells. Also, purification of a tagged complex from yeast would have indicated whether Dyn2 is part of the complex and whether other factors, like RBM15 or Hakai, present in humans are also present in yeast.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Dyn2 subunit is an exciting new finding that is worth further investigation. The IP-MS experiments suggest that Dyn2 is subunit of the complex and that the Dyn2 interaction is mediated via Slz1. We also noticed a reduction in m6A levels (50%) in the dyn2 deletion mutant. What the function of Dyn2 is and whether it is conserved remains to be determined.</p><p>Our IP-MS experiments with Mum2 identified the complex as described in the manuscript, however we did not find evidence of orthologs of RBM15 and Hakai. More follow up work is needed using in vivo and in vitro assays are needed to determine how m6A by the yeast MTC is regulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P3 top: Although m6A is the most abundant internal methylation variant, it is far below the methylation levels of cap-adjacent nucleotides in mammalian mRNAs (PMID: 35970556 ).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the word “internal” to the first sentence of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A list of author contributions is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Most of the conclusions of this paper are well supported by data, and the text is clearly written and easy to read. Here are my suggestions and comments:</p><p>1. In Fig.2, why not use LC-MS to measure m6A levels in Ygl036w, Dyn2, Pab1, Npl3 mutants, as in Fig.1?</p></disp-quote><p>For measuring m6A levels, we use combination of LC-MS and m6A ELISA and m6A-seq2 throughout the manuscript. We used ELISA in the Fig2 because we had established this assay in the lab (Ensinck et al, RNA Journal, 2023). M6A-ELISA technique was more accessible and easier to execute compared to LC-MS. Additionally our collaborator for the LC-MS moved his lab to another country, which made it impractical to continue the use of LC-MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The protein purification experiment described in Fig. 4D is informative. Can they include Dyn2 in the expression system as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Dyn2 was not the focus of the manuscript as Dyn2 has, at best, only a minor role in m6A deposition in vivo. We are also currently aiming to dissect how Dyn2 regulates m6A and the yeast MTC in follow up work. Hence we decided not to add more experiments on Dyn2 to the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Among the MTC components identified in this study, Dyn2 is a new and interesting subunit. It was shown that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Dlc1 is involved in stabilizing the m6A writer Mett10. I wonder if yeast has a homolog of C. elegans Mett10?</p></disp-quote><p>As far as we know, there is no ortholog identified of Mett10 (METTL16 in mammals) in budding yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors have emphasized &quot;the m6A dependent and independent functions&quot;; however, this is only based on previous observations. Is it possible that the less severe phenotype associated with ime4 catalytic mutant is due to residual catalytic activity? I think the data presented in Fig. 5 tell us that Ime4 and other MTC subunits have no additional moonlighting function. It is not entirely clear to me what &quot;the m6A-independent function&quot; is.</p></disp-quote><p>The observation that the yeast MTC complex has m6A dependent and independent function is based on the previous observations and the current work. In Agarwala et al 2012 PLOS Genetics, it was shown that mum2 and ime4 deletion mutants have more severe phenotype than slz1 deletion mutant or the catalytically inactive mutant of Ime4. We confirmed these observations in the revised manuscript (see Figure S5A and S5B). In this work, we showed that kar4 and vir1 deletion mutants have comparable delay in the onset of meiosis as mum2 and ime4 deletion mutants. Also, the MTC remains intact with absence of Slz1, but falls apart in ime4D, mum2D, vir1D or showed strongly reduced RNA binding (kar4 deletion mutant). Based on this we conclude that an m6A independent function of the MTC exists.</p><p>We have included data demonstrating that the catalytically inactive mutant has no residual m6A and a milder meiotic phenotype compared to the ime4 deletion mutant (see Figure S5A and S5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Mum2-TEV-ProA IP (1B) and Kar4-TEV-ProA IP (S1A), Slz1 was not significantly enriched; however, in the repeated Mum2-TEV-ProA IP with/without RNAse (S1B, 4C), Slz1 was strongly enriched. Why are the Slz1 results so variable?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute observation, for which we do not have a definitive answer. One possibility is that Slz1 is the only subunit that is induced during meiosis. It is possible that induction of Slz1 varied between the different IP-MS experiments, hence leading to variability in its association with the MTC complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The last paragraph on page 11, &quot;Collectively...&quot;, and the first paragraph on page 12, &quot;Collectively...&quot;, seem redundant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the duplicated paragraph in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
