Previous research has established a connection between cellular senescence and periodontitis. However, the role and mechanism of cell senescence in the progression of periodontitis have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to explore the involvement of cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and determine the underlying mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that senescent cells accumulated during the progress of periodontitis in both human samples and mice models. Moreover, several scRNA-seq analyses suggested that gingival fibroblasts were the main cell population undergoing cellular senescence during human periodontitis, which helps mitigate tissue damage and bone loss. Furthermore, we identified a high expression of CD81 in the senescent gingival fibroblast population. These cells were found to actively contribute to inflammation through their potent pro-inflammatory metabolic activity and secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. Additionally, they recruited neutrophils via the C3/C3aR1 pathway, indirectly sustaining the inflammatory response. Senolytics via Navitoclax successfully alleviated inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis, and administration of metformin could alleviate inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis through inhibiting cellular senescence. These results provide valuable insights into the cellular and molecular basis of periodontitis-induced tissue damage, highlighting the significance of fibroblast senescence. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the relationship between CD81 and cellular senescence, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for periodontitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cellular senescence</kwd><kwd>periodontal diseases</kwd><kwd>human gingival fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>senescence-associated secretory phenotype</kwd><kwd>CD81</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 32370816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Haibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007046</institution-id><institution>Research Project of School an Hospital of Stomatology Wuhan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. ZW202403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Haibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007046</institution-id><institution>Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Wuhan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. S202510486507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting CD81<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts–neutrophils axis provides a new strategy for periodontitis treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of irreversible progressive tissue damage, alveolar bone loss, and destruction of tooth supporting tissues and is caused by microbial infections that eventually lead to tooth loosening and eventual tooth loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolff et al., 1994</xref>). Periodontitis affects 11.2% of the global population and more than 40% of people over the age of 30, posing a major burden on public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanz et al., 2020</xref>). Clinical studies have shown that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis increase with age, and moderate loss of alveolar bone and periodontal attachment is common in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huttner et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Cell senescence is a stress response characterized by irreversible proliferation arrest, resistance to apoptosis, and secretion of a range of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases, known as senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodier et al., 2009</xref>). Cellular senescence is considered necessary for tissue homeostasis as it aims to eliminate unnecessary damage and promote tissue repair through immune-mediated mechanisms and even prevent the occurrence of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohtani and Hara, 2013</xref>). However, the specific environment of the gingival sulcus leads to persistent plaque in periodontal tissue, resulting in oxidative DNA damage as collateral damage of chronic bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aquino-Martinez et al., 2020</xref>). Repeated exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> (Pg), a key pathogen of periodontitis, can accelerate cellular senescence driven by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aquino-Martinez et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that bacteria can also induce senescence of healthy cells in an active oxygen-dependent manner by causing inflammation and excessive neutrophil activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lagnado et al., 2021</xref>). The aggravation or persistence of these stimulating factors can lead to abnormal accumulation of senescent cells and directly affect periodontal tissue function. Therefore, chronic bacterial infections can cause cell senescence through both direct and indirect mechanisms.</p><p>Senescent cells have been found to contribute to bacteria-induced inflammation, with the activation of SASPs playing a crucial role in the release of various pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, and IL-8. Elevated levels of these inflammatory factors have been associated with periodontal damage and loss of alveolar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aquino-Martinez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2024</xref>). However, the specific mechanism by which senescent cells contribute to the development of periodontitis remains unclear. In the immune response to periodontitis, dendritic cells infected by Pg activate related SASPs, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, which ultimately accelerate the progression of periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Awady et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the aging of T lymphocytes, which are crucial for adaptive immunity, leads to a significant alteration in their immunosuppressive ability in Th17/Treg subsets. This alteration ultimately results in the loss of tooth support and alveolar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">González-Osuna et al., 2022</xref>). However, the role and mechanism of cellular senescence in the progression of periodontitis have not been thoroughly investigated.</p><p>The breakthrough technology of single-cell RNA sequencing has made it easier to analyze gene expression at the cellular level and identify key cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we utilized bulk RNA-seq, clinical periodontal samples, and a mice ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) model to demonstrate that cellular senescence levels increase with periodontitis progression. Through scRNA-seq, in vitro, and in vivo experiments, we observed significant cellular senescence in gingival fibroblasts. Additionally, we identified a unique subgroup of gingival fibroblasts with high expression of CD81, which exhibited senescence characteristics such as ROS accumulation and enrichment of senescence genes. We propose that this subgroup of fibroblasts can directly promote the progression of periodontitis by secreting SASP-related factors, such as IL-6, and indirectly amplify inflammation by recruiting neutrophils through the complement pathway, specifically C3. We also found that targeting cellular senescence with senolytic drug or metformin can reduce inflammation and delay alveolar bone resorption in periodontitis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cellular senescence characteristics in periodontitis</title><p>Cellular senescence is a manifestation of aging at the cellular level.

In clinical gingival specimens from periodontally healthy individuals of similar age and those diagnosed with periodontitis, we found that the senescence biomarker senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) was scarcely expressed in the gingiva of young healthy individuals. However, in gingival samples from patients with periodontitis, a notable increase in SA-β-gal-positive cells was observed, primarily localized in the lamina propria of gingival connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining analysis revealed that other senescent biomarkers, such as cell cycle inhibitory proteins p16 and p21, and senescence-associated heterochromatin foci like H3K9me3, were significantly upregulated in human periodontitis gingival tissues as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of cellular senescence along with periodontitis progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image of and semi-quantification of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining in healthy (<italic>n </italic>= 4 field) and periodontitis (<italic>n </italic>= 6 field) patient gingiva, scale bar = 40 or 20 μm.

To avoid confounding factors like age potentially affecting the experimental results, we also examined the levels of cellular senescence in the ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). IHC staining results indicated that the protein expression level of p16 among gingiva was significantly upregulated following ligation, peaking at day 7 post-ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). And then, gingiva at day 7 post-ligation and healthy gingiva as control were collected for protein and gene analysis. Western blotting analysis showed that the protein levels of p16 in the LIP 7D group were about two times larger than those in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Furthermore, bulk RNA sequencing was performed on gingival tissues from LIP 7D and healthy mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), identifying 458 upregulated and 358 downregulated genes.

Meanwhile, upregulation of the cellular senescence pathway and a series of inflammatory-related pathways, including complement activation and response to lipopolysaccharide, were also enriched in the LIP group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We discovered that senescent gingival fibroblasts are associated with periodontitis pathology. Under continuous stimulation of Pg-LPS, oxidative stress caused by ROS accelerates cell senescence in gingival fibroblasts. These senescent cells highly express CD81, which contributes to the expansion of inflammation through pro-inflammatory metabolic activities and factors related to SASP. Additionally, they continuously recruit neutrophils through the C3 pathway, indirectly maintaining the inflammatory response. The use of Navitoclax and Metformin can slow down the progression of periodontitis by reducing gingival cell senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the CD81<sup>+</sup> senescent gingival fibroblast–neutrophil axis in periodontitis progression.</title><p>We propose that the initial periodontal inflammation is triggered by the CD81<sup>+</sup> senescent gingival fibroblast induced by bacterial virulence like <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS).

Our findings will provide valuable insights for future studies on the pathological mechanism of periodontitis development. Gingival fibroblasts, which are essential cells in gingival connective tissue, have recently gained attention as key participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wielento et al., 2023</xref>). Previous studies have reported heterogeneity in gingival fibroblasts in periodontal tissues, with four subsets significantly altered in periodontitis: Fib 1.1 (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL13); Fib 1.2 (APCDD1, IGFBP2, MRPS6); Fib 1.3 (APOD, GSN, CFD); and Fib 1.4 (TIMP3, ASPN, COL11A1). Some of these clusters are directly associated with neutrophils and pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that periodontal tissue immunity relies on strong matrix–neutrophil interactions within these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). Another study revealed the presence of genetic markers in a unique subgroup of gingival fibroblasts called AG fibroblasts (fibroblasts activated to guide chronic inflammation). These fibroblasts may have functional capabilities as oral immune surveillance agents and play a role in coordinating the initiation of gingival inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2023</xref>). Caetano et al. conducted a study where they mapped stromal cells from healthy and periodontitis individuals. They identified a subset of fibroblasts that expressed ARGE pro-inflammatory genes at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caetano et al., 2023</xref>). In a more recent study, the team used multiomics techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization to demonstrate the presence of a spatially restricted population of pathogenic fibroblasts in the gingival lamina propria. These fibroblasts expressed CXCL8 and CXCL10 and were responsible for recruiting neutrophils and lymphocytes in the periodontal pocket area. Additionally, they exhibited angiogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caetano et al., 2023</xref>). The increasing amount of data supports the role of gingival fibroblast heterogeneity in the pathological mechanism of periodontitis, particularly in immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yin et al., 2025</xref>). However, previous studies have mainly focused on immune disorders resulting from communication between fibroblasts and immune cells, neglecting the dynamic changes of fibroblasts themselves in periodontitis pathology. In this study, we present a unique subset of fibroblasts with significantly altered gene signatures due to cell senescence, suggesting that cell senescence plays a crucial role in the heterogeneity of gingival fibroblasts.</p><p>It has been recognized that low concentrations of ROS produced during chronic inflammation can indirectly cause periodontal tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chapple and Matthews, 2007</xref>). Recent studies have also found that repeated exposure to LPS, a component of gram-negative bacterial membranes, leads to DNA damage in various cell types, including gingival and alveolar bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aquino-Martinez et al., 2020</xref>). Cells that survive from persistent DNA damage acquire a senescent phenotype, which in turn triggers the recruitment of immune cells through dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Senescent cells often overexpress IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-8, collectively referred to as SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings indicate that gingival fibroblast senescence directly promotes the development of chronic periodontitis by secreting SASP-related factors, which may explain the formation of pro-inflammatory fibroblasts and their significant impact on immune regulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that drugs can regulate the activity of SASP, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2020</xref>, who showed that short-term treatment with rapamycin can reduce gingival and alveolar bone inflammation and promote the regeneration of alveolar bone in elderly mice. Additionally, Kuang et al. reported that metformin inhibits the destructive effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), leading to a reduction in oxidative stress-induced aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuang et al., 2020</xref>). Through oral administration of metformin, we have demonstrated its potential in alleviating the progression of periodontitis by delaying the senescence of gingival fibroblasts. However, further experiments are required to determine the decisive role of fibroblast senescence in periodontitis.</p><p>CD81, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins, could serve as a cell surface marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karam et al., 2020</xref>) and a signaling pathway receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oguri et al., 2020</xref>). CD81 is a major regulator of virus entry into cells and plays an important role in other pathogenic human viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">New et al., 2021</xref>). Research on the role of CD81 has shown that it could form a complex with αV/β1 and αV/β5 integrins to activate the FAK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oguri et al., 2020</xref>), which induces the interferon signaling pathway for immune response regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanagata and Li, 2011</xref>), and mediates NF-κB signaling pathway to induce IL-6 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). Clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the level of CD81 in saliva and the severity of periodontitis disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tobón-Arroyave et al., 2019</xref>), as well as its association with the regulation of aging and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we observed that gingival fibroblasts with high CD81 expression exhibited a high enrichment of the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to significant upregulation of IL-6 expression. The NF-κB pathway is recognized as a switch for cellular senescence, and NF-κB activation can drive cell senescence-related secretory phenotypes. Therefore, CD81 is likely to play a crucial role in regulating gingival fibroblast cell senescence. However, further investigation is needed to elucidate the specific molecular mechanism.</p><p>Finally, a link has been established between C3 from senescent fibroblasts and neutrophil infiltration in periodontitis. C3 has a strong recruitment ability for neutrophils and is crucial for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yipp et al., 2012</xref>). Persistent neutrophil infiltration and hyperresponsiveness, including the formation of NETs, play significant roles in the development of periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uriarte and Hajishengallis, 2023</xref>). Genetic analysis and preclinical studies have confirmed C3 as a potential pharmacological target for periodontitis treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alayash et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hajishengallis and Chavakis, 2021</xref>). Gingival fibroblasts stimulated with IFN-γ upregulated the expression of chemokines (CXCL9, -10, -11, CCL8), molecules involved in antigen presentation, complement component 3 (C3), and other immune response-related molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ha et al., 2022</xref>). Our experimental results have demonstrated that CD81<sup>+</sup> gingival fibroblasts are an important source of C3. Understanding the source and mechanism of C3 complement in periodontitis is of great significance for comprehending the pathological development of the disease and can provide a new perspective for designing drug schemes.</p><p>Our study focused on identifying a specific group of gingival fibroblasts that express high levels of CD81 during the development of periodontitis. Our findings suggest that these CD81<sup>+</sup> gingival fibroblasts exhibit characteristics of cellular senescence and possess strong pro-inflammatory abilities. Furthermore, we have established a connection between CD81<sup>+</sup> gingival fibroblasts and the recruitment and hyperactivation of neutrophils through C3. However, further investigations are required to explore the association between CD81 and cellular senescence, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target. In conclusion, our research provides valuable insights and treatment strategies for understanding the progression of periodontitis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human samples</title><p>All individuals provided written informed consent, and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of School &amp; Hospital of Stomatology Wuhan University (WDKQ2024B01).

For the semi-quantification of Masson’s trichrome, the collagen volume fractions (stained blue) for individual sections were measured using ImageJ2 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Bulk RNA sequencing</title><p>For bulk RNA sequencing, RNA was extracted using the methods outlined in the qRT-PCR protocol. The total RNA was then sent to the Analysis and Testing Center at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Wuhan, China) for quality control, library preparation, and sequencing on the Illumina platform. We utilized the Illumina TruSeq RNA library preparation kit, which generated libraries with insert fragment lengths of approximately 400–500 bp. The resulting fastq reads were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using a dedicated RNA-seq aligner. We filtered the raw data quality using Trimmomatic (version 0.36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). The filtered reads were subsequently aligned to the reference genome with HISAT2 (version 2.2.1), and the aligned reads were quantified using StringTie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>). The average mapping rate for each sample exceeded 90%, with sequencing depths ranging from 30 to 40 M reads.</p><p>We employed DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) to identify differentially expressed gene sets, applying thresholds of |log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)| &gt;1 and a significance level of p &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The selected differentially expressed genes were then subjected to GO enrichment analysis. Additionally, GSEA was performed using GSEA_Linux_4.1.0 to identify relevant pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Significant gene sets were determined based on three criteria: p &lt; 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.25, and an absolute normalized enrichment score &gt;1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis</title><p>Single-cell RNA transcriptome including GSE164241, GSE152042, and GSE242714 was obtained from the GEO dataset. GSE164241 contained 70,407 cells from 13 healthy samples and 8 periodontitis samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2021</xref>).

As for scRNA-seq, the ‘Seurat4.4.0’ package was applied to integrate different samples with CCA (cross-dataset normalization) method. GSE164241 cell profiles were filtered with criteria of Feature_RNA &gt;200 &amp; nFeature_RNA &lt;5000 &amp; MT_percent &lt;10 &amp; nCount_RNA &lt;25,000 &amp; nCount_RNA &gt;1000, then GSE152042 cell profiles were filtered with criteria of Feature_RNA &gt;500 &amp; nFeature_RNA &lt;6000 &amp; MT_percent &lt;20, and GSE242714 cell profiles were filtered with criteria of Feature_RNA &gt;300 &amp; nFeature_RNA &lt;5000 &amp; MT_percent &lt;15 &amp; nCount_RNA &lt;25,000 &amp; nCount_RNA &gt;500, then those data were further normalized using the ‘LogNormalize’ method, and the unique gene markers in each group were identified with the ‘FindMarkers’ function. ‘UMAP’ was used to display the cell distribution. The function ‘AddModuleScore’ was used to reflect differences in biological processes in different cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Fibroblast cell re-clustering analysis</title><p>Fibroblast clusters from GSE164241 were re-analysed and were then re-normalized by calling the ‘NormalizeData’ function to account for the reduction in cell numbers subsequent to subsetting the data. The top 2000 most variable features across the dataset were then identified using the ‘FindVariableFeatures’. These variable features were subsequently used to inform clustering by passing them into the ‘RunPCA’ command. Via ‘Elbowplot’, we identified that the first eight principal components should be used for downstream clustering when invoking the ‘FindNeighbors’ and ‘RunUMAP’, as detailed above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Gene function enrichment analysis</title><p>GO analysis was performed using ‘Enrichr’ on the top 200 differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 by Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuleshov et al., 2016</xref>). GO terms shown are enriched at FDR &lt;0.05. The enrichment analysis between different fibroblast subsets in scRNA-seq was performed by ‘Metascape’ and further drawn by the ‘ggplot2’ package. Four methods, including ‘ssGSEA’, ‘AUCell’, ‘UCell’, and ‘singscore’ were used for enrichment analysis between different clusters. Images were further drawn by ‘irGSEA’. GSEA was applied to validate the result on RNA-seq with default settings (1000 permutations for gene sets, Signal2Noise metric for ranking genes).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>‘Cellular senescence’ and ‘senescence-associated secretory phenotypes’ gene set</title><p>The cellular senescence gene set, which was used to reflect the degree of cellular senescence, has been validated across species in a variety of cell lines and multiple sequencing data including scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, etc. It has better validation efficiency than previously known gene sets associated with cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saul et al., 2022</xref>). SASP includes several soluble and insoluble factor families. These factors can affect surrounding cells by activating various cell surface receptors and corresponding signal transduction pathways that may lead to a variety of pathologies. SASP factors can be divided globally into the following main categories: soluble signal transduction factors (ILs, chemokines, and growth factors), secreted proteases, and secreted insoluble protein/extracellular matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Metabolism pathway analysis</title><p>The ‘scMetabolism’ package was used to quantify the metabolism activity at the scRNA-seq dataset.

The capture of gene expression information for ST slides was performed by the Visium Spatial platform of 10x Genomics through the use of spatially barcoded mRNA-binding oligonucleotides in the default protocol. Raw UMI counts spot matrices, imaging data, spot-image coordinates, and scale factors were imported into R using the Seurat package (versions 4.2.2). Normalization across spots was performed with the ‘LogVMR’ function. Dimensionality reduction and clustering were performed with independent component analysis (PCA) at resolution 1 with the first 30 PCs. Signature scoring derived from scRNA-seq or ST signatures was performed with the ‘AddModuleScore’ function with default parameters in Seurat. Spatial feature expression plots were generated with the SpatialFeaturePlot function in Seurat (versions 3.2.1). To further increase data resolution at a subspot level, we applied the BayesSpace package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0, USA) was used for statistical analyses.

They support this finding in the murine model through bulk RNA-sequencing and show that differentially expressed genes are significantly enriched in the SenMayo cellular senescence in aging dataset. They then show that Ligature-Induced Periodontitis (LIP) mice treated with the senomorphic drug metformin display overall diminished bone damage, reduced histomorphic alterations, and a reduction in P21 and P16 immunostaining signal. To explore the cell types expressing cellular senescence markers in periodontitis, the authors make use of a combination of bioinformatic analyses on publicly available scRNA-seq data, immunostainings on patient samples and their LIP model; as well as in vitro culture of healthy human gingival fibroblasts treated with LPS. They found that fibroblasts are a cell population expressing P16 in periodontitis which are also enriched for SenMayo genes, suggesting they have a senescent phenotype. They then point to a subgroup of fibroblasts expressing CD81+ with the highest enrichment for a SASP geneset in periodontitis. They also show that treatment of LIP mice and human LPS-treated gingival fibroblasts with metformin leads to a reduction of P21 and P16-positive cells, as well as the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) marker. Finally, they show evidence suggesting that CD81+ senescent fibroblasts are the source of C3 complement protein, which they stipulate signals through the C3AR1 receptor present in neutrophils in periodontitis. The authors observed that both CD81+ fibroblast and C3AR1+ neutrophil populations are expanded in periodontitis, that both populations appear to be in close contact, and that treatment with metformin reduced both C3 and the neutrophil marker MPO in their mouse LIP model.</p><p>After a round of revision, the authors have made significant improvements to their manuscript, such as improving the quality of the data/evidence and also included new data from experiments using a well-known senolytic and the senomorphic metformin, which all together provide a solid support to their main claims.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study implements several different techniques and tools on human samples, mouse models, fibroblast cultures, and publicly available data to support their conclusions. In summary, they provide solid evidence showing that in the context of periodontitis, there is an expansion of cells expressing senescence markers P21, and P16, as well as members of the SASP, and that this includes CD81+ fibroblasts.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The fact that in this study the periodontitis samples belonged to patients with a significantly higher median age (all older than 50 years of age) and the healthy samples belonged to young adults (all younger than 35 years of age), raises the need for caution in interpretation due to a possible effect of aging in the accumulation of CD81+ senescent fibroblasts. However, the recruitment of similar age groups in this case is of course difficult due to the higher prevalence of periodontitis in older adults. In this regard it is important to note that the authors still support their findings using a mouse ligature model. Similar studies comparing healthy and periodontitic patients from similar age groups will be of great importance in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

In the revised manuscript, we performed SA-β-gal staining on fresh frozen samples, revealing a significantly higher number of SA-β-gal positive cells in the gingival tissue of periodontitis, particularly in the lamina propria, while few SA-β-gal positive cells were observed in healthy gingival tissue (Figure. 1A). Additionally, we assessed the protein level changes of H3K9me3, a marker of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), in gingival tissues from healthy individuals and periodontitis patients. The results showed a notable increase in the number of H3K9me3 positive cells in periodontitis tissues, approximately double that found in healthy gingiva (Figure. 1B). This trend aligns with our previous findings of elevated p16 and p21 levels. Collectively, these results further confirm that periodontitis gingival tissues contain a greater number of senescent cells compared to healthy gingiva.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Claims on disturbances in lipid metabolism as a driver of CD81+ fibroblast senescence require appropriate functional/mechanistic validations and experiments of metabolism rewiring.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewers' suggestion for more experimental evidence regarding the role of lipid metabolism in driving CD81+ fibroblast senescence. The influence and mechanisms of lipid metabolism on cellular senescence is a complex and important scientific issue, and it is not the central focus of this manuscript. Therefore, to avoid causing confusion for the reviewers and readers, we have removed the metabolism analysis in the Figure 4-figure supplement 1 and revised the presentation of the relevant results in the revised manuscript to ensure a more rigorous interpretation of our findings (Page 7-8, Line 186-194).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Do LPS-stimulated HGFS implementing the senescent programme secrete C3? Detection of complement C3 at the protein level (e.g. by ELISA) would reinforce the proposed mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting question. In response to the reviewers' suggestion, we measured the levels of C3 protein secreted by human gingival fibroblasts induced by Pg-LPS, which is one of the markers of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The results indicated that, compared to untreated fibroblasts, those induced by Pg-LPS exhibited significantly higher levels of C3 secretion, approximately 1.5 times that of the control group (Figure. 5G). Additionally, we also found that primary gingival fibroblasts derived from periodontitis tissues secreted more complement C3 compared to those derived from healthy tissues (Figure. 5F). These findings suggest that the increased secretion of complement C3 by gingival fibroblasts in periodontitis tissues may be related to Pg-LPS-induced cellular senescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The mechanism of Metformin to impair senescence and/or the SASP is not fully validated and Metformin can produce other pleiotropic effects. A key experiment (including therapeutic implications) is using a senolytic drug (e.g. Navitoclax) to causally connect the eradication of senescent CD81+ fibroblasts with the recruitment of neutrophils. If the hypothesis of the authors is correct this approach should result in reduced levels of gingival CD81 and C3 positivity, prevention of neutrophils infiltration (reduced MPO positivity), and ameliorate bone damage in ligationinduced periodontitis murine models.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully understand the reviewers' concerns regarding the role of metformin in alleviating cellular senescence and the possibility of it acting through non-senescent pathways. To clarify the role of cellular senescence in the recruitment of neutrophils by CD81+ fibroblasts through C3 in periodontitis, we treated a ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model with ABT-263, also known as Navitoclax. The results showed that after ABT-263 treatment, the number of p16-positive or H3K9me3-positive senescent cells in the periodontitis mice significantly decreased. Additionally, we observed reductions in the quantities of CD81+ fibroblasts, C3 protein levels, neutrophil infiltration, and osteoclasts to varying degrees in the LIP model after ABT263 treatment (Figure. 6). These results further support our hypothesis that the eradication of senescent CD81+ fibroblasts could reduce neutrophil infiltration and alveolar bone resorption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Have the authors considered using any of the available C3/C3aR inhibitors to validate the involvement of neutrophils and the inflammatory response in periodontitis? A C3/C3aR inhibitor would be an elegant treatment group in parallel with the senolytic approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the reviewers' suggestion to investigate neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory responses after treating periodontitis with C3/C3aR inhibitors. In a clinical study by Hasturk et al. in 2021 (Reference 1), it was found that using the C3 inhibitor AMY-101 effectively alleviated gingival inflammation levels in periodontitis patients. This was reflected in significant decreases in clinical indicators such as the modified gingival index and bleeding on probing, as well as a marked reduction in inflammatory tissue destruction markers, including MMP-8 and MMP-9. In addition, Tomoki Maekawa et al. (Reference 2) demonstrated that a peptide inhibitor of complement C3 effectively reduced inflammation levels and the extent of bone resorption in periodontitis. Moreover, research by Guglietta et al. (Reference 3) clarified that the C3 complement promotes neutrophil recruitment and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) via C3aR. And neutrophil extracellular traps are considered key pathological factors in causing sustained chronic inflammation in periodontitis (References 4 and 5). In summary, existing studies have clearly indicated that C3/C3aR inhibitors likely reduce neutrophil recruitment and inflammation in periodontitis.</p><p>Reference</p><p>(1) Hasturk, H., Hajishengallis, G., Forsyth Institute Center for Clinical and Translational Research staff, Lambris, J.

Through further analysis of the bulk RNA sequencing results of gingival tissues from LIP mice model, we found significant alterations in multiple senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes and several cellular senescencerelated pathways. SASP genes, such as Icam1, Mmp3, Nos3, Igfbp7, Igfbp4, Mmp14, Timp1, Ngf, Il6, Areg, and Vegfa, were markedly upregulated in the periodontitis samples of ligature-induced mice (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A).

In contrast, the healthy gingival samples were sourced from patients undergoing wisdom tooth extraction, which primarily involves younger individuals. Therefore, due to the limited sample size, we could not enforce strict age matching.

Could the clarity of this be improved either by using more evident images or annotation with arrowheads indicating positive cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer's suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have provided more representative images in Figure. 7C in the revised manuscripts to reflect the effect of metformin treatment on the number of p16-positive cells in periodontitis. In Figure 7-figure supplement 1D of the revised manuscripts, we have marked p21-positive cells with black arrows to help readers better identify the p21-positive cells. Additionally, we have also assessed the H3K9me3 marker, which is more specific, and the results similarly indicate that metformin treatment can alleviate the formation of senescent cells in periodontitis (Figure 7-figure supplement 1E of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 2Gc, d, and e are not mentioned in the results text.

This makes the interpretation of the data quite difficult. Also, for Figures 6 B and C, the meaning of the (H) and (P) annotations should be clear on either the figure or figure legend. I surmise that they represent &quot;Healthy&quot; and &quot;Periodontic&quot; samples respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have enlarged Figure 6B in the previous manuscripts to better display the X-axis as shown in the Figure 5B of the revised manuscripts.

The associated results texts (Lines 220 to 223) discuss the spatial coincidence of CD81 and MPO. Can the authors address this discrepancy in either the results text or the figure panel? Moreover, can Figure 6H and I be annotated to show the location of the gingival lamina propria to improve clarity?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reminder. We have revised the relevant statements in the text: &quot;Interestingly, spatial transcriptomic analysis of gingival tissue revealed that the regions expressing CD81 and SOD2, a neutrophil marker, in periodontitis overlapped in the gingival lamina propria, showing a high spatial correlation&quot; in Page 9, Line 223-226 of the revised manuscripts.
